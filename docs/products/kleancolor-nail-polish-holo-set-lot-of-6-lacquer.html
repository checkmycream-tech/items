            <li>LOVE THIS POLISH!!</li>
            <li>I love them!!</li>
            <li>The color is as authentic and beautiful as the pictures show!</li>
            <li>the colors aren&#x27;t as bright on your nails as pictured but after 2 coats it shows the color just not as bright.  </li>
            <li>Colors are not as bright as pictured.</li>
            <li>Loved these glitter combinations.  </li>
            <li>I loved the colors.</li>
            <li>However the finished product is good.</li>
            <li>about three coats to look good.</li>
            <li>I guess if you have time to do 4 - 5 coats before going somewhere you&#x27;d be good.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>this is a good price for just polishes</li>
            <li>but an hour is un fair.</li>
            <li>Takes about three coats to get good coverage.</li>
            <li>Omg these polish are so beautiful they looks better than the pictures.</li>
            <li>Bright neon colors, good price, I love using them!</li>
            <li>The wear time isn&#x27;t great, but I&#x27;ve been using them for projects and the sparkle is stunning.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with them.</li>
            <li>so i use them as a top sparkle and works great..</li>
            <li>I love these colors, they are great.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product worth the experience</li>
            <li>works great as I top coat</li>
            <li>Nice colors, stays on quite a while, good selection, etc.</li>
            <li>Now I have to spend more money getting the correct colors!</li>
            <li>Love these polishes!</li>
            <li>I love these colors!</li>
            <li>What more could a girl want!</li>
            <li>I love these colors!</li>
            <li>Once you&#x27;ve got those 4 coats on though the sparkle is stunning!</li>
            <li>They do not have a very strong smell, which is good because I don&#x27;t need anything adding to the smell of acrylic when I do my own nails.</li>
            <li>Great colors easy application</li>
            <li>these just sparkle like you can&#x27;t imagine, very easy to apply and wonderful over other colors or on their own, very happy with them</li>
            <li>I think that I&#x27;m done with them unless they come out with something amazing..</li>
            <li>Nice set.</li>
            <li>I will say it does take about 3 coats to get any kind of non-sheer coverage</li>
            <li>NEEDS REALL GOOD TOP COAT</li>
            <li>Not as nice as the pics...</li>
            <li>Gorgeous, have used most off them.</li>
            <li>this polish is so nice.</li>
            <li>Kind of ruiny as nail polish.</li>
            <li>Nice to gift.</li>
            <li>This is a nice glitter set (if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for).</li>
            <li>The right amount of nail polish and the colors are beautiful.</li>
            <li>The smell is very strong but then again all of Kleancolors are like that.</li>
            <li>So pretty and bright!</li>
            <li>I must say that I&#x27;m loving these polishes even more after 2 months of use.</li>
            <li>More translucent then expected but very nice especially as a top coat.</li>
            <li>Has a very fine glitter</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li>The colors are beautiful and very glittery.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more a very fine glitter.</li>
            <li>The Polish is very cheap.</li>
            <li>On the bright side they are full of glitter and sparkle, which I love.</li>
            <li>Good coverage, colors &amp; is super sparkley &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li>top coat.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ok with this</li>
            <li>They are ok for the price</li>
            <li>LOVE Glitter :)</li>
            <li>But I still love them.</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>but instead they sent more of a charcoal color instead.</li>
            <li>Need as many as 4 or 5 coats to get the depth you want.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS STUFF.</li>
            <li>I USE IT OVER COMPLIMENTING COLORS FOR EVEN MORE VARIATIONS.</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>All I can say is I love it.</li>
            <li>or I would have bought more colors</li>
            <li>I did because I wanted more colors.</li>
            <li>the polishes are more of a tinted glitter formula.</li>
            <li>Love the product, but it does&lt;br /&gt;take</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re anything like me you will find a thousand creative ways to use all your colors.</li>
            <li>I even tried roughing up 1 nail in hopes it&#x27;d stick better.</li>
            <li>The shipper shipped incredibly fast and in great packaging.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rare to find this good of a covering with a glitter polish.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these polishes.</li>
            <li>What looks like purple in the picture is more of a gray/chrome holo.</li>
            <li>These are my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love the sparkle  </li>
            <li>It so lovely</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Kleancolor is one of my favorite nail polish brands.</li>
            <li>(the pictures of the colors on here do seem to be &#x27;enhanced&#x27; and brighter), but that was okay with me.  </li>
            <li>Better quality than you&#x27;d think for the price.</li>
            <li>Love this set.</li>
            <li>These are some of my most favorite polishes.</li>
            <li>I USE TOP COAT TWICE</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I bought them.</li>
            <li>I am sure she will love</li>
            <li>Love the set.</li>
            <li>I love these polishes.</li>
            <li>the colors are okay.  </li>
            <li>stays on okay too.</li>
            <li>and when i saw how they were packaged i was really in love with all the colors ..</li>
            <li>Way, way, way more than the metallic set or pastel set.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work well with my top coat</li>
            <li>some of the colors take 4 or more coats to be noticeable</li>
            <li>I love these sparkly colors.</li>
            <li>I purchased a set of the pastel colors as well, and use these on top of the pastels.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE the colors the service was AAA+++</li>
            <li>Love the colors.</li>
            <li>I love ordering from Mightygadget.</li>
            <li>The colors are spectacular and the polish is packed full with holographic glitter.</li>
            <li>But worth it!!</li>
            <li>This brand of polish does take a while to dry so best thing to do, buy a &amp;#34;quick dry&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I bought it mostly for the blues and the pink, which I am very happy with.</li>
            <li>They sparkle and shine so nicely in the right light!</li>
            <li>First off, I was happy with how quick I received the polishes.</li>
            <li>BUT that&#x27;s just fine because I really love the colors.</li>
            <li>Overall, these are very good</li>
            <li>Bright and VERY shiny.</li>
            <li>Ok so I didn&#x27;t get my free gift(lol)</li>
            <li>love the colors and enjoy mixing them up.</li>
            <li>The colors are great after about 4 coats on natural nails.</li>
            <li>They are cheap but still pretty good quality.</li>
            <li>but you can smooth it with a top coat.</li>
            <li>The colors are beautiful but you can only see them if used as a top coat.</li>
            <li>As I say the drying time it&#x27;s more than I have experience even with the really cheap nail polishes.</li>
            <li>so the shipping was fast which i loved.</li>
            <li>These polishes are great in that they are super well priced, super sparkly and very pretty...</li>
            <li>The colors are gorgeous the reason i am giving this 3 stars is because although the shipping was very fast and the colors are pretty, the pictures shows that they are squealers when in reality there more like sparkly top coats.</li>
            <li>Beautiful though also amazing over other colors.</li>
            <li>The downside is that it chips off very quickly.</li>
            <li>Nail polish chips way too easily.</li>
            <li>it chips so easy</li>
            <li>, I liked it so much I bought 2 more.</li>
            <li>They do seem to chip easily though</li>
            <li>This is a beautiful 6 piece set, but they are sheer.</li>
            <li>You have to put more than 3 coats to get a true color</li>
            <li>They are a very pretty color but very light.</li>
            <li>Use a fast drying top coat like seche vite or better yet top it off with a coat if gel and cure with a UV light if you have one.</li>
            <li>The nail polish set came in the mail just fine.</li>
            <li>The colors are very pretty, I LOVE THIS ,would buy it again.</li>
            <li>, (I&#x27;ve gotten away with two coats but three coats is really where it&#x27;s at with these) but the colors really are beautiful, and I&#x27;ve yet to see another brand that has these pastel colored holos so they are unique in that sense.</li>
            <li>great colors but chips by second day</li>
            <li>I really like these colors and the price is amazing.</li>
            <li>You just cannot wear these colors alone since they&#x27;re so light and transparent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m overall happy with mine.</li>
            <li>The texture isn&#x27;t smooth as shown in the photos, it&#x27;s kinda like sand on your nails</li>
            <li>Free shipping sold me on it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fabulous.</li>
            <li>but they didnt included the free earrings, which I&#x27;m not too concerned about</li>
            <li>goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>Great topper for similarly colored polishes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get what the free earrings things about because I didn&#x27;t get anything besides the polish.</li>
            <li>The good thing is that it comes off in almost complete sheets, so I dont have to try to scrub glitter polish off with polish remover.</li>
            <li>I really like the colors and they were everything that I was expecting!!!</li>
            <li>I really hope they are whats pictured!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s SUPER strong.</li>
            <li>My only critique is that it takes a good 4 to 5 layers to get the look i wanted, i top them with a fast dry top coat and it worked great.  </li>
            <li>Love the colors really pretty</li>
            <li>I did not notice the earring set when I originally ordered it, but in my confirmation e-mail it included the earring gift, so I guess it should have been included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it, ladies!</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s a linear holographic polish, this is a super fine glitter.</li>
            <li>i was so excited to get them in the mail</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>Super huge fan of nail polish.  </li>
            <li>Super light too</li>
            <li>Its amazing how vivid the colors are and it does required 2 coats to appreciate the color</li>
            <li>When you try to return it, you can&#x27;t because of the special handling it requires.</li>
            <li>The colors are not as bright as they are in the pics, almost the same but like a muted version of what shows up on screen.</li>
            <li>They arrived sooner than expected and in great condition.</li>
            <li>I really like using the polishes as a glitter top coat.</li>
            <li>The colors represented in the picture are true to what I received.</li>
            <li>True to the picture if you do a ton of coats</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second, they really need a top coat to shine well.</li>
            <li>Polish lasts for several days without chipping though, it&#x27;s a good quality in that sense.</li>
            <li>Good value for what you&#x27;re actually paying.  </li>
            <li>For the \\&quot;purple\\&quot; and aqua color it really only took 2 coats to look good.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely need a top coat or your nails feel like sand paper.</li>
            <li>Not bad.  </li>
            <li>And for the advanced users out there like me there are also a lot like the new OPI tinted top coat</li>
            <li>The colors are great and it goes on well without any other polish underneath.</li>
            <li>Great as a overlay for other colors.</li>
            <li>Pretty but not holographic at all...more like fine glitter.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using these for a quick &amp;#34;paint</li>
            <li>The polishes were shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly, and all in tact.</li>
            <li>do it gives this super sparkle</li>
            <li>Even with high quality top coat.</li>
            <li>The glitter shows up which makes for a very pretty spring/summer nail color.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S SO PRETTY IN THE LIGHT.</li>
            <li>these colors are very pretty but as others have said, they don&#x27;t appear as they do in the picture.  </li>
            <li>I love the colors but the nail polish is very opaque even with a coat of clear on top of it.</li>
            <li>the colors are actually very pretty -- just sit aside a night in if you want to really do them to look like the photos!!</li>
            <li>The colors are very drab and you need 3 or more coats to really get the full effect of the polish.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really cheap and easy way to change your favorite colors of tried and true nail polishes, and this certain type of nail polish by this company is like a tinted clear polish with glitter, so to get it to show up like in the bottle it has to be painted over a similar color, it&#x27;s fairly easy.</li>
            <li>The overall product is nice.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for Holographic nail polish you need to spend more on a professional brand.</li>
            <li>but it is worth it</li>
            <li>They just sparkle so much, it&#x27;s mesmerizing.</li>
            <li>They can chip kind of easily but for less than $2 a bottle, I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>This nail polish just peels right off your nail.</li>
            <li>Shipping was right on target.</li>
            <li>chips easy but just put a clear coat on it!</li>
            <li>, so it peeled off pretty quickly, but it&#x27;s really pretty</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Northern lights\\&quot; top coat some of these colors work/look very similar and this polish only takes 1 coat to get a nice glittery</li>
            <li>but it is still pretty and fun</li>
            <li>and if you paint two many layers your nails will not dry.</li>
            <li>That pink, purple and blue color are incredible.</li>
            <li>Definitely need coordinating undies if you want them to dry, but they&#x27;re beautiful once they are.</li>
            <li>and it was great when it was opened but when it was used it was very watered down and didnt stick very well.</li>
            <li>My little sister loved them.</li>
            <li>Good polishes for the price, a little over $1 a bottle.</li>
            <li>Shipping was ok, got the package the day before the last day.</li>
            <li>The colors are really pretty, but dang</li>
            <li>I love the colors but only 4 starts because the &#x27;purple&#x27; in mine... doesn&#x27;t look purple...</li>
            <li>It is pretty.</li>
            <li>Pretty colors.</li>
            <li>This was my first experience using the Kleancolor brand of polishes</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty color, but the picture shows purple.</li>
            <li>You can create some really pretty effects.  </li>
            <li>Really pretty.</li>
            <li>It is still pretty, but I would have preferred a darker color like pictured.</li>
            <li>and they don&#x27;t last more than a day.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t expect it to last more than a day.</li>
            <li>There pretty colors in the bottle</li>
            <li>The orange is more of a pastel-puke-rust (I will never wear it) and the &amp;#34;purple&amp;#34; I got wasn&#x27;t even close to purple, it was navy blue.</li>
            <li>If anything it could be used as a top coat, but definitely not by itself.</li>
            <li>I love them needs a couple of coats to get the same effect like in the picture</li>
            <li>And the result is that I&#x27;ve gotten many various colors and effects.</li>
            <li>The purple is more like a navy blue..</li>
            <li>Unfortunately is not working well for me.</li>
            <li>I received the colors shown but the orange looks brownish, not the pretty orange in the pic.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s pretty.</li>
            <li>The colors are great(exactly as pictured) and the polish stays on pretty well.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery too!</li>
            <li>but they are more of the transparent sheer.</li>
            <li>no earrings with order, and it&#x27;s more sheer than with color</li>
            <li>The colors are pretty</li>
            <li>but you will need to use a top coat over it for staying power (I use seche vite because it makes my mani dry super fast)</li>
            <li>They are seriously breathtakingly beautiful colors and totally worth the little bit of extra drying time, if you can allot the time.</li>
            <li>I used these as glitter color top coats since it can take quite a few coats to make them look like the picture, but that&#x27;s fine by me.</li>
            <li>I used the pink over a white polish that looked great.</li>
            <li>They change slightly with a topcoat but are still stunning!</li>
            <li>I love the colors but the nail polish so far has been sticky and kind of hard to apply.</li>
            <li>Great for an accent with other solid nail paints.</li>
            <li>Vibrant colors that last longer than most polishes.</li>
            <li>If you paint too many coats it simply won&#x27;t dry.</li>
            <li>This product wasnt&#x27; exactly what I expected and some colors are more translucent than others.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t buy certain brands of polish because of that.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re pretty but far more sheer than the photos would lead you to believe.</li>
            <li>I even try applying the fast dry top coat</li>
            <li>I did not recieve the colors it shows, they state in details that only certain colors are available and the colors aren&#x27;t the ones showing in the pic.</li>
            <li>I still really like these holos</li>
            <li>I will be ordering these for my sister very soon.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these to all!</li>
            <li>They are very shear</li>
            <li>it looks like a navyblue/black instead which is a bummer because I really was looking forward to the purple...</li>
            <li>Better than expected.  </li>
            <li>But I expected more holo that they were.  </li>
            <li>VERY CHILD LIKE COLORS</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>With the exception of pink being a more pigmented color</li>
            <li>Thanks to the seller for packing them</li>
            <li>Came on time, wrapped very well</li>
            <li>and I was able to keep the polish on for over 2 weeks with no chipping and minimal tip wear on my non-dominant hand (my dominant hand always has issues</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very disapointed by the colors.</li>
            <li>For the price, I really can&#x27;t complain ---</li>
            <li>The pink one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast</li>
            <li>I really like this brand of nail polish</li>
            <li>But the one that looks purple really isn&#x27;t purple.</li>
            <li>Gorgeous colors and they last longer than my other brands of nail polish.</li>
            <li>I love them alone or with other polish for nail art.</li>
            <li>They do take a little longer than most polishes to dry, but not horribly so.</li>
            <li>The colors here are fun to wear over other solid shades, because they are more shimmer, not quite glitter, but they don&#x27;t cover very solidly, which is fine.</li>
            <li>The nice thing about these is they are very similar to a few other products that cost much more!  </li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s what striping tape is for-create a new look when you have chipping!).</li>
            <li>I used the light blue with the dark blue matte finish and it creates a kind of &amp;#34;starry night sky&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Had the polish lasted longer, I&#x27;d definitely have gone back and bought a ton of other colors because it&#x27;s a great price.</li>
            <li>Overall, the number coats needed and the powerful smell are not enough to make me dislike this set as the sparkle wins out!</li>
            <li>Quality was decent</li>
            <li>Each colour is so vibrant.</li>
            <li>I bought these to apply on top of other polishes (and I also do special effects and use my polishes in ways the average user will probably never use nail polish, like the first thing I did with these is get out cosmetic wedges and do gradient/ombré nails</li>
            <li>My only complaints are the very strong smell and the time it takes to dry for just 1 coat.</li>
            <li>Highly reccommend.</li>
            <li>It is just kind of hard to get off</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll need some kind of ventilation or at least crack a window.</li>
            <li>I bought these nail polishes to use on top of nearly the same color or white to make the colors pop.</li>
            <li>It is not hard to get off your nails.</li>
            <li>one arround here sells a lot of new products like they always sell kleancolor nail polish</li>
            <li>Within the first or second day of wear.</li>
            <li>I was upset that I had to clean off the other two polishes that were packaged with it.</li>
            <li>I give these 5 stars because shipping was pretty quick (4 days after ordering), I loved the colors, they went on smoothly (no bubbles/not too thick or loose), and I achieved the look on my nails (see attached pic) with 2 coats.</li>
            <li>They are much darker &amp; more dull than what is pictured!</li>
            <li>Cheap, Looks great, Just as advertised in picture when used with proper base color coats underneath.</li>
            <li>However, when I put the polish on my nails it looks almost clear.</li>
            <li>Its almost like there clear polish with glitter...</li>
            <li>I also recommend using at least two coats of clear polish as a top coat.</li>
            <li>Some of the colors are too clear to wear by themselves.</li>
            <li>I received two of the same color and the rest are much, much darker than pictured.</li>
            <li>I love the effects these polishes give when I use them over my nail polish, especially dark colors.  </li>
            <li>Would like to see more sets in different vibrant colors, would also like to see black and white too.</li>
            <li>After applying two coats, the polish chipped after the first time my hands were in hot water (not really surprising but something to be aware of).</li>
            <li>The colors are nice, but the quality is poor.</li>
            <li>, looks just as good as those expensive ones in the market.</li>
            <li>These polishes work well for me as long as I use a good base coat and top coat.</li>
            <li>The actual description and product photos are highly inaccurate.</li>
            <li>I am pretty sure it was because of very poor packaging.</li>
            <li>they sparkel soo much.. and stay on for a long time..</li>
            <li>Also not sure why the description says free earrings</li>
            <li>The first color I used was the holo pink</li>
            <li>The color is not as saturated as pictured either (at least not when applied directly to natural nails with no base coat).</li>
            <li>This brand is notorious for it&#x27;s odd scent, but I think it is completely worth it.</li>
            <li>For me is a major flaw.</li>
            <li>They dry fast, aren&#x27;t terribly hard to take off, and a reasonable price too!!!  </li>
            <li>I have to use a different color  on the bottom to get the color to show up because it&#x27;s a clear glittery nail polish.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only tried one color so far and it took three coats</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re particularly sensitive to the chemical smell you should probably find a different brand.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews before I purchased, so I wasn&#x27;t surprised when I only received 5 of the colors shown....</li>
            <li>Otherwise it chips easily.&lt;br /&gt;You may wonder if its even worth the trouble with all the drying time and coats etc.</li>
            <li>However, within 24hrs - they peel/chip right off with little reason.</li>
            <li>I really like the colors and the polish however to get your nails to look the way they are shown you will need to apply several coats of polish and have a lot of time on your hands for each coat to throughly dry.</li>
            <li>Some people have complained of a strong smell but they smell like all regular polishes to me.</li>
            <li>The only real complaint I had is that some of the colors (mainly the green and the orange) are not as bright in person as they are in the picture.  </li>
            <li>Then do your second coat like a hour later, this will insure that it dries completely.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really tried the yellow, pink or orange yet.</li>
            <li>In my personal opinion this is so far the only set I will think twice before re purchasing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost like they never dry at all.</li>
            <li>What I do really dislike is that it take way to long to dry.</li>
            <li>All the colors are the exact same over black no difference..</li>
            <li>I like this set, but they are not true holographic polishes which is evident if you look closely at the pictures of the colors on actual nails.</li>
            <li>Very pretty polish &amp; to me the smell of the polish is not that bad, strong but tolerable.</li>
            <li>I was very happy with that because I hate when my nails still have that wet polish smell even after they dry.</li>

            <li> LOVE THIS POLISH!!</li>
            <li> I love them!!</li>
            <li> The color is as authentic and beautiful as the pictures show!</li>
            <li> the colors aren&#x27;t as bright on your nails as pictured but after 2 coats it shows the color just not as bright.  </li>
            <li> Colors are not as bright as pictured.</li>
            <li> Loved these glitter combinations.  </li>
            <li> I loved the colors.</li>
            <li> However the finished product is good.</li>
            <li> about three coats to look good.</li>
            <li> I guess if you have time to do 4 - 5 coats before going somewhere you&#x27;d be good.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> this is a good price for just polishes</li>
            <li> but an hour is un fair.</li>
            <li> Takes about three coats to get good coverage.</li>
            <li> Omg these polish are so beautiful they looks better than the pictures.</li>
            <li> Bright neon colors, good price, I love using them!</li>
            <li> The wear time isn&#x27;t great, but I&#x27;ve been using them for projects and the sparkle is stunning.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with them.</li>
            <li> so i use them as a top sparkle and works great..</li>
            <li> I love these colors, they are great.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product worth the experience</li>
            <li> works great as I top coat</li>
            <li> Nice colors, stays on quite a while, good selection, etc.</li>
            <li> Now I have to spend more money getting the correct colors!</li>
            <li> Love these polishes!</li>
            <li> I love these colors!</li>
            <li> What more could a girl want!</li>
            <li> I love these colors!</li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;ve got those 4 coats on though the sparkle is stunning!</li>
            <li> They do not have a very strong smell, which is good because I don&#x27;t need anything adding to the smell of acrylic when I do my own nails.</li>
            <li> Great colors easy application</li>
            <li> these just sparkle like you can&#x27;t imagine, very easy to apply and wonderful over other colors or on their own, very happy with them</li>
            <li> I think that I&#x27;m done with them unless they come out with something amazing..</li>
            <li> Nice set.</li>
            <li> I will say it does take about 3 coats to get any kind of non-sheer coverage</li>
            <li> NEEDS REALL GOOD TOP COAT</li>
            <li> Not as nice as the pics...</li>
            <li> Gorgeous, have used most off them.</li>
            <li> this polish is so nice.</li>
            <li> Kind of ruiny as nail polish.</li>
            <li> Nice to gift.</li>
            <li> This is a nice glitter set (if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for).</li>
            <li> The right amount of nail polish and the colors are beautiful.</li>
            <li> The smell is very strong but then again all of Kleancolors are like that.</li>
            <li> So pretty and bright!</li>
            <li> I must say that I&#x27;m loving these polishes even more after 2 months of use.</li>
            <li> More translucent then expected but very nice especially as a top coat.</li>
            <li> Has a very fine glitter</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful and very glittery.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more a very fine glitter.</li>
            <li> The Polish is very cheap.</li>
            <li> On the bright side they are full of glitter and sparkle, which I love.</li>
            <li> Good coverage, colors &amp; is super sparkley &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li> top coat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ok with this</li>
            <li> They are ok for the price</li>
            <li> LOVE Glitter :)</li>
            <li> But I still love them.</li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> but instead they sent more of a charcoal color instead.</li>
            <li> Need as many as 4 or 5 coats to get the depth you want.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF.</li>
            <li> I USE IT OVER COMPLIMENTING COLORS FOR EVEN MORE VARIATIONS.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> All I can say is I love it.</li>
            <li> or I would have bought more colors</li>
            <li> I did because I wanted more colors.</li>
            <li> the polishes are more of a tinted glitter formula.</li>
            <li> Love the product, but it does&lt;br /&gt;take</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re anything like me you will find a thousand creative ways to use all your colors.</li>
            <li> I even tried roughing up 1 nail in hopes it&#x27;d stick better.</li>
            <li> The shipper shipped incredibly fast and in great packaging.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rare to find this good of a covering with a glitter polish.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these polishes.</li>
            <li> What looks like purple in the picture is more of a gray/chrome holo.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite.</li>
            <li> I love the sparkle  </li>
            <li> It so lovely</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Kleancolor is one of my favorite nail polish brands.</li>
            <li> (the pictures of the colors on here do seem to be &#x27;enhanced&#x27; and brighter), but that was okay with me.  </li>
            <li> Better quality than you&#x27;d think for the price.</li>
            <li> Love this set.</li>
            <li> These are some of my most favorite polishes.</li>
            <li> I USE TOP COAT TWICE</li>
            <li> and I am so glad I bought them.</li>
            <li> I am sure she will love</li>
            <li> Love the set.</li>
            <li> I love these polishes.</li>
            <li> the colors are okay.  </li>
            <li> stays on okay too.</li>
            <li> and when i saw how they were packaged i was really in love with all the colors ..</li>
            <li> Way, way, way more than the metallic set or pastel set.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work well with my top coat</li>
            <li> some of the colors take 4 or more coats to be noticeable</li>
            <li> I love these sparkly colors.</li>
            <li> I purchased a set of the pastel colors as well, and use these on top of the pastels.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE the colors the service was AAA+++</li>
            <li> Love the colors.</li>
            <li> I love ordering from Mightygadget.</li>
            <li> The colors are spectacular and the polish is packed full with holographic glitter.</li>
            <li> But worth it!!</li>
            <li> This brand of polish does take a while to dry so best thing to do, buy a &amp;#34;quick dry&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I bought it mostly for the blues and the pink, which I am very happy with.</li>
            <li> They sparkle and shine so nicely in the right light!</li>
            <li> First off, I was happy with how quick I received the polishes.</li>
            <li> BUT that&#x27;s just fine because I really love the colors.</li>
            <li> Overall, these are very good</li>
            <li> Bright and VERY shiny.</li>
            <li> Ok so I didn&#x27;t get my free gift(lol)</li>
            <li> love the colors and enjoy mixing them up.</li>
            <li> The colors are great after about 4 coats on natural nails.</li>
            <li> They are cheap but still pretty good quality.</li>
            <li> but you can smooth it with a top coat.</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful but you can only see them if used as a top coat.</li>
            <li> As I say the drying time it&#x27;s more than I have experience even with the really cheap nail polishes.</li>
            <li> so the shipping was fast which i loved.</li>
            <li> These polishes are great in that they are super well priced, super sparkly and very pretty...</li>
            <li> The colors are gorgeous the reason i am giving this 3 stars is because although the shipping was very fast and the colors are pretty, the pictures shows that they are squealers when in reality there more like sparkly top coats.</li>
            <li> Beautiful though also amazing over other colors.</li>
            <li> The downside is that it chips off very quickly.</li>
            <li> Nail polish chips way too easily.</li>
            <li> it chips so easy</li>
            <li> , I liked it so much I bought 2 more.</li>
            <li> They do seem to chip easily though</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful 6 piece set, but they are sheer.</li>
            <li> You have to put more than 3 coats to get a true color</li>
            <li> They are a very pretty color but very light.</li>
            <li> Use a fast drying top coat like seche vite or better yet top it off with a coat if gel and cure with a UV light if you have one.</li>
            <li> The nail polish set came in the mail just fine.</li>
            <li> The colors are very pretty, I LOVE THIS ,would buy it again.</li>
            <li> , (I&#x27;ve gotten away with two coats but three coats is really where it&#x27;s at with these) but the colors really are beautiful, and I&#x27;ve yet to see another brand that has these pastel colored holos so they are unique in that sense.</li>
            <li> great colors but chips by second day</li>
            <li> I really like these colors and the price is amazing.</li>
            <li> You just cannot wear these colors alone since they&#x27;re so light and transparent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m overall happy with mine.</li>
            <li> The texture isn&#x27;t smooth as shown in the photos, it&#x27;s kinda like sand on your nails</li>
            <li> Free shipping sold me on it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fabulous.</li>
            <li> but they didnt included the free earrings, which I&#x27;m not too concerned about</li>
            <li> goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> Great topper for similarly colored polishes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get what the free earrings things about because I didn&#x27;t get anything besides the polish.</li>
            <li> The good thing is that it comes off in almost complete sheets, so I dont have to try to scrub glitter polish off with polish remover.</li>
            <li> I really like the colors and they were everything that I was expecting!!!</li>
            <li> I really hope they are whats pictured!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s SUPER strong.</li>
            <li> My only critique is that it takes a good 4 to 5 layers to get the look i wanted, i top them with a fast dry top coat and it worked great.  </li>
            <li> Love the colors really pretty</li>
            <li> I did not notice the earring set when I originally ordered it, but in my confirmation e-mail it included the earring gift, so I guess it should have been included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it, ladies!</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a linear holographic polish, this is a super fine glitter.</li>
            <li> i was so excited to get them in the mail</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> Super huge fan of nail polish.  </li>
            <li> Super light too</li>
            <li> Its amazing how vivid the colors are and it does required 2 coats to appreciate the color</li>
            <li> When you try to return it, you can&#x27;t because of the special handling it requires.</li>
            <li> The colors are not as bright as they are in the pics, almost the same but like a muted version of what shows up on screen.</li>
            <li> They arrived sooner than expected and in great condition.</li>
            <li> I really like using the polishes as a glitter top coat.</li>
            <li> The colors represented in the picture are true to what I received.</li>
            <li> True to the picture if you do a ton of coats</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, they really need a top coat to shine well.</li>
            <li> Polish lasts for several days without chipping though, it&#x27;s a good quality in that sense.</li>
            <li> Good value for what you&#x27;re actually paying.  </li>
            <li> For the \\&quot;purple\\&quot; and aqua color it really only took 2 coats to look good.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely need a top coat or your nails feel like sand paper.</li>
            <li> Not bad.  </li>
            <li> And for the advanced users out there like me there are also a lot like the new OPI tinted top coat</li>
            <li> The colors are great and it goes on well without any other polish underneath.</li>
            <li> Great as a overlay for other colors.</li>
            <li> Pretty but not holographic at all...more like fine glitter.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using these for a quick &amp;#34;paint</li>
            <li> The polishes were shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, and all in tact.</li>
            <li> do it gives this super sparkle</li>
            <li> Even with high quality top coat.</li>
            <li> The glitter shows up which makes for a very pretty spring/summer nail color.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S SO PRETTY IN THE LIGHT.</li>
            <li> these colors are very pretty but as others have said, they don&#x27;t appear as they do in the picture.  </li>
            <li> I love the colors but the nail polish is very opaque even with a coat of clear on top of it.</li>
            <li> the colors are actually very pretty -- just sit aside a night in if you want to really do them to look like the photos!!</li>
            <li> The colors are very drab and you need 3 or more coats to really get the full effect of the polish.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really cheap and easy way to change your favorite colors of tried and true nail polishes, and this certain type of nail polish by this company is like a tinted clear polish with glitter, so to get it to show up like in the bottle it has to be painted over a similar color, it&#x27;s fairly easy.</li>
            <li> The overall product is nice.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for Holographic nail polish you need to spend more on a professional brand.</li>
            <li> but it is worth it</li>
            <li> They just sparkle so much, it&#x27;s mesmerizing.</li>
            <li> They can chip kind of easily but for less than $2 a bottle, I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> This nail polish just peels right off your nail.</li>
            <li> Shipping was right on target.</li>
            <li> chips easy but just put a clear coat on it!</li>
            <li> , so it peeled off pretty quickly, but it&#x27;s really pretty</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Northern lights\\&quot; top coat some of these colors work/look very similar and this polish only takes 1 coat to get a nice glittery</li>
            <li> but it is still pretty and fun</li>
            <li> and if you paint two many layers your nails will not dry.</li>
            <li> That pink, purple and blue color are incredible.</li>
            <li> Definitely need coordinating undies if you want them to dry, but they&#x27;re beautiful once they are.</li>
            <li> and it was great when it was opened but when it was used it was very watered down and didnt stick very well.</li>
            <li> My little sister loved them.</li>
            <li> Good polishes for the price, a little over $1 a bottle.</li>
            <li> Shipping was ok, got the package the day before the last day.</li>
            <li> The colors are really pretty, but dang</li>
            <li> I love the colors but only 4 starts because the &#x27;purple&#x27; in mine... doesn&#x27;t look purple...</li>
            <li> It is pretty.</li>
            <li> Pretty colors.</li>
            <li> This was my first experience using the Kleancolor brand of polishes</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty color, but the picture shows purple.</li>
            <li> You can create some really pretty effects.  </li>
            <li> Really pretty.</li>
            <li> It is still pretty, but I would have preferred a darker color like pictured.</li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t last more than a day.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t expect it to last more than a day.</li>
            <li> There pretty colors in the bottle</li>
            <li> The orange is more of a pastel-puke-rust (I will never wear it) and the &amp;#34;purple&amp;#34; I got wasn&#x27;t even close to purple, it was navy blue.</li>
            <li> If anything it could be used as a top coat, but definitely not by itself.</li>
            <li> I love them needs a couple of coats to get the same effect like in the picture</li>
            <li> And the result is that I&#x27;ve gotten many various colors and effects.</li>
            <li> The purple is more like a navy blue..</li>
            <li> Unfortunately is not working well for me.</li>
            <li> I received the colors shown but the orange looks brownish, not the pretty orange in the pic.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s pretty.</li>
            <li> The colors are great(exactly as pictured) and the polish stays on pretty well.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery too!</li>
            <li> but they are more of the transparent sheer.</li>
            <li> no earrings with order, and it&#x27;s more sheer than with color</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty</li>
            <li> but you will need to use a top coat over it for staying power (I use seche vite because it makes my mani dry super fast)</li>
            <li> They are seriously breathtakingly beautiful colors and totally worth the little bit of extra drying time, if you can allot the time.</li>
            <li> I used these as glitter color top coats since it can take quite a few coats to make them look like the picture, but that&#x27;s fine by me.</li>
            <li> I used the pink over a white polish that looked great.</li>
            <li> They change slightly with a topcoat but are still stunning!</li>
            <li> I love the colors but the nail polish so far has been sticky and kind of hard to apply.</li>
            <li> Great for an accent with other solid nail paints.</li>
            <li> Vibrant colors that last longer than most polishes.</li>
            <li> If you paint too many coats it simply won&#x27;t dry.</li>
            <li> This product wasnt&#x27; exactly what I expected and some colors are more translucent than others.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy certain brands of polish because of that.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pretty but far more sheer than the photos would lead you to believe.</li>
            <li> I even try applying the fast dry top coat</li>
            <li> I did not recieve the colors it shows, they state in details that only certain colors are available and the colors aren&#x27;t the ones showing in the pic.</li>
            <li> I still really like these holos</li>
            <li> I will be ordering these for my sister very soon.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend these to all!</li>
            <li> They are very shear</li>
            <li> it looks like a navyblue/black instead which is a bummer because I really was looking forward to the purple...</li>
            <li> Better than expected.  </li>
            <li> But I expected more holo that they were.  </li>
            <li> VERY CHILD LIKE COLORS</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> With the exception of pink being a more pigmented color</li>
            <li> Thanks to the seller for packing them</li>
            <li> Came on time, wrapped very well</li>
            <li> and I was able to keep the polish on for over 2 weeks with no chipping and minimal tip wear on my non-dominant hand (my dominant hand always has issues</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disapointed by the colors.</li>
            <li> For the price, I really can&#x27;t complain ---</li>
            <li> The pink one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast</li>
            <li> I really like this brand of nail polish</li>
            <li> But the one that looks purple really isn&#x27;t purple.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous colors and they last longer than my other brands of nail polish.</li>
            <li> I love them alone or with other polish for nail art.</li>
            <li> They do take a little longer than most polishes to dry, but not horribly so.</li>
            <li> The colors here are fun to wear over other solid shades, because they are more shimmer, not quite glitter, but they don&#x27;t cover very solidly, which is fine.</li>
            <li> The nice thing about these is they are very similar to a few other products that cost much more!  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s what striping tape is for-create a new look when you have chipping!).</li>
            <li> I used the light blue with the dark blue matte finish and it creates a kind of &amp;#34;starry night sky&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Had the polish lasted longer, I&#x27;d definitely have gone back and bought a ton of other colors because it&#x27;s a great price.</li>
            <li> Overall, the number coats needed and the powerful smell are not enough to make me dislike this set as the sparkle wins out!</li>
            <li> Quality was decent</li>
            <li> Each colour is so vibrant.</li>
            <li> I bought these to apply on top of other polishes (and I also do special effects and use my polishes in ways the average user will probably never use nail polish, like the first thing I did with these is get out cosmetic wedges and do gradient/ombré nails</li>
            <li> My only complaints are the very strong smell and the time it takes to dry for just 1 coat.</li>
            <li> Highly reccommend.</li>
            <li> It is just kind of hard to get off</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll need some kind of ventilation or at least crack a window.</li>
            <li> I bought these nail polishes to use on top of nearly the same color or white to make the colors pop.</li>
            <li> It is not hard to get off your nails.</li>
            <li> one arround here sells a lot of new products like they always sell kleancolor nail polish</li>
            <li> Within the first or second day of wear.</li>
            <li> I was upset that I had to clean off the other two polishes that were packaged with it.</li>
            <li> I give these 5 stars because shipping was pretty quick (4 days after ordering), I loved the colors, they went on smoothly (no bubbles/not too thick or loose), and I achieved the look on my nails (see attached pic) with 2 coats.</li>
            <li> They are much darker &amp; more dull than what is pictured!</li>
            <li> Cheap, Looks great, Just as advertised in picture when used with proper base color coats underneath.</li>
            <li> However, when I put the polish on my nails it looks almost clear.</li>
            <li> Its almost like there clear polish with glitter...</li>
            <li> I also recommend using at least two coats of clear polish as a top coat.</li>
            <li> Some of the colors are too clear to wear by themselves.</li>
            <li> I received two of the same color and the rest are much, much darker than pictured.</li>
            <li> I love the effects these polishes give when I use them over my nail polish, especially dark colors.  </li>
            <li> Would like to see more sets in different vibrant colors, would also like to see black and white too.</li>
            <li> After applying two coats, the polish chipped after the first time my hands were in hot water (not really surprising but something to be aware of).</li>
            <li> The colors are nice, but the quality is poor.</li>
            <li> , looks just as good as those expensive ones in the market.</li>
            <li> These polishes work well for me as long as I use a good base coat and top coat.</li>
            <li> The actual description and product photos are highly inaccurate.</li>
            <li> I am pretty sure it was because of very poor packaging.</li>
            <li> they sparkel soo much.. and stay on for a long time..</li>
            <li> Also not sure why the description says free earrings</li>
            <li> The first color I used was the holo pink</li>
            <li> The color is not as saturated as pictured either (at least not when applied directly to natural nails with no base coat).</li>
            <li> This brand is notorious for it&#x27;s odd scent, but I think it is completely worth it.</li>
            <li> For me is a major flaw.</li>
            <li> They dry fast, aren&#x27;t terribly hard to take off, and a reasonable price too!!!  </li>
            <li> I have to use a different color  on the bottom to get the color to show up because it&#x27;s a clear glittery nail polish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried one color so far and it took three coats</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re particularly sensitive to the chemical smell you should probably find a different brand.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before I purchased, so I wasn&#x27;t surprised when I only received 5 of the colors shown....</li>
            <li> Otherwise it chips easily.&lt;br /&gt;You may wonder if its even worth the trouble with all the drying time and coats etc.</li>
            <li> However, within 24hrs - they peel/chip right off with little reason.</li>
            <li> I really like the colors and the polish however to get your nails to look the way they are shown you will need to apply several coats of polish and have a lot of time on your hands for each coat to throughly dry.</li>
            <li> Some people have complained of a strong smell but they smell like all regular polishes to me.</li>
            <li> The only real complaint I had is that some of the colors (mainly the green and the orange) are not as bright in person as they are in the picture.  </li>
            <li> Then do your second coat like a hour later, this will insure that it dries completely.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really tried the yellow, pink or orange yet.</li>
            <li> In my personal opinion this is so far the only set I will think twice before re purchasing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost like they never dry at all.</li>
            <li> What I do really dislike is that it take way to long to dry.</li>
            <li> All the colors are the exact same over black no difference..</li>
            <li> I like this set, but they are not true holographic polishes which is evident if you look closely at the pictures of the colors on actual nails.</li>
            <li> Very pretty polish &amp; to me the smell of the polish is not that bad, strong but tolerable.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with that because I hate when my nails still have that wet polish smell even after they dry.</li>
            <li> The other problem is that they take a very long time to dry a few minutes is fine</li>
            <li> Was super excited to get these in the mail and then was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Pretty colors, a bit hard to take off.</li>
            <li> The only reason my review is 4 stars is because of how long it takes to achieve the desired look.</li>
            <li> Not quite as long lasting as the metallic colors.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re subtle and so pretty.</li>
            <li> Once again I really love these colors, they sparkle like crazy.</li>
            <li> Only problem I have/had is that I did not get the pink color or the earring gift that was included with my purchase.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, you need to wait a long time between coats.</li>
            <li> Even with two coats these colors were sheer with minimal holo.  </li>
            <li> The prettiest ones are pink and yellow.</li>
            <li> This takes a lot of coats to show up and each coat takes a long time to dry.  </li>
            <li> and I found that it did take a long time for them to dry.  </li>
            <li> I guess the quality of the nail polish is not very high.</li>
            <li> They are not as sheer as some of the other reviews would have you believe.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering their other sets.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have very long staying power</li>
            <li> I took off one star for the smell and the dry time.</li>
            <li> but, they take forever to dry.  </li>
            <li> Even after it appears dry if you touch it or bump it, it will show.</li>
            <li> It takes forever to dry as well.</li>
            <li> But does get somewhat chunky if you don&#x27;t leave enought time to dry between applications.</li>
            <li> The blue and green are super thin.</li>
            <li> I had to use a base coat of a colored polish I had that was similar in color and then put it on top of that to get it to look similar to the nails in the pictures...</li>
            <li> It only had a slight tint of the color.</li>
            <li> I thought they were solid with slight glitter.</li>
            <li> Like others have noted, the smell of the polish is really strong however it wasn&#x27;t bad enough for me not to use it</li>
            <li> but.... product is not a strong polish, doesn&#x27;t last long before showing wear.  </li>
            <li> The closest I got to the way the polish looks in the picture was after 3 coats and it still was a little sheer, a 4th coat would have done the trick</li>
            <li> The black handle was separated from the brush on one of the bottles but no major complaints.</li>
            <li> In the picture I used the halo chrome and pink.</li>
            <li> Hope to get the pink color &amp; earrings soon.</li>
            <li> but then I am rough on my hands.</li>
            <li> I only had my nails painted for a few hours before the polish started to chip.</li>
            <li> I actually bought the holo green from a thrift store about a year ago-</li>
            <li> , green was the only holo they had</li>
            <li> The smell is minimal too</li>
            <li> Chipped the very next day with using a sticky base coat and then a top coat.</li>
            <li> but you have  to put it over a similar color polish as a base or many coats to see the color.</li>
            <li> It goes on better over a solid color base</li>
            <li> It gives a color base coat a nice sparkle.</li>
            <li> The smells of the polish was just like any other polish just a little tiny bit stronger</li>
            <li> To have the same results as the picture, you need to have like 8 coats, and they already take longer to dry than usual.</li>
            <li> I tried 3 coats and even after that it was just thick and dust want to dry well and still not the same tone as photos.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m looking forward to trying their other polishes.</li>
            <li> Colors are  not exactly as shown in image.</li>
            <li> and I plan to purchase other colors from this brand</li>
            <li> I am going to try the other colors and see how they turn out.</li>
            <li> We ordered 2 other sets the spring line and metallic</li>
            <li> They are sheer polish with small holo sparkles.</li>
            <li> Sometimes when I&#x27;ve messed up my other design, I could always count on a coat of Kleancolor Chrome to cover up, or to &amp;#34;bling&amp;#34; up my do.</li>
            <li> for the polish, they do need lot of coats like the other reviewers</li>
            <li> It took three coats to get the color I achieved, and I did not use them over any other color.  </li>
            <li> I think they all work well over other polishes.</li>
            <li> I am very curious what they did to have the purple result pictured.</li>
            <li> After using 5 coats the color was still not like the actual color in the bottle expect for the Blue.. Not happy with this purchase at all.</li>
            <li> and I hope the other two are at least similar to the picture.  </li>
            <li> I put another coat on and it got a little bit darker but not much.</li>
            <li> I tried each color alone, with a base coat, with a top coat and with all 3</li>
            <li> I paint my nails with a base color and then apply the holo nail polish on top.</li>
            <li> After two days half of it had chipped off.</li>
            <li> They are not full linear holo polish.</li>
            <li> It is not true Holographic nail polish, but a glitter polish that would take a gazillion coats to get to appear anything like holographic nail polish..edited below..</li>
            <li> These smell horrible, like they were made to appeal to 8 year old girls; it&#x27;s a sickly sweet cotton candy type smell that I can&#x27;t stand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You will need several coats if you use the color by itself so I recommend using a colored base coat, that being said these are so pretty</li>
            <li> I did not want a refund, I wanted the gift I promised my little sister.</li>
            <li> but once the polush dried the smell was gone.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind waiting a few minutes</li>
            <li> I use these with a white base and they really shine in the sunlight.</li>
            <li> The technique of using various base colors can also save me from using too much Kleancolor each time.</li>
            <li> Used alone they come out really pale.  </li>
            <li> Everything is very dull as if they added grey to it.</li>
            <li> For example, I may use lighter or darker green as base coat, and the Kleancolor green or yellow, and I would have created completely different effect each time, a lime chrome or a forest green chrome...</li>
            <li> These nail polishes came to my house in a small flimsy envalope and one of them was compleatly shattered on the side.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not overwhelmingly sparkly</li>
            <li> of the polishes were broken, other then that, I like them.</li>
            <li> I wanted the deep tones u see in the photos I will have to get s base coat in similar color to achieve this look.</li>
            <li> I tried to use them in all different ways, by themselves, with different base colors, etc.</li>
            <li> However, it is extremely hard to remove.</li>
            <li> Colours loo dull on nails when applied</li>
            <li> Otherwise the finish is somewhat dull.</li>
            <li> Colors are dull, and really thick.</li>
            <li> You need at least 4.</li>
            <li> To get the color you do have to put at least three coats on.</li>
            <li> poorly packed , have nail polish wasted all through parcel</li>
            <li> The green bottle was broken and spilled all over the inside package.</li>
            <li> But hey I mean it arrived in the shipping window</li>
            <li> but this is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I also received the purple very thick and hard to put on which i did not like.</li>
            <li> Not good they peel of</li>
            <li> but I was tired of waiting.</li>
            <li> But as soon as I opened it, I seen one was broken.  </li>
            <li> Poor quality.  </li>
            <li> and this is the fisrt time Ive ever gotten a broken bottle</li>
            <li> said or what I did was put white base coat and topped which these polish, about two coats.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not too dramatic.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed I wish I would have read the reviews...</li>
            <li> Takes a couple coats to make it not look faint.</li>
            <li> e-mailed the Kleancolor company over 10 days ago and have not received a response, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> so I had no leakage or broken bottles and for Amazons service!</li>
            <li> I find this ridiculously inconvenient.</li>
            <li> Bad customer service, I got nothing for my troubles.</li>
            <li> Frustrated is an understatement</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m SO disappointed and nervous because this is one of three items that I was waiting for</li>
            <li> :((</li>
            <li> Was so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t read all the reviews... :(  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very unhappy with this product and won&#x27;t order it again any time soon.</li>
            <li> so you do need a base coat.</li>
            <li> I plan to use my neons for a base color and match the Holographic polishes with them to make them pop out.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t recommend a base coat either because that just seemed to add to the drying</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try to get color base polish to see if it will turn out like the photos.</li>
            <li> The colors are absolutely horrible, nothing like the picture.</li>
            <li> Horrible nail polish.</li>
            <li> The glitter is INSANE</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I received all of the holos shown but the purple, I received 2 different blues. I still really like these holos,they are perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I posted a picture with the holo blue that I used.</li>
            <li> I give these 5 stars because shipping was pretty quick (4 days after ordering), I loved the colors, they went on smoothly (no bubbles/not too thick or loose), and I achieved the look on my nails (see attached pic) with 2 coats. They are, as others have stated, very sheer so you do need a base coat. I used white tips and that did the trick. In the picture I used the halo chrome and pink. The glitter shows up which makes for a very pretty spring/summer nail color. I would recommend these to anyone. I will be ordering these for my sister very soon. Kleancolor never lets me down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. This brand of polish does take a while to dry so best thing to do, buy a &amp;#34;quick dry&amp;#34; top coat. Works like a charm 👌.</li>
            <li> I like this set, but they are not true holographic polishes which is evident if you look closely at the pictures of the colors on actual nails. It&#x27;s more a very fine glitter. I&#x27;m ok with this so the price was great</li>
            <li> Ok so I didn&#x27;t get my free gift(lol) BUT that&#x27;s just fine because I really love the colors. I&#x27;ve only tried one color so far and it took three coats but it&#x27;s beautiful... Shipping was ok, got the package the day before the last day. But hey I mean it arrived in the shipping window so I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> Beautiful set! The color is as authentic and beautiful as the pictures show! I would highly recommend these to all!</li>
            <li> The colors are great and it goes on well without any other polish underneath. The downside is that it chips off very quickly.</li>
            <li> Nail polish chips way too easily. Within the first or second day of wear.</li>
            <li> This is only my second review on Amazon. I&#x27;m SO disappointed and nervous because this is one of three items that I was waiting for and I hope the other two are at least similar to the picture.  The colors are absolutely horrible, nothing like the picture. I received two of the same color and the rest are much, much darker than pictured. Now I have to spend more money getting the correct colors! Frustrated is an understatement</li>
            <li> Hoping for different results, holographic, didn&#x27;t satisfy my hoped-for-look!</li>
            <li> The colors are really pretty, but dang it chips so easy</li>
            <li> They are very shear and if you paint two many layers your nails will not dry. They are ok for the price</li>
            <li> I love the colors but only 4 starts because the &#x27;purple&#x27; in mine... doesn&#x27;t look purple... it looks like a navyblue/black instead which is a bummer because I really was looking forward to the purple... oh well i guesss maybe with two coats?</li>
            <li> Omg these polish are so beautiful they looks better than the pictures. I would so buy these again when I when I need them.</li>
            <li> Loved these glitter combinations.  Better than expected.  The black handle was separated from the brush on one of the bottles but no major complaints.</li>
            <li> Horrible nail polish. I wish I could return them. Chipped the very next day with using a sticky base coat and then a top coat. This nail polish just peels right off your nail. I will never buy this brand again! Garbage...</li>
            <li> Pretty colors, a bit hard to take off. But worth it!! LOVE Glitter :)</li>
            <li> Takes a couple coats to make it not look faint.</li>
            <li> Love the colors really pretty</li>
            <li> I have this set. It is pretty. It is not hard to get off your nails.</li>
            <li> Pretty colors. Great as a overlay for other colors.</li>
            <li> I recieved this nail polish set as a Christmas present and I&#x27;m pretty happy with it. I really like the colors and the polish however to get your nails to look the way they are shown you will need to apply several coats of polish and have a lot of time on your hands for each coat to throughly dry. The closest I got to the way the polish looks in the picture was after 3 coats and it still was a little sheer, a 4th coat would have done the trick but I was tired of waiting. I really like using the polishes as a glitter top coat. It gives a color base coat a nice sparkle. The smells of the polish was just like any other polish just a little tiny bit stronger but once the polush dried the smell was gone. I was very happy with that because I hate when my nails still have that wet polish smell even after they dry. I won&#x27;t buy certain brands of polish because of that. The only reason my review is 4 stars is because of how long it takes to achieve the desired look. This was my first experience using the Kleancolor brand of polishes and I&#x27;m looking forward to trying their other polishes.</li>
            <li> These are great polishes. They are Holographic. But I expected more holo that they were.  But I still love them.</li>
            <li> I really like the colors and they were everything that I was expecting!!!</li>
            <li> My little sister loved them. Quality was decent</li>
            <li> THE COLORS ARE NOT WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE IN PICTURES.. VERY CHILD LIKE COLORS</li>
            <li> Beautiful!!!! I love these. However, it is extremely hard to remove. Also, does not watermarble well.</li>
            <li> The picture with the results of the nails is inaccurate</li>
            <li> Colors are  not exactly as shown in image.</li>
            <li> These are beautiful;. Definitely need coordinating undies if you want them to dry, but they&#x27;re beautiful once they are. The wear time isn&#x27;t great, but I&#x27;ve been using them for projects and the sparkle is stunning. I took off one star for the smell and the dry time.</li>
            <li> Nice set. More translucent then expected but very nice especially as a top coat. Great colors.</li>
            <li> great colors but chips by second day</li>
            <li> Beautiful though also amazing over other colors.</li>
            <li> The nail polish set came in the mail just fine. The overall product is nice. Nice colors, stays on quite a while, good selection, etc. I got the set as a Christmas gift for my sister and she was happy with them. Only problem I have/had is that I did not get the pink color or the earring gift that was included with my purchase. I did not notice the earring set when I originally ordered it, but in my confirmation e-mail it included the earring gift, so I guess it should have been included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I e-mailed the Kleancolor company over 10 days ago and have not received a response, unfortunately. That I don&#x27;t like. Hope to get the pink color &amp; earrings soon. The polish itself is real nice though.</li>
            <li> After using 5 coats the color was still not like the actual color in the bottle expect for the Blue.. Not happy with this purchase at all. I have ordered 3 different sets the Mattes which the brushes on those are horrible, the Metallic&#x27;s which I love love. Then these. It&#x27;s like a hit or miss with Kleancolor. I think that I&#x27;m done with them unless they come out with something amazing.. Gl with the Holo&#x27;s hope they work for you.</li>
            <li> Great colors! Good consistency and texture! Reasonably priced. Bought all of their sets and have plenty of choices from lacquer to glitter to metallic. Very pleased with them.</li>
            <li> the colors aren&#x27;t as bright on your nails as pictured but after 2 coats it shows the color just not as bright.  Didn&#x27;t try with white nail polish under yet, might show brighter</li>
            <li> Gorgeous colors and they last longer than my other brands of nail polish. Although, I thought there was gonna be purple but instead they sent more of a charcoal color instead. It&#x27;s a pretty color, but the picture shows purple.</li>
            <li> Colors are not as bright as pictured. Need as many as 4 or 5 coats to get the depth you want. Otherwise they are very beautiful. One nail applicator was cracked when it arrived, will have to superglue back into place to use.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re alright but the smell from the polish.. you&#x27;ll need some kind of ventilation or at least crack a window. It&#x27;s SUPER strong. So if you&#x27;re particularly sensitive to the chemical smell you should probably find a different brand.</li>
            <li> These colors are absolutely gorgeous!!!!! They are not as sheer as some of the other reviews would have you believe. I only needed to put on the standard two coats and my nails were just as sparkly as the ones in the picture. They do take a little longer than most polishes to dry, but not horribly so. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using these for a quick &amp;#34;paint &#x27;n go&amp;#34; polish, but if you&#x27;re just taking your time, relaxing at home and pampering yourself a bit, I would definitely use these! They are seriously breathtakingly beautiful colors and totally worth the little bit of extra drying time, if you can allot the time. Definitely worth it, ladies!</li>
            <li> All the colors are the exact same over black no difference.. Its all red/orange glitter. :(( they do not show up like the bottle looks.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF. I USE IT OVER COMPLIMENTING COLORS FOR EVEN MORE VARIATIONS. IT&#x27;S SO PRETTY IN THE LIGHT.</li>
            <li> poorly packed , have nail polish wasted all through parcel</li>
            <li> I bought these nail polishes to use on top of nearly the same color or white to make the colors pop. I received all the colors pictured and am very happy with my purchase. They do not have a very strong smell, which is good because I don&#x27;t need anything adding to the smell of acrylic when I do my own nails. Overall, these are very good and I plan to purchase other colors from this brand</li>
            <li> The right amount of nail polish and the colors are beautiful.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS POLISH!! I&#x27;m actually ordering another set to have for when I run out.</li>
            <li> Was so disappointed. I loved the colors. But as soon as I opened it, I seen one was broken.  And I can&#x27;t even do a return.</li>
            <li> Goes on gloppy and chips just about immediately. Even with high quality top coat. The colors are nice, but the quality is poor. Doesnt qualify for a refund so your stuck looking at them til you decide to throw them out.</li>
            <li> I never received my package and I purchased it as  a christmas gift. When I contacted the seller, they said it must have gotten lost in the mail and gave me a refund. I did not want a refund, I wanted the gift I promised my little sister. They didn&#x27;t even attempt to send me the product again. Bad customer service, I got nothing for my troubles.</li>
            <li> love the colors and enjoy mixing them up. Don&#x27;t have very long staying power but then I am rough on my hands.</li>
            <li> The colors here are fun to wear over other solid shades, because they are more shimmer, not quite glitter, but they don&#x27;t cover very solidly, which is fine. As accent colors they are super-fun and add a different dimension to the colors you already have.</li>
            <li> I really like these colors and the price is amazing. These polishes work well for me as long as I use a good base coat and top coat. Once again I really love these colors, they sparkle like crazy.</li>
            <li> I love the effects these polishes give when I use them over my nail polish, especially dark colors.  I use them over the Kleancolor matte finish polishes.  You can create some really pretty effects.  Used alone they come out really pale.  I used the light blue with the dark blue matte finish and it creates a kind of &amp;#34;starry night sky&amp;#34; effect.  Really pretty.</li>
            <li> Great product and Seller to work with.</li>
            <li> Not enough coverage with two coats. You need at least 4. However the finished product is good.</li>
            <li> When you look at the picture of the nails painted with this polish, it looks like a deep solid color with sparkles in it. However, when I put the polish on my nails it looks almost clear. It only had a slight tint of the color. I put another coat on and it got a little bit darker but not much. It is still pretty, but I would have preferred a darker color like pictured. I only had my nails painted for a few hours before the polish started to chip. I was playing with  my dog so this might have something to do with it. I am going to try the other colors and see how they turn out.</li>
            <li> All I can say is I love it. You have to use two coats. 😃</li>
            <li> I actually bought the holo green from a thrift store about a year ago- one arround here sells a lot of new products like they always sell kleancolor nail polish, green was the only holo they had or I would have bought more colors, I liked it so much I bought 2 more. When I found out I could get the set on amazon I did because I wanted more colors. I think the name holo is deceiving because it&#x27;s not a holo like color club that&#x27;s a linear holographic polish, this is a super fine glitter. I bought these to apply on top of other polishes (and I also do special effects and use my polishes in ways the average user will probably never use nail polish, like the first thing I did with these is get out cosmetic wedges and do gradient/ombré nails and then I stamped a design on them.) With the exception of pink being a more pigmented color the polishes are more of a tinted glitter formula. It&#x27;s a really cheap and easy way to change your favorite colors of tried and true nail polishes, and this certain type of nail polish by this company is like a tinted clear polish with glitter, so to get it to show up like in the bottle it has to be painted over a similar color, it&#x27;s fairly easy. The nice thing about these is they are very similar to a few other products that cost much more!  I think they are somewhat similar to \\&quot;Northern lights\\&quot; top coat some of these colors work/look very similar and this polish only takes 1 coat to get a nice glittery look- but you will need to use a top coat over it for staying power (I use seche vite because it makes my mani dry super fast) And for the advanced users out there like me there are also a lot like the new OPI tinted top coat but this also has glitter in it!</li>
            <li> These colors are glittery with a hint of color. I thought they were solid with slight glitter. Great for an accent with other solid nail paints.</li>
            <li> Package arrived on time.. Love the product, but it does&lt;br /&gt;take about three coats to look good.</li>
            <li> BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL!  Love these polishes!</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful 6 piece set, but they are sheer. If you&#x27;re looking for Holographic nail polish you need to spend more on a professional brand. That is my opinion. I bought the Kleancolor Neon Retros, Kleancolor Neons and the Kleancolor Metallics. I plan to use my neons for a base color and match the Holographic polishes with them to make them pop out. I&#x27;m giving the Holos a 4 star review for the price and beautiful colors. The colors represented in the picture are true to what I received. I read over a hundred reviews before mine were delivered and quite frankly I was almost regretting my purchase. Now that I have seen and inspected these products I feel that for the price and what you get is a wonderful way to start your nail polish collection. If you&#x27;re anything like me you will find a thousand creative ways to use all your colors. Thanks to the seller for packing them so I had no leakage or broken bottles and for Amazons service!</li>
            <li> Great colors excellent quality and price</li>
            <li> Not good they peel of</li>
            <li> This takes a lot of coats to show up and each coat takes a long time to dry.  After 4 coats, my nails looked nothing like the picture and it began to peel later that day.  When you try to return it, you can&#x27;t because of the special handling it requires.</li>
            <li> The colors are great after about 4 coats on natural nails. However, within 24hrs - they peel/chip right off with little reason. I tried each color alone, with a base coat, with a top coat and with all 3 and they don&#x27;t last more than a day. I even tried roughing up 1 nail in hopes it&#x27;d stick better. The good thing is that it comes off in almost complete sheets, so I dont have to try to scrub glitter polish off with polish remover. I guess if you have time to do 4 - 5 coats before going somewhere you&#x27;d be good. Just don&#x27;t expect it to last more than a day. I&#x27;m OCD with my nail polish though - if it chips, I have to take it off. The shipper shipped incredibly fast and in great packaging. Had the polish lasted longer, I&#x27;d definitely have gone back and bought a ton of other colors because it&#x27;s a great price. It&#x27;s rare to find this good of a covering with a glitter polish.</li>
            <li> My husband Joe bought these for me I couldn&#x27;t wait to get them... I was a little disappointed I wish I would have read the reviews... They aren&#x27;t quite the same colors as pictured and they are very very very sheer. Its almost like there clear polish with glitter... I had to use a base coat of a colored polish I had that was similar in color and then put it on top of that to get it to look similar to the nails in the pictures... There pretty colors in the bottle but if I would of known they were so sheer I wouldn&#x27;t have got them... We ordered 2 other sets the spring line and metallic I think... They should be here in a couple days I really hope they are whats pictured!!!</li>
            <li> This brand is notorious for it&#x27;s odd scent, but I think it is completely worth it. The colors are spectacular and the polish is packed full with holographic glitter.I absolutely love these polishes.</li>
            <li> The polishes were shipped quickly. They are a very pretty color but very light. A under color is required to make them look their best</li>
            <li> I like how the nail polish looks when I am doing my nail art decorations. Its amazing how vivid the colors are and it does required 2 coats to appreciate the color but it is worth it</li>
            <li> Was super excited to get these in the mail and then was disappointed. The colors are not as bright as they are in the pics, almost the same but like a muted version of what shows up on screen. When used the color is sheer and took multiple coats to achieve the coverage I was wanting. On the bright side they are full of glitter and sparkle, which I love. So I have decided to keep them.</li>
            <li> I use these with a white base and they really shine in the sunlight. To get the color you do have to put at least three coats on. What looks like purple in the picture is more of a gray/chrome holo. Good polishes for the price, a little over $1 a bottle.</li>
            <li> Each colour is so vibrant. They look great all together and alone. I am happy with my purchase. The smell is minimal too</li>
            <li> I love these colors! True to the picture if you do a ton of coats so i use them as a top sparkle and works great.. Came on time, wrapped very well so they wouldn&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite. The glitter is INSANE</li>
            <li> This polish doesn&#x27;t look like it does in the picture I love the sparkle  but you have  to put it over a similar color polish as a base or many coats to see the color. I used the pink over a white polish that looked great.</li>
            <li> Super huge fan of nail polish.  These are a great addition to my collection!</li>
            <li> It so lovely n glittery I love it</li>
            <li> Colours loo dull on nails when applied</li>
            <li> Good product. Not quite as long lasting as the metallic colors.</li>
            <li> Poor quality.  You just cannot wear these colors alone since they&#x27;re so light and transparent.</li>
            <li> I love it they sparkel soo much.. and stay on for a long time.. But it comes with different colors then what they show in the picture..</li>
            <li> These polishes are great. I love them alone or with other polish for nail art. Will order again.</li>
            <li> Kleancolor is one of my favorite nail polish brands. They are cheap but still pretty good quality. They can chip kind of easily but for less than $2 a bottle, I can&#x27;t complain. I used these as glitter color top coats since it can take quite a few coats to make them look like the picture, but that&#x27;s fine by me. Some people have complained of a strong smell but they smell like all regular polishes to me.</li>
            <li> Great colors.  Would like to see more sets in different vibrant colors, would also like to see black and white too.</li>
            <li> I love these colors, they are great.  They dry fast, aren&#x27;t terribly hard to take off, and a reasonable price too!!!  What more could a girl want!</li>
            <li> I love these colors! I&#x27;m only giving 4 stars rather than 5 because of the amount of coats it takes for total coverage-4 (yikes)!. Once you&#x27;ve got those 4 coats on though the sparkle is stunning! The first color I used was the holo pink and I was able to keep the polish on for over 2 weeks with no chipping and minimal tip wear on my non-dominant hand (my dominant hand always has issues but that&#x27;s what striping tape is for-create a new look when you have chipping!). Like others have noted, the smell of the polish is really strong however it wasn&#x27;t bad enough for me not to use it and I look forward to trying all of the colors in the future. Overall, the number coats needed and the powerful smell are not enough to make me dislike this set as the sparkle wins out! If you&#x27;re on the fence about getting them I say do it-at this price what have you got to lose? If nothing else you have a birthday gift for a friend if you end up not liking them.</li>
            <li> These polishes are great in that they are super well priced, super sparkly and very pretty...but, they take forever to dry.  It&#x27;s almost like they never dry at all. Even after 30 minutes they will smudge. I find this ridiculously inconvenient. But I have some tips to make it work.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, you need to wait a long time between coats. Brush on one coat and then go do something else for a while. Then do your second coat like a hour later, this will insure that it dries completely. If you paint too many coats it simply won&#x27;t dry. Like ever.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend a base coat either because that just seemed to add to the drying time.&lt;br /&gt;Second, they really need a top coat to shine well. Otherwise the finish is somewhat dull. Use a fast drying top coat like seche vite or better yet top it off with a coat if gel and cure with a UV light if you have one. This will help it last and protect it from smudges. Otherwise it chips easily.&lt;br /&gt;You may wonder if its even worth the trouble with all the drying time and coats etc., (I&#x27;ve gotten away with two coats but three coats is really where it&#x27;s at with these) but the colors really are beautiful, and I&#x27;ve yet to see another brand that has these pastel colored holos so they are unique in that sense. Also you can&#x27;t beat this set for the price. Just know what you&#x27;re getting when you buy. I&#x27;m overall happy with mine. They just sparkle so much, it&#x27;s mesmerizing.</li>
            <li> The colors are different from the picture. Everything is very dull as if they added grey to it. I&#x27;m very disapointed by the colors. The orange is more of a pastel-puke-rust (I will never wear it) and the &amp;#34;purple&amp;#34; I got wasn&#x27;t even close to purple, it was navy blue. The polish itself isn&#x27;t holographic either but it is sparkly. The texture isn&#x27;t smooth as shown in the photos, it&#x27;s kinda like sand on your nails but you can smooth it with a top coat. Polish lasts for several days without chipping though, it&#x27;s a good quality in that sense.</li>
            <li> The colors are very pretty, I LOVE THIS ,would buy it again.</li>
            <li> These colors are gorgeous! They change slightly with a topcoat but are still stunning! They do seem to chip easily though</li>
            <li> Good value for what you&#x27;re actually paying.  The only real complaint I had is that some of the colors (mainly the green and the orange) are not as bright in person as they are in the picture.  I bought it mostly for the blues and the pink, which I am very happy with.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before I purchased, so I wasn&#x27;t surprised when I only received 5 of the colors shown....the purple was &#x27;chrome&#x27; instead --- or maybe it was the same color, it just appears darker in reality (the pictures of the colors on here do seem to be &#x27;enhanced&#x27; and brighter), but that was okay with me.  I will say it does take about 3 coats to get any kind of non-sheer coverage and I found that it did take a long time for them to dry.  For the price, I really can&#x27;t complain --- so won&#x27;t...the colors are actually very pretty -- just sit aside a night in if you want to really do them to look like the photos!!</li>
            <li> Look nothing like the picture. If anything it could be used as a top coat, but definitely not by itself. Three coats of paint and its still sheer. After two days half of it had chipped off. Would not buy again or recommend.</li>
            <li> These nail polishes came to my house in a small flimsy envalope and one of them was compleatly shattered on the side. When I opened the package glass shards fell everywhere. Ive orded a lot of nail polishes online and this is the fisrt time Ive ever gotten a broken bottle I am pretty sure it was because of very poor packaging. The colors themselves are also mush duller than they look in the pictures. Also not sure why the description says free earrings the nail polishes don&#x27;t come with anything which I don&#x27;t mind this is a good price for just polishes but I think they should take that out of the description.</li>
            <li> I got all the same colors as advertised but it&#x27;s a sheer color I wanted the deep tones u see in the photos I will have to get s base coat in similar color to achieve this look. I tried 3 coats and even after that it was just thick and dust want to dry well and still not the same tone as photos.</li>
            <li> I love them needs a couple of coats to get the same effect like in the picture but they are beautiful</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors great polish!</li>
            <li> They are not full linear holo polish. They are sheer polish with small holo sparkles. Glitter polish not holo polish.</li>
            <li> Bright neon colors, good price, I love using them!</li>
            <li> great price beautiful colors!!!</li>
            <li> That pink, purple and blue color are incredible. Better quality than you&#x27;d think for the price. Arrived quickly, and all in tact. I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering their other sets.</li>
            <li> Vibrant colors that last longer than most polishes. These are great for DIY tutorials I have seen on youtube! I love them!!</li>
            <li> Love this set. The colors are great.</li>
            <li> These are some of my most favorite polishes. They&#x27;re subtle and so pretty. They&#x27;re not overwhelmingly sparkly but that&#x27;s what&#x27;s perfect in my opinion. The pink one is my favorite. The only downside, they start to chip on day 3. If you&#x27;re going to use these, I recommend using rubber gloves when washing dishes or anytime your hands are going in water for an extended period of time. I also recommend using at least two coats of clear polish as a top coat.</li>
            <li> these just sparkle like you can&#x27;t imagine, very easy to apply and wonderful over other colors or on their own, very happy with them</li>
            <li> I ordered this on December 23 and received it on December 27 so the shipping was fast which i loved. The bottle came in a box and were well sealed in bubble wrap. The colors are gorgeous the reason i am giving this 3 stars is because although the shipping was very fast and the colors are pretty, the pictures shows that they are squealers when in reality there more like sparkly top coats. The other problem is that they take a very long time to dry a few minutes is fine but an hour is un fair. Even after it appears dry if you touch it or bump it, it will show. I also received the purple very thick and hard to put on which i did not like.</li>
            <li> Cheap, Looks great, Just as advertised in picture when used with proper base color coats underneath. Free shipping sold me on it.</li>
            <li> GREAT COLOR BUT CHIPS NEEDS REALL GOOD TOP COAT I USE TOP COAT TWICE</li>
            <li> I use nail polish on a(n almost) daily basis, and I&#x27;ve gotten used to the chemical smell of the polishes and removers both. These smell horrible, like they were made to appeal to 8 year old girls; it&#x27;s a sickly sweet cotton candy type smell that I can&#x27;t stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The payoff is wonderful and 2-3 coats provides wonderful coverage, but I can&#x27;t get over that smell.</li>
            <li> I must say that I&#x27;m loving these polishes even more after 2 months of use. I received all six colors. I tried to use them in all different ways, by themselves, with different base colors, etc. And the result is that I&#x27;ve gotten many various colors and effects. For example, I may use lighter or darker green as base coat, and the Kleancolor green or yellow, and I would have created completely different effect each time, a lime chrome or a forest green chrome... It&#x27;s fabulous. The technique of using various base colors can also save me from using too much Kleancolor each time. Sometimes when I&#x27;ve messed up my other design, I could always count on a coat of Kleancolor Chrome to cover up, or to &amp;#34;bling&amp;#34; up my do. Love them!!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t read all the reviews... :(  It is not true Holographic nail polish, but a glitter polish that would take a gazillion coats to get to appear anything like holographic nail polish..edited below..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to edit my review.  This product wasnt&#x27; exactly what I expected and some colors are more translucent than others.  The purple is more like a navy blue..but it is still pretty and fun and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  It goes on better over a solid color base I think that is similar to the glitter color.  For the \\&quot;purple\\&quot; and aqua color it really only took 2 coats to look good.  The green seems much thinner.  I haven&#x27;t really tried the yellow, pink or orange yet.</li>
            <li> You will need several coats if you use the color by itself so I recommend using a colored base coat, that being said these are so pretty and I am so glad I bought them. They sparkle and shine so nicely in the right light!</li>
            <li> Going into Easter basket for family hunt on Saturday.</li>
            <li> Different colors then the ones you buy in stores. Giving as Christmas gift to Granddaughter.I am sure she will love</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the colors. Not as nice as the pics...</li>
            <li> Shipped fast but they didnt included the free earrings, which I&#x27;m not too concerned about but they are misleading the product info.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the polish, they do need lot of coats like the other reviewers said or what I did was put white base coat and topped which these polish, about two coats. I&#x27;ll try to get color base polish to see if it will turn out like the photos.</li>
            <li> I like them,she loves them!</li>
            <li> Gorgeous, have used most off them. Love the set. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> The Polish is very cheap. It chips the same day applied on nails. I give it a 1 star because it wouldn&#x27;t let me go without selecting none.</li>
            <li> Bright and VERY shiny. I love these polishes. Have had multiple compliments about them! Highly reccommend.</li>
            <li> This product only met my expectations based on the reviews. The actual description and product photos are highly inaccurate. Colors are dull, and really thick. I&#x27;d recommend purchasing a thinner with these. The sparkles are wonderful though!</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful and very glittery. Super light too so it&#x27;s not too dramatic. It is just kind of hard to get off</li>
            <li> Must read all info before buying. I looked at the picture and the beautiful colors that it showed here.... however I didn&#x27;t read the details. I did not recieve the colors it shows, they state in details that only certain colors are available and the colors aren&#x27;t the ones showing in the pic. So don&#x27;t assume. Read it all. Colors are very sheer, need a lot of coats.</li>
            <li> this polish is so nice. goes on smooth. I really like this brand of nail polish, looks just as good as those expensive ones in the market.</li>
            <li> Not bad.  the colors are okay.  stays on okay too.</li>
            <li> i was so excited to get them in the mail and when i saw how they were packaged i was really in love with all the colors ..you will have to put on 2 or 3 coats but they are beautiful  either way...i would recommend</li>
            <li> So pretty and bright! Great topper for similarly colored polishes.</li>
            <li> I would have give it five start but there is one thing I dislike. For me is a major flaw. The colors are beautiful but you can only see them if used as a top coat. I paint my nails with a base color and then apply the holo nail polish on top. Which I don&#x27;t mind at all. ( it&#x27;s like adding glitter to your manicure). What I do really dislike is that it take way to long to dry. Way, way, way more than the metallic set or pastel set. I don&#x27;t mind waiting a few minutes but this is ridiculous. I even try applying the fast dry top coat and well it did not help. It makes it stiky. In my personal opinion this is so far the only set I will think twice before re purchasing. As I say the drying time it&#x27;s more than I have experience even with the really cheap nail polishes.</li>
            <li> Kind of ruiny as nail polish. Got it as a gift and it was great when it was opened but when it was used it was very watered down and didnt stick very well.</li>
            <li> Takes about three coats to get good coverage. Didn&#x27;t work well with my top coat, so it peeled off pretty quickly, but it&#x27;s really pretty when it&#x27;s on!</li>
            <li> Even with two coats these colors were sheer with minimal holo.  They&#x27;re pretty but far more sheer than the photos would lead you to believe.</li>
            <li> I love the colors but the nail polish is very opaque even with a coat of clear on top of it. Unfortunately is not working well for me. I guess the quality of the nail polish is not very high.</li>
            <li> these colors are very pretty but as others have said, they don&#x27;t appear as they do in the picture.  I received the colors shown but the orange looks brownish, not the pretty orange in the pic.  It took three coats to get the color I achieved, and I did not use them over any other color.  I think I will next time I want to try these, maybe that will enhance the colors.</li>
            <li> some of the colors take 4 or more coats to be noticeable</li>
            <li> This polish is great. Good coverage, colors &amp; is super sparkley &amp; shiny. Has a very fine glitter do it gives this super sparkle that&#x27;s pretty. I have a holo polish which is a bit different but this one is just like shown in picture.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money! The colors are great(exactly as pictured) and the polish stays on pretty well. Fast delivery too! I received this item just 2 days after ordering it. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> Perfect for my nieces</li>
            <li> Great color, but they are more of the transparent sheer. Definitely need multiple coats to achieve any color close to the picture. Absolutely need a top coat or your nails feel like sand paper.</li>
            <li> I love these sparkly colors. I purchased a set of the pastel colors as well, and use these on top of the pastels. Some of the colors are too clear to wear by themselves. To have the same results as the picture, you need to have like 8 coats, and they already take longer to dry than usual. Would recommend them as a pair.</li>
            <li> These are the best spring colors I&#x27;ve seen this year. They arrived sooner than expected and in great condition. My only complaints are the very strong smell and the time it takes to dry for just 1 coat.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE the colors the service was AAA+++ but.... product is not a strong polish, doesn&#x27;t last long before showing wear.  But adore the colors.. Shipping and service second to none!  Price was fair for the product!</li>
            <li> Great colors easy application</li>
            <li> The colors are very drab and you need 3 or more coats to really get the full effect of the polish.</li>
            <li> Value for money. Nice to gift.</li>
            <li> First off, I was happy with how quick I received the polishes. However, upon receiving the polishes I didn&#x27;t get what I payed for. The green bottle was broken and spilled all over the inside package. I was upset that I had to clean off the other two polishes that were packaged with it. I don&#x27;t get what the free earrings things about because I didn&#x27;t get anything besides the polish. I&#x27;m very unhappy with this product and won&#x27;t order it again any time soon.</li>
            <li> The polish is great but when you take it off your nails are yellow. I don&#x27;t use anymore.</li>
            <li> Love the colors. But the one that looks purple really isn&#x27;t purple. Its called holo chrome. The blue and green are super thin. The prettiest ones are pink and yellow. I think they all work well over other polishes. Shipping was right on target. Got them the last day it gave me as an estimated delivery date.</li>
            <li> chips easy but just put a clear coat on it!</li>
            <li> I love the colors but the nail polish so far has been sticky and kind of hard to apply. I have to use a different color  on the bottom to get the color to show up because it&#x27;s a clear glittery nail polish. It takes forever to dry as well. I feel like the picture of the painted nails is deceiving the nail polish doesn&#x27;t look like  anything like the picture once applied.</li>
            <li> Excellent product worth the experience</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this set.  I even shared this link with my friends - My only critique is that it takes a good 4 to 5 layers to get the look i wanted, i top them with a fast dry top coat and it worked great.  The smell is very strong but then again all of Kleancolors are like that.</li>
            <li> I love ordering from Mightygadget. They are greats</li>
            <li> You have to put more than 3 coats to get a true color</li>
            <li> Very pretty polish &amp; to me the smell of the polish is not that bad, strong but tolerable.</li>
            <li> i bought these polishes for my niece&#x27;s Easter basket &amp; they are not the same pastel colors at all. They are much darker &amp; more dull than what is pictured! I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased the colors received &amp; may be returning.</li>
            <li> The colors are really bright and look good! But does get somewhat chunky if you don&#x27;t leave enought time to dry between applications.</li>
            <li> ! of the polishes were broken, other then that, I like them.</li>
            <li> The product was great I bought it for my niece and she loved it very happy</li>
            <li> no earrings with order, and it&#x27;s more sheer than with color</li>
            <li> works great as I top coat if you wont just a touch of glitter.</li>
            <li> I ordered 3 sets (3 different types) of Kleancolor nail polish from three different sellers. This one took the longest to receive (3 - 5 day shipping stated in the description but it took 9 days to receive). I did receive the colors stated in the description but, the &amp;#34;Chrome&amp;#34; is nothing like the picture. It is a silver/gray. I am very curious what they did to have the purple result pictured. The color is not as saturated as pictured either (at least not when applied directly to natural nails with no base coat). After applying two coats, the polish chipped after the first time my hands were in hot water (not really surprising but something to be aware of). The colors are pretty but, I wouldn&#x27;t describe it as &amp;#34;holo&amp;#34;. This is a nice glitter set (if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for).</li>
            <li> Pretty but not holographic at all...more like fine glitter.</li>
            <li> Great combination of colors.</li>
    </ol>
