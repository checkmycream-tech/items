    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>They still look great!  </li>
            <li>For me, this is the best polish system around.</li>
            <li>This is THE BEST nail polish that I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
            <li>For the money, this is great alternative to getting gels at a salon.  </li>
            <li>and I found the perfect combo:  3 coats of color followed by 1-2 coats of Top Coat.  </li>
            <li>I love this polish!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been doing my own nails</li>
            <li>so I was beyond thrilled when I heard about Miracle Gel.</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s a nice neutral and complements my skin tone.</li>
            <li>I bought the introductory kit with the polish &amp;#34;Street Flair&amp;#34; which is kind of a lavender shade.</li>
            <li>Just bought some today and was so excited!!</li>
            <li>LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>However, if you do 2 coats, then a coat of the top coat, then another coat of polish and another top coat (</li>
            <li>I am wondering if the difference between the 1 star reviews and the 5 star reviews is whether or not people used the top coat.  </li>
            <li>I like it more than Revlon&#x27;s Colorstay Gel Envy because it has yet to bubble when I apply it</li>
            <li>Keep in mind, you MUST buy the top coat to &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I topped it with the gel top coat, and it was mostly OK for a couple days.</li>
            <li>I took it off before I was able to evaluate durability and longevity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the Birthday Suit color</li>
            <li>I am glad to find it here.  </li>
            <li>This polish is fabulous!  </li>
            <li>new to do it yourself gel, and think it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Second of all (and most importantly) - this is not gel polish.  </li>
            <li>I apply two light coats of color, including the tips, then one top coat.</li>
            <li>The removal is so easy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 55 and have really strong nails.  </li>
            <li>This does not wear quite as long, but I easily get a week of great wear and love the easy removal.  </li>
            <li>it which they don&#x27;t tell you until you read the fine print on the bottle:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Wearing polish on my nails reminds me to be more careful with them, so they&#x27;ve been growing and look beautiful.</li>
            <li>Ignore the other ratings- if you love a beautifully polished nail, this is your color.</li>
            <li>I find the primary benefits of gel polish to be: 1)</li>
            <li>I will probably never get the &amp;#34;Gel Nail Polish&amp;#34; with UV light again.  </li>
            <li>I use it with something called Gelous which is a gel basecoat that does not require a light.  </li>
            <li>I know the layers sound like a lot</li>
            <li>found a better color, Per-Suede, and two coats of that are nice and solid.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly, the brush is flat making it easy to use and paint on nicely.  </li>
            <li>superior shine, 2) longer lasting,</li>
            <li>Very streaky finish, even after a top coat was used.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this product.  </li>
            <li>I redid it after I wasn&#x27;t happy with the look, leaving a full day of drying time between my first and second coat.</li>
            <li>3) quick drying.  </li>
            <li>My nails tend to snap off or break on the sides at the quick</li>
            <li>Be sure to let each coat dry thoroughly, and you must use the coordinating Sally Hansen Miracle Gel top</li>
            <li>I bought this in the store, where it was made abundantly clear by the display that it is a two part process - color and top coat.  </li>
            <li>Chips and peels off right away.</li>
            <li>I bought a kit at CVS with Bare Dare &amp; the top coat, then bought Birthday Suit separately since it was on sale.</li>
            <li>on VERY smoothly&lt;br /&gt;Leaves a nice shine&lt;br /&gt;Dries quicker than regular nailpolish</li>
            <li>The polish started chipping after 2 1/2 days, which is comparable to most regular nail polishes.  </li>
            <li>first time I followed the directions on the bottle and had wearing on the tips by day 2.</li>
            <li>I went 17 days before I had enough wear on the tips and growth that I decided to remove it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s more work than advertised, but cheaper than shelac.</li>
            <li>This is more so a review of the Sally Hansen Miracle Gel line as opposed to a specific color.</li>
            <li>First of all, I would reallllly like to know why these Sally Hansen Miracle Gel polishes are selling for $15+</li>
            <li>I first apply the basecoat</li>
            <li>I top off with a last layer of basecoat.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably get a few more days out of them and haven&#x27;t found them to chip easily.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I need to remove and reapply is because my nails have grown a good deal recently.  </li>
            <li>hopefully if done right with doing two light coats and letting dry in between coats and then the top coat it will actually last..</li>
            <li>Waited until each coat was thoroughly dry and put the top gel coat on.  </li>
            <li>The polish took forever to dry and the top coat did too.  </li>
            <li>For my money, Dazzle Dry is a MUCH better polish system.</li>
            <li>Something else that was also made clear in the store is that this product uses natural light to make the process happen rather than UV lightbulbs.  </li>
            <li>It is very watery.  </li>
            <li>God knows how much polish remover I&#x27;ll need</li>
            <li>my whole life and</li>
            <li>but this color goes on very streaky.</li>
            <li>Exposing your nails to sunlight really helps.  </li>
            <li>It just isn&#x27;t as shiny nor as cheap as Revlon (only $5.00).</li>
            <li>If you want it to look like a real gel manicure, then you&#x27;re going to have to go legit and put in the work.</li>
            <li>but they really aren&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I actually stumbled onto these reviews because I&#x27;m looking to buy more colors and was surprised to see that this had a three star rating.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I gave it a chance and will be returning to this polish for a LONG time!!!!</li>
            <li>This is regular polish, and really not even great regular polish.  </li>
            <li>If you go to the Sally Hansen site and read the directions, it does eventually say that it uses natural light to complete the process, so if you do your nails indoors and don&#x27;t expose them to much light, you will probably have a less desirable outcome.  </li>
            <li>Even with the gel topcoat, it wasn&#x27;t particularly shiny.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this polish</li>
            <li>Why is this price so high?</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not hard on my nails</li>
            <li>Both color and Top Coat dry faster than regular polish.  </li>
            <li>I say just buy regular polish and a more expensive top coat.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s much longer than any traditional polish has ever lasted on my natural nails.</li>
            <li>Another PLUS is my nails remain shiny and haven&#x27;t dulled after nearly 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Anyone who has had a salon gel manicure should not be surprised by this.  </li>
            <li>When they say no light needed, they are referring to the UV light salons use.  </li>
            <li>probably acts just like regular polish and chips fast.  </li>
            <li>YOU MUST USE WITH THE SPECIAL SALLY HANSON TOPCOAT IN THE BLACK BOTTLE or this polish</li>
            <li>The color is not nude, more like pale pink.</li>
            <li>I stopped counting after 10 days&#x27; wear, but when my daughter applied a regular coat of sparkle polish over the color and topcoat sometime after the tenth day, the polish broke down quickly.  </li>
            <li>not last anywhere near 14 days.</li>
            <li>I ended up throwing a thin coat of glitter polish on top to cover it all up.</li>
            <li>Better but not great.</li>
            <li>Still in the early hours of application so time will tell if it actually wears longer than regular polish.</li>
            <li>This polish went on dull, took a full three coats to obtain the color.  </li>
            <li>when they cost less than $8 for the exact same polish at every Walmart in the country.  </li>
            <li>After doing two coats of color, waiting 5 minutes per the Sally Hansen site, and one coat of top coat, it only took a few minutes to firm up.  </li>

            <li> When I applied it, the second coat caused drag on the first making for an uneven tone.</li>
            <li> I am pretty hard on my nails (handwashing dishes, prying things with my nails, etc) and they are holding up equally as well as a salon job.  </li>
            <li> It lasts longer than regular polish but not quite as long as a UV salon gel manicure.  </li>
            <li> Finally, since it took three coats, it took forever to completely dry.  </li>
            <li> I find that placing my nails in light (either artificial or natural) helps them dry quicker - can&#x27;t tell you why, but it does.  </li>
            <li> Seeing as how my gel manicures are off by the 5th day, they are a complete waste for me</li>
            <li> Never has a polish survived that long on me.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t have time to sit around and wait that long, plus, it is too thick</li>
            <li> Pay a little extra for a real gel polish, buy your base coat and your top coat and resign yourself to getting one of those at-home UV lights.  </li>
            <li> and I could feel that the polish &#x27;held them together&#x27; during several instances where any other polish wouldn&#x27;t have done the trick.  </li>
            <li> letting it dry between coats)</li>
            <li> An addict to absolutely destroying a manicure the second one chip occurs or a gel nail starts to lift, which inevitably occurs around day 2.</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed and taking both the color and top gel back to get a refund.  </li>
            <li> and expected chipping and have had NONE.  </li>
            <li> Furthermore I should say here that I dug into my flowerpots, washed dishes, bathed small children, and washed my hands regularly during the 10 days.  </li>
            <li> Plus, my nails were in terrible condition after wearing gel polish for many months, despite always having the polish changed professionally.</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I will say with this polish, the curing comes with the top coat and/or base coat.  </li>
            <li> I use the basecoat as a base and a top coat.  </li>
            <li> This color, Birthday Suit, is very thin and even two heavy coats look very streaky.</li>
            <li> If I prep my nails accordingly, aka wipe down with a acetone or nail prep, and do a little buffing, this polish lasts without a single chip for at least 5 days.</li>
            <li> a shame because I like the pros, its just not strong enough of a pro to get me to stop using regular nailpolish &amp; pay for this expensive nailpolish that lasts 3 days.</li>
            <li> Looks chunky and uneven when it dries up.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have the appropriately harsh word to describe how stupid/conniving that is.  </li>
            <li> At first I was a little disappointed because it still felt slightly tacky to the touch.  </li>
            <li> I am not easy on my nails, and this stuff stays on.</li>
            <li> Letting each thin layer of application dry for about 1 minute each.  </li>
            <li> This particular color gave the illusion of elongating the length of my fingers and looks very expensive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not been a fan of Sally Hansen in the past and was hesitant to purchase.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Not worth the money!!!</li>
            <li> I had to put 3 color coats on because it is so thin and uneven.  </li>
            <li> It is thick and goes on streaky.</li>
            <li> Outrageously over-priced nail polish ---no comparison to a true gel manicure.</li>
            <li> Sad that I wasted the money</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed because all the ads on the magazines said that it would last 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Very thick when applied.</li>
            <li> Sucked it up &amp; paid the steep price but was not totally happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I have been using regular gel polish for years and always hate the removal process.  </li>
            <li> this is by far the worst polish I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been VERY HARD on my nails this week (housecleaning!)</li>
            <li> difficult to remove and too liguidy</li>
            <li> But now I&#x27;m seeing all the negative reviews which makes me sad :(</li>
            <li> Very poor polish.</li>
            <li> I got bubbles like crazy.  </li>
            <li> If you think you can just use the polish you will be highly disappointed.  </li>
            <li> absolutely HORRIBLE!!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> absolutely HORRIBLE!!</li>
            <li> difficult to remove and too liguidy</li>
            <li> After day 2 I had chipping also.  Not happy that I spent $9.99 on the color and $9.99 on the top coat.  Definitely not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last any longer than regular polish. Save yourself $10 and get the regular polish.</li>
            <li> Very thick when applied. Looks chunky and uneven when it dries up. Chips and peels off right away. The color is not nude, more like pale pink.</li>
            <li> The term &amp;#34;Miracle Gel&amp;#34; is a total lie.  This is regular polish, and really not even great regular polish.  Not at all like a gel.  I find the primary benefits of gel polish to be: 1) superior shine, 2) longer lasting, 3) quick drying.  This polish went on dull, took a full three coats to obtain the color.  Even with the gel topcoat, it wasn&#x27;t particularly shiny.  The polish started chipping after 2 1/2 days, which is comparable to most regular nail polishes.  Finally, since it took three coats, it took forever to completely dry.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Very streaky finish, even after a top coat was used. I will not be purchasing this product again. I say just buy regular polish and a more expensive top coat.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product.  Trial and error and I found the perfect combo:  3 coats of color followed by 1-2 coats of Top Coat.  Both color and Top Coat dry faster than regular polish.  I can apply 4 coats in an evening and not have to worry about them not drying in time to go to bed and worry about &#x27;sheet imprints&#x27;!  I find that placing my nails in light (either artificial or natural) helps them dry quicker - can&#x27;t tell you why, but it does.  Another PLUS is my nails remain shiny and haven&#x27;t dulled after nearly 2 weeks.  My nails needed to be reshaped and I didn&#x27;t have time to take the polish off and reapply so I took a chance and filed with the polish on.  They still look great!  I&#x27;ll probably get a few more days out of them and haven&#x27;t found them to chip easily.  The only reason I need to remove and reapply is because my nails have grown a good deal recently.  I&#x27;ve been VERY HARD on my nails this week (housecleaning!) and expected chipping and have had NONE.  This polish has taken a beating and protected my nails from breaking.  My nails tend to snap off or break on the sides at the quick and I could feel that the polish &#x27;held them together&#x27; during several instances where any other polish wouldn&#x27;t have done the trick.  I&#x27;ve not been a fan of Sally Hansen in the past and was hesitant to purchase.  I&#x27;m glad I gave it a chance and will be returning to this polish for a LONG time!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the worst polish I&#x27;ve ever used from Sally Hansen.  I am extremely disappointed and taking both the color and top gel back to get a refund.  This is junk!  It is very watery.  I put 3 coats on and left plenty of time in between each coat. I had to put 3 color coats on because it is so thin and uneven.  Waited until each coat was thoroughly dry and put the top gel coat on.  I got bubbles like crazy.  I ended up throwing a thin coat of glitter polish on top to cover it all up. God knows how much polish remover I&#x27;ll need but I didn&#x27;t have time to take it all off and start over.  I&#x27;m 55 and have really strong nails.  I&#x27;ve been doing my own nails my whole life and this is by far the worst polish I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;m going back to OPI-it lasts over 10 days. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Let me tell you... I am a nail polish picker. An addict to absolutely destroying a manicure the second one chip occurs or a gel nail starts to lift, which inevitably occurs around day 2. Seeing as how my gel manicures are off by the 5th day, they are a complete waste for me so I was beyond thrilled when I heard about Miracle Gel. I&#x27;ve tried it and it surpasses my expectations every time! I am not easy on my nails, and this stuff stays on. If I prep my nails accordingly, aka wipe down with a acetone or nail prep, and do a little buffing, this polish lasts without a single chip for at least 5 days. Uh hello.... that is a MIRACLE. I think this should be a staple in every nail OCD gal&#x27;s life.</li>
            <li> The gel is streaky even after applying three coats. I would rather stick to my regular nail polish and touch up as needed.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this polish but I literally had chipping after 2 days. I&#x27;ve had regular polish last longer than this. Sad that I wasted the money</li>
            <li> I just applied it so I can&#x27;t testify to it&#x27;s staying power but this color goes on very streaky. I&#x27;ll probably remove it.</li>
            <li> It will last 14 days, but there is a trick to it.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I followed the directions on the bottle and had wearing on the tips by day 2. However, if you do 2 coats, then a coat of the top coat, then another coat of polish and another top coat (letting it dry between coats) you&#x27;ll get 14 days wear. I went 17 days before I had enough wear on the tips and growth that I decided to remove it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s more work than advertised, but cheaper than shelac.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product.  Thought it would save me money, and I don&#x27;t like the idea of soaking my foil wrapped fingers in acetone polish remover to get gel manicures off.  Turns out, this still requires acetone remover to remove it, though it says you can use non-acetone polish remover. Nope, doesn&#x27;t work.  When I applied it, the second coat caused drag on the first making for an uneven tone. I redid it after I wasn&#x27;t happy with the look, leaving a full day of drying time between my first and second coat. Better but not great. Still, I don&#x27;t have time to spend a day on painting my nails. Sucking up the cost, and heading back to my manicurist.</li>
            <li> Outrageously over-priced nail polish ---no comparison to a true gel manicure.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last...  On the third day, the polish started to peel around the edges.  I was so disappointed because all the ads on the magazines said that it would last 2 weeks.  I have to look for CVS pharmacy receipt cause they honor 60-day return with receipt.</li>
            <li> I am wondering if the difference between the 1 star reviews and the 5 star reviews is whether or not people used the top coat.  I bought this in the store, where it was made abundantly clear by the display that it is a two part process - color and top coat.  Anyone who has had a salon gel manicure should not be surprised by this.  Something else that was also made clear in the store is that this product uses natural light to make the process happen rather than UV lightbulbs.  When they say no light needed, they are referring to the UV light salons use.  If you go to the Sally Hansen site and read the directions, it does eventually say that it uses natural light to complete the process, so if you do your nails indoors and don&#x27;t expose them to much light, you will probably have a less desirable outcome.  After doing two coats of color, waiting 5 minutes per the Sally Hansen site, and one coat of top coat, it only took a few minutes to firm up.  At first I was a little disappointed because it still felt slightly tacky to the touch.  Then I went outside to drive somewhere.  By the time I got in the car, the polish had noticeably hardened.  Exposing your nails to sunlight really helps.  I am pretty hard on my nails (handwashing dishes, prying things with my nails, etc) and they are holding up equally as well as a salon job.  I actually stumbled onto these reviews because I&#x27;m looking to buy more colors and was surprised to see that this had a three star rating.</li>
            <li> This is more so a review of the Sally Hansen Miracle Gel line as opposed to a specific color. I like it more than Revlon&#x27;s Colorstay Gel Envy because it has yet to bubble when I apply it and it lasts longer. It just isn&#x27;t as shiny nor as cheap as Revlon (only $5.00).</li>
            <li> I bought this at Walgreens as an impulse purchase. Sucked it up &amp; paid the steep price but was not totally happy with the results. Keep in mind, you MUST buy the top coat to &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; it which they don&#x27;t tell you until you read the fine print on the bottle:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Goes on VERY smoothly&lt;br /&gt;Leaves a nice shine&lt;br /&gt;Dries quicker than regular nailpolish&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons-&lt;br /&gt;Does not last anywhere near 14 days. By day 3, it starts to chip and I&#x27;m not hard on my nails (I work in an office). My regular nailpolish lasts longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a shame because I like the pros, its just not strong enough of a pro to get me to stop using regular nailpolish &amp; pay for this expensive nailpolish that lasts 3 days.</li>
            <li> First of all, I would reallllly like to know why these Sally Hansen Miracle Gel polishes are selling for $15+ when they cost less than $8 for the exact same polish at every Walmart in the country.  I don&#x27;t even have the appropriately harsh word to describe how stupid/conniving that is.  I guess they&#x27;re just hoping people won&#x27;t notice?  Moving on....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second of all (and most importantly) - this is not gel polish.  It is nothing but lies and tomfoolery.  Pay a little extra for a real gel polish, buy your base coat and your top coat and resign yourself to getting one of those at-home UV lights.  If you want it to look like a real gel manicure, then you&#x27;re going to have to go legit and put in the work.</li>
            <li> This color, Birthday Suit, is very thin and even two heavy coats look very streaky. I topped it with the gel top coat, and it was mostly OK for a couple days. Had one chip, but that was a problem with the edge on my nail. But the color is almost white, and it was so streaky I took it off before I was able to evaluate durability and longevity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found a better color, Per-Suede, and two coats of that are nice and solid. Still in the early hours of application so time will tell if it actually wears longer than regular polish. For me, that would be anything over three days and I&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
            <li> Love the Birthday Suit color - it&#x27;s a nice neutral and complements my skin tone. I bought a kit at CVS with Bare Dare &amp; the top coat, then bought Birthday Suit separately since it was on sale. The color difference wasn&#x27;t enough to justify having both, so I&#x27;ll buy whichever is in the kit the next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this polish has not lasted me 14 days, it does last about a week. That&#x27;s much longer than any traditional polish has ever lasted on my natural nails. I apply two light coats of color, including the tips, then one top coat. Be sure to let each coat dry thoroughly, and you must use the coordinating Sally Hansen Miracle Gel top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this in desperation as nothing except UV-cured gel polish has ever stayed on my nails. I stopped doing salon gel polish to avoid the constant UV exposure on my hands. Plus, my nails were in terrible condition after wearing gel polish for many months, despite always having the polish changed professionally. Nobody is going to convince me that having that stuff soaked off with the nail buffing every two weeks isn&#x27;t harming my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wearing polish on my nails reminds me to be more careful with them, so they&#x27;ve been growing and look beautiful. For me, this is the best polish system around.</li>
            <li> new to do it yourself gel, and think it&#x27;s great.  thank you!</li>
            <li> Not worth the money!!! Polish only lasted 3 days after that it starts coming off</li>
            <li> I love this polish! I will probably never get the &amp;#34;Gel Nail Polish&amp;#34; with UV light again.  I will say with this polish, the curing comes with the top coat and/or base coat.  If you think you can just use the polish you will be highly disappointed.  I use it with something called Gelous which is a gel basecoat that does not require a light.  I use the basecoat as a base and a top coat.  I first apply the basecoat and then my gel color coat.  Letting each thin layer of application dry for about 1 minute each.  I then apply another layer of basecoat and color.  I top off with a last layer of basecoat.  I tell you.  My polish lasts all week with no chipping.  After about a week I like to change the color and shape my nails.  I know the layers sound like a lot but they really aren&#x27;t.  The removal is so easy.  Just use regular polish remover.</li>
            <li> This is THE BEST nail polish that I have ever used.  This particular color gave the illusion of elongating the length of my fingers and looks very expensive.  I stopped counting after 10 days&#x27; wear, but when my daughter applied a regular coat of sparkle polish over the color and topcoat sometime after the tenth day, the polish broke down quickly.  Furthermore I should say here that I dug into my flowerpots, washed dishes, bathed small children, and washed my hands regularly during the 10 days.  Never has a polish survived that long on me.  YOU MUST USE WITH THE SPECIAL SALLY HANSON TOPCOAT IN THE BLACK BOTTLE or this polish probably acts just like regular polish and chips fast.  This is a two-part process.  I received this color as a gift from a friend for Christmas, and she had to look for it for two weeks in stores to find this hue.  I am glad to find it here.  Ignore the other ratings- if you love a beautifully polished nail, this is your color.</li>
            <li> This polish is fabulous!  I have been using regular gel polish for years and always hate the removal process.  This does not wear quite as long, but I easily get a week of great wear and love the easy removal.  I am throwing away everything else!</li>
            <li> For the money, this is great alternative to getting gels at a salon.  It lasts longer than regular polish but not quite as long as a UV salon gel manicure.  Goes on smoothly, the brush is flat making it easy to use and paint on nicely.  If you take care of your nails, mine lasted about 10 days before chipping.  It doesn&#x27;t damage your nails like UV gels, either and can be removed with regular nail polish.  What a money saver!  (SIDENOTE: I didn&#x27;t get this on Amazon, but in Target where it&#x27;s only $7.99!)</li>
            <li> Very poor polish. It is thick and goes on streaky. I bought the introductory kit with the polish &amp;#34;Street Flair&amp;#34; which is kind of a lavender shade. The polish took forever to dry and the top coat did too.  I really don&#x27;t have time to sit around and wait that long, plus, it is too thick no matter what you do.  For my money, Dazzle Dry is a MUCH better polish system.</li>
            <li> Why is this price so high? 20 dollars ? Plus shipping ? Redic. Just go buy it at Walmart for like 8 dollars. Just bought some today and was so excited!! But now I&#x27;m seeing all the negative reviews which makes me sad :( hopefully if done right with doing two light coats and letting dry in between coats and then the top coat it will actually last..</li>
