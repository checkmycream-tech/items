    <ol>
            <li>I am so impressed with Frownies!  </li>
            <li>( BTW best price on the web)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with them and at 39 am happy to have found them before turning to botox!</li>
            <li>I use one of these on face between my eyebrows at night and it works great at keeping me from frowning in my sleep.</li>
            <li>Frown lines are greatly improved.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t very sure if these pads would work when I ordered them.</li>
            <li>Be sure to stretch your face upward when you put them on!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I leaned about these in one of my searches!</li>
            <li>, I love these things!</li>
            <li>You will kind of resemble the invisible man with the bandages on when you apply them.  </li>
            <li>I have my 50th high school reunion this year, and want to look good for that, so everything helps!!</li>
            <li>I love them.  </li>
            <li>This is one of those flights of fancy in which ladies imagine there is a magic that will restore their faces to what they used to be.  </li>
            <li>these are better and cheaper than botox.</li>
            <li>Ok ... I was thumbing through a Vermont Country Store catalog, and found these things.  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I will reorder, for sure.  </li>
            <li>I love Frownies.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>I feel like it retrained my skin to lay more</li>
            <li>I love Frownies.</li>
            <li>Perhaps others will have better luck.</li>
            <li>And when I received it I tried it the first night, well because of being the first try I wasn&#x27;t experienced and had some difficulty in keeping that thing on my face.</li>
            <li>I use it on a strong line between my brows.</li>
            <li>but, I&#x27;ll stay loyal to Frownies!</li>
            <li>This should be applied in a comfortable setting around someone who won&#x27;t freak out when you come out of the bathroom with flesh colored paper attached to your face.     </li>
            <li>Try and see your face free of lines again.</li>
            <li>But the patch keeps my forehead wrinkle free.</li>
            <li>I use it over my regimen of moisturizer and is real easy to apply, stays put all night and it is helping with my deep frown :)</li>
            <li>, I use clean tap water as it drips out of faucet.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>I can make my own wrinkle mask for a lot less money out of natural ingredients that is good for your skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them for hachet&#x27;s between the brows especially, they honestly work!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny</li>
            <li>One thing I&#x27;ve learned is that they don&#x27;t stick as well if I apply them right after I put on my nighttime moisturizer--just have to wait 10-15 min.</li>
            <li>Instead I got a half filled box of some kind of undereye gel pads.  </li>
            <li>But the other night when I tried again, I easily managed to stick it and it stayed till the morning and even more.</li>
            <li>It might be a bit of an adjustment at first.  </li>
            <li>They prevent you from creasing your brow when you are sleeping, and those 8 hours or so really help!  </li>
            <li>but, you need to be consistent with the product.  </li>
            <li>However, it works very well.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money for a natural way to decrease the intensity of lines.</li>
            <li>but they do a decent job in helping keep your wrinkles   in check.</li>
            <li>But the main thing is that they work.</li>
            <li>After the first use while I saw softening immediately upon removal of the adhesive from my skin I will say that over time throughout the day my skin went back to normal.  </li>
            <li>see other manufacturers are finally discovering the magic with these adhesive patches;</li>
            <li>I have read the other reviews and said to myself &#x27;OK lets give a chance and try, even if it doesn&#x27;t work I would have spent not as much as I paid to those creams and else&#x27;.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t smoke I have a healthy diet, but there is little I can do about the big winkles.  </li>
            <li>so it pokes your skin, and so far, have not shown any results.</li>
            <li>I also have to make a conscious effort to remember not to frown during the day, too.</li>
            <li>I naturally, was also using anti wrinkle products in addition to these</li>
            <li>I am 68 years old with sun damage from my youth.  </li>
            <li>I was really surprised after just one use.  </li>
            <li>It does keep my frown flat and straight when I sleep.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely not recommend using them on a first, second or 30th date.  </li>
            <li>seeing that I developed them from over 15 years of suffering from migraines, but after one week they are barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li>You can actually feel how much smoother the winkle is after the first use, and after repeated uses the lines do look less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I used to wake up with a major frown line.</li>
            <li>I wonder if my co-workers have wondered why my face has been smooth as a babies bottom lately?</li>
            <li>So I look really young for my age, I wear sunscreen daily</li>
            <li>I was so surprised to see my facial lines had softened after just one use.  </li>

            <li> I totally thought I would have to use this product for at least 3-4 weeks as I read somewhere before.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am so impressed with Frownies!  They felt strange for about 2/3 nights, now I feel strange withOUT them on!  I highly recommend them for hachet&#x27;s between the brows especially, they honestly work!</li>
            <li> These things help keep your frown lines from getting deep and permanent. The aren&#x27;t botox but they do a decent job in helping keep your wrinkles   in check.</li>
            <li> The Frownie patches were sent to me as a gift. They are very uncomfortable to wear overnight, as recommended. The paper is stiff and hard at the edges so it pokes your skin, and so far, have not shown any results. There&#x27;s no way you can stretch your skin and think that a gluey paper will hold a wrinkle till it disappears. I can make my own wrinkle mask for a lot less money out of natural ingredients that is good for your skin.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Frownies pads for use on forehead and between brows.  Instead I got a half filled box of some kind of undereye gel pads.  Not what I wanted.  I&#x27;ve decided to keep them and use them but I ham very disappointed not to have gotten the frown pads.</li>
            <li> I am a botox user.  But it is VERY, VERy painful and i save it for extreme circumstances, if you will.  These frownies work.  Of course it is temporary, so it botox!  The thing I wanted to tell shoppers is I do not buy the frownies spritz  for them, I use clean tap water as it drips out of faucet.  Cheaper on Amazon than in store, in my experience. Be sure to stretch your face upward when you put them on!</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd box of frownies.  I love them.  And they work.     It might be a bit of an adjustment at first.  You will kind of resemble the invisible man with the bandages on when you apply them.  There might be a little tug on the skin directly around the frownies but this is a minor annoyance compared with the price of botox and restylane treatments. And these work just as well.     I would definitely not recommend using them on a first, second or 30th date.  This should be applied in a comfortable setting around someone who won&#x27;t freak out when you come out of the bathroom with flesh colored paper attached to your face.     But the main thing is that they work. Period. So you have to make the decision.</li>
            <li> THey do work and you have to use them every night. I have no problem sleeping with them on.</li>
            <li> It does keep my frown flat and straight when I sleep.  I use it over my regimen of moisturizer and is real easy to apply, stays put all night and it is helping with my deep frown :)</li>
            <li> I have a bad habit of frowning in my sleep and would always wake up with frown lines between my eyebrows. I use one of these on face between my eyebrows at night and it works great at keeping me from frowning in my sleep. Frown lines are greatly improved. I also have to make a conscious effort to remember not to frown during the day, too.</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t work for someone over 55.  A lot of money has gone in the garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer needs to be age specific about their products.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t very sure if these pads would work when I ordered them. I have read the other reviews and said to myself &#x27;OK lets give a chance and try, even if it doesn&#x27;t work I would have spent not as much as I paid to those creams and else&#x27;. And when I received it I tried it the first night, well because of being the first try I wasn&#x27;t experienced and had some difficulty in keeping that thing on my face. And I thought well 15 bucks for rubbish. But the other night when I tried again, I easily managed to stick it and it stayed till the morning and even more. And when I peeled it off I saw that the lines between the eyes were gone?! Now I am using it almost every night, and sometimes when I am home, and I am smiling to a face with no lines. I can suggest this to everyone. Try and see your face free of lines again.</li>
            <li> I thought those 11&#x27;s between my brows were here to stay..seeing that I developed them from over 15 years of suffering from migraines, but after one week they are barely noticeable.  I naturally, was also using anti wrinkle products in addition to these but before I got the FROWNIES here ( BTW best price on the web) I was using the anti wrinkle products alone &amp;  wasn&#x27;t seeing any results!  I&#x27;m so glad I leaned about these in one of my searches!</li>
            <li> This is one of those flights of fancy in which ladies imagine there is a magic that will restore their faces to what they used to be.  Never going to happen, but we can dream.</li>
            <li> i use these for my frown nightly.. also i get a headache from frowning at night.. they prevent my headaches and i have no frowns. i never had botox. these are better and cheaper than botox.</li>
            <li> So I look really young for my age, I wear sunscreen daily, I don&#x27;t smoke I have a healthy diet, but there is little I can do about the big winkles.  These little sticker things work.  They prevent you from creasing your brow when you are sleeping, and those 8 hours or so really help!  You can actually feel how much smoother the winkle is after the first use, and after repeated uses the lines do look less noticeable.  No toxin injected into your skin either!  Worth every penny, I love these things!</li>
            <li> Ok ... I was thumbing through a Vermont Country Store catalog, and found these things.  I thought they were a little steep for what they were, so I checked here on Amazon to see if they had them - yep .. and they were considerably less expensive as well.  I was skeptical at this point as to if they worked or not, but the reviews were positive.  They say you might not see results the first few times, but I did!  I use them overnight, and have been amazed at the results.  My wrinkles are not super deep ones, so that probably helps.  I wonder if my co-workers have wondered why my face has been smooth as a babies bottom lately? :)  They&#x27;re wondering ... botox?</li>
            <li> Frownies are a part of my age fighting arsenal! I have a tendency to frown in my sleep and wake up with a slight furrow between my brows; Frownies remedies this. Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I am 68 years old with sun damage from my youth.  I can see where Frownies has  helped even my tired skin.  It is not a facelift, but small changes are noticeable after about 3 weeks.  I will reorder, for sure.  I have my 50th high school reunion this year, and want to look good for that, so everything helps!!</li>
            <li> I love Frownies. I dont&#x27; find them difficult to apply or uncomfortable, and they definitely make the lines between my  eyes go away. One thing I&#x27;ve learned is that they don&#x27;t stick as well if I apply them right after I put on my nighttime moisturizer--just have to wait 10-15 min. Love them.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised after just one use.  I totally thought I would have to use this product for at least 3-4 weeks as I read somewhere before.  I was so surprised to see my facial lines had softened after just one use.  Since I wore them overnight I feel like it retrained my skin to lay more still and not wrinkle or move while I slept. After the first use while I saw softening immediately upon removal of the adhesive from my skin I will say that over time throughout the day my skin went back to normal.  I still have hope that after using them for 3-4 weeks that the results may last longer throughout the day.  I&#x27;m hoping anyway!!  Perhaps I&#x27;ll re-post with another review after that time.  I&#x27;m really happy with them and at 39 am happy to have found them before turning to botox!</li>
            <li> I frown when I sleep, not sure why. But the patch keeps my forehead wrinkle free. I&#x27;m 39 but people are shocked when I tell them my age because I&#x27;m wrinkle free. I love Frownies. I never sleep without it.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t botox (I&#x27;ve had it but will never get it again after it made me feel like I had the flu for the week I got the shots and the week it wore off-obviously the stuff goes into your body, not just your muscle). However, it works very well. I use it on a strong line between my brows. I used to wake up with a major frown line. Now, in the morning it&#x27;s gone. It still appears if I concentrate or frown during the day but its less pronounced being I start my day without it. I only need the smallest triangle so these will last me over 4 months. Definitely worth the money for a natural way to decrease the intensity of lines.</li>
            <li> They are a little uncomfortable, but when I remember to use them, they do seem to improve the frown lines between my eyes.</li>
            <li> Frownies do work; but, you need to be consistent with the product.  I did try the lip smoothers, but they just don&#x27;t stay on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see other manufacturers are finally discovering the magic with these adhesive patches; but, I&#x27;ll stay loyal to Frownies!</li>
            <li> They are uncomfortable to wear and just not for me.  I was not able to wear them as long as it says I needed to do so for results.  Perhaps others will have better luck.</li>
