            <li>I am so glad I got this!</li>
            <li>The ear covers (which were my favorite part!)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s at a great price point and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good quality, reuse able</li>
            <li>The ear covers are nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been highlighting my own hair using disposable highlighting caps since I was 16</li>
            <li>Everything came packaged nicely.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s held up nicely.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s kind of a hassle when you&#x27;re trying to color your own hair</li>
            <li>This item was sponsored to me by Bundle Monster in exchange for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>item was sponsored to me by Bundle Minster in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li>Super happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>and I am pleased, with the price and fast shiptment, thats awesome....</li>
            <li>Very useful, good quality</li>
            <li>Honestly, I was not expecting much on this one because the price was so great</li>
            <li>Awesome, very durable, the handle is super</li>
            <li>And if your doing highlights, a better cap.</li>
            <li>This set is FABULOUS!</li>
            <li>Always relied on a close friend or relative, and then I got this awesome product!</li>
            <li>Clips were a big plus and the travel bag makes it awesome to keep neat</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received better quality brushes from DIY hair kits I&#x27;ve bought at Duane Reade.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s definitely better out</li>
            <li>(like I was), but everything else in the kit is good quality and useful.</li>
            <li>glad i have it.</li>
            <li>It really was a great buy for the price.</li>
            <li>I love the bowls to mix my hair color in.</li>
            <li>but the cap snapped in many places while using the hook to pull the hair through.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>What more do you want?</li>
            <li>I have used this several times and works perfect.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this kit to use at home and love it, has everything I need for coloring my hair at home.</li>
            <li>favorite item is the comb/brush combo.</li>
            <li>Okay, so it&#x27;s time to touch up time-greyed hair.  </li>
            <li>My highlights turned out great and everything cleaned up well and is ready to reuse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with the results and the quality of all items.  </li>
            <li>The cape and cap are pretty good quality; I have no complaints about the brushes or bowls.  </li>
            <li>Even the cheap disposable caps where better than this .</li>
            <li>fit ok and did their job keeping the dye off my ears.  </li>
            <li>Every item in this package is good quality and very functional.  </li>
            <li>One of the clips broke right away, but probably of my own folly.</li>
            <li>This is an awesome kit that comes in a cute little bag.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need the ear covers because the cap covered them just fine</li>
            <li>Super excited!</li>
            <li>It made Huge holes in the cap that caused severe leakage .</li>
            <li>I bought this kit primarily for the highlighting cap; I saw everything else as an added plus.</li>
            <li>I would say that with exception to the ear covers, this is a great bundle especially for mixing and coloring hair.  </li>
            <li>The inside of the cap is totally smooth.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d enjoy this if my hair were any longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>silicone highlighting cap fit</li>
            <li>Awesome little bundle for the price!</li>
            <li>It is very convenient to have a comb and a brush all in one and very easy to rinse out after using it.</li>
            <li>I was excited to get this kit, but the cap does not have pre-made holes.</li>
            <li>The cap (which is why I bought this in the first place) is better than the one my stylist uses on my hair when she does it.</li>
            <li>A little short, but perfect if you&#x27;re doing your own hair.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I still can not believe after 30 years of coloring my own hair it took my young cousin having a coloring bib for me to figure out</li>
            <li>The rubber gloves where basic gloves and the clips didn&#x27;t work all that well ,but  the bowls where good quality and so where the brushes .</li>
            <li>The clips are weak, the brushes are good, the bowls are good, the ear things are stupid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only thing I would change is the length of the cape and add more of a sleeve for better coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was really excited to try this product mainly because it just looked like so much fun!  </li>
            <li>they partially refunded me &amp; I was able to get a good old plastic cap.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the cap is silicone which is nice</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use the white highlighting cap much, but it seems to be of good quality.</li>
            <li>So worth it.</li>
            <li>The clips and ear covers aren&#x27;t worth the space they take up but the dishes, cape and brushes have lasted me quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>extremely useful.</li>
            <li>Useful for what it does.</li>
            <li>I was looking for the right tools to use with coloring my hair and everything was in the kit.  </li>
            <li>Very nice little set, it makes the job a whole lot easier!</li>
            <li>and everything is pretty useful.</li>
            <li>The only thing was the gloves are very cheap and came stuck together and when trying&lt;br</li>
            <li>And it tends to slide off the top of your head, trying to conform back to shape.  </li>
            <li>It comes with so much stuff!</li>
            <li>:) Would definitely purchase again!!!!</li>
            <li>Absolutely 110% recommended!</li>
            <li>The cap ripped and tore up on the first use.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>but it is definitely higher quality.  </li>
            <li>This cape is actually the lighter nylon material on the top but has another layer of some type of rubberized material on the bottom.  </li>
            <li>guess the short version of this is that every piece of this package was well made and much more than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li>But, I found that if you just push the needle through at a bit of an angle, it works pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>This was my first time coloring and the brush helped in applying the color evenly.</li>
            <li>The gloves were good, but they tore after a few uses.</li>
            <li>Perfect kit Has EVERYTHING You need love the color its not super pink its like a mix of purple in the bowls and brush only thing</li>
            <li>This is a great kit The cap included to pull hair for highlights is , um, ridiculous.</li>
            <li>In good quality, not so expensive, love it!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;only $16</li>
            <li>Saves this busy mom time, saves me money, and gets the job done right!  </li>
            <li>other than that its a nice product and very durable.</li>
            <li>Pretty much every thing you need for at home hair coloring.</li>
            <li>I am so glad to get this, I was looking for something like this for a very long time now.</li>
            <li>Makes it so much easier to dye hair.</li>
            <li>Never have I ever had so much difficulty highlighting than I did when I used this cap.</li>
            <li>However, the hook is kickass; it&#x27;s made of metal and very sturdy.</li>
            <li>I really like everything in this kit except the cap.</li>
            <li>It worked really well at keeping the cap on my head.  </li>
            <li>I was very upset .</li>
            <li>That way you won&#x27;t miss&lt;br /&gt;any areas where you want to low light</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure if someone else had done it for me they wouldn&#x27;t have been as careful as to not making it hurt.</li>
            <li>It was so much easier and neater to color my hair with this kit.</li>
            <li>I also really like the two types of brushes to apply the hair color with.  </li>
            <li>I mean, I guess they&#x27;re good at what they do, but I never knew I needed them</li>
            <li>The cape is definitely reusable if you clean after use as well as the bowls, brushes and clips.  </li>
            <li>Just get some decent gloves if your wanting reusable.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this kit if you are mainly getting it for the cap</li>
            <li>the other tools also help greatly with controlling the mess and doing the hair correctly</li>
            <li>The cape is super short</li>
            <li>/ high light.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am glad it came with a little bag to put store everything when not in use.</li>
            <li>The gloves are thicker than normal, too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They are big enough to fit dumbo.</li>
            <li>If you are a serious do it yourself kind a gal</li>
            <li>I lost so much hair trying to get this off, I legitimately thought I would have bald spots when I finally got it off and checked the mirror.</li>
            <li>Other than that, everything else is pretty decent.</li>
            <li>The smock is not very big, but it&#x27;s still decent quality.</li>
            <li>High quality rubber for the cap especially.</li>
            <li>Its hard to find a good cap that will stay tight on the head.</li>
            <li>It fits up to extra large necks and goes almost to the waist in the back.</li>
            <li>this kit actually turned out to be a very helpful tool for adding highlights to human hair lace wigs.</li>
            <li>I have been coloring my hair home for ages and finally decided to purchase the tools instead of using an old t-shirt and a tooth brush!</li>
            <li>The pink ear covers stayed on even though they seem large, but I found them to be somewhat in the way</li>
            <li>Just use a comb to softly run the comb through it &amp; the loop would be slowly be pulled out to full length.&lt;br</li>
            <li>No more wearing an old bathrobe (and staining it), and placing the color exactly where I wanted it, with no scalp staining.</li>
            <li>The cap was a little bit large on me</li>
            <li>Cap ripped in three areas, one large rip which caused my hair to color unevenly.</li>

            <li> Very useful, good quality</li>
            <li> Honestly, I was not expecting much on this one because the price was so great</li>
            <li> Awesome, very durable, the handle is super</li>
            <li> And if your doing highlights, a better cap.</li>
            <li> This set is FABULOUS!</li>
            <li> Always relied on a close friend or relative, and then I got this awesome product!</li>
            <li> Clips were a big plus and the travel bag makes it awesome to keep neat</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received better quality brushes from DIY hair kits I&#x27;ve bought at Duane Reade.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s definitely better out</li>
            <li> (like I was), but everything else in the kit is good quality and useful.</li>
            <li> glad i have it.</li>
            <li> It really was a great buy for the price.</li>
            <li> I love the bowls to mix my hair color in.</li>
            <li> but the cap snapped in many places while using the hook to pull the hair through.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> What more do you want?</li>
            <li> I have used this several times and works perfect.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this kit to use at home and love it, has everything I need for coloring my hair at home.</li>
            <li> favorite item is the comb/brush combo.</li>
            <li> Okay, so it&#x27;s time to touch up time-greyed hair.  </li>
            <li> My highlights turned out great and everything cleaned up well and is ready to reuse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with the results and the quality of all items.  </li>
            <li> The cape and cap are pretty good quality; I have no complaints about the brushes or bowls.  </li>
            <li> Even the cheap disposable caps where better than this .</li>
            <li> fit ok and did their job keeping the dye off my ears.  </li>
            <li> Every item in this package is good quality and very functional.  </li>
            <li> One of the clips broke right away, but probably of my own folly.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome kit that comes in a cute little bag.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need the ear covers because the cap covered them just fine</li>
            <li> Super excited!</li>
            <li> It made Huge holes in the cap that caused severe leakage .</li>
            <li> I bought this kit primarily for the highlighting cap; I saw everything else as an added plus.</li>
            <li> I would say that with exception to the ear covers, this is a great bundle especially for mixing and coloring hair.  </li>
            <li> The inside of the cap is totally smooth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d enjoy this if my hair were any longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> silicone highlighting cap fit</li>
            <li> Awesome little bundle for the price!</li>
            <li> It is very convenient to have a comb and a brush all in one and very easy to rinse out after using it.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this kit, but the cap does not have pre-made holes.</li>
            <li> The cap (which is why I bought this in the first place) is better than the one my stylist uses on my hair when she does it.</li>
            <li> A little short, but perfect if you&#x27;re doing your own hair.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I still can not believe after 30 years of coloring my own hair it took my young cousin having a coloring bib for me to figure out</li>
            <li> The rubber gloves where basic gloves and the clips didn&#x27;t work all that well ,but  the bowls where good quality and so where the brushes .</li>
            <li> The clips are weak, the brushes are good, the bowls are good, the ear things are stupid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing I would change is the length of the cape and add more of a sleeve for better coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this product mainly because it just looked like so much fun!  </li>
            <li> they partially refunded me &amp; I was able to get a good old plastic cap.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the cap is silicone which is nice</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use the white highlighting cap much, but it seems to be of good quality.</li>
            <li> So worth it.</li>
            <li> The clips and ear covers aren&#x27;t worth the space they take up but the dishes, cape and brushes have lasted me quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> extremely useful.</li>
            <li> Useful for what it does.</li>
            <li> I was looking for the right tools to use with coloring my hair and everything was in the kit.  </li>
            <li> Very nice little set, it makes the job a whole lot easier!</li>
            <li> and everything is pretty useful.</li>
            <li> The only thing was the gloves are very cheap and came stuck together and when trying&lt;br</li>
            <li> And it tends to slide off the top of your head, trying to conform back to shape.  </li>
            <li> It comes with so much stuff!</li>
            <li> :) Would definitely purchase again!!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely 110% recommended!</li>
            <li> The cap ripped and tore up on the first use.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> but it is definitely higher quality.  </li>
            <li> This cape is actually the lighter nylon material on the top but has another layer of some type of rubberized material on the bottom.  </li>
            <li> guess the short version of this is that every piece of this package was well made and much more than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li> But, I found that if you just push the needle through at a bit of an angle, it works pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> This was my first time coloring and the brush helped in applying the color evenly.</li>
            <li> The gloves were good, but they tore after a few uses.</li>
            <li> Perfect kit Has EVERYTHING You need love the color its not super pink its like a mix of purple in the bowls and brush only thing</li>
            <li> This is a great kit The cap included to pull hair for highlights is , um, ridiculous.</li>
            <li> In good quality, not so expensive, love it!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;only $16</li>
            <li> Saves this busy mom time, saves me money, and gets the job done right!  </li>
            <li> other than that its a nice product and very durable.</li>
            <li> Pretty much every thing you need for at home hair coloring.</li>
            <li> I am so glad to get this, I was looking for something like this for a very long time now.</li>
            <li> Makes it so much easier to dye hair.</li>
            <li> Never have I ever had so much difficulty highlighting than I did when I used this cap.</li>
            <li> However, the hook is kickass; it&#x27;s made of metal and very sturdy.</li>
            <li> I really like everything in this kit except the cap.</li>
            <li> It worked really well at keeping the cap on my head.  </li>
            <li> I was very upset .</li>
            <li> That way you won&#x27;t miss&lt;br /&gt;any areas where you want to low light</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m sure if someone else had done it for me they wouldn&#x27;t have been as careful as to not making it hurt.</li>
            <li> It was so much easier and neater to color my hair with this kit.</li>
            <li> I also really like the two types of brushes to apply the hair color with.  </li>
            <li> I mean, I guess they&#x27;re good at what they do, but I never knew I needed them</li>
            <li> The cape is definitely reusable if you clean after use as well as the bowls, brushes and clips.  </li>
            <li> Just get some decent gloves if your wanting reusable.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this kit if you are mainly getting it for the cap</li>
            <li> the other tools also help greatly with controlling the mess and doing the hair correctly</li>
            <li> The cape is super short</li>
            <li> / high light.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am glad it came with a little bag to put store everything when not in use.</li>
            <li> The gloves are thicker than normal, too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They are big enough to fit dumbo.</li>
            <li> If you are a serious do it yourself kind a gal</li>
            <li> I lost so much hair trying to get this off, I legitimately thought I would have bald spots when I finally got it off and checked the mirror.</li>
            <li> Other than that, everything else is pretty decent.</li>
            <li> The smock is not very big, but it&#x27;s still decent quality.</li>
            <li> High quality rubber for the cap especially.</li>
            <li> Its hard to find a good cap that will stay tight on the head.</li>
            <li> It fits up to extra large necks and goes almost to the waist in the back.</li>
            <li> this kit actually turned out to be a very helpful tool for adding highlights to human hair lace wigs.</li>
            <li> I have been coloring my hair home for ages and finally decided to purchase the tools instead of using an old t-shirt and a tooth brush!</li>
            <li> The pink ear covers stayed on even though they seem large, but I found them to be somewhat in the way</li>
            <li> Just use a comb to softly run the comb through it &amp; the loop would be slowly be pulled out to full length.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more wearing an old bathrobe (and staining it), and placing the color exactly where I wanted it, with no scalp staining.</li>
            <li> The cap was a little bit large on me</li>
            <li> Cap ripped in three areas, one large rip which caused my hair to color unevenly.</li>
            <li> The products are not super high quality, but they get the job done.  </li>
            <li> Also, because the plastic of the cap is so thick, it can take a little bit more of a push on the little needle to get it through the holes.</li>
            <li> The cape isn&#x27;t as long as the beauty salon</li>
            <li> The kit comes with everything you need right down to ear covers to protect your skin from the hard to get off hair dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;m not crazy about is the hair clips, nothing wrong with them except they don&#x27;t grip hair as well as others I have used.</li>
            <li> Outside has little raised molded-in-circles around the holes.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> I have medium-thick hair and spent 30 minutes trying to get this cap out of my hair.</li>
            <li> I also think the brushes might not stand up to a salon volume use, so I would not purchase if I were going to use everyday, several days a week, etc.</li>
            <li> the ear covers do not fit they are too big</li>
            <li> My hair is real long, past the center of my back, and it takes time to do.  </li>
            <li> I bought this mainly for the frosting cap, but the material is so thick that the little hook tool does not penetrate.</li>
            <li> The gloves are single use black latex.</li>
            <li> My hair was a mess, I had to dye my hair and purchase a frosting kit from store.</li>
            <li> The gloves and clips are a little flimsy.  </li>
            <li> found the little raised circles around the holes serve a purpose when trying to do it</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have to hurt but takes a little time to figure it all out.</li>
            <li> Both Dye Brush and Twin Headed Brush were missing.</li>
            <li> Once everything is pulled through and you&#x27;re ready to jump in the shower to remove the dye, it&#x27;s impossible to get your hair out of the cap.</li>
            <li> The brush is a little thick and stiff but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> felt a little spoiled with this kit!</li>
            <li> and they were way to large to use and not be frustrated from them</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s made of a very unforgiving material that is painful to get on and off of the head.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if I got a defective one</li>
            <li> I was not thrilled about this product once I received it</li>
            <li> Unless your putting in on a person with a very small head and they can tolerate the yanking needed to pull the hairs though the latex cap that grips the hair under it..</li>
            <li> Those two things made it so I didn&#x27;t have to dirty any other combs or hair accessories.</li>
            <li> Its very thick latex.</li>
            <li> I also like the included clips, my hair is very thick and has to be pulled up in layers.</li>
            <li> annoyed..</li>
            <li> The silicone cap that&#x27;s included in the kit makes your hair nightmarishly static-y making it extremely difficult to pull strands of hair through each hole.</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> Holes were difficult to puncture in the cap.  </li>
            <li> the cap was VERY poor quality .</li>
            <li> the material of gloves is too bad</li>
            <li> The ear covers are worthless.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used everything in the yet but everything I have used it of good quality. The only thing I&#x27;m not crazy about is the hair clips, nothing wrong with them except they don&#x27;t grip hair as well as others I have used.</li>
            <li> I order this kit only for the cap. Its hard to find a good cap that will stay tight on the head. Everything in this kit I have used .Very good quality.</li>
            <li> Good quality, reuse able</li>
            <li> Love it! I have been coloring my hair home for ages and finally decided to purchase the tools instead of using an old t-shirt and a tooth brush! Took me a while! If you are some one like me who does her hair home don&#x27;t wait like I did!!! Very good quality …I would definitely recommend!!&lt;br /&gt;On the picture it looks like the bowls are different size….they are the same!</li>
            <li> Works great and is of good quality.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this kit, but the cap does not have pre-made holes. You&#x27;ll have to spend 45 mins making holes. Other than that, everything else is pretty decent.</li>
            <li> It is very good, the quality is excellent. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the cap is silicone which is nice but the holes are not pre poked for you, so I had to take a toothpick and pre poke the holes myself. other than that its a nice product and very durable.</li>
            <li> This is a great kit The cap included to pull hair for highlights is , um, ridiculous. Its very thick latex. You could use it for a vegetable drainer bowl. There is no way to get it on someones head then pull the hair through the sticky latex holes. Unless your putting in on a person with a very small head and they can tolerate the yanking needed to pull the hairs though the latex cap that grips the hair under it.. And it tends to slide off the top of your head, trying to conform back to shape.  The ear covers are nice. I had to glue them on with eyelash adhesive. They are big enough to fit dumbo. The gloves are single use black latex. Its a disadvantage in my mind. You cant see if color is still on the gloves before you grab something. But, for the price it was wonderful. very nice bowls, brushes, clips and the cape is really good quality and washable. It fits up to extra large necks and goes almost to the waist in the back. The front overlaps well and covers the front quite a bit. It has Velcro closure and a rubber underlining. KEEPER!! Just get some decent gloves if your wanting reusable. And if your doing highlights, a better cap.</li>
            <li> Very useful, good quality</li>
            <li> I am so glad I bought this!  While I don&#x27;t use all the products in set, it&#x27;s definitely a good one to have. The mixing bowls and brush applicators are perfect!  And I definitely use the body wrap. The pink ear covers stayed on even though they seem large, but I found them to be somewhat in the way and I preferred to just pre-treat my ears with an oil to avoid staining them with hair dye. The gloves were good, but they tore after a few uses. I didn&#x27;t use the white highlighting cap much, but it seems to be of good quality. The hair clasps weren&#x27;t that great--they pulled my hair and I preferred to just not use them.</li>
            <li> This set is FABULOUS! Well worth the $15!!!! I couldn&#x27;t have purchased a better set!!! It comes with so much stuff! So worth it. Very pleased!!! :) Would definitely purchase again!!!! Absolutely 110% recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been the DIY for hair dye. Always relied on a close friend or relative, and then I got this awesome product! I love it! Makes it so much easier to dye hair. Would recommend!</li>
            <li> Ear things too big just fall off so I don&#x27;t bother  using it . Clips were a big plus and the travel bag makes it awesome to keep neat</li>
            <li> Great set for the price!</li>
            <li> I bought this kit primarily for the highlighting cap; I saw everything else as an added plus. I&#x27;ve been highlighting my own hair using disposable highlighting caps since I was 16 (I&#x27;m 21 now). Never have I ever had so much difficulty highlighting than I did when I used this cap. The silicone cap that&#x27;s included in the kit makes your hair nightmarishly static-y making it extremely difficult to pull strands of hair through each hole. Once everything is pulled through and you&#x27;re ready to jump in the shower to remove the dye, it&#x27;s impossible to get your hair out of the cap. I have medium-thick hair and spent 30 minutes trying to get this cap out of my hair. I felt like Samus trying to rip a metroid of her head. I lost so much hair trying to get this off, I legitimately thought I would have bald spots when I finally got it off and checked the mirror. Beyond this, the cap claims to close up the holes you made it (like it can heal itself or something) . . . obviously it doesn&#x27;t. Considering I bought this for the cap, I&#x27;m giving this one star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the cap, here&#x27;s the rest of my commentary:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Stackable Mixing Bowls: Awesome, very durable, the handle is super convenient.&lt;br /&gt;- Dye Brush/Twin Headed Brush: Not the greatest. I&#x27;ve received better quality brushes from DIY hair kits I&#x27;ve bought at Duane Reade.&lt;br /&gt;- Duckbill Hair Clips: Not the greatest at gripping hair, but satisfactory. There&#x27;s definitely better out there.&lt;br /&gt;- Silicone Ear Cover Protectors: What? I mean, I guess they&#x27;re good at what they do, but I never knew I needed them and I still don&#x27;t think I do.&lt;br /&gt;- Latex Gloves: My fingers split the tips the instant I went to put them on. Use your own.&lt;br /&gt;- Shoulder Cape: Surprisingly good quality! A little short, but perfect if you&#x27;re doing your own hair.&lt;br /&gt;- Highlighting Cap with Hook: As stated earlier, the cap is God-awful. However, the hook is kickass; it&#x27;s made of metal and very sturdy. I&#x27;ll be using it with every disposablehighlighting cap I use in the future.kit</li>
            <li> I really like everything in this kit except the cap. The cap split after using it once. Everything came packaged nicely. and everything is pretty useful. The smock is not very big, but it&#x27;s still decent quality. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this kit if you are mainly getting it for the cap (like I was), but everything else in the kit is good quality and useful.</li>
            <li> Cap ripped in three areas, one large rip which caused my hair to color unevenly. My hair was a mess, I had to dye my hair and purchase a frosting kit from store. Everything else was good. I am sure you will understand just why I was a tad! annoyed..</li>
            <li> I still can not believe after 30 years of coloring my own hair it took my young cousin having a coloring bib for me to figure out I should get one the other tools also help greatly with controlling the mess and doing the hair correctly</li>
            <li> I am so glad to get this, I was looking for something like this for a very long time now.</li>
            <li> The cap ripped and tore up on the first use. I had to throw it away. The bowls and combs are great. I wish I had ordered just those items and saved myself the money.</li>
            <li> I let my girl friend use it, she like it!</li>
            <li> I recently ordered this kit and thought would use on this weekend. Both Dye Brush and Twin Headed Brush were missing.</li>
            <li> The products are not super high quality, but they get the job done.  The cape and cap are pretty good quality; I have no complaints about the brushes or bowls.  The gloves and clips are a little flimsy.  The ear covers are worthless.  I think is a good value.  I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> Really good purchase... happy i did buy this kit,even if it&#x27;s not for coloring,glad i have it.</li>
            <li> Great product! Fast shipping! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I purchased this because of the varying items which I needed.  I would say that with exception to the ear covers, this is a great bundle especially for mixing and coloring hair.  My hair is real long, past the center of my back, and it takes time to do.  The cape is definitely reusable if you clean after use as well as the bowls, brushes and clips.  I did not use the gloves but I think you could get several uses out of them, if cleaned after using.  I did not give this four stars because I did not think the ear covers were a necessity and they were way to large to use and not be frustrated from them continually falling off.  I also think the brushes might not stand up to a salon volume use, so I would not purchase if I were going to use everyday, several days a week, etc.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome kit that comes in a cute little bag. Great price, good quality items.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed and perfect price. The clips and ear covers aren&#x27;t worth the space they take up but the dishes, cape and brushes have lasted me quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;I throw the cape in the wash and it&#x27;s held up nicely.</li>
            <li> awesome kit. extremely useful. every item is of great quality! the only thing i didn&#x27;t use was the cap. even without using a cap, this was a great deal in my opinion.</li>
            <li> You know what...this kit actually turned out to be a very helpful tool for adding highlights to human hair lace wigs. With the wig  supported on a mannequin head with T-pins, I placed the rubber cap on top of the wig (like a cap), randomly selected the circles where I wanted the highlights, and used the included needled to puncture cap &amp; pull hair through. I used used the brushes to dye all of the hair pulled out of the holes. Rinse with the cap still on &amp; PERFECT!  It really was a great buy for the price. I have used it on my head too.</li>
            <li> The ear covers are my favorite!! One of the clips broke right away, but probably of my own folly. All of these things work great. Super happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> now I have everything I need for my hair.. I used the set twice.. easy to wash, I love it!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good and love it!.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly good quality.</li>
            <li> I love the bowls to mix my hair color in. The brush is a little thick and stiff but it gets the job done. The cape is super short so it&#x27;s kind of a hassle when you&#x27;re trying to color your own hair so I don&#x27;t use it on myself.</li>
            <li> the material of gloves is too bad</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t always use all of the items, but the cap and bowl are the best.</li>
            <li> In good quality, not so expensive, love it!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;only $16 and I got everything I want. good good good good</li>
            <li> Honestly, I was not expecting much on this one because the price was so great but I was wrong.  Every item in this package is good quality and very functional.  The cap (which is why I bought this in the first place) is better than the one my stylist uses on my hair when she does it. The cape isn&#x27;t as long as the beauty salon but it is definitely higher quality.  This cape is actually the lighter nylon material on the top but has another layer of some type of rubberized material on the bottom.  So, it won&#x27;t ever rip.  The gloves are thicker than normal, too.&lt;br /&gt;I guess the short version of this is that every piece of this package was well made and much more than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;Some notes:  The cap was a little bit large on me and I have quite a bit of hair. I used one of those elastic pieces that you can put on the corners of your mattress cover to hold it in place.  It worked really well at keeping the cap on my head.  Also, because the plastic of the cap is so thick, it can take a little bit more of a push on the little needle to get it through the holes. But, I found that if you just push the needle through at a bit of an angle, it works pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I feel like this was a great deal!</li>
            <li> Great, tried it once already and I am pleased, with the price and fast shiptment, thats awesome....</li>
            <li> Pretty much every thing you need for at home hair coloring. Awesome!</li>
            <li> Perfect kit Has EVERYTHING You need love the color its not super pink its like a mix of purple in the bowls and brush only thing the ear covers do not fit they are too big</li>
            <li> I bought this mainly for the frosting cap, but the material is so thick that the little hook tool does not penetrate. The clips are weak, the brushes are good, the bowls are good, the ear things are stupid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not use the cape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say you get what you pay for. I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I was not thrilled about this product once I received it the cap was VERY poor quality . I am not sure if I got a defective one but the cap snapped in many places while using the hook to pull the hair through. It made Huge holes in the cap that caused severe leakage . I was very upset . I have used rubber caps before and never had this problem. Even the cheap disposable caps where better than this . The rubber gloves where basic gloves and the clips didn&#x27;t work all that well ,but  the bowls where good quality and so where the brushes . The cape is also helpful in protecting your clothes and skin.</li>
            <li> Very nice little set, it makes the job a whole lot easier!</li>
            <li> Awesome little bundle for the price! Came in a timely manner! ! Super excited!</li>
            <li> EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO DYE YOUR HAIR! Except the dye itself. I am so glad I got this! Great Quality and its everything you need all in a convenient button up bag.</li>
            <li> High quality rubber for the cap especially. The inside of the cap is totally smooth. Outside has little raised molded-in-circles around the holes.&lt;br /&gt;Well, the holes need poking to make them holes. I used an ice pick &amp; poked all of them.&lt;br /&gt;I found the little raised circles around the holes serve a purpose when trying to do it myself.&lt;br /&gt;As you work around your head You can use your fingers to find the holes that do not have hair pulled through yet. That way you won&#x27;t miss&lt;br /&gt;any areas where you want to low light / high light.&lt;br /&gt;My longest hairs were about 3 1/2 inches. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d enjoy this if my hair were any longer.&lt;br /&gt; It hurts when pulling it through. I found a good system was when sometimes loops were created &amp; wouldn&#x27;t pull all the way out. Just use a comb to softly run the comb through it &amp; the loop would be slowly be pulled out to full length.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure if someone else had done it for me they wouldn&#x27;t have been as careful as to not making it hurt. It doesn&#x27;t have to hurt but takes a little time to figure it all out. I didn&#x27;t need the ear covers because the cap covered them just fine</li>
            <li> This kit was so helpful.</li>
            <li> Love it. Great price! If you are a serious do it yourself kind a gal this has everything you need! The color brush is great!</li>
            <li> Arrived as described. Useful for what it does. What more do you want?</li>
            <li> I have used this several times and works perfect.  Has plenty of everything needed to do&lt;br /&gt;all your coloring.  The only thing was the gloves are very cheap and came stuck together and when trying&lt;br /&gt;to pull them apart ripped so they were unusable.  Even that was not a problem as you can get those very&lt;br /&gt;cheap any where.</li>
            <li> It was so much easier and neater to color my hair with this kit. No more wearing an old bathrobe (and staining it), and placing the color exactly where I wanted it, with no scalp staining. Good, reusable tools.&lt;br /&gt;C</li>
            <li> I was looking for the right tools to use with coloring my hair and everything was in the kit.  This was my first time coloring and the brush helped in applying the color evenly.</li>
            <li> My only issue would be the cap used for highlights...it&#x27;s made of a very unforgiving material that is painful to get on and off of the head.  My daughter was in tears and we never got it fully on her head.  Love everything else in the kit though :D</li>
            <li> some are of low quality</li>
            <li> The kit had everything I needed and it was all good quality. It was also at a great price for what you get.</li>
            <li> I purchased this kit to use at home and love it, has everything I need for coloring my hair at home.</li>
            <li> Holes were difficult to puncture in the cap.  Tore in several spots.</li>
            <li> This item was sponsored to me by Bundle Monster in exchange for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt a little spoiled with this kit! Only thing I had to buy to go with this kit was the hair color. I used everything except for the highlight cap and the ear guards which would be best to use together. These two items however, would be great to use on my kids hair and I look forward to trying them out soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite item is the comb/brush combo. It is very convenient to have a comb and a brush all in one and very easy to rinse out after using it. I also like the included clips, my hair is very thick and has to be pulled up in layers. Those two things made it so I didn&#x27;t have to dirty any other combs or hair accessories. I am glad it came with a little bag to put store everything when not in use. The only thing I would change is the length of the cape and add more of a sleeve for better coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very happy with this kit and will use it again!</li>
            <li> Okay, so it&#x27;s time to touch up time-greyed hair.  The BMC Hair-Dye Coloring DIY Salon Tools Kit provides everything I need to do the needful by myself.  Saves this busy mom time, saves me money, and gets the job done right!  Recommended.</li>
            <li> everything is good, except the cap. it does not work and started ripping as soon as i started to make holes in it with the hook. but amazon took care of the issue for me. they partially refunded me &amp; I was able to get a good old plastic cap.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this product mainly because it just looked like so much fun!  The kit comes with everything you need right down to ear covers to protect your skin from the hard to get off hair dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The silicone highlighting cap fit well and I didn&#x27;t have any issues pulling my hair through the pre designated holes with the hook.  The ear covers (which were my favorite part!) fit ok and did their job keeping the dye off my ears.  I also really like the two types of brushes to apply the hair color with.  My highlights turned out great and everything cleaned up well and is ready to reuse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with the results and the quality of all items.  It&#x27;s at a great price point and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item was sponsored to me by Bundle Minster in exchange for my honest review.</li>
