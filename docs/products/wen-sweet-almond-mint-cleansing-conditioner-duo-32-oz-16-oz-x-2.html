            <li>32 oz for 40 bucks... haven&#x27;t been able to find that on here.</li>
            <li>Definitely my favorite fragrance of Wen.  </li>
            <li>I love this cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li>This is meant for women/men that want naturally healthy hair.</li>
            <li>and I get remarks about my healthy shiny hair.</li>
            <li>and I still love it.</li>
            <li>fragrance is pleasant and there is a large variety to choose from.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Much better price than on the original web site.</li>
            <li>Easy to take camping...  </li>
            <li>My hair feels really smooth again.  </li>
            <li>the pumps don&#x27;t fit or work.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to say it is an easy product to use, but if you use it right, it does work!</li>
            <li>(Tressemme moisture rich conditioner)</li>
            <li>First of all, I love the product itself.</li>
            <li>( no billowing sudsy affect as I &#x27;clean&#x27; my hair..</li>
            <li>With Wen I can go 2-3 days in between and my hair still looks clean.</li>
            <li>I ordered sweet almond mint but received  Pomegranata instead.</li>
            <li>I love this product so much.  </li>
            <li>then normal makes my hair very shiny and styles nice.</li>
            <li>I love using when on my natural curly hair.</li>
            <li>Make sure you wash the product out completely.</li>
            <li>Hence this product not being &amp;#34;hassle free&amp;#34; (the results are totally worth it though).</li>
            <li>This is a poor at best knock off.  </li>
            <li>I tried for 2-3 months to find the right combination of products (cleansing conditioner, styling cream, texture balm, etc.)</li>
            <li>I washed mine every other day at first and then was able to get good results with washing every third day.</li>
            <li>I like this very much</li>
            <li>Massage your scalp very gently to remove scalp oil and sweat.</li>
            <li>Perfect for keeping your naturally curly hair straight after you straighten it with a flat iron, especially in the summer.</li>
            <li>First I wash my hair with a shampoo , then I use this product.</li>
            <li>so the style doesn&#x27;t last for more than an hour</li>
            <li>Talk about clean, soft, manageable hair!  </li>
            <li>I have used shampoo for so long that the lack of suds is odd, but, WOW, this is wonderful!!!!  </li>
            <li>At first you may feel as though your hair doesn&#x27;t feel as it normally does after shampooing and conditioning but hang in there!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really see a difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair much healthier.  </li>
            <li>Use lukewarm water and gently work through strands of hair.</li>
            <li>Within 1 week, everyone was telling me how much thicker my hair looked.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product &amp; the company that sells it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Immediately after rinsing, my curly hair would tangle more did not feel as soft and supple as when I used a regular conditioner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better results with this product than any other.</li>
            <li>When I had ordered it originally I received it from the Wen website and the labeling and packaging was different.</li>
            <li>i would highly recommend it to my family and friends.</li>
            <li>she advises that my &amp;#60; gently dyed :&amp;#62; hair maintains its color and is in good condition.. due to a combination of &#x27;coloring products&#x27; she uses every month and a half AND</li>
            <li>have naturally curly hair and this made me very frizzy.</li>
            <li>Expensive but great for your hair.</li>
            <li>Everyone wants to borrow it because it makes your hair sssoooo soft.</li>
            <li>I have a slight curl in my hair, so cleansing conditioner leaves hair silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>I have a sensitive scalp, and WEN has improved this condition.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll order directly from mfg</li>
            <li>My hair ends up too soft</li>
            <li>I just love this cleansing conditioner and it has certainly made a dramatic difference to my hair.  </li>
            <li>However, one small point to mention is that in the shipping I only received one pump for two bottles - surely there should have been one for each bottle as shown on the picture.</li>
            <li>This product has made my hair extra shinny and soft.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product thinking that it would be the same as what I order directly from Wen.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The bottles did not travel well and made a large mess in my bags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has made all the difference on my fine, thin hair.</li>

            <li> Also, I&#x27;ve found that I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair near as often as I did when I used other products.</li>
            <li> only needed to use a single product in the shower, not a shampoo + conditioner</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time and stilll do if that tells anything.</li>
            <li> but then again I have really long hair)</li>
            <li> I have a very curly thick hair.</li>
            <li> It works really well for my long, thick, wavy, dry and damaged hair.</li>
            <li> My only complaints are 1.)I have to be very careful about buying it...</li>
            <li> I have a dry scalp issue.</li>
            <li> B0024NPAAQ TRESemme Shampoo and Conditioner for Dry or Damaged Hair</li>
            <li> Pat dry and don&#x27;t gunk your hair up with root lift, styling products and sprays.</li>
            <li> This &#x27;Cleansing Conditioner&#x27; is THE single product I&#x27;ve used for over 6 years .. and that has served as both shampoo &amp;#60; cleaner &amp;#62; and&lt;br /&gt;conditioner</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty expensive product and you have to use a TON of it each use, so the bottle doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> When you get down to about 1/3 of the bottle left you cant get the product out with the pump.</li>
            <li> For those that think it is instant, it is not magical especially for people that use anything chemical on their hair for years.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use these products since I have only been using them for a few months.</li>
            <li> Always use wide tooth comb when hair is wet.</li>
            <li> Wet your hair and pump out some of the Wen.  </li>
            <li> Usually, I have to wash my hair every other day because by the second day, my scalp is itchy and flaky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this was the actual Wen by Chaz Dean.</li>
            <li> (The average person uses 10-20 pumps per cleansing I believe)</li>
            <li> I would wash my hair about every other day and it still lasted less than half the time.</li>
            <li> You have to take the pump off, turn it upside down and beat it out.</li>
            <li> This shampoo made my hair much less frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have been using Wen for a few years and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> Slick it through your hair, working it down to your scalp</li>
            <li> because I&#x27;ve read a lot of other reviews stating that people were signed up for auto delivery and charged monthly without realizing it and it was difficult to correct and near impossible to get a refund(not my personal experience, as I knew from reading other reviews that when i purchased to check for that) and that there may be some knock offs being sold 2.</li>
            <li> My sister gave me a small bottle for Easter one year</li>
            <li> My husband got it for me this past xmas</li>
            <li> Rinse it out and re-apply, this time leave it in for a few minutes!  </li>
            <li> Things I disliked about the product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terribly expensive.</li>
            <li> /&gt;***Do NOT buy this product from the infomercials!!&lt;br /&gt;Their high-pressure phone sales tactics are horrible and I was charged for $210 of extra product that I DID NOT ORDER.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thin and did not even need the recommended amount of pumps they specify in the booklet</li>
            <li> Do not like it as well and was disappointed that my order was wrong!</li>
            <li> Defective and very disappointed.  </li>

            <li> I ordered sweet almond mint but received  Pomegranata instead. Do not like it as well and was disappointed that my order was wrong!</li>
            <li> I like this very much it keeps my dye in longer then normal makes my hair very shiny and styles nice.I would definitely suggest item to my friends.</li>
            <li> I just love this cleansing conditioner and it has certainly made a dramatic difference to my hair.  Its a keeper.  However, one small point to mention is that in the shipping I only received one pump for two bottles - surely there should have been one for each bottle as shown on the picture.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much.  My hair feels really smooth again.  Also, my hair no longer feels oily!!!!  This is a really great product!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Its okay.  Does not lather.  Didn&#x27;t really see a difference in my hair.  It cleans your hair but I did not notice a shine in my hair.  Will not buy again</li>
            <li> I think the Wen products are good and it has made my hair feel lighter and healthier but it has not grown my hair back in the areas that are thinning. I will continue to use these products since I have only been using them for a few months.</li>
            <li> I love using when on my natural curly hair. I use it just as stated and could not be happier with the results. Just love, love, love this.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair much healthier.  Have been using for some time. Great value. Lasts a long time.  Try it. You will like it.</li>
            <li> Best product for my daughter&#x27;s super curly hair!</li>
            <li> I have used WEN for two years. It is the best hair care product I have used! I have a sensitive scalp, and WEN has improved this condition. Thank you!</li>
            <li> LADIES (and gentlemen?) This product is no gimmick. I was skeptical from the mixed reviews I saw here, but I am so glad I gave it a shot. I&#x27;m not going to say it is an easy product to use, but if you use it right, it does work! I have a dry scalp issue. Usually, I have to wash my hair every other day because by the second day, my scalp is itchy and flaky. Honestly, I have now go 3 days without washing my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE KEY: Make sure you wash the product out completely. If you think you have washed it all out...rinse some more. Hence this product not being &amp;#34;hassle free&amp;#34; (the results are totally worth it though).</li>
            <li> I love this product. My sister gave me a small bottle for Easter one year and I just fell in love with the way it works with my hair. It cleans and conditions the hair. My hair has never felt so good!</li>
            <li> Much better price than on the original web site. This shampoo made my hair much less frizzy. I love it. Need to buy more already. At first you may feel as though your hair doesn&#x27;t feel as it normally does after shampooing and conditioning but hang in there! The trick is not to wash your hair every day. I washed mine every other day at first and then was able to get good results with washing every third day. Perfect for keeping your naturally curly hair straight after you straighten it with a flat iron, especially in the summer.</li>
            <li> fat srvice...great product</li>
            <li> Defective and very disappointed.  the pumps don&#x27;t fit or work.  I&#x27;ll order directly from mfg so I can get replacements or refunds  - the savings will not compensate for how I will have to use this product.</li>
            <li> Love Wen.  Been using it for years.</li>
            <li> This &#x27;Cleansing Conditioner&#x27; is THE single product I&#x27;ve used for over 6 years .. and that has served as both shampoo &amp;#60; cleaner &amp;#62; and&lt;br /&gt;conditioner for my hair.  I visit my  terrific hairdresser every six/seven weeks.. she advises that my &amp;#60; gently dyed :&amp;#62; hair maintains its color and is in good condition.. due to a combination of &#x27;coloring products&#x27; she uses every month and a half AND the Wen Cleansing&lt;br /&gt;Conditioner I use about twice a week to &#x27;shampoo&#x27;** my hair.  ( no billowing sudsy affect as I &#x27;clean&#x27; my hair.. I follow label instructions&lt;br /&gt;.. and have found terrific results for over ten years.</li>
            <li> I have a slight curl in my hair, so cleansing conditioner leaves hair silky smooth.  I love the smell</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time and stilll do if that tells anything. If you expect instant results -don&#x27;t. It requires time and constant use. For some, like me, it is 4-6 weeks to see results. For those that think it is instant, it is not magical especially for people that use anything chemical on their hair for years.</li>
            <li> Things I disliked about the product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terribly expensive. I&#x27;ve had better results from a store-bought conditioner costing $4 (Tressemme moisture rich conditioner) similar to:[[ASIN:B0024NPAAQ TRESemme Shampoo and Conditioner for Dry or Damaged Hair 2/44 oz]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally curly hair and this made me very frizzy. It did not work well at all as a leave-in conditioner after showering. I tried for 2-3 months to find the right combination of products (cleansing conditioner, styling cream, texture balm, etc.) but in the end I went back to Infusium [[ASIN:B0019RKS5K Infusium 23 (Frizz)ologie Leave-In Treatment, Step 3, 16 oz.]] and a bit of gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The estimate of a \\&quot;30 day supply\\&quot; is a joke. I would wash my hair about every other day and it still lasted less than half the time. My hair is very thin and did not even need the recommended amount of pumps they specify in the booklet but I was though a 16oz bottle in under 14 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immediately after rinsing, my curly hair would tangle more did not feel as soft and supple as when I used a regular conditioner. It just didn&#x27;t leave that conditioned &#x27;feel&#x27; that I love for my hair to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottles did not travel well and made a large mess in my bags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I enjoyed about the product:&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is pleasant and there is a large variety to choose from.&lt;br /&gt;I only needed to use a single product in the shower, not a shampoo + conditioner so it was somewhat convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Do NOT buy this product from the infomercials!!&lt;br /&gt;Their high-pressure phone sales tactics are horrible and I was charged for $210 of extra product that I DID NOT ORDER.</li>
            <li> First of all, I love the product itself. My husband got it for me this past xmas and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since. It works really well for my long, thick, wavy, dry and damaged hair. I&#x27;ve had better results with this product than any other. It&#x27;s balanced my hair and stopped it from breaking off after it was over processed. Also, I&#x27;ve found that I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair near as often as I did when I used other products. With Wen I can go 2-3 days in between and my hair still looks clean. My only complaints are 1.)I have to be very careful about buying it... because I&#x27;ve read a lot of other reviews stating that people were signed up for auto delivery and charged monthly without realizing it and it was difficult to correct and near impossible to get a refund(not my personal experience, as I knew from reading other reviews that when i purchased to check for that) and that there may be some knock offs being sold 2.) It&#x27;s a pretty expensive product and you have to use a TON of it each use, so the bottle doesn&#x27;t last long. (The average person uses 10-20 pumps per cleansing I believe) 3.)The process of applying it to my hair and brushing through all of it before rinsing takes quite a while(approximately 15 minutes, but then again I have really long hair) and I have to do this every time I use it. 4.) When you get down to about 1/3 of the bottle left you cant get the product out with the pump. You have to take the pump off, turn it upside down and beat it out. Pain in the ---. Look around before you buy it and see if you can get it cheaper from another website. I just got a duo 16 oz pack of tea tree and almond mint cleansing conditioner for 40 from QVC. 32 oz for 40 bucks... haven&#x27;t been able to find that on here.</li>
            <li> Definitely my favorite fragrance of Wen.  I have been using Wen for about a year and can&#x27;t imagine going back to traditional shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have been using Wen for a few years and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. It has made all the difference on my fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m now a fan and will be using it from now on. i would highly recommend it to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> Very very good ia a wen girl iam using it for three years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this was the actual Wen by Chaz Dean. The label was different and didn&#x27;t include Chaz Dean&#x27;s name. When I had ordered it originally I received it from the Wen website and the labeling and packaging was different. The scent  of the product also seemed off and it didn&#x27;t work as well. Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> I love this cleansing conditioner. You are meant to treat your hair like priceless silk strands. Use lukewarm water and gently work through strands of hair. Massage your scalp very gently to remove scalp oil and sweat. Pat dry and don&#x27;t gunk your hair up with root lift, styling products and sprays. This is meant for women/men that want naturally healthy hair.Always use wide tooth comb when hair is wet. That is when your hair is fragile. And NO my hair didn&#x27;t come out. Your hair IS priceless and I get remarks about my healthy shiny hair. I&#x27;m a Wen user for life.</li>
            <li> This product has made my hair extra shinny and soft. I have a very curly thick hair. Although it says cleansing conditioner, I use it only as a conditioner. First I wash my hair with a shampoo , then I use this product. I have been using it over a year now.</li>
            <li> Expensive but great for your hair. I have been using Wen shampoo for just over a year and I still love it. Within 1 week, everyone was telling me how much thicker my hair looked. I give out samples so everyone can see for themselves.</li>
            <li> Great price, great arrival time, &amp; great product! I would highly recommend this product &amp; the company that sells it!</li>
            <li> Best product for your hair.......!!!!</li>
            <li> Easy to take camping...  Everyone wants to borrow it because it makes your hair sssoooo soft.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product thinking that it would be the same as what I order directly from Wen.  NOT!  This is a poor at best knock off.  I&#x27;ve used WEN for over 3 years and I can tell by the way my hair responds that they have tried to match the formula but have fallen short.  My hair ends up too soft so the style doesn&#x27;t last for more than an hour and then my hair goes flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone looking for a deal on Wen.  It just doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> My only wish is that it came with 2 pumps.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE THIS STUFF!  I have used shampoo for so long that the lack of suds is odd, but, WOW, this is wonderful!!!!  Talk about clean, soft, manageable hair!  And it makes your hair grow, I swear it does!  This is all you use, one bottle of conditioner.  Wet your hair and pump out some of the Wen.  Slick it through your hair, working it down to your scalp, I use a comb in the shower.  Rinse it out and re-apply, this time leave it in for a few minutes!  The results are incredible!  I will never use shampoo again!</li>
