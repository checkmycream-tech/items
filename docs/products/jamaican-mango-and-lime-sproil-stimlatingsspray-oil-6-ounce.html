            <li>I am at half a bottle left, but will be buying more!</li>
            <li>I was letting my new growth come in so that when I cut them off I could rock a medium afro.  </li>
            <li>I think with the new leave in mix</li>
            <li>ISLAND OIL is not as intense as the Sproil spray, but it&#x27;s also a good product if you don&#x27;t have a problem with dry, dull hair.  </li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>and my hair shines and becomes really soft.</li>
            <li>I am currently out of country and cannot tend to my hair like I normally do.  </li>
            <li>I use it almost everyday but don&#x27;t really have to spray much</li>
            <li>My 18 year old sun used this and broke out all on the back of his neck</li>
            <li>Smells good, tingles the scalp, moisturizes and it does make hair grow loke crazy.</li>

            <li> realize I sound like an info-mercial, or maybe a fake, paid-for product reviewer.  </li>
            <li> My scalp is no longer dry looking and it feels stronger.</li>
            <li> Sad but true..</li>
            <li> I currently pour a little into my leave in mix.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad this product can&#x27;t be found in most stores.</li>
            <li> it feels like it&#x27;s working other than bs nozzle tube</li>
            <li> like I thought it would but other than that it does what its supposed to do</li>
            <li> They were hard and scratchy to the point where I had to tie them up just to keep them from scratching my back.  </li>
            <li> applied the Sproil spray one morning after using one of the JML conditioners on the previous night.  </li>
            <li> wish they can bring price down a little still must buy</li>
            <li> As a result, my locs were beginning to look dry and dull.  </li>
            <li> only complaint is the bottle is relatively small.</li>
            <li> It tingles for a little bit after being sprayed on scalp.</li>
            <li> I have dreadlocks that are past my shoulders</li>
            <li> I never thought my hair would grow past my shoulders but since using as Sproil mango spray, shampoo, leave-in conditioner, and oil treatment</li>
            <li> Over the course of time, they have become very long and difficult to shampoo, condition, style, etc.  </li>
            <li> My hair is a dull color</li>
            <li> Unbelievable!  </li>
            <li> My hair was very dull and flakes was on 1000.  </li>
            <li> They are also very thick and ropey because I don&#x27;t often twist or tighten them.  </li>
            <li> I cold not wait to use this product after readingt</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>

            <li> I have been using this for a while and I can see the difference. My scalp is not as dry as it used to be (and so doesn&#x27;t itch as much) and my locks look much better. It tingles for a little bit after being sprayed on scalp. Excellent product. Would definitely recommend...</li>
            <li> Great stuff it made my dry dreads shiny and soft . It&#x27;s too bad this product can&#x27;t be found in most stores.</li>
            <li> I have had locs for almost 20 years.  Over the course of time, they have become very long and difficult to shampoo, condition, style, etc.  They are also very thick and ropey because I don&#x27;t often twist or tighten them.  I like locs that look like they just happened to grow out of your head that way.  As a result, my locs were beginning to look dry and dull.  They were hard and scratchy to the point where I had to tie them up just to keep them from scratching my back.  I was ready to cut them off.  I was letting my new growth come in so that when I cut them off I could rock a medium afro.  But then I found this product.  Wow!  I&#x27;m soooo glad I kept my locs!  Just three or four pump actions, and now I have brand-new looking locs that are soft, and full of body &amp; shine.  Unbelievable!  A really great product which delivers on it&#x27;s promises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied the Sproil spray one morning after using one of the JML conditioners on the previous night.  But I&#x27;m almost positive it was the Sproil spray which did the trick!  I found the Sproil product at a beauty supply store while looking for the JML ISLAND OIL product which I&#x27;ve used for about 6 months.  ISLAND OIL is not as intense as the Sproil spray, but it&#x27;s also a good product if you don&#x27;t have a problem with dry, dull hair.  JML ISLAND OIL has a light, fresh scent which keeps my hair smelling good in between shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize I sound like an info-mercial, or maybe a fake, paid-for product reviewer.  Trust me on this. Get yourself Sproiled!  You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> Love this product and my hair smells lovely. Been using this product for about a year.</li>
            <li> BAMMM!!!! I cold not wait to use this product after readingt he reviews.. I am a fan of the mango and lime products, but never heard or seen this.. My hair was very dull and flakes was on 1000.  I am currently out of country and cannot tend to my hair like I normally do.  But when I first sprayed this on my scout, i fell asleep lol because it was soooo tingly, and my scalp was finally at peace.  Sad but true.. It left my hair moisturized and with some shine to it.  I currently pour a little into my leave in mix.  I haven&#x27;t experienced any growth, but my hair has been retaining hair.  I think with the new leave in mix I use ot had helped too..But good product.  I am at half a bottle left, but will be buying more! Godd product for sure.</li>
            <li> This product is a must if you need some shine to your locs. My hair is a dull color and I refuse to use any dye. So all i do after i wash my locs i put some of this sproil in it and it makes my air look great, it also tingles. It gives a brilliant shine for real. My scalp is no longer dry looking and it feels stronger. I also use it in between washes, to keep a healthy shiney loc hairdo.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. I have dreadlocks that are past my shoulders and I spray a couple sprays of this on and my hair shines and becomes really soft. This is the best product I have found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the bottle is relatively small.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I&#x27;ve tried most of other products for natural har care but this and other Jamaican Mango &amp; Lime products does a superb job with less cost.</li>
            <li> Great smell does wat it says gave it 3 stars because the nozzle straw thing that makes it spray was way to long had to cut with scissors but overall u feel  better wen this stuff in hair it feels like it&#x27;s working other than bs nozzle tube this is a must buy also I bought 6 oz seems like it&#x27;s not a enough couple squirts u at middle of the bottle wish they can bring price down a little still must buy</li>
            <li> This Spray oil is great! I use it almost everyday but don&#x27;t really have to spray much it brings a luster back to your dreadlocks twists or whatever style your rockin....lol...I have had my locks for almost a year now and I love to keep them fresh lookin all the time and this helps out with that a lot...and the price is not bad for it eiether...it doesn&#x27;t have a fruity smell to it like I thought it would but other than that it does what its supposed to do I will definitely be buying more :)</li>
            <li> Great product for full-grown dreadlocks!</li>
            <li> My locs and I love it. I alternate between this and another one of their oils. Both are amazing. This has a tingle to it that makes my locs feel refreshed after workouts.</li>
            <li> Smells good, tingles the scalp, moisturizes and it does make hair grow loke crazy. I couldn&#x27;t find in any stores.</li>
            <li> This really works on an itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> Started using this about two weeks ago. This product has a fantastic smell and more importantly, it keeps my locs moisturized without being sticky or gummy.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Grows your hair and is great for moisturizing. Can be very oily so not too much is needed. I spray about once a week and use a lighter oil in between such as coconut oil.</li>
            <li> My 18 year old sun used this and broke out all on the back of his neck</li>
            <li> still have baby locs but this adds a nice scent to it and feels good. I am trying to save it for when my baby locs officially &#x27;lock up&#x27;. no point in using products such as this until then</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sproil for about 3 yrs on my twists and braids and it&#x27;s strengthened my hair from the roots to the ends. It has a tropical kinda smell to it that opens up your pores in the scalp to receive the moisture so that you hair is lest looking shiney and healthy.  I never thought my hair would grow past my shoulders but since using as Sproil mango spray, shampoo, leave-in conditioner, and oil treatment my hair has exceeded my expectation. For anyone whose wondering about Sproil hair products. It Works!!!!</li>
            <li> Love love this stuff. Great smell.</li>
