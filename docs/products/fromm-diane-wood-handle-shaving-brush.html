            <li>That being said it lathered ok and put the suds where I wanted it.</li>
            <li>, NooBs wait a bit and work out your lathering technique on a more forgiving brush.</li>
            <li>but it is OK.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is OK in travel or once in a while use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping is more than the price</li>
            <li>I love mine.</li>
            <li>Brush works great but the only problem is that the bristle fall out when I mix it with the shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I purchased this primarily as part of a collection of all things</li>
            <li>It looks light weight.</li>
            <li>Also fantastic computer keyboard brush.</li>
            <li>having said this with a wee bit of practice I&#x27;ve been getting VERY good lathers out of this little brush.</li>
            <li>Experienced wet shavers its a MUST BUY</li>
            <li>like the roughness of the bristles on my skin, so as far as exfoliating the skin while applying, the brush is excellent, but in all other departments the brush is severely inadequate.&lt;br</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s a cheap brush so don&#x27;t expect much.</li>

            <li>you know the saying &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;, right?  </li>
            <li>Well, this is just the case here: i&#x27;s OK in general.  </li>
            <li>I am presently using a brush with twice the head size, which lathers the face better.</li>
            <li>I also had issues with the brush popping out of the handle although this was easily fixed with super glue</li>

            <li>Packaged very well.</li>
            <li>It felt like there was a gob of glue in the middle of the brush kind of like a paint brush that you forgot to clean out before it dried.</li>

            <li>When I contacted them they actually thought it funny that I paid twice as much.  </li>
            <li>Really comfortable, finally I found what I need, soft, long and do the job, which worth the money.</li>

            <li>This is my third shaving brush but first using horsehair.  </li>
            <li>Okay I had it for a week or to and the hairs welt and bend, the bristles are hard and do not lather.</li>
            <li>I have the old stoneware cup that my Grandpa used for his shaving soap and brush.</li>
            <li>Works fine, but way to small for my need.  </li>

            <li> I just wanted to see what was being offered for 3 bucks, it was a functional brush with no real offending qualities but was very small. Another two dollars and you could buy a decent boar brush.</li>
            <li> Brush works great but the only problem is that the bristle fall out when I mix it with the shaving cream.</li>
            <li> This is my third shaving brush but first using horsehair.  Perhaps it is due to the previous brushes being of badger hair, but I seriously disliked the horse hair of this brush.  I found I had to work harder to create a lather and the brush would not hold the water or lather well.&lt;br /&gt;I like the roughness of the bristles on my skin, so as far as exfoliating the skin while applying, the brush is excellent, but in all other departments the brush is severely inadequate.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the handle is very small.

            <li> I have the old stoneware cup that my Grandpa used for his shaving soap and brush. This makes a great accessory for my bathroom.  I may need to order some more for the family members that shave. : )</li>
            <li> This company doubled the price of the shaving brushes.  Be careful  when ordering anything from this company.  They are sneaky and laugh about it.  When I contacted them they actually thought it funny that I paid twice as much.  They said Amazon could not do anything about it,so I contacted my credit card company and they agreed with me .</li>
            <li> Works fine, but way to small for my need.  I am presently using a brush with twice the head size, which lathers the face better.</li>
            <li> Bristles are good but the &amp;#34;wood&amp;#34; is not even close to convincing! This might go in my travel case....</li>
            <li> To me when I use this brush, I fell like the bristles are made of Hay rather than animal fur. when I apply the lather on my face, it doesn&#x27;t give me a perfect &amp;#34;Santa Beard&amp;#34;. also when lathering, it doesn&#x27;t absorb the lather into the brush, it just collects it outside the bristles.</li>
            <li> It did just what it was suppose to do.  I have a hard time spreading shaving gel on my face with my hands, but the brush did the trick.</li>
            <li> you know the saying &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;, right?  Well, this is just the case here: i&#x27;s OK in general.  Also, I just don&#x27;t like that individual bristles keep falling off sometimes.</li>
            <li> this is the same type of brush I used for over twenty years I hope it holds up as well</li>
            <li> I was disappointed. Brush hairs are much thinner than they appear in the photo. One of them fell apart before I even wrapped the gift. They took longer to get than any of my other Amazon purchases, so I didn&#x27;t have time to return it. I ended up gluing it back together and gifting it anyway. :(</li>
            <li> Thought since the price was low I&#x60;d try out the shaving brush. After getting the brush I saw it wasn&#x60;t of good quality, didn&#x60;t give a good lather and rough on the face...but for the price what do you expect. Recommend buying higher quality shave brushes that are available.</li>
            <li> Okay I had it for a week or to and the hairs welt and bend, the bristles are hard and do not lather. A plug of hair even fell out. I don&#x27;t know if it a defective brush but the purchese was not worth it to me</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cheap brush so don&#x27;t expect much. It looks like the factory puts all it&#x27;s new hires on the job for this brush. It felt like there was a gob of glue in the middle of the brush kind of like a paint brush that you forgot to clean out before it dried. That being said it lathered ok and put the suds where I wanted it. But I only used it once and then decided life is too short to put up with this. I&#x27;m not going to bother the vendor for a refund. It was my bad judgement on this one. But it is a brush after all. It&#x27;ll work.</li>
            <li> bristle are very thin but you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> I purchased this primarily as part of a collection of all things FROMM...however, the name is printed on the packaging only whereas I hoped for it to be engraved on the handle...</li>
            <li> Great quality brushes, the the design is cool and unique. Packaged very well. Would definitely come back in the future.</li>
            <li> First I want to praise their customer service which is AWESOME. This brush on the other-hand gets a solid MEH? its not a bad little brush (little being the operative word) and I believe its aimed at \\&quot; Barber professionals\\&quot; that need a solid performer at a \\&quot;throw away\\&quot; price. using lather from one of those barber \\&quot;hot lather\\&quot; machines this puppy would shine but its a bit small and stiff for mug lathering....having said this with a wee bit of practice I&#x27;ve been getting VERY good lathers out of this little brush. Experienced wet shavers its a MUST BUY, NooBs wait a bit and work out your lathering technique on a more forgiving brush.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and just spend a bit more on a nice Omega brush. To start off this brush is very prickly and is very uncomfortable when you apply your lather and does not break in like higher quality brushes. I also had issues with the brush popping out of the handle although this was easily fixed with super glue this is just shoddy quality. But the biggest thing that made me trash this brush is the shedding. This brush constantly sheds, not just a few strands but huges chunks. By the time I got rid of the brush the entire middle part of the brush had shed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just skip this brush.</li>
            <li> It looks light weight. But when my husband started using it ,the hair of the brush started coming out at that time only.</li>
            <li> Really comfortable, finally I found what I need, soft, long and do the job, which worth the money. wished is less but it is OK.</li>
            <li> It is below standard shaving brush, hair are too short to leather&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good about, it is made of horse hair, bad about it, hair fall&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is OK in travel or once in a while use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping is more than the price</li>
            <li> Best weapons cleaning brush ever. Also fantastic computer keyboard brush.</li>
            <li> This is a horse hair brush. That said, you may want to wash it with soap and water before use to remove the smell inherent to horse hair. It makes great lather with any soap and is stiffer than badger brushes. I love mine. The only thing I would change is lengthening the handle. If you use a deep soap mug it is a little short. At this price everyone should own one.</li>
