            <li>It is the size I wanted and works great.</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>Very handy with some weight on it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still good.</li>
            <li>You will need a very bright light to work with this mirror.</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>Nice size mirror</li>
            <li>I sell jewelry at craft shows and needed a nice looking hand held mirror.  </li>
            <li>Came nicely shipped and protected.  </li>
            <li>This is mirror is made of very cheap plastic.  </li>
            <li>It is flimsy &amp; very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Good clarity and perfect size to see reverse image in other mirror !  </li>
            <li>Love the pattern on the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Glad to find this.</li>
            <li>Great mirror despite other reviews mine is durable and gives a great all around view</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good, sturdy hand mirror.</li>
            <li>So the mirror itself is fine, it was cheaper in CVS than it is on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are trying to see fine detail</li>
            <li>The seller did a fine job.</li>
            <li>I thought as it was made by Conair it would be fine.</li>
            <li>If this were in a brick, real store, I don&#x27;t think many would be sold at all.</li>
            <li>I use it for my patients, and they are easily able to see their entire faces in it, and it is light and easy to hold.</li>
            <li>This is a barely adequate mirror.</li>
            <li>a quick once-over of the appearance</li>
            <li>it is adequate.</li>
            <li>This is Dollar Store worthy.</li>
            <li>Large and easy to use.</li>
            <li>They seemed very positive.</li>
            <li>Great size to use for cutting own hair.</li>
            <li>It is much handier than those tiny mirrors you find in stores and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>The paper sticker ripped and I had to scratch it off with my fingers, even after running under hot water.  </li>
            <li>Nice light weight ... not too heavy !</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, it is just a mirror, you can&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s big oblong size is particularly nice for seeing the back of my head.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes there&#x27;s a cute mug on the otherside, and other times, not so much so ...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ConAir, great dimensions and weight big enough to look at the back of your neck if you are a man and give yourself personal shape-ups with clippers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure carrying the Conair brand name adds a few bucks to the price.</li>
            <li>Might be a good mirror, but it was broken when I opened the package.</li>
            <li>so I had to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>This mirror is exactly the same as one I bought in the store for 3 times the price.</li>
            <li>this fills the bill,  the mirror size is BIG so folks can really see the necklace.</li>
            <li>Its major shortcoming is that it reflects a dim image.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s large enough to see everything I need to and sturdy enough to where I don&#x27;t feel as it will fall apart on my hands.  </li>
            <li>it is absolutely ridiculous that Conair would put a huge non-peelaway sticker over the face of the mirror.  </li>

            <li> The mirror arrived broken, and was deducted from my order total.</li>
            <li> I found one at another store in town, got to choose the color, and it cost less too!  </li>
            <li> When I sit on this one, I will take my lazy butt to the beauty supply store &amp; get one well made.</li>

            <li> The color was an odd purple, and the plastic cheesy.</li>

            <li> I am disappointed in this mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Stupid.</li>
            <li> It seems as if the list price is terribly inflated for Amazon customers.  </li>

            <li> Large and easy to use. Wish there were color options.</li>
            <li> This mirror is exactly the same as one I bought in the store for 3 times the price. I use it for my patients, and they are easily able to see their entire faces in it, and it is light and easy to hold.</li>
            <li> Great size to use for cutting own hair. Needed this to see the back of my head and neck in conjunction with the bathroom mirror.</li>
            <li> Nice size mirror and I got a blue one.</li>
            <li> Might be a good mirror, but it was broken when I opened the package.</li>
            <li> Great price. Very handy with some weight on it. Love the pattern on the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it is just a mirror, you can&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li> Thought it was a larger size mirror but it&#x27;s still good.</li>
            <li> I broke our last mirror so I had to buy a new one. This is a pretty good, sturdy hand mirror. I always but these Connor mirrors so I know I will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is mirror is made of very cheap plastic.  I&#x27;m sure carrying the Conair brand name adds a few bucks to the price.</li>
            <li> Great mirror despite other reviews mine is durable and gives a great all around view</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror based on the reviews. They seemed very positive. Although I was charged $12.95 for the mirror, the price tag on the one I received was $3.95.  My initial shock and outrage was increased when I went to my local grocery store and found the very same mirror for $3.49.  It seems as if the list price is terribly inflated for Amazon customers.  Needless to say, I returned the item to the seller immediately, but am still waiting for credit.</li>
            <li> So the mirror itself is fine, it was cheaper in CVS than it is on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it is absolutely ridiculous that Conair would put a huge non-peelaway sticker over the face of the mirror.  The paper sticker ripped and I had to scratch it off with my fingers, even after running under hot water.  Why, WHY would you put a sticker on the mirror surface?  Stupid.</li>
            <li> The mirror arrived broken, and was deducted from my order total. The color was an odd purple, and the plastic cheesy. I found one at another store in town, got to choose the color, and it cost less too!  Would not recommend, as it&#x27;s too fragile to ship, and no choice in color.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to others. It is much handier than those tiny mirrors you find in stores and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ConAir, great dimensions and weight big enough to look at the back of your neck if you are a man and give yourself personal shape-ups with clippers.</li>
            <li> I sell jewelry at craft shows and needed a nice looking hand held mirror.  this fills the bill,  the mirror size is BIG so folks can really see the necklace.</li>
            <li> Good clarity and perfect size to see reverse image in other mirror !  Nice light weight ... not too heavy !</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a mirror what else can I say? Sometimes there&#x27;s a cute mug on the otherside, and other times, not so much so ...</li>
            <li> Hello ... the product is excellent and very beautiful .. thank you .. and happy day</li>
            <li> I give myself haircuts and this mirror has been a necessity to get the back of my head.  It&#x27;s big oblong size is particularly nice for seeing the back of my head.  Came nicely shipped and protected.  Happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This hand mirror is just as advertised and I like it because it is not too heavy to check the back of a hairdo</li>
            <li> Hard to find these simple, big mirrors.  Keep breaking them, so I buy extras.</li>
            <li> I did not know that I could purchase the mirror I purchased.  I thought that only beauticians had this mirror.  I love it!  It is the size I wanted and works great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s large enough to see everything I need to and sturdy enough to where I don&#x27;t feel as it will fall apart on my hands.  Perfect for every day use.</li>
            <li> This is a barely adequate mirror. Its major shortcoming is that it reflects a dim image.You will need a very bright light to work with this mirror.I am disappointed in this mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a quick once-over of the appearance it is adequate. If you are trying to see fine detail you will find it frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no problem with the shipping or packing. The seller did a fine job. The stickers on my mirror came off without any problem.</li>
            <li> Smaller then I suspected. I sat on my last one, so needed to replace it. I thought as it was made by Conair it would be fine. It is flimsy &amp; very cheaply made. When I sit on this one, I will take my lazy butt to the beauty supply store &amp; get one well made. If this were in a brick, real store, I don&#x27;t think many would be sold at all. Hard to tell online how sturdy some things are. This is Dollar Store worthy.You don&#x27;t get to choose the color, I got a yucky shade of blue. Could have been a worse color I guess..lol</li>
            <li> Glad to find this. I like the size, and use it to apply makeup.  Bought one in a store a while back and dropped and broke it, but couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere in stores again.</li>
