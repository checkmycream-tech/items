            <li>The brush fit perfectly, works perfect for my sensitive skin, and arrived by the time is was promised.</li>
            <li>I bought a replacement brush for my 17 y/o daughter, so we would each have our own.</li>
            <li>Bought one for my hubby to have his own too.</li>
            <li>This was the best deal by far.</li>
            <li>My skin just continues to look better and better.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love my clarisonic mia.  </li>
            <li>and about the product, what can I say, I love clarisonic.</li>
            <li>It prepares my skin to absorb the serum and moisturizer much better.</li>
            <li>I love that I can take in the shower, too.</li>
            <li>but I think this one does just an ok job.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just worried about ordering more Clarisonic Brushes from Amazon, but I think I will still give it another chance to be sure.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this is more Gentle on your skin,but very effective.</li>
            <li>I works for me,therefore, I reordered two of same replacement brushes at a very good price.  </li>
            <li>very good replacement brush head for my clarisonic (mia) &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Cleans up easily and stays Whiter than regular replacements</li>
            <li>These brush heads are great and the price is very good for two compared with other companies selling the same product.  </li>
            <li>It came in an original Box, but who knows?</li>
            <li>It was easy to order and came in right away.</li>
            <li>This is nothing special, Just a brush head.</li>
            <li>Amazon gave me a full refund without question.  </li>
            <li>was very pleased and definitely will do business with them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The process was easy and fast.  </li>
            <li>I bought my Clarisonic system a few months ago and have been using religiously and very happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>I first tried a brush for normal skin but found this brush for sensitives skin much better for me at age 60 having sensitive skin .I</li>
            <li>Came in authentic boxes but must have been refurbished with different bristles -- do not buy.</li>
            <li>Saved so much!</li>
            <li>The first 2 brushes I ordered had no problems.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Price is reasonable,</li>
            <li>As for the Clarisonic Pro, I really like it..</li>
            <li>Not the real product.</li>
            <li>I now use this one for sensitive skin and it is gentle  enough to deeply clean while not leaving me looking chapped.</li>
            <li>I would recommend to everyone that wants clear skin to get a clarisonic brush.</li>
            <li>I priced the replacement brushes for my new Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li>We prefer the sensitive skin brush heads!</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I just purchased the sensitive skin care brush</li>
            <li>I purchased the Clarisonic Pro and it came with the Sensitive Skin brush.  </li>
            <li>I used the brush for normal skin the first time I   used the clairsonic system, and my cheeks were quite   red the next morning.    </li>
            <li>Personally, I find the sensitive brush to be perfect for my skin, as the other ones are just a little to rough and leaves me red in the face....   </li>
            <li>I am feeling immediate calm to my skin and less tightness and overworking that</li>
            <li>It came quickly, in just a few days.</li>
            <li>It is a major part of my cleansing routine.</li>

            <li> HOWEVER, my skin care practitioners have all been noticing that I may be exfoliating too hard.  </li>
            <li> This brush frayed and twisted immediately, so I don&#x27;t know if it was just defective, or</li>

            <li> I received this product within a couple of days. It was packaged nicely and fits perfect &amp; works great on my clarisonic. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love my clarisonic mia.  The brush fit perfectly, works perfect for my sensitive skin, and arrived by the time is was promised.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried Clarisonic, you must! Personally, I find the sensitive brush to be perfect for my skin, as the other ones are just a little to rough and leaves me red in the face....   Great purchase.</li>

It&#x27;s sort of like changing from a firm to hard toothbrush to a soft/senstive line.

            <li> I purchased the Clarisonic Pro and it came with the Sensitive Skin brush.  I works for me,therefore, I reordered two of same replacement brushes at a very good price.  The process was easy and fast.  As for the Clarisonic Pro, I really like it..only wish I knew about it sooner.  I&#x27;ve only been using it since November and I feel that my skin has improved.  It prepares my skin to absorb the serum and moisturizer much better. I love that I can take in the shower, too.</li>
            <li> Not the real product. Came in authentic boxes but must have been refurbished with different bristles -- do not buy.</li>
            <li> Have ordered the brush head before.  The Clarisonic brush is great.  It is a major part of my cleansing routine.</li>

            <li> This product was shipped quickly, my only concern was that it was not in any type of packaging.  It made it hard to believe it was brand new....</li>
