            <li>Now I know this is what works perfectly.</li>

            <li>And have been VERY pleased with everything i have used from them.  </li>
            <li>And I am very pleased.  </li>

            <li>Helps greatly with a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>amazing.</li>
            <li>This has a nice after smell.</li>
            <li>It is also nice for traveling.</li>
            <li>Smells great, shaves clean.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and when this is combined with a 3 blade safety razor, I get a perfect shave.  </li>
            <li>and this makes shaving very easy.</li>
            <li>Excellent product so far, Recommended it to close friends</li>
            <li>This is a great pre shave oil that helps the blade glide over the top and greatly reduce (not totally reduce) the amount of ingrown hairs while shaving.  </li>
            <li>Also reduces the shaving bumps I have as the shaving oil used is also very important.    </li>
            <li>Smells wonderful / super manly and really keeps your skin smooth - can&#x27;t ask for anything more out of a shave oil!</li>
            <li>this product did better than art of shaving unscented</li>
            <li>I like &#x27;Cremo&#x27; better</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>- dare i say - borderline enjoyable.  </li>
            <li>shaving is actually enjoyable again.  </li>
            <li>glad i found this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love the stuff.  </li>
            <li>My husband prefers this product to many he has tried.</li>
            <li>Not too greasy, doesn&#x27;t leave a film on his skin - more moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Sooo glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>This is the main reason for those great results.  </li>
            <li>What I appreciate most is that this oil appears &amp;#34;thinner&amp;#34; than the others and thus slides more easily across my skin, and it doesn&#x27;t clog up my 5 blade razor like the others.</li>
            <li>Product gives good shaving lubrication with only 5-6 drops and smells good too.</li>
            <li>I tried other famous brands and this is the best.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure at first if I would have liked the product</li>
            <li>and  makes shaving easy.</li>
            <li>but just know that it has a strong smell to it, but you get used to it after about 3 uses</li>
            <li>Extremely smooth, easy rinsing, and does NOT clog the blade.</li>
            <li>First it smells so good, it makes the entire bathroom suite smell good.</li>
            <li>This stuff works great, and is the only thing I need to shave.  </li>
            <li>the equivalent of lather, and from there it&#x27;s smooth sailing.</li>
            <li>Also great for touch ups when you are in a rush or for parts of your beard that grow back faster.</li>
            <li>That and the incredibly smooth shave it gives.</li>
            <li>But after using it for about 2 weeks now I rather enjoy</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light sent</li>
            <li>Well worth it!</li>
            <li>Now back to more effective competitors.</li>
            <li>I use this Monday morning after shaving Sunday night for a fresh professional close look, and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the effect.</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s on the low end price wise and</li>
            <li>However, this product in particular is excellent because it conditions your skin with a little comfortable heat before you pass the razor.  </li>
            <li>Works very well, razor glides easier and the oil does make a marked difference in getting a good shave.</li>
            <li>It is actually a pleasure to shave again - no razor burn, a very close shave, and it feels great on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Not as good as slick water,  but a better value.</li>
            <li>Great for shaving away from home to avoid the mess of shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I have been experimenting with various shaving oils (SS, SD and American Crew) and AC is by far the best of the lot.</li>
            <li>I like them both very much.  </li>
            <li>Wet my face/neck with warm to hot water&lt;br /&gt;3)  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>I lucked out because my first order got lost in the mail</li>
            <li>I struggle with ingrown hairs and after purchasing an expensive oil form an executive shaving store I thought, &amp;#34;there has to be a better and more affordable option out there.&amp;#34;  I found this after looking through some reviews on amazon and am glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Used David Somersets shaving oil previously, this one is even better at a better price!&lt;br /&gt;Great shave for a sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use it in sensitive body areas, or use it for a full face shave if I&#x27;ll be outdoors in the sun that day.</li>
            <li>I put it on my dry face and then apply shaving cream on top.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let the price throw you off: it will last you a good while given how little you use, and the small size makes it great for travel.</li>
            <li>Really does the job.</li>
            <li>The shave i get is very close.  </li>
            <li>Much smoother shaves.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t find this product was very &amp;#34;slick&amp;#34; nor did it help prevent razor burn.  </li>
            <li>The key is to take time to shave correcty, I was always trying to rush through it with cheap stuff.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m always a bit surprised more people don&#x27;t know about this terrific product.</li>
            <li>Much better than shaving cream or some other product.</li>
            <li>This is a great pre shave product I have a tough beard and sensitive skin</li>
            <li>but the main thing is what works for you and for your face.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>would high recommend.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t bother putting shave cream over the top of it, it is simpler to just use a few drops of this oil on each side of my face.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m reviewing this, but it is a genuinely useful (either alone or with a shaving cream) and not enough people know about it.</li>
            <li>evenon my very sensitive adams apple area.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone else with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>For some one that used to always get little dings and red marks on my skin after shaving, this has been fantastic!  </li>
            <li>a bottle of this should last two months or a little more (I shave with it 5 days a week).  </li>
            <li>Last a long time compared to King of Shaves products, which I used previously, and has a better, less potent, scent.</li>
            <li>This one by far in my opinion blew all the others away.</li>
            <li>Since it isn&#x27;t exactly cheap and comes in small bottles, I use it selectively.</li>
            <li>still in my first six months of wet shaving</li>
            <li>Oh yeah,I shave with an old fashioned double sided safety razor.</li>
            <li>Recently switched to a replaceable blade old fashion safety razor and got both this shave oil and a brush lather.</li>
            <li>Just make certain you have a sharp blade.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Following those steps, I&#x27;ve literally never cut myself shaving the last 2 years, and never have red marks on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>If I skimp on the oil or rubbing, as I did the first few times the coverage is spotty and there&#x27;s snags.</li>
            <li>The bottle is still somewhat small for the price and you have to use a little more than you&#x27;d think.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a few products; some of them were very high quality and from boutique-type stores like L&#x27;Occitane and Keihl&#x27;s.  </li>

            <li> Perfect to apply before normal shaving cream as a base layer if you have a rough beard, or I suppose just to shave with if your stubble isn&#x27;t thick.  </li>
            <li> i am a long time user of the King of shaves line of products.  </li>
            <li> and then you just stumble across a product and wonder how you got by without it before</li>
            <li> Works very well, WAY too expensive for what you actually get in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small which works for traveling but it also seems to last for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I shave daily now with no irritation and few cuts.</li>
            <li> but you only need to use a small amount.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a great pre shave product I have a tough beard and sensitive skin and when I put this product on my face it is not greasy and it does not clog my pores this product did better than art of shaving unscented</li>
            <li> The picture shows ultra glide but description is for essential shave oil. Do not be fooled they are not the same. Ultra glide is awful and dries your skin, it&#x27;s bad for sensitive skin especially.</li>
            <li> This may not be as &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; as the shaving oil from Pacific Shaving, but I don&#x27;t care.  This stuff works great, and is the only thing I need to shave.  I don&#x27;t bother putting shave cream over the top of it, it is simpler to just use a few drops of this oil on each side of my face.  I have very sensitive skin, and when this is combined with a 3 blade safety razor, I get a perfect shave.  This stuff also rocks for travel.  One bottle in my travel kit will last for years.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaving oil makes for great razor glide through ones beard.  I love this stuff for  a smooth shave, feels great!  I&#x27;ve used this product for a number of years.  Helps prevent razor burn too.</li>
            <li> Took a break from this brand and came back in heart beat. The trick is you need to know you beard and the type of oil that works. Now I know this is what works perfectly. I have normally thick and curly facial hair and this makes shaving very easy. Also reduces the shaving bumps I have as the shaving oil used is also very important.    There are different shaving oils out there but the main thing is what works for you and for your face. This works for me as I have tried others and came running back. I have been using this and will keep using it.</li>
            <li> Smell great and helps prevent razor burn.</li>
            <li> Perfect to apply before normal shaving cream as a base layer if you have a rough beard, or I suppose just to shave with if your stubble isn&#x27;t thick.  Smells wonderful / super manly and really keeps your skin smooth - can&#x27;t ask for anything more out of a shave oil!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m reviewing this, but it is a genuinely useful (either alone or with a shaving cream) and not enough people know about it.</li>
            <li> Never knew what I was missing till I started using this product.</li>
            <li> Used this for a while.I put it on my dry face and then apply shaving cream on top. Really does the job.I know I&#x27;ve applied it correctly when it looks cloudy on my skin.I think I&#x27;m on my third container. It smells good and works well. Just make certain you have a sharp blade. Oh yeah,I shave with an old fashioned double sided safety razor.</li>
            <li> Works very well, razor glides easier and the oil does make a marked difference in getting a good shave. Would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> Product gives good shaving lubrication with only 5-6 drops and smells good too. Great for shaving away from home to avoid the mess of shaving cream.</li>
            <li> over priced, should be 45.00 or less?</li>
            <li> Smells great, shaves clean. I bought this oil as I was just getting started with double edge shaving and wanted something to go under my Col. Conk shave soap for smoothness. The bottle is still somewhat small for the price and you have to use a little more than you&#x27;d think. For me it works best if I apply about a nickel&#x27;s diameter of the oil and rub until cloudy-- the equivalent of lather, and from there it&#x27;s smooth sailing. If I skimp on the oil or rubbing, as I did the first few times the coverage is spotty and there&#x27;s snags. I use this Monday morning after shaving Sunday night for a fresh professional close look, and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the effect. Also great for touch ups when you are in a rush or for parts of your beard that grow back faster. I use this for my sideburns and chin on work days.</li>
            <li> Dissolves in my shaving soap and defoams it as I apply.  Basically I&#x27;m washing the oil off my face with the brush. This leads to no lubrication at all, a gritty and abrasive shave, razor burn, and a residue on my brush and soap cake.  I tried this out as an experiment.  Now back to more effective competitors.</li>
            <li> i am a long time user of the King of shaves line of products.  And have been VERY pleased with everything i have used from them.  However, lately thier products have been hit or miss on Amazon.  So, i decided to give the American Crew a try.  And I am very pleased.  I am now using the AC preshave oil and the after shave lotion.  I like them both very much.  The preshave oil has a nice scent and feel good on the skin.  (I do still use the KOS shave gel until my supply runs out).  The shave i get is very close.  never a rash or razor burn.  evenon my very sensitive adams apple area.  So, I give this product 5 stars.  Order without hesitation.</li>
            <li> Works well. Last a long time compared to King of Shaves products, which I used previously, and has a better, less potent, scent. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I like &#x27;Cremo&#x27; better but this is good too. This has a nice after smell.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this in his barber shop. Customers.love it. Prevents razor burn and bumps. Smells nice too! Good product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Especially good if using s DE razor. Much smoother shaves. Price is excellent. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Not as good as slick water,  but a better value.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;m prone to razor bumps and irritation, and this oil just about eliminates any post-shave problems. Since it isn&#x27;t exactly cheap and comes in small bottles, I use it selectively. I&#x27;ll use it in sensitive body areas, or use it for a full face shave if I&#x27;ll be outdoors in the sun that day. Every now and then you just stumble across a product and wonder how you got by without it before - this is one of those products!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t find this product was very &amp;#34;slick&amp;#34; nor did it help prevent razor burn.  Had a weird warming sensation.  Just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> print is too small to tell you that this is meant to be an undercoat for soap and razor.  feels like olive oil on face; will heat up electric razor.</li>
            <li> works great in the shower.  will refill.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! The price is less than half of other comparable products and I have tried them all.</li>
            <li> Why didn&#x27;t I start using this stuff earlier in my shaving career. First it smells so good, it makes the entire bathroom suite smell good. That and the incredibly smooth shave it gives. I&#x27;ll order again!</li>
            <li> Excellent shaving product that is soothing to the face and  makes shaving easy. Much better than shaving cream or some other product.</li>
            <li> This is the slickest stuff I have ever used for shaving.  I abandoned use of shaving cream altogether. It is also nice for traveling.</li>
            <li> I used to get such terrible razor burn that I would put shaving off for as long as possible. However, my job required me to be clean-shaven at all times so I would grit my teeth and start off every morning with a bloody face and terrible razor burn. I tried different shaving creams, razors, after-shaves, everything but pre-shave oils. As soon as I started generously applying this pre-shave oil all my troubles went away. I shave daily now with no irritation and few cuts. I highly recommend this to anyone else with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Save yourself some cash &amp; buy shave secret at your local Wally World.</li>
            <li> Used David Somersets shaving oil previously, this one is even better at a better price!&lt;br /&gt;Great shave for a sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent product so far, Recommended it to close friends</li>
            <li> This is the best Shave Oil as it feels warm and provides for a good shave. I tried other famous brands and this is the best.</li>
            <li> I have used approximately 5 different shave oils. This one by far in my opinion blew all the others away. Extremely smooth, easy rinsing, and does NOT clog the blade. This seller lists it properly. This is the Ultra Glide not the standard. Some sellers show the pic of Ultra Glide but ship the standard. The bottles are extremely similar but product is not. Trust this seller for this product you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> For some one that used to always get little dings and red marks on my skin after shaving, this has been fantastic!  Here is how I use this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)  Shower&lt;br /&gt;2)  Wet my face/neck with warm to hot water&lt;br /&gt;3)  Immediately put this oil on my face&lt;br /&gt;4)  Immediately put shaving gel over the oil&lt;br /&gt;5)  Let it all soak in for a couple of minutes&lt;br /&gt;6)  Shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following those steps, I&#x27;ve literally never cut myself shaving the last 2 years, and never have red marks on my sensitive skin.  This is the main reason for those great results.  If I&#x27;ve tried to shave without it, the dings and cuts return.  It may seem expensive, but this little bottle lasts me nearly a year.  Well worth it!</li>
            <li> smells good feels goood</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  Just what I was looking for.  Thank you.  A+++++</li>
            <li> My review could be as simple as: it just works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m always a bit surprised more people don&#x27;t know about this terrific product. 7-8 drops, and you get a great, close, shave, and the oil leaves your skin nicely moisturized. Don&#x27;t let the price throw you off: it will last you a good while given how little you use, and the small size makes it great for travel.</li>
            <li> absolutely excellent product.  The day I discovered shave oil, shaving went from a frustrating chore with an expectation of blood to something - dare i say - borderline enjoyable.  No.  ACTUALLY enjoyable.  I&#x27;ve used a few products; some of them were very high quality and from boutique-type stores like L&#x27;Occitane and Keihl&#x27;s.  However, this product in particular is excellent because it conditions your skin with a little comfortable heat before you pass the razor.  I use it with Cremo shave creme and my Harry&#x27;s razors.  ... yeah.. shaving is actually enjoyable again.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure at first if I would have liked the product it&#x27;s a lot lighter than the more expensive shave oils.  But after using it for about 2 weeks now I rather enjoy it&#x27;s light sent and it&#x27;s ease of use.  Not sure of the benefits of using a shave oil as a pre-shave but my skin looks and feels great.  I will purchase this stuff again.</li>
            <li> Works very well, WAY too expensive for what you actually get in my opinion.  In terms of shave oils I guess it&#x27;s on the low end price wise and a bottle of this should last two months or a little more (I shave with it 5 days a week).  I lucked out because my first order got lost in the mail so they sent a replacement, the lost package showed up shortly after and so I got two for one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still in my first six months of wet shaving and this is the only shave oil I&#x27;ve used, I would buy it again but I will try another brand when it runs out just to see what else is out there.</li>
            <li> Works well for me.  It&#x27;s small which works for traveling but it also seems to last for a long time.  I&#x27;m still using a bottle I ordered 5 months previous.</li>
            <li> Helps greatly with a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. i highly recommend it. Its expensive but you only need to use a small amount.</li>
            <li> Recently switched to a replaceable blade old fashion safety razor and got both this shave oil and a brush lather. This oil is so easy to use and smells great after I&#x27;m done. Conditions my skin and gives the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had in my life.</li>
            <li> Best product on the market@</li>
            <li> amazing. glad i found this stuff. would high recommend. but just know that it has a strong smell to it, but you get used to it after about 3 uses</li>
            <li> I have been experimenting with various shaving oils (SS, SD and American Crew) and AC is by far the best of the lot. It is actually a pleasure to shave again - no razor burn, a very close shave, and it feels great on my skin.  What I appreciate most is that this oil appears &amp;#34;thinner&amp;#34; than the others and thus slides more easily across my skin, and it doesn&#x27;t clog up my 5 blade razor like the others. I am going to try the &amp;#34;essential&amp;#34; variety of AC next to see if there is any measurable difference.</li>
            <li> I just switched to this oil prior to shaving.  I struggle with ingrown hairs and after purchasing an expensive oil form an executive shaving store I thought, &amp;#34;there has to be a better and more affordable option out there.&amp;#34;  I found this after looking through some reviews on amazon and am glad I did.  This is a great pre shave oil that helps the blade glide over the top and greatly reduce (not totally reduce) the amount of ingrown hairs while shaving.  I also use a beaver hair brush with Geo F. Trumper&#x27;s Coconut Oil Shaving cream...I love the stuff.  The key is to take time to shave correcty, I was always trying to rush through it with cheap stuff.  These items are affordable and quality.</li>
            <li> My husband prefers this product to many he has tried. Not too greasy, doesn&#x27;t leave a film on his skin - more moisturizing. Sooo glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
