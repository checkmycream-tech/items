            <li>I&#x27;m not going to stop this routine until it stops working because trying to many things on your skin isn&#x27;t good.  </li>

            <li>We love this cleansing bar, better than Dove.</li>

            <li>My marks where not horrible.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a huge difference in the appearance of my skin becoming more even-toned and not as oily.</li>
            <li>Pairing this along with Bio Oil, a great product for pimples, has made me hopeful for clear skin.</li>
            <li>Feels good and cleans really well.</li>
            <li>Even&#x27;s your tone after a month you will notice a huge difference.</li>
            <li>This review is not intended to be super insightful.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best soaps I have found for my sensitive, dry skin that works really well.</li>
            <li>the soap is really good, i couldn&#x27;t tell if it was doing what it was supposed to do or not because i didn&#x27;t really see any changes because i only used 1 out of the 6.</li>
            <li>tone has evened out considerably, face is more youthful.</li>
            <li>i put lotion right after.</li>
            <li>this product does exactly what it says</li>
            <li>leaves you smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I love it and get six for this cheap and always order two packs (12) and it lasts me for a few months.</li>
            <li>skin has never looked better, and it doesn&#x27;t dry ouit</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also tried Ambi complexion bar which smells more perfumy than this bar but doesn&#x27;t work as well and dries my skin while this bar doesn&#x27;t dry my skin as much.  </li>
            <li>This cocoa butter bar, however, is one of the very few things I&#x27;ve ever been able to wash my face with at the sink without worrying that I&#x27;ll be able to get it to rinse completely off.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>And, it really moistens my skin</li>
            <li>I tried this soap and omg, it really helped my face.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says (soft).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 17 right now and have been battling acne and scars since I was younger.</li>
            <li>It really is magic...and works like some expensive soaps and facial cleansers I&#x27;ve tried for a LOT more money!!</li>
            <li>Little acne scars on face and actually light patchy areas on my legs caused by an autoimmune issue.</li>
            <li>It moisturize my skin and my skin feel so soft.  </li>
            <li>The soap can be a little drying, so using a good moisturizer afterwards usually combats that dryness.</li>
            <li>fade cream-for specific areas ; soap- facial and body (lasts longer than the average bar of soap); the daily moisturizer (it&#x27;s ok); scub-once weekly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Despite that, it does not dry out the skin either.  </li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t know if this really works for dark spots,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>Since this soap is originally for black women, I have trouble finding it in my hometown.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I came to the same conclusion about this soap as the reviewer before me.  I tried the Ambi complexion bar, and it was indeed perfumy...and a sickening kind of perfumy, at that!  This cocoa butter bar, however, is one of the very few things I&#x27;ve ever been able to wash my face with at the sink without worrying that I&#x27;ll be able to get it to rinse completely off.  It rinses away well, leaves no residue, and despite the cocoa butter, is not oily in the least.  Despite that, it does not dry out the skin either.  It really is magic...and works like some expensive soaps and facial cleansers I&#x27;ve tried for a LOT more money!!</li>
            <li> this product does exactly what it says&lt;br /&gt;clears skin&lt;br /&gt;even tones&lt;br /&gt;My skin has never looked better, and it doesn&#x27;t dry ouit, I cleanse my whole body with this from head to toe and I moisturize with raw shea butter which I melt in the microwave.  I&#x27;m not going to stop this routine until it stops working because trying to many things on your skin isn&#x27;t good.  I&#x27;ve also tried Ambi complexion bar which smells more perfumy than this bar but doesn&#x27;t work as well and dries my skin while this bar doesn&#x27;t dry my skin as much.  I love it and get six for this cheap and always order two packs (12) and it lasts me for a few months.</li>
            <li> We love this cleansing bar, better than Dove. It smells great and moisturizes. No winter dry skin!</li>
            <li> Works very well. leaves you smooth and soft. Even&#x27;s your tone after a month you will notice a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Feels good and cleans really well.</li>
            <li> the soap is really good, i couldn&#x27;t tell if it was doing what it was supposed to do or not because i didn&#x27;t really see any changes because i only used 1 out of the 6. i gave the rest to my sister and she says it&#x27;s working. it might work for you.</li>
            <li> I Use this every day.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best soaps I have found for my sensitive, dry skin that works really well. I recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great. It moisturizes my skin, while it cleanses. My skin tone has evened a lot. I have continued to purchase this soap and have given it out to my family members to benefit from it&#x27;s properties. This review is not intended to be super insightful.</li>
            <li> I have been using this because I tend to have dry skin except my face. And, it really moistens my skin and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in the amount of moisturizer that I have to use. So, you can save a bit on the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because my face takes a beating during the winter time.  I tried this soap and omg, it really helped my face.  It moisturize my skin and my skin feel so soft.  I would recommend this item.  It does exactly what it says (soft).</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for about six weeks now. The soap can be a little drying, so using a good moisturizer afterwards usually combats that dryness. I use it not only on my face, but my body also. I have noticed a huge difference in the appearance of my skin becoming more even-toned and not as oily. I have oily skin that is prone to blemishes every now and then. I use this soap on my face once a day, usually at night before bed. On some days I will use a face brush for exfoliating. For my body, I use the soap twice a day, morning and night during shower time. I find that combining this soap with the 100% raw African Shea butter works wonders for my face and body.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know if this really works for dark spots,&lt;br /&gt;but one thing i know is my face gets very dry after washing my face&lt;br /&gt;so i put lotion right after.</li>
            <li> Product is working great! Came sooner than I thought!</li>
            <li> Since this soap is originally for black women, I have trouble finding it in my hometown.  I&#x27;ve used it for years and love it so I went to the internet to find it.  Just a really good soap that is not drying but doesn&#x27;t. make your face greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 17 right now and have been battling acne and scars since I was younger. My skin does this thing where acne and mosquito bites turn darker once they&#x27;ve gone away. I&#x27;ve tried the typical Proactiv alternatives, skin acids, the Ambi Fade Cream (which worked slowly but well), Bio Oil, and a myriad of other products. This one is by far the best one for my skin. Keep in mind that everyone&#x27;s skin is different. What worked best for me may not work well for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed after a week of use that my dark spots immediately started fading. I&#x27;ve ordered a six pack and am continuing to use it.  It seems like progress has slown down for now (after months of use) but it is indeed still working. Pairing this along with Bio Oil, a great product for pimples, has made me hopeful for clear skin.</li>
            <li> Love Ambi Cocoa butter Cleansing bars, they are really good and over time does help to even out your complexion!</li>
            <li> I have recently discover these products and use a set daily: fade cream-for specific areas ; soap- facial and body (lasts longer than the average bar of soap); the daily moisturizer (it&#x27;s ok); scub-once weekly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My tone has evened out considerably, face is more youthful. Spots faded over a months time. This is using it twice a day with a dab on the area. My marks where not horrible. Little acne scars on face and actually light patchy areas on my legs caused by an autoimmune issue. It actually some how worked in the opposite way. It lightened the area around it but not the spot giving the apprearance of an even tone. Pleasant smell. Love it!</li>
            <li> Came b4 time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always have noted this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will not do the skin wrong&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
