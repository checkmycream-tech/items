    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I knew it was the best set of clippers I had ever tried.</li>
            <li>for me it had a life for about 5 years, and was one of the greatest $20 investments i&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>The Remington is excellent in design and function.  </li>
            <li>the box the product came in is the best feature of this item.  </li>
            <li>excellent for the price</li>
            <li>Pixies are also very good for these too.</li>
            <li>I had purchased a Remington Titanium about five years ago and loved it!</li>
            <li>Another case of a great product revamped to bologna...</li>
            <li>All was going great until I tried to MacGyver it one day and sharpen the blades......</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great trimmer.</li>
            <li>It was GREAT for about fifteen months &amp; used it once a month.</li>
            <li>Great product, and</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s great.   </li>
            <li>Worked great for the 3+ years (maybe 11-14 times) I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li>I also have a Wahl that I&#x27;m happy with.  </li>
            <li>It is best suitable for the trimming and home hair cut.</li>
            <li>I had a HC920 and loved it.</li>
            <li>Works good, cuts well.</li>
            <li>Then you&#x27;re stuck with the guilt of sending a perfectly good motor and casing to the landfill.</li>
            <li>Price was considered to be good also.</li>
            <li>Good for blending.</li>
            <li>Good Product for the price.</li>
            <li>Glad I made this purchase!</li>
            <li>Great product, easy to use.</li>
            <li>I liked the looks of the Remington HC-921 kit.  </li>
            <li>, my whole family is quite happy!</li>
            <li>I cut my own hair with it and dint get any bald patches by mistake-</li>
            <li>Comes with a nice case with lots of attachments.</li>
            <li>As a barber I know my clippers and these are nice and affordable clippers.</li>
            <li>I have to plug my ears, otherwise i think they would honestly damage my hearing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Still not as good as my original, but good nonetheless.</li>
            <li>Purchased the product after reading many reviews and have been very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>but it still cuts it very easily.</li>
            <li>The problem is the guide combs break, EASILY!</li>
            <li>im okay with it</li>
            <li>Servicing &amp; sharpening the blades costs more than replacement.</li>
            <li>Therefore this product is a big WIN!</li>
            <li>They have more power and don&#x27;t pull my hair like most cheaper models do.  </li>
            <li>I threw the item in the trash and bought a ConAir at Kmart which surprisly worked about 20 times better.  </li>
            <li>Appears to be well made and having purchased several trimmers over the years, this is the best one yet.  </li>
            <li>Until they change that or make the blade more durable.</li>
            <li>but it still is not getting any better.  </li>
            <li>We love not having to oil them.</li>
            <li>Unless you abuse it, it will work for many years for almost all hair types.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had these for around 4 years now and they are ok considering the price.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find an exact replacement of the 8017 that I had, but I went with the updated model and they work fairly well.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind these are also great for girls to give them a nice cute and low maintinence pixie not just for boys!</li>
            <li>It allowed hair to move through more smoothly which kept you from ripping hair out.  </li>
            <li>I saw the name Titanium &amp; it made me think strong &amp; durable.</li>
            <li>The unit itself may be strong &amp; durable, but the blade is not.</li>
            <li>These clippers would be as good as new.</li>
            <li>I bought a Wahl brand clipper that has lasted over a year and still works fine.</li>
            <li>I am using it for over a month and a had no problem , work just fine .</li>
            <li>Weight seems to be a first indication of how they are made, and these are heavier and feel more sturdy than most of the cheap department store clippers.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with this - highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I used the Remington twice up to now, and the bottom line it is a great machine, you will never need to lube it, and that is a big deal with clippers.</li>
            <li>100% original, recomendado.</li>
            <li>The Remington HC-921 Titanium PrecisionPro Deluxe 22 Piece Corded Haircut Kit is a good buy for the money and lasted a few years before having to be replaced.</li>
            <li>The Reminington is very quiet, feels much better built, very easy and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>That will explain many of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I have thick hair and it has worked perfectly for over 5 years now.</li>
            <li>The Andis Pro-Motor clipper is better than the Conair for sure, but it also gets hot and needs frequent oiling.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a quick \\&quot;disposable\\&quot; set of clippers</li>
            <li>For the first two hair cuts it was a fantastic product and did the main grooming perfectly, you will need a pair of small trimmers for the edges and beard trimming.  </li>
            <li>but I rarely use the attachments.  </li>
            <li>So far this model has been trouble-free for the most part</li>
            <li>We also use it on our dog (a golden retriever).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are better sets out there if you want to spend more, but figuring in the cost of haircuts over the 1-2 years they will likely last they&#x27;re well worth $20.  </li>
            <li>Never before had I gotten such nice crewcuts as I did with these.</li>
            <li>Quiet, strong and easily maneuvered.</li>
            <li>The Andis T-outliner is nice for edge ups, but it gets way too hot way too fast and needs frequent oiling.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get it to cut right again, so I exchanged it for a replacement model.  </li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t have the money to buy them right now, but if you do.</li>
            <li>luckily i was able to finish the cut, but i am in the market to purchase the same one b/c of the price and reliability.  </li>
            <li>its easy to clean, sharp and easy to work with.</li>
            <li>For the price of a two haircuts at the barber I can do my own for a long time.</li>
            <li>As far as the clippers themselves, they work fine, but I use a guard when I cut my hair.  </li>
            <li>Bought my first one about 5 years ago or so at Wal Mart and as soon as I tried it</li>
            <li>Just threw them out and just purchased another brand that had higher ratings.</li>
            <li>hopefully work better next time .</li>
            <li>on first haircut my wife was pulling the hair out by the roots to cut the hair.  </li>
            <li>At this point, the sound is so loud it&#x27;s unbearable.</li>
            <li>Our old one had slide-ons and the combs had many more teeth which were not as sharp.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately I still have my old guide combs which fit and will hopefully last me a while.  </li>
            <li>Liked it so much that I bought two more for future use a few years ago, but I am still on the first one.  </li>
            <li>All were made in China and were pure junk.  </li>
            <li>All of the old attachments fit the new clipper which may comfort some people</li>
            <li>I ordered another pair from Amazon because of how long the first one lasted me, and free shipping.  </li>
            <li>I hope you like it as much as I did and still do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If the guard does not work well, then it really does not matter how the clippers cut.  </li>
            <li>Bought it for my boyfriend for xmas and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>She and I think they&#x27;re great,and very quit.</li>
            <li>The first few times it works really good &amp; is pretty quiet.</li>
            <li>You should really think of buying a oyster hair clipper set.     </li>
            <li>I cut my son&#x27;s and husband&#x27;s hair the whole time.</li>
            <li>I cut my own hair, very short, whats left of it.</li>
            <li>sure the executives behind these &#x27;quality&#x27; choices are enjoying their bonuses.</li>
            <li>But other than that we love this set.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re significantly wider between the individual blades, flimsy, and contain one-less \\&quot;blade\\&quot; in them.  </li>
            <li>Maybe they were really good at first and then the company got sloppy?  </li>
            <li>Just make sure to read ALL the reviews both good &amp; bad.</li>
            <li>I mainly use the clippers, with no attachments, to buzz my head.  </li>
            <li>After the last one broke, I bought a different brand with better guide combs.</li>
            <li>4 stars as they are decent for the money.</li>
            <li>After receiving the hair clippers i was very excited to get cutting, i cut my own hair.  </li>
            <li>Highly Recommended.   </li>
            <li>If you spend a little more money.</li>
            <li>The first few times I used the clippers they worked just fine.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty good looking machine but the first time the i use it pull hair like crazy</li>
            <li>i am sending this back &amp; buying another costing three times the money &amp; figure my scalp is worth it.</li>
            <li>You shouldn&#x27;t expect to use these clippers for more then a few months, if that.</li>
            <li>Not very environmentally friendly, Remington.     </li>
            <li>But since these new clippers tug the stubbies, I now have to buzz it 3 times a week.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had one for two years, still cuts like new.</li>
            <li>I thought I would upgrade and get me a new set.  </li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t need oiling for about 2-3 years, then i purchased blade oil(although product states it doesn&#x27;t need oiling its life), and worked like new.  </li>
            <li>Either we are doing something &amp;#34;wrong&amp;#34; or we lucked out because we have had this set since they were new on the market</li>
            <li>and we need a new one, Remington has them but doesn&#x27;t ship to Canada and doesn&#x27;t take Canadian billing addresses even if we use a US shipping address.</li>
            <li>If I had a new blade.</li>
            <li>That Remington would give you a chance to buy new blades, but they don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>A big advantage of this powerful clipper is that its teeth never need to be oiled - which I like since the oil applied to my old clipper</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it very frequently</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned the exact same clipper for about 6 years now and it was a workhorse.  </li>
            <li>So when it died on me, I decided to buy the exact same model.  </li>
            <li>it stopped working in the middle of the first haircut on my son; i had to finish the haircut with scissors.</li>
            <li>we stopped using this new product &amp; finished w the old shears.  </li>
            <li>This unit has a powerful motor, very sharp blades and a large kit that includes everything.  </li>
            <li>Take my advice &amp; spend a little more money or buy a different model.</li>
            <li>With the old clipper, I would buzz my head once sometimes twice a week.  </li>
            <li>used my Remington for years trouble free without oiling</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s almost a year old now.</li>
            <li>After that it started making a knocking noise so loud that i couldnt use it.  </li>
            <li>It dose not cut as my old five dollars one.</li>
            <li>Maybe a year or two into using them though, they started producing a loud knocking noise.</li>
            <li>Then, suddenly the last time I used it it was not cutting well and pulling alot.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen that feature on other manufacturers and it would be important to have if the plastic attachments don&#x27;t clip hair close enough for your needs.</li>
            <li>Other reviewers were right here...</li>
            <li>Overall, I highly recommend this product for home hair cuts for people and/or</li>
            <li>I am only writing this review now, because I am looking for a new clipper kit to replace these ones.</li>
            <li>though for thicker hair it helped a lot to cut some of it off first with a scissors (especially for my brother&#x27;s long curly hair and for the dog).</li>
            <li>Oster sells replacement blades &amp; are made to last a lifetime (If you take care of them properly), which is why they cost so much.</li>
            <li>I wish that wasn&#x27;t the case, but I have no other choice.</li>
            <li>I bought a set of these clippers at a department store about 3 years ago, after having gone through at least 3 sets of cheap clippers in a year&#x27;s time.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps it was an unusual mishap, but now I handle this clipper carefully to avoid a repeat problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now it just catches on my hair &amp; will barely cut at all.</li>
            <li>im going to put a little bit of oil to see what happen right now</li>
            <li>After dropping these clippers several times over the years and through regular wear-and-tear, however, it was time to get a new unit.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve even dropped it IN THE TOILET, and on concrete multiple times cracking the plastic handle that sticks out to adjust blade.  </li>
            <li>The cut is sharp and the guides really help.</li>

            <li> The Andis T-outliner is nice for edge ups, but it gets way too hot way too fast and needs frequent oiling.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get it to cut right again, so I exchanged it for a replacement model.  </li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t have the money to buy them right now, but if you do.</li>
            <li> luckily i was able to finish the cut, but i am in the market to purchase the same one b/c of the price and reliability.  </li>
            <li> its easy to clean, sharp and easy to work with.</li>
            <li> For the price of a two haircuts at the barber I can do my own for a long time.</li>
            <li> As far as the clippers themselves, they work fine, but I use a guard when I cut my hair.  </li>
            <li> Bought my first one about 5 years ago or so at Wal Mart and as soon as I tried it</li>
            <li> Just threw them out and just purchased another brand that had higher ratings.</li>
            <li> hopefully work better next time .</li>
            <li> on first haircut my wife was pulling the hair out by the roots to cut the hair.  </li>
            <li> At this point, the sound is so loud it&#x27;s unbearable.</li>
            <li> Our old one had slide-ons and the combs had many more teeth which were not as sharp.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately I still have my old guide combs which fit and will hopefully last me a while.  </li>
            <li> Liked it so much that I bought two more for future use a few years ago, but I am still on the first one.  </li>
            <li> All were made in China and were pure junk.  </li>
            <li> All of the old attachments fit the new clipper which may comfort some people</li>
            <li> I ordered another pair from Amazon because of how long the first one lasted me, and free shipping.  </li>
            <li> I hope you like it as much as I did and still do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If the guard does not work well, then it really does not matter how the clippers cut.  </li>
            <li> Bought it for my boyfriend for xmas and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> She and I think they&#x27;re great,and very quit.</li>
            <li> The first few times it works really good &amp; is pretty quiet.</li>
            <li> You should really think of buying a oyster hair clipper set.     </li>
            <li> I cut my son&#x27;s and husband&#x27;s hair the whole time.</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair, very short, whats left of it.</li>
            <li> sure the executives behind these &#x27;quality&#x27; choices are enjoying their bonuses.</li>
            <li> But other than that we love this set.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re significantly wider between the individual blades, flimsy, and contain one-less \\&quot;blade\\&quot; in them.  </li>
            <li> Maybe they were really good at first and then the company got sloppy?  </li>
            <li> Just make sure to read ALL the reviews both good &amp; bad.</li>
            <li> I mainly use the clippers, with no attachments, to buzz my head.  </li>
            <li> After the last one broke, I bought a different brand with better guide combs.</li>
            <li> 4 stars as they are decent for the money.</li>
            <li> After receiving the hair clippers i was very excited to get cutting, i cut my own hair.  </li>
            <li> Highly Recommended.   </li>
            <li> If you spend a little more money.</li>
            <li> The first few times I used the clippers they worked just fine.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good looking machine but the first time the i use it pull hair like crazy</li>
            <li> i am sending this back &amp; buying another costing three times the money &amp; figure my scalp is worth it.</li>
            <li> You shouldn&#x27;t expect to use these clippers for more then a few months, if that.</li>
            <li> Not very environmentally friendly, Remington.     </li>
            <li> But since these new clippers tug the stubbies, I now have to buzz it 3 times a week.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one for two years, still cuts like new.</li>
            <li> I thought I would upgrade and get me a new set.  </li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t need oiling for about 2-3 years, then i purchased blade oil(although product states it doesn&#x27;t need oiling its life), and worked like new.  </li>
            <li> Either we are doing something &amp;#34;wrong&amp;#34; or we lucked out because we have had this set since they were new on the market</li>
            <li> and we need a new one, Remington has them but doesn&#x27;t ship to Canada and doesn&#x27;t take Canadian billing addresses even if we use a US shipping address.</li>
            <li> If I had a new blade.</li>
            <li> That Remington would give you a chance to buy new blades, but they don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> A big advantage of this powerful clipper is that its teeth never need to be oiled - which I like since the oil applied to my old clipper</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it very frequently</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned the exact same clipper for about 6 years now and it was a workhorse.  </li>
            <li> So when it died on me, I decided to buy the exact same model.  </li>
            <li> it stopped working in the middle of the first haircut on my son; i had to finish the haircut with scissors.</li>
            <li> we stopped using this new product &amp; finished w the old shears.  </li>
            <li> This unit has a powerful motor, very sharp blades and a large kit that includes everything.  </li>
            <li> Take my advice &amp; spend a little more money or buy a different model.</li>
            <li> With the old clipper, I would buzz my head once sometimes twice a week.  </li>
            <li> used my Remington for years trouble free without oiling</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s almost a year old now.</li>
            <li> After that it started making a knocking noise so loud that i couldnt use it.  </li>
            <li> It dose not cut as my old five dollars one.</li>
            <li> Maybe a year or two into using them though, they started producing a loud knocking noise.</li>
            <li> Then, suddenly the last time I used it it was not cutting well and pulling alot.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen that feature on other manufacturers and it would be important to have if the plastic attachments don&#x27;t clip hair close enough for your needs.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers were right here...</li>
            <li> Overall, I highly recommend this product for home hair cuts for people and/or</li>
            <li> I am only writing this review now, because I am looking for a new clipper kit to replace these ones.</li>
            <li> though for thicker hair it helped a lot to cut some of it off first with a scissors (especially for my brother&#x27;s long curly hair and for the dog).</li>
            <li> Oster sells replacement blades &amp; are made to last a lifetime (If you take care of them properly), which is why they cost so much.</li>
            <li> I wish that wasn&#x27;t the case, but I have no other choice.</li>
            <li> I bought a set of these clippers at a department store about 3 years ago, after having gone through at least 3 sets of cheap clippers in a year&#x27;s time.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps it was an unusual mishap, but now I handle this clipper carefully to avoid a repeat problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now it just catches on my hair &amp; will barely cut at all.</li>
            <li> im going to put a little bit of oil to see what happen right now</li>
            <li> After dropping these clippers several times over the years and through regular wear-and-tear, however, it was time to get a new unit.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve even dropped it IN THE TOILET, and on concrete multiple times cracking the plastic handle that sticks out to adjust blade.  </li>
            <li> The cut is sharp and the guides really help.</li>
            <li> It was quiet for the first month and then the clatter slowly emerged.</li>
            <li> I am not the only one complaining that the blade gets dull fast.</li>
            <li> Plus the blade doesn&#x27;t last very long at all.</li>
            <li> I think I will continue using my 5 year old Wahl clippers that I paid less that $20.00 for until I can get another set like them.  </li>
            <li> but the tugging will cause ingrown hairs if you let it grow for too long, hence the 3 times a week.  </li>
            <li> It is fairly quiet and the vibrations are minimal.</li>
            <li> It turns on, but simply does not cut hair; it basically tries to yank the hairs out of your head.</li>
            <li> We have had our set so long that I can not remember when we bought them.</li>
            <li> After cleaning it and removing excess hair, I found that if i jammed a small Q-tip under the back of the blade it would stop the noise but being a new instrument i shouldnt have to do that.  </li>
            <li> Lots of different types of guides, clips among other things.</li>
            <li> Buzzcuts especially are over with quickly due to the quality of this machine.</li>
            <li> These new clippers have a little less power because you feel the motor start to cutout</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I can&#x27;t comment on the supplementary pieces as I don&#x27;t use them, the unit itself saw more metal components substituted with plastic; the cord length was halved; and the motor appeared weaker or blades were/went dull (stalls frequently when cutting my hair.)</li>
            <li> (Haven&#x27;t used it in nearly the past year, as allowed my hair to grow!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We only do buzz cuts, but the scissors is very sharp</li>
            <li> In fact, this product broke after only a few months of use.</li>
            <li> Just be careful with the plastic guides.</li>
            <li> It made absolutely no difference.</li>
            <li> You can buy clippers that will last a few years.</li>
            <li> I kept the Remington for the dog, he&#x27;s not particular!</li>
            <li> The low price of this product is just not worth the headache and waste it produces.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> The blades are sharp and the fact that you don&#x27;t have to lube them is an added plus.</li>
            <li> Perhaps these other people had bought the product before they lowered the quality.  </li>
            <li> Look at some of the other reviews on this clipper set.</li>
            <li> Used several hair razors and found most to be too weak, and some to be very hard to hold because of poor design.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe only complaint is that if you don&#x27;t keep it in the bathroom or some other place, the pieces are too prone to scatter unless you&#x27;re obsessively organized.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the hassle.  </li>
            <li> Worked well for about a year, then thin plastic housing cracked and makes an extremely loud noise.</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t very sharp anymore.  </li>
            <li> I tried using half a bottle of lubricating oil, which I specifically bought for these clippers, thinking that was the problem.</li>
            <li> I started feeling a slight pulling on my hair.</li>
            <li> On one side of the plastic comb guide there is a ridge to hold the comb guide in place on the shaver, and on the other side over half of the plastic ridge has been cut away so that there is just a small sliver of plastic to hold the comb guide in place.  </li>
            <li> Ive given it Four stars because it is a bit heavy to hold after a while.</li>
            <li> You would think with everyone going green.</li>
            <li> My complaint is that it&#x27;s hard to get single replacement combs...</li>
            <li> I only have one real complaint...</li>
            <li> After a few months they start to pull the hair (went dull</li>
            <li> Excessive vibration that loosened the screws.</li>
            <li> Notice the other reviews of folks looking to replace their broken comb guides.  </li>
            <li> I did not know that this product would give me hard time. .  </li>
            <li> ...the blades go dull and can&#x27;t be replaced.</li>
            <li> My experience with this product is that it does not cut hardly at all.  </li>
            <li> The blade seemed to be dull from the beginning and always pulled hair.</li>
            <li> The baldes are just now getting dull.</li>
            <li> I, on the other hand, am disappointed with their product and will avoid buying a Remington -- of any sort - in the future.</li>
            <li> and I never once had a problem or complaint.</li>
            <li> Lately the blades have been seizing for some reason and I have to move the blade around to get it working again.</li>
            <li> my last haircut it started going off and on while cutting.  </li>
            <li> The negative reviews are non-sense.</li>
            <li> My sons hair is thick and silky, I have to start with the longer combs and work my way shorter</li>
            <li> Very disapointed it is hands down the worst I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> Someone seriously screwed up.</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> Another user with broken guide blades.  </li>
            <li> I have 5 crack or broken blades which renders the razor almost useless.  </li>
            <li> The Conair and the Wahl were forgettable.</li>
            <li> It gave me some weird noises in the beginning but disappeared.  </li>
            <li> Terrible drop in quality from the last one I owned.</li>
            <li> these clippers are not even suited for casual home use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> therefor, the shaver is useless for cutting that hair length.  </li>
            <li> This one has lasted less than two months before succumbing to a horrible deafening clatter.</li>
            <li> I usually like Remington products but this hair clipper is horrible.</li>
            <li> was disappointed with these clippers and never used them again.</li>
            <li> You will be disappointed if you have used anything else!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve owned the exact same clipper for about 6 years now and it was a workhorse.  So when it died on me, I decided to buy the exact same model.  All of the old attachments fit the new clipper which may comfort some people but I rarely use the attachments.  I mainly use the clippers, with no attachments, to buzz my head.  These new clippers have a little less power because you feel the motor start to cutout and they pull the stubbies of my scalp.  With the old clipper, I would buzz my head once sometimes twice a week.  But since these new clippers tug the stubbies, I now have to buzz it 3 times a week.  It does leave a close enough cut where it almost looks you&#x27;ve shaved your head but the tugging will cause ingrown hairs if you let it grow for too long, hence the 3 times a week.  Another case of a great product revamped to bologna...</li>
            <li> Bought my first one about 5 years ago or so at Wal Mart and as soon as I tried it I knew it was the best set of clippers I had ever tried. I&#x27;ve had clippers from Conair, Wahl, and Andis too by the way. The Conair and the Wahl were forgettable. The Andis T-outliner is nice for edge ups, but it gets way too hot way too fast and needs frequent oiling. The Andis Pro-Motor clipper is better than the Conair for sure, but it also gets hot and needs frequent oiling.&lt;br /&gt;I used my Remington for years trouble free without oiling and I never once had a problem or complaint. All was going great until I tried to MacGyver it one day and sharpen the blades......that didn&#x27;t go se well. So I&#x27;m going back to what works for me, the Remington Precision Pro. I ordered it here on Amazon last night. If you do get one I hope you like it as much as I did and still do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;02/11/13 follow up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed with these clippers and never used them again. I couldn&#x27;t find an exact replacement of the 8017 that I had, but I went with the updated model and they work fairly well. Still not as good as my original, but good nonetheless.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great trimmer. I&#x27;ve had one for two years, still cuts like new. The problem is the guide combs break, EASILY! and you can&#x27;t buy just a replacement for the one you use. You have to buy a set of 6 different ones for $6.00, when you only need the one. Which WILL break again.    After the last one broke, I bought a different brand with better guide combs. I kept the Remington for the dog, he&#x27;s not particular!</li>
            <li> Other reviewers were right here...After a few months they start to pull the hair (went dull I guess).  They say do not oil...so I didn&#x27;t.  Just threw them out and just purchased another brand that had higher ratings.</li>
            <li> I purchaded a set of Wahl clippers about 5 years ago and have been cutting my own hair for that period of time.  I thought I would upgrade and get me a new set.  I liked the looks of the Remington HC-921 kit.  I purchased it and have used it one time.  I don&#x27;t think I will use it again.  If the plastic guards were any cheaper and flimsy, they would break.  As far as the clippers themselves, they work fine, but I use a guard when I cut my hair.  If the guard does not work well, then it really does not matter how the clippers cut.  I think I will continue using my 5 year old Wahl clippers that I paid less that $20.00 for until I can get another set like them.  Would not purchase this product unless you want a set of clippers that you are not going to use guards with.  You will be disappointed if you have used anything else!</li>
            <li> Having used the cordLESS version for years, I&#x27;ve decided to switch to the CORDED version because recently the cordless versions have been giving me lots of problems.  So far this model has been trouble-free for the most part and it&#x27;s almost a year old now. It gave me some weird noises in the beginning but disappeared.  Lately the blades have been seizing for some reason and I have to move the blade around to get it working again.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve owned this product for almost 5 years.  it didn&#x27;t need oiling for about 2-3 years, then i purchased blade oil(although product states it doesn&#x27;t need oiling its life), and worked like new.  i&#x27;ve never went to the barber while i had this machine.  i cut about every month, possibly every 1.5 month.  also cut my roommates hair multiple times as well.  my last haircut it started going off and on while cutting.  luckily i was able to finish the cut, but i am in the market to purchase the same one b/c of the price and reliability.  i&#x27;ve even dropped it IN THE TOILET, and on concrete multiple times cracking the plastic handle that sticks out to adjust blade.  through all that it still worked.  for me it had a life for about 5 years, and was one of the greatest $20 investments i&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good looking machine but the first time the i use it pull hair like crazy im going to put a little bit of oil to see what happen right now im okay with it hopefully work better next time .</li>
            <li> I bought this HC-921 about 18 months ago.  It was GREAT for about fifteen months &amp; used it once a month. Then, suddenly the last time I used it it was not cutting well and pulling alot.  Now it doesn&#x27;t cut at all.    The product cover says \\&quot;Lube-For-Life TITANIUM coated blades\\&quot; but the enclosed brochure says, \\&quot;The blades on your HC-70 hair clipper should be oiled before every haircut\\&quot;???  (I never oiled them.)  Whatever - the blades no longer cut!  Servicing &amp; sharpening the blades costs more than replacement.</li>
            <li> Great product, and it is so quiet. Bought it for my boyfriend for xmas and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> I bought this clipper to cut my brother&#x27;s hair and for him to cut mine. We also use it on our dog (a golden retriever). It cuts well; though for thicker hair it helped a lot to cut some of it off first with a scissors (especially for my brother&#x27;s long curly hair and for the dog). We only do buzz cuts, but the scissors is very sharp and I imagine would work well for taper cuts. It is fairly quiet and the vibrations are minimal. It has already paid for itself between the hair cuts for me and my brother (would have been about $10-12 each), and my dog (would have probably cost upwards of $20 at a groomer). I haven&#x27;t used it very frequently so we will see how it holds up over the test of time (it has a 5 year warranty). I also bought a bottle of hair clipper oil to use once in a while, though the box claims the blades will never need to be oiled. Overall, I highly recommend this product for home hair cuts for people and/or pets.      AMMENDMENT: In fact, this product broke after only a few months of use. It turns on, but simply does not cut hair; it basically tries to yank the hairs out of your head. I bought a Wahl brand clipper that has lasted over a year and still works fine. I would not recommend this product after all.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a replacement for another Remington trimmer that finally went kaput.  This unit has a powerful motor, very sharp blades and a large kit that includes everything.  I only have one real complaint...I don&#x27;t like the clip-on style of combs. Our old one had slide-ons and the combs had many more teeth which were not as sharp.  It allowed hair to move through more smoothly which kept you from ripping hair out.  Other than that, my whole family is quite happy!</li>
            <li> I believe the guides were designed to break.  On one side of the plastic comb guide there is a ridge to hold the comb guide in place on the shaver, and on the other side over half of the plastic ridge has been cut away so that there is just a small sliver of plastic to hold the comb guide in place.  Once that piece breaks off - and it will - the comb will not stay on the shaver, and therefor, the shaver is useless for cutting that hair length.  All of the guides are designed this way - to break.  Notice the other reviews of folks looking to replace their broken comb guides.  Shameless, that a company would do this.  Stay away from this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason you could possibly want this is if you only used the shaver without the guides.  You know, to shave practically bald.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. Cuts well and efficiently. I cut my own hair with it and dint get any bald patches by mistake- Therefore this product is a big WIN! The guides are plastic but not the breakable type so that&#x27;s great.   Lots of different types of guides, clips among other things. Highly Recommended.   Ive given it Four stars because it is a bit heavy to hold after a while. Otherwise no complains</li>
            <li> I had a prior Remington hair clipper that was the cordless version of this model and it lasted FIVE YEARS. This one has lasted less than two months before succumbing to a horrible deafening clatter. It was quiet for the first month and then the clatter slowly emerged. The clippers are now unusable. Terrible drop in quality from the last one I owned.</li>
            <li> this product doesn&#x27;t deserve even one star.  it stopped working in the middle of the first haircut on my son; i had to finish the haircut with scissors.</li>
            <li> I bought a set of these clippers at a department store about 3 years ago, after having gone through at least 3 sets of cheap clippers in a year&#x27;s time.  All were made in China and were pure junk.  Weight seems to be a first indication of how they are made, and these are heavier and feel more sturdy than most of the cheap department store clippers.  They have more power and don&#x27;t pull my hair like most cheaper models do.  Eventually I did start having problems with the blades, and when I went to replace them I found they were no longer sold in the store.  I ordered another pair from Amazon because of how long the first one lasted me, and free shipping.  The newer model feels the same, but it does look like they&#x27;ve gone cheaper on the guide combs.  Fortunately I still have my old guide combs which fit and will hopefully last me a while.  4 stars as they are decent for the money. I&#x27;m sure there are better sets out there if you want to spend more, but figuring in the cost of haircuts over the 1-2 years they will likely last they&#x27;re well worth $20.  Just be careful with the plastic guides.</li>
            <li> After receiving the hair clippers i was very excited to get cutting, i cut my own hair.  For the first two hair cuts it was a fantastic product and did the main grooming perfectly, you will need a pair of small trimmers for the edges and beard trimming.  After that it started making a knocking noise so loud that i couldnt use it.  After cleaning it and removing excess hair, I found that if i jammed a small Q-tip under the back of the blade it would stop the noise but being a new instrument i shouldnt have to do that.  Have not tried the hassle of returning it yet..</li>
            <li> I did not know that this product would give me hard time. .  It dose not cut as my old five dollars one.</li>
            <li> A big advantage of this powerful clipper is that its teeth never need to be oiled - which I like since the oil applied to my old clipper caused acne (go figure).  Liked it so much that I bought two more for future use a few years ago, but I am still on the first one.  Seems to last forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I had initially was that the teeth got out of alignment after I dropped it.  I couldn&#x27;t get it to cut right again, so I exchanged it for a replacement model.  Perhaps it was an unusual mishap, but now I handle this clipper carefully to avoid a repeat problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One feature I wish it did have was a lock on the adjustable / sliding head.  I&#x27;ve seen that feature on other manufacturers and it would be important to have if the plastic attachments don&#x27;t clip hair close enough for your needs.</li>
            <li> Not good. Had to trow away. Excessive vibration that loosened the screws. I had a HC920 and loved it. No comparison.</li>
            <li> After using a Wahl clipper, the difference is night and day! The Reminington is very quiet, feels much better built, very easy and comfortable to use. The blades are sharp and the fact that you don&#x27;t have to lube them is an added plus. Comes with a nice case with lots of attachments. Very pleased with this - highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Used several hair razors and found most to be too weak, and some to be very hard to hold because of poor design.  The Remington is excellent in design and function.  Quiet, strong and easily maneuvered.</li>
            <li> The first few times I used the clippers they worked just fine.  But after about 15 hair cuts the blade wasn&#x27;t very sharp anymore.  It took forever and pulled on the hairs.  It&#x27;s not worth the hassle.  If you&#x27;re looking for a quick \\&quot;disposable\\&quot; set of clippers these are the ones for you.</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair, very short, whats left of it. For the price of a two haircuts at the barber I can do my own for a long time. Works good, cuts well. Didn&#x27;t need all the attatchments but someone might. Had another one just like it and couldn&#x27;t find it at the retail stores anymore but here it was on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Either we are doing something &amp;#34;wrong&amp;#34; or we lucked out because we have had this set since they were new on the market (so maybe 7 years) and have never had a problem with them. Maybe they were really good at first and then the company got sloppy?  My husbands hair is like a bristle brush and he shaves his head every 6 to 8 weeks. My sons hair is thick and silky, I have to start with the longer combs and work my way shorter but it still cuts it very easily. And no one complains about it pulling their hair. My complaint is that it&#x27;s hard to get single replacement combs... in Canada, one broke when it fell off the counter (the comb not the unit) and we need a new one, Remington has them but doesn&#x27;t ship to Canada and doesn&#x27;t take Canadian billing addresses even if we use a US shipping address. But other than that we love this set.</li>
            <li> ...the blades go dull and can&#x27;t be replaced. Then you&#x27;re stuck with the guilt of sending a perfectly good motor and casing to the landfill. Not very environmentally friendly, Remington.     I will never again trust a clipper with non-replaceable blades. The low price of this product is just not worth the headache and waste it produces.</li>
            <li> I am using it for over a month and a had no problem , work just fine . &lt;br /&gt;If you are thinking in  to buy this , do it .</li>
            <li> I used the Remington twice up to now, and the bottom line it is a great machine, you will never need to lube it, and that is a big deal with clippers. its easy to clean, sharp and easy to work with.</li>
            <li> As a barber I know my clippers and these are nice and affordable clippers. Never before had I gotten such nice crewcuts as I did with these. Pixies are also very good for these too. Buzzcuts especially are over with quickly due to the quality of this machine. So if you are a barber or a home barber buy these. Keep in mind these are also great for girls to give them a nice cute and low maintinence pixie not just for boys!</li>
            <li> Perhaps these other people had bought the product before they lowered the quality.  My experience with this product is that it does not cut hardly at all.  I threw the item in the trash and bought a ConAir at Kmart which surprisly worked about 20 times better.  My recommendation is DO NOT BUY!</li>
            <li> Purchased the product after reading many reviews and have been very pleased with it.  Appears to be well made and having purchased several trimmers over the years, this is the best one yet.  Price was considered to be good also.</li>
            <li> I bought these clippers for my dog. She and I think they&#x27;re great,and very quit. Takes the buzz out of a buzz cut</li>
            <li> the box the product came in is the best feature of this item.  on first haircut my wife was pulling the hair out by the roots to cut the hair.  we stopped using this new product &amp; finished w the old shears.  i am sending this back &amp; buying another costing three times the money &amp; figure my scalp is worth it.</li>
            <li> Worked great for the 3+ years (maybe 11-14 times) I&#x27;ve used it. (Haven&#x27;t used it in nearly the past year, as allowed my hair to grow!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe only complaint is that if you don&#x27;t keep it in the bathroom or some other place, the pieces are too prone to scatter unless you&#x27;re obsessively organized.</li>
            <li> Please beware - you will not get what you see in the picture above.  The hair guards you see pictured are not the same ones you will receive.  They&#x27;re significantly wider between the individual blades, flimsy, and contain one-less \\&quot;blade\\&quot; in them.  For those of you who know how to cut hair, you&#x27;ll realize this means a poorer, less-even look on the hair.  You also do NOT get the 1/8th guard as is shown in the picture above.  Its simply not included.  Someone seriously screwed up.</li>
            <li> These are basically disposable hair clippers, because Remington doesn&#x27;t sell replacement blades. Plus the blade doesn&#x27;t last very long at all. So these clippers will end up where mine are going. The landfill!!! I wish that wasn&#x27;t the case, but I have no other choice. I tried using half a bottle of lubricating oil, which I specifically bought for these clippers, thinking that was the problem. It made absolutely no difference. DON&#x27;T let the Titanium name fool you either. I saw the name Titanium &amp; it made me think strong &amp; durable. The unit itself may be strong &amp; durable, but the blade is not. The first few times it works really good &amp; is pretty quiet. That will explain many of the positive reviews. People try it once or twice &amp; write their review. After 4 or 5 times using these clippers. I started feeling a slight pulling on my hair. Then I needed to start going slower &amp; slower to allow it to cut. Now it just catches on my hair &amp; will barely cut at all. It is a shame that I have to throw the clippers out, because they don&#x27;t sell replacement blades. I checked all over &amp; even went to a site that just sells replacement parts. There were no matches for this model. If I had a new blade. These clippers would be as good as new. You would think with everyone going green. That Remington would give you a chance to buy new blades, but they don&#x27;t. Until they change that or make the blade more durable. You should avoid buying this clipper set. Take my advice &amp; spend a little more money or buy a different model. If I had the money I would buy what the professionals use, which is Oster clippers. Oster sells replacement blades &amp; are made to last a lifetime (If you take care of them properly), which is why they cost so much. I just don&#x27;t have the money to buy them right now, but if you do. You should really think of buying a oyster hair clipper set.     Look at some of the other reviews on this clipper set. I am not the only one complaining that the blade gets dull fast. I am only writing this review now, because I am looking for a new clipper kit to replace these ones. You shouldn&#x27;t expect to use these clippers for more then a few months, if that. If you spend a little more money. You can buy clippers that will last a few years. Just make sure to read ALL the reviews both good &amp; bad.</li>
            <li> I usually like Remington products but this hair clipper is horrible. The blade seemed to be dull from the beginning and always pulled hair. We followed the instructions with oiling the blade, etc. but it still is not getting any better.  I would not recommend getting this clipper.</li>
            <li> Another user with broken guide blades.  Razor works...just checked I have 5 crack or broken blades which renders the razor almost useless.  I also have a Wahl that I&#x27;m happy with.  It also came with a 1/16 guide blade.  Good for blending.</li>
            <li> Great product, easy to use. I&#x27;ve had it over a year and had no problems with it. The cut is sharp and the guides really help. Heck, I can even cut my hair by myself! It&#x27;s paid for itself 10 times over since I haven&#x27;t been to a traditional barber in over a year. Glad I made this purchase!</li>
            <li> We have had our set so long that I can not remember when we bought them. We know over 7 years. I cut my son&#x27;s and husband&#x27;s hair the whole time. We love not having to oil them. The baldes are just now getting dull.Ordering another pair.</li>
            <li> The negative reviews are non-sense. I have thick hair and it has worked perfectly for over 5 years now. Unless you abuse it, it will work for many years for almost all hair types.</li>
            <li> Good Product for the price. It has all the pieces to use for the hair cut. It is best suitable for the trimming and home hair cut.</li>
            <li> excellent for the price</li>
            <li> Cheaper then the barber</li>
            <li> Worked well for about a year, then thin plastic housing cracked and makes an extremely loud noise.</li>
            <li> I had purchased a Remington Titanium about five years ago and loved it! After dropping these clippers several times over the years and through regular wear-and-tear, however, it was time to get a new unit. Unsurprisingly, I purchased another Titanium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I was punished for my loyalty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I can&#x27;t comment on the supplementary pieces as I don&#x27;t use them, the unit itself saw more metal components substituted with plastic; the cord length was halved; and the motor appeared weaker or blades were/went dull (stalls frequently when cutting my hair.) Forget salon quality ... these clippers are not even suited for casual home use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure the executives behind these &#x27;quality&#x27; choices are enjoying their bonuses. I, on the other hand, am disappointed with their product and will avoid buying a Remington -- of any sort - in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these for around 4 years now and they are ok considering the price. Maybe a year or two into using them though, they started producing a loud knocking noise. I&#x27;ve tried everything to quiet it and nothing has worked. At this point, the sound is so loud it&#x27;s unbearable. I have to plug my ears, otherwise i think they would honestly damage my hearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend finding a different set of clippers...</li>
            <li> Very disapointed it is hands down the worst I have ever owned. Now I am going to have to order a Wahl set.</li>
            <li> The Remington HC-921 Titanium PrecisionPro Deluxe 22 Piece Corded Haircut Kit is a good buy for the money and lasted a few years before having to be replaced.</li>
            <li> 100% original, recomendado.</li>
