            <li>LOVE the daily Vitamin C moisturizer with 30 SPF.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this Sublime Sampler to my friends!!</li>
            <li>My personal favorite is the vitamin C day cream w SPF 30....</li>
            <li>The first item I tried was the Vitamin C SPF 30 Day Cream.</li>
            <li>The most precious little gift box ever!!  </li>
            <li>A daily sunscreen is essential for good skincare</li>
            <li>Not enough to know if you will actually see any skin changes, but you get a good feeling of the texture, the odor, the way your skin feels after you apply.</li>
            <li>These products sell at high end prices and are worth every cent.</li>
            <li>It really helped my usually dry, flaky skin look much more moisturized and the flaky spots were gone.</li>
            <li>Decent amounts for samples!  </li>
            <li>so I am thrilled to give her this little sample box.  </li>
            <li>I received a nice little box but NO instructions.  </li>
            <li>The samples all come in nice little jars or spay bottles.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like the feel of face products with clay in it, so while this is not my cup of tea it does seem like a well-made product.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a very distinctive scent to me at all.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t seem to have much of a scent either.</li>
            <li>The serum absorbs really fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been hearing a lot of good things about Hyaluronic Serums lately</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t tried a few of these Sublime Beauty products yet so it was nice to get a chance.</li>
            <li>I am greatful to have got invited to test this out for an introductory price...now I can know exactly which new ones I will order.</li>
            <li>I personally have been very satisfied with every single item included.</li>
            <li>First of all I love the little box this sampler comes in.</li>

            <li> Apply this lotion after the gel has been thoroughly absorbed.</li>
            <li> and i even used something in this box for the first time and then turned around and ordered the true size.  </li>
            <li> The Collagen mask is such a nice way to pamper your skin.</li>
            <li> So far I have enjoyed all the products with no issues.</li>
            <li> Whisperer Gel - Pink gel like consistency that gives a nice cool effect when you use it.</li>
            <li> The first one is Gylocolic Salicylic (Have fun watching through me</li>
            <li> Even though it is a little thicker it goes on really well and feels great.  </li>
            <li> It feels pretty good but a little sticky afterwards but not to sticky.</li>
            <li> First of all...</li>
            <li> Love the sample kit especially for travel!</li>
            <li> Facial Oil - There is no scent to this and the spray bottle gives out perfect small amounts for you to apply to your skin.</li>
            <li> This serum is the lightest so this should be used first.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin so soft and gives it a smooth look.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> LOVE the daily Vitamin C moisturizer with 30 SPF.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this Sublime Sampler to my friends!!</li>
            <li> My personal favorite is the vitamin C day cream w SPF 30....</li>
            <li> The first item I tried was the Vitamin C SPF 30 Day Cream.</li>
            <li> The most precious little gift box ever!!  </li>
            <li> A daily sunscreen is essential for good skincare</li>
            <li> Not enough to know if you will actually see any skin changes, but you get a good feeling of the texture, the odor, the way your skin feels after you apply.</li>
            <li> These products sell at high end prices and are worth every cent.</li>
            <li> It really helped my usually dry, flaky skin look much more moisturized and the flaky spots were gone.</li>
            <li> Decent amounts for samples!  </li>
            <li> so I am thrilled to give her this little sample box.  </li>
            <li> I received a nice little box but NO instructions.  </li>
            <li> The samples all come in nice little jars or spay bottles.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like the feel of face products with clay in it, so while this is not my cup of tea it does seem like a well-made product.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a very distinctive scent to me at all.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t seem to have much of a scent either.</li>
            <li> The serum absorbs really fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been hearing a lot of good things about Hyaluronic Serums lately</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t tried a few of these Sublime Beauty products yet so it was nice to get a chance.</li>
            <li> I am greatful to have got invited to test this out for an introductory price...now I can know exactly which new ones I will order.</li>
            <li> I personally have been very satisfied with every single item included.</li>
            <li> First of all I love the little box this sampler comes in.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get the opportunity to try this out during a recent promotion.  </li>
            <li> My first impression of this sampler was WOW!</li>
            <li> of the products are nicely packed in small containers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m particularly excited about the facial oil, it is one of my favorite products and the little spritz bottle is perfection.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to try some new ones too like the LUXURIOUS FACIAL OIL and Cellulite Whisperer Gel &amp; Lotion.  </li>
            <li> a gentle skin exfoliator, brings new skin to the surface&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> There is no scent to them which I love because most cellulite products I&#x27;ve tried had a weird odor to them.</li>
            <li> This is high quality skin care</li>
            <li> She loves having high end beauty products</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this sampler to everyone.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this Sublime Sampler from Sublime Beauty for anyone who is interested in their products!</li>

            <li> This is a light yellowish white cream, its consistency is thin and runny and goes on pretty smoothly that can be used for use at night to repair skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the asking price is very reasonable because it will last you quite a while!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love to get a few of these to give to my friends as gifts to get them hooked on Sublime Beauty!</li>
            <li> I think after using a few of these products for at least a month, a better result would be more visible.</li>
            <li> To be totally honest I would never purchase this product simply because I can&#x27;t get past the smell.  </li>
            <li> The well made box is black accented with pink polka-dots  and a cute pink and white ribbon on the top.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore when a company puts effort into their packaging, especially when it comes to HBA items.</li>
            <li> Made my skin radiant and soft.</li>
            <li> Mask- firms and tones mature skin&lt;</li>
            <li> This should only be used at night because the product can break down in light.</li>
            <li> I noticed it did clear the tiny little bumps on my face and smooth it out without reddening it.</li>
            <li> The sampler comes in this adorable little gift box that I will definitely be saving to reuse in the future.</li>
            <li> Wish I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased, not worth it, have not found useful.</li>

            <li> I am a HUGE fan of Sublime!  Their products are second to none in my opinion.  Every single thing I have used by them is amazing and gives me great results.  I have wanted my Mom to try their products but she can&#x27;t justify the expense so I am thrilled to give her this little sample box.  First of all...how cute is this box?  (You know I&#x27;m going to ask her to give it back to me after she takes the samples out--lol!)  The sampler includes 9 of their best and most popular items.  Five of the samples come in little pots and four in little spray bottles that are all reusable. They are perfect sizes for travel or to carry in your purse.  If you haven&#x27;t tried Sublime yet this is a great opportunity for you to do so at a great price.  The following are included in this box:  retinal serum, collagen mask, cellulite whisperer lotion and gel, vitamin C day cream, collagen serum, hyaluronic serum, glycolic serum and luxurious facial oil (a new one for me). There is also a sheet that lists the ingredients in each product and gives you a link on where to go for more product info.  This is high quality skin care and I can&#x27;t wait for my Mom to try it.  I am so thankful to have received this for my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> It did not have instructions of what to do ;((</li>
            <li> Love the sample kit especially for travel! It contains some of my favorites from Sublime.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:f86cfd4582bf8841d3542d98fe94fb1]] First of all I love the little box this sampler comes in.It is very cute and definitely gift giving worthy.This is a small sampler box about 5\\&quot; by 5\\&quot; give or take.It comes with sample sized creams,serums, &amp; even a mask with this sampler box which I thought was cute.The one thing I did not like about this product is that they did not include any instructions inside the gift box on how to use these products.They only included a paper that had all the ingredients listed on them.I had to go back to the listing to see what to use each of these for but they instruct you to go to their website which I list below.Here is what you get and what I thought of each product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1- Vitamin C Day Cream SPF 30 -Nice and creamy white cream that goes on pretty smoothly and blends well into my skin.It feels pretty good but a little sticky afterwards but not to sticky.I believe it could be from the SPF that is in it.So far it works pretty good.For sun protection and moisturization of skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1- Retinol Serum - Use after cleansing and before any other serum or cream. To be used only at night since it will break down in sunlight.Let it absorb before adding other products.This is a light yellowish white cream, its consistency is thin and runny and goes on pretty smoothly that can be used for use at night to repair skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1-Collagen Mask - is spa quality and weekly or twice monthly.I thought this was pretty neat to include a small jar of collagen mask in this sampler.Definitely has a mask like consistency feels nice on my skin and I am glad I did not break out from any of these.My skin is very sensitive.10-15 minutes on cleansed skin is all it takes to do its magic!  Wipe gently with a wet washcloth then rinse with cool water&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1-Cellulite Whisperer Gel - Pink gel like consistency that gives a nice cool effect when you use it.Massage the gel in after dry skin brushing or exfoliation.  Let it absorb while you massage it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1-Cellulite Whisperer Lotion - After the Cellulite Whisperer Gel has absorbed, apply the lotion and massage it into your skin. The lotion absorbs quickly and is soothing.Pink creamy consistency that goes on well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1-Luxurious Facial Oil - There is no scent to this and the spray bottle gives out perfect small amounts for you to apply to your skin.I like this one because it helps moisturize my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1-Collagen Peptide Serum -The serum can be applied twice daily, after cleansing and before any creams.Gel like consistency and sprays well out of the bottle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1-Glycolic Serum - love to use this brighten the skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1-Hyaluronic Serum- Use twice daily - ideal to apply just after the Collagen Serum, which is good for plumping and bringing hydration/glow&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; These make a great sample box to have while traveling you got a mini spa treatment all in this box.The only downside for me with this is you have to go to their website to see the directions on how to use this.I was a little disappointed because no directions were included only a card directing to website.Other than that they are very neat sample sized products and so far I like them.I love that I can use the jars for DIY Lipbalm as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Website for directions on how to use all these can be found here: www.sublime-beauty.net/sublime-sampler&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Sample provided to me at discount for evaluation.r Lotion - After the Cellulite Whisperer Gel has absorbed, apply the lotion and massage it into your skin.

            <li> I enjoyed the selection of the 9 skincare samples.  5 came in little containers and 4 in reusable spray bottles.  The Box they came In was very pretty.  Lotions were very smooth and spread very easily.  I noticed a bit of improvement around the eyes. I was happy to see that the product was made in the USA.</li>
            <li> I started using the face washing product and it is super.  I wanted to sample the other products.  I received a nice little box but NO instructions.  I contacted Sublime Beauty and was told to go on line and find the instructions.  I didn&#x27;t like that.  I want the instructions WITH the product.  I don&#x27;t have time to search online for each product&#x27;s instructions.  I won&#x27;t bother with this company again.</li>
            <li> Thank you for my purchase it was nice to have something to try befor I buy the big bottles I hope to be ordering from you again.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:7c7edf3ceb204f0a5c8e209b0433a3a7]]The Sublime Sampler is great for gifting. Its comes with 9 skincare samples.&lt;br /&gt;The samples included are-&lt;br /&gt;COLLAGEN PEPTIDE SERUM&lt;br /&gt;LUXURIOUS FACIAL OIL&lt;br /&gt;RETINOL SERUM WITH VITAMIN C&lt;br /&gt;HYALURONIC SERUM&lt;br /&gt;GLYCOLIC SERUM&lt;br /&gt;COLLAGEN ANTIOXIDANT MASK&lt;br /&gt;SPF 30 VITAMIN C DAY CREAM&lt;br /&gt;CELLULITE WHISPERER GEL&lt;br /&gt;CELLULITE WHISPERER LOTION&lt;br /&gt;Each of the products are nicely packed in small containers. The creams come in a small jar and the serums or oil come in tiny tube bottles. They are really cute and very nice products too. They are great for your skin and its a complete package for healthy skin. You may use the products and decide which suit you and which don&#x27;t. The full size products are available on amazon so you may try each out then purchase the full size.&lt;br /&gt;It comes in an amazing gift box which makes this the perfect gift. I was lucky to receive this at full discount for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> The sampler comes in this adorable little gift box that I will definitely be saving to reuse in the future. I absolutely adore when a company puts effort into their packaging, especially when it comes to HBA items. You get 9 samples of Sublime Beauty products and I&#x27;m going to give you all my thoughts and impressions on each sample; I had to look up what each item was so I&#x27;ll also give a quick overview of what the product is for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-First up, we have the Retinol Serum with vitamin C.  It&#x27;s a yellowish colored cream and it smells uhm, interesting.  It&#x27;s supposed to reduce wrinkles and rejuvenate your skin.  To be totally honest I would never purchase this product simply because I can&#x27;t get past the smell.  It doesn&#x27;t smell horrible, but if I&#x27;m going to apply something to my face daily I want to like the way it smells.  This retails for $39.99 for .5 oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Next up we have the Vitamin C Day Cream SPF 30.  This is a white cream and it&#x27;s a little thicker than a lotion, but it smells ABSOLUTELY incredible! It&#x27;s SPF 30 so obviously it gives you protection from damaging sun rays.  It also has Aloe, Vitamin A, and Vitamin E to help moisturize and replenish your skin. I would definitely purchase this cream.  A daily sunscreen is essential for good skincare and I&#x27;m sold on the smell alone. Even though it is a little thicker it goes on really well and feels great.  This retails for $39.99 for 1.7 oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The Cellulite Whisper Gel is a pink almost gel like lotion. It smells like yummy grapefruit, which would make sense because it has Organic Gotu Kola, Grapefruit &amp; Caffeine.  It is supposed to help the appearance of cellulite. I can&#x27;t speak to how this product works as I think it would take some time to really notice a difference, but if you are looking for a product to try and reduce the appearance of cellulite this one smells excellent! It retails for $39.00 for 8oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The collagen mask is a really thick white heavy lotion.  It&#x27;s a mask so it&#x27;s definitely heavier than a lotion.  It has Collagen, Cucumber, Aloe, Vitamin E, and French White Clay in it.  The Clay is supposed to exfoliate and the mask is supposed to revive and rejuvenate your skin. I really don&#x27;t like the feel of face products with clay in it, so while this is not my cup of tea it does seem like a well-made product.  It retails for $43.99 for 1.7oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The last &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; is the Cellulite Whisperer Lotion. This is very similar to the gel and smells like yummy grapefruit too. You get all of the same benefits from the lotion as the gel.  This retails for $41 for 8oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Now we move on to the Serums.  You receive 4 samples in the sampler pack. The first one is Gylocolic Salicylic (Have fun watching through me stumble through that one in the video review!) This is best for aging or oily skin. For aging you use it twice a week, for oily, acne prone skin you use it daily. It is supposed to exfoliate and minimize pores. It has kind of an antiseptic smell to it, which doesn&#x27;t bother me. I associate that smell with clean, but it&#x27;s definitely strong. This retails for $39.99 for .5oz&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The Collagen Serum/Peptide Rich is supposed to reduce wrinkles and moisturize your skin. It doesn&#x27;t have a very distinctive scent to me at all. It&#x27;s supposed to help your skin look smoother and healthier.  It retails for $42.99 for .5oz/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The Luxurious Facial Oil is supposed to nourish your skin with vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.  It doesn&#x27;t have a very strong scent, but I&#x27;m not a fan of the scent it does have.  I also don&#x27;t like putting oils on my face so this would not be a go to product for me.  This retails for $24.49 for .5oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;Last, but not least we have the Hyaluronic Serum (Yep, can&#x27;t say that one either!) This is supposed to be great for skin firmness, moisture, and elasticity.  I&#x27;ve been hearing a lot of good things about Hyaluronic Serums lately so I&#x27;m hoping to see some good results with this! This doesn&#x27;t seem to have much of a scent either. This retails for $38.99 for .5 oz&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; My overall impressions are these are well made products and I will definitely be purchasing that Vitamin C Cream with SPF 30 again.  Did I mention I love the way it smells?  I&#x27;m excited to try the collagen products and hope for some results in reducing the appearance of cellulite, either way I&#x27;m going to smell fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this for free product in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.verall impressions are these are well made products and I will definitely be purchasing that Vitamin C Cream with SPF 30 again.

I received this for free product in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Gave me a chance to see which products are for me without it breaking the bank.  So fun trying all the different choices.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like in it is they put in 2 cellulite cream samples, and I don&#x27;t need or want it.  But everything else was great!</li>
            <li> This is a really cute beauty gift set. First off, everything comes nestled in an adorable box. The well made box is black accented with pink polka-dots  and a cute pink and white ribbon on the top. This box can be reused. In the box I received a company card along with a list of product ingredients. There are 9 sample products in the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s in the box?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COLLAGEN SERUM: This serum is the lightest so this should be used first. This can be applied twice a day, after cleansing and before you apply any creams. It comes in a spray bottle and a very faint scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HYALURONIC SERUM: Apply this after the collagen serum. It can be used twice a day. This comes in a spray bottle. It&#x27;s a little thicker than the collagen serum so it takes a little longer to soak into the skin. It hardly has any smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GLYCOLIC SERUM: This is great for oily skin types. You will want to use this daily to help control oil. If you have aging skin, you can use this twice a week to help brighten your skin. This comes in a spray bottle and has a slight alcohol smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LUXURIOUS FACIAL OIL: This is prefect for face and hands. I leave this in my purse and use on my cuticles. It comes in a spray bottle and have a very faint almond scent. You can&#x27;t smell it unless you stick it to your nose. This is one of my favorite products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RETINOL SERUM: This should only be used at night because the product can break down in light. The serum absorbs really fast. It leaves your skin silky smooth. This comes in a jar and has a nutty smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VITAMIN C CREAM: This cream is SPF30. It smells like paradise and reminds me of the beach. It leaves my skin so soft and gives it a smooth look. This cream comes in a jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COLLAGEN MASK: After thoroughly cleansing skin, apply this mask. Leave on skin for 10 to 15 minutes. Gently wipe off with a wet washcloth and rinse with cool water. This comes in a jar and it will leave your skin glowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CELLULITE WHISPERER GEL: Apply this gel before the lotion to help manage cellulite. Massage into skin until absorbed. Use twice daily. This gel comes in a jar and smells like grapefruit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CELLULITE WHISPERER LOTION: Apply this lotion after the gel has been thoroughly absorbed. This lotion is thick but absorbs pretty fast. It has a light grapefruit scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sprays are clear glass bottles and the jars are made of a clear with white tops. All of these are reusable. They are great to throw in your purse and for traveling. The spray bottles are 3 ML and the jars are 1/8th ounce. The samples are good for approximately 4-5 applications,. This travel size set is a great way to try all Sublime&#x27;s beauty products before purchasing the full size product. It&#x27;s even a perfect option for a gift.sage into skin until absorbed.

            <li> Samples are so small, they don&#x27;t really give you a chance to even tell of they work or not. Love the smell of the Vitamin C serum, but didn&#x27;t really help me decide on any of the samples to buy full price. Maybe the Glycolic spritz. I noticed it did clear the tiny little bumps on my face and smooth it out without reddening it.</li>
            <li> This is a great little sampler set. Would make a perfect gift! The packaging is to die for! Come in the adorable polka dot box! Love it! It is packed with 9 samples of facial care items that every woman needs in her daily routine, Vitamin C, Hyaluronic Acid, etc. The samples all come in nice little jars or spay bottles. The products themselves are nice. They all worked well. Made my skin radiant and soft. It was nice to actually be able to get a beauty sample pack. I actually took this on vacation with me and it was perfect for travel. I am happy to recieve this item to review. Will definitely buy some as gifts and to have for future trips!</li>
            <li> This product is great! It makes my skin feel so soft and smooth. I noticed some of my dark spots and blemishes went away and it is such a great variety of products. I ordered myself some of the full size products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I ordered this cuter than ever sampler kit. It gave me a chance to try a little bit of everything and is great for traveling too! I hadn&#x27;t tried a few of these Sublime Beauty products yet so it was nice to get a chance. LOVE the daily Vitamin C moisturizer with 30 SPF. I&#x27;d love to get a few of these to give to my friends as gifts to get them hooked on Sublime Beauty!</li>
            <li> This sampler is a cute gift idea. I like that it comes all ready to be gifted. The box itself is a black square box with a black and white polka dot lid with a pink bow. It comes with 9 different samples.&lt;br /&gt;It includes:&lt;br /&gt;Collagen Peptide Serum&lt;br /&gt;Retinol Serum with Vitamin C&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic Serum&lt;br /&gt;Glycolic Serum&lt;br /&gt;Collagen Antioxidant Mask&lt;br /&gt;Luxurious Facial Oil&lt;br /&gt;Cellulite Whisperer Gel&lt;br /&gt;Cellulite Whisperer Cream&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in package that also meet TSA standards. The only drawbacks for me are the fact that the bottles are glass and breakable and my box didn&#x27;t come with instructions. They do however have instructions on the listing. This is however a cute sampler kit. I would definitely by it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*SAMPLE PROVIDED*</li>
            <li> I love these products so much so that I purchased 5 of them in full size!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is looking brighter and younger even my husband has noyiced!!</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed this cute little box full of wonderful samples. The box is adorable and is reusable, it contains samples of nine Sublime beauty products. Each sample had enough for about four applications which is plenty to determine if you like the product or not. I personally have been very satisfied with every single item included.</li>
            <li> This came in a cute box with samples of serums, lotions, oils of collagen, vitamin C, Retinol, and even a lotion for cellulite . It&#x27;s perfect for traveling and just sampling to see if you like the product to order a bigger size. You do not need to use a lot, so this will last longer than just a couple days so you can get a good idea as to how it is working for you.  I recommend this to get a variety of products to sample.</li>
            <li> A cute sampler that let&#x27;s you try 9 different Sublime Skin Care products. I was able to get 4-5 uses out of each product. Not enough to know if you will actually see any skin changes, but you get a good feeling of the texture, the odor, the way your skin feels after you apply. Enough for you to decide which product you would definitely like to order again.</li>
            <li> The samples are tiny and they aren&#x27;t ur usual serum and moisturizer. The serums are in tiny spray bottles the spray straw takes up space  and a mask for your face. I am not interested in the cellulite creams that came with it. So,I have no idea how to use them. There is a thank you card and a narrow strip of paper with really tiny print I had to get a magnifying glass to read it only has the ingredients listed for some of the products but NO INSTRUCTIONS  Also, I didn&#x27;t intend to order two. They were listed separately on my account They were packaged differently and they both came without instructions. So $40 of products I don&#x27;t know how to use. I will try to contact them and post an update.</li>
            <li> How cute is this box?! Seriously, this is the cutest sampler I have ever purchased! It comes with 9 different skincare items in there with a card to list what each one is. I really like that none of these products had a strong scent, it was refreshing for a change. It&#x27;s also really great for traveling because they are perfect travel sized bottles. And don&#x27;t let the price scare you away because even though I received this at a discounted rate for my unbiased review the asking price is very reasonable because it will last you quite a while! I&#x27;ve been using it for well over a week and I still have plenty left! I also see a huge difference in my face. It has become a lot clearer, and my black heads have been decreasing in size, and slowly diminishing, this is honestly a wonderful product, and you should definitely get your hands on it!!</li>
            <li> The SUBLIME SAMPLER from Sublime Beauty is truly sublime!  It includes 9 different Sublime Beauty products.  Five come in little pots and four in little spray bottles that are all reusable.  They are perfect for travel.  I currently use several of Sublime Beauty&#x27;s quality products and I love having these small sizes for on the go.  I always keep the SPF 30 VITAMIN C DAY CREAM and HYALURONIC SERUM in my purse.  I&#x27;m excited to try some new ones too like the LUXURIOUS FACIAL OIL and Cellulite Whisperer Gel &amp; Lotion.  The samples arrive in an oh so cute reusable box.  It is black and the lid has white polka dots.  It&#x27;s finished with a pink ribbon and bow, also with white polka dots.  Whether giving to someone to try Sublime Beauty products for the first time or to a current user such as myself, the SUBLIME SAMPLER will be delightfully welcomed.  Makes a great treat for yourself too.  An insert lists each product&#x27;s ingredients and provides a link to a page with more details about each product, how to use them and what they can do for your skin.  I received this kit to experience in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> The most precious little gift box ever!!  But the samples are so very very tiny that I can&#x27;t even read the printing on them.  There is not nearly enough product to be able to try it out!!  I suggest the samples be much larger, maybe not so many...&lt;br /&gt;Love the box!!</li>
            <li> The SUBLIME SAMPLER from Sublime beauty is the perfect starter kit for anyone interested in starting or rekindling their beauty and skin regime. It comes with nine different products, all focusing on specific skin care needs.&lt;br /&gt;Each set includes one of the following in the spray bottle:&lt;br /&gt;~Collagen Serum- tightens skin and erases fine lines and wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;~Luxurious Facial Oil- softens and moisturizes the skin&lt;br /&gt;~Hyalunic Serum-gives the skin the plumpness and firmness for more youthful looking skin&lt;br /&gt;~Glycolic Serum- a gentle skin exfoliator, brings new skin to the surface&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And each set comes with a small jar of:&lt;br /&gt;~Vitamin C Day Cram SPF 30-protects skin from future signs of aging&lt;br /&gt;~Retinol Serum- protect skin from future signs of aging AND corrects existing damage&lt;br /&gt;~Cellulite Whisperer Lotion-reduces cellulite and smooth the skin for a firmer appearance (love the smell of this!)&lt;br /&gt;~Cellulite Whisper Gel- dissolves toxins that produce cellulite&lt;br /&gt;~Collagen Mask- firms and tones mature skin&lt;br /&gt;I love the results I have gotten since using the Sublime beauty line. My skin looks and feels smoother, brighter and more youthful. These products are made from organic, natural ingredients and are gentle on the skin. I have not experienced any skin irritation using these products. This a great buy and makes a great gift!</li>
            <li> I liked the cute little decorative box.Great travel sized items.feels great on my Skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars and not 5 only because this is a sampler package. There is only enough for about 5-6 applications. I have tried ALL the products. I have no complaints on any of them. I have very sensitive skin and not one of them broke me out, or left my face feeling dry, itchy, or red faced. They all left my face feeling supple and soft. All the products had pleasant to no smell. I feel my face looks brighter and shows more firmness. I think after using a few of these products for at least a month, a better result would be more visible. I wish the sampler provided more information on the products and which ones to use together and how often and when. I had to guess. But I did like how all the products smelled and left my skin.</li>
            <li> Sublime makes amazing products! This sampler was a fantastic way to try out some their product that I don&#x27;t have just yet. Thank you sublime for making this. The packaging was adorable as well and would make a great gift.</li>
            <li> seeing results! will post more!</li>
            <li> Decent amounts for samples!  Great way to try new products.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get the opportunity to try this out during a recent promotion.  These skin care items work fantastic.  My skin never felt so smooth.  I didn&#x27;t have a routine but now I think this has shown the benefits of skincare.  I haven&#x27;t had break outs very bad just the occasional pimple or two.  But now that I am aging I see lines and wrinkles that I never had before.  Just after a few uses this routine has helped those problem areas greatly!!  LOVE THIS!!!</li>
            <li> I am a beauty guru and love trying out new beauty products! I was stoked to be able to purchase this sampler at a promotional price and be able to share my experience with it here with you. The sampler arrives in the cutest reusable box! I am a sucker for polka dots! The box is also really good quality and seems really durable. Inside you will find 9 products, 5 pots and 4 pump bottles, all 9 of these product are in travel size and I would think that one could refill these very easily! The 2 products that I was most excited to try were the Cellulite whisper lotion and gel. Both feel great on! There is no scent to them which I love because most cellulite products I&#x27;ve tried had a weird odor to them. It also contains a collagen mask, retinol serum, Vitamin C day cream with SPF 30, luxurious face oil, hyalouronic serum, glycolic serum and collagen peptide serum. These are not only great for travel but they are great sizes to stick in your purse! I also think this set would make a great gift item, you wouldn&#x27;t even need to wrap it! I would highly recommend this Sublime Sampler to my friends!!</li>
            <li> I have tried some products from Sublime Beauty before and absolutely loved them. So when I was offered this Sublime Sampler with 9 different products for a great deal to try and share my  honest thoughts about it, I definitely ordered it. It arrived and in the cutest little box too! I opened it and was so thrilled with the 9 products in it. There are 2 different moisturizers, 4 different serums, cellulite lotion, cellulite gel, and a collagen mask! I love each of them! I definitely recommend this Sublime Sampler from Sublime Beauty for anyone who is interested in their products!</li>
            <li> Gorgeous set! Beautiful box would make for an excellent gift or storage solution for one&#x27;s beauty station. Absolutely adorable. The quality of the products is second to none - they smell fabulous and feel great on the skin. Decadent lotions, divine serums and rich oils create an elegant set that would be wonderful for travel. Though there are no instructions included, there is a list of ingredients which boast things such as:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pink grapefruit essential oil&lt;br /&gt;organic green tea&lt;br /&gt;pumpkin seed oil&lt;br /&gt;papaya&lt;br /&gt;organic ginger enzyme&lt;br /&gt;dead sea concentrate and minerals&lt;br /&gt;organic rosemary&lt;br /&gt;organic cinnamon&lt;br /&gt;passionflower&lt;br /&gt;shitake mushroom extract&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These ingredients work together to create some wonderfully enticing smells and certainly create the Sublime experience. There is quite an extensive collection of elixers, for a range of uses. I&#x27;m particularly excited about the facial oil, it is one of my favorite products and the little spritz bottle is perfection. I&#x27;m a huge fan of the day cream, which has SPF protection and is great for re-applying and touch ups on the sunny days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I had the chance to review some samples for testing purposes, I think the richness and creamy textures feel like heaven on the skin and I would definitely recommend many of these individually; however, the sampler is great for getting to try each one and how they work together. Fantastic service and I am already checking out the website and subscribing for updates - I can&#x27;t wait to see what else they come up with!</li>
            <li> Very cute sampler set! I was on the fence about buying the products outright, so I am so glad I got to try them out first! The packaging is beautiful, and would make it a great gift. And all of the samples are a good size.. I will be able to use them and decide which ones I will buy full size. Thankfully, they are not the tiny blister pack &amp;#34;samples&amp;#34; that name brands send. I couldnt be more happy with Sublime&#x27;s products :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Tried Discounted Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]</li>
            <li> Wish I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased, not worth it, have not found useful.</li>
            <li> Live the product line that I have already tried and now I have a samples of the others so I can give them a try. I am positive I will love them. They come in a cute box. This is perfect for introducing others to the product line. There are a couple of uses in each sample possible my travel pack as they appear that I could refill them as they run out.</li>
            <li> Love this sampler.  Great for travel and i even used something in this box for the first time and then turned around and ordered the true size.  I love Sublime Beauty.  This is the only anti aging beauty line I have.</li>
            <li> Wow this skincare line is amazing! The box is adorable and the 9 samples inside are the perfect size for traveling and you can test out the product enough to see how it works for your skin. The serums make my face so soft and the vitamin c day cream with spf 30 has a light beautiful scent to it and moisturizes my dry skin. Try this sample box! You won&#x27;t regret it:)</li>
            <li> My first impression of this sampler was WOW! The box is simply gorgeous! I currently use MANY of Sublime Beauty skincare products and I love the brand. This sampler box is perfect for first time users of Sublime bc it has 9 different products to test out. I am greatful to have got invited to test this out for an introductory price...now I can know exactly which new ones I will order. I recommended this already to my sisters and they will be placing their own orders. My personal favorite is the vitamin C day cream w SPF 30....the smell alone is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I have tried the Night and day cream from Sublime and I just cannot speak more highly of it! I purchased this set on promotion to give to my Aunt Tammy. She loves having high end beauty products and I wanted a little something for her. These products sell at high end prices and are worth every cent. I wanted her to try out the entire line so she could see just how awesome they are. The packaging was perfect for a gift and shipping came in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> This is a great little sample set to try Sublime Beauty products before you commit to the full size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set includes:&lt;br /&gt;Collagen Serum&lt;br /&gt;Collagen Mask&lt;br /&gt;Retinol Serum&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic Serum&lt;br /&gt;Glycolic Serum&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C SPF30 Day Cream&lt;br /&gt;Luxurious Facial Oil&lt;br /&gt;Cellulite Whisperer Gel&lt;br /&gt;Cellulite Whisper Lotion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are five pots and 4 perfect for travel vials. The first item I tried was the Vitamin C SPF 30 Day Cream. It was very nice to apply, made my skin feel and look softer, and has a high SPF in it to protect my face. Next was the Glycolic/Salicylic serum. This serum is awesome because of the Salicylic acid to help with acne. The Collagen serum has a nice light scent to it, absorbs into the skin quickly, and helps the signs of aging. The Retinol Serum is great and should be applied at night and followed by a nighttime moisturizer. It helps reduce the signs of aging, dark spots, and uneven skin tone. The Hyaluronic Serum is one of my favorites! It gave my skin an instant glow. My skin looked much healthier after a few days of using it. It really helped my usually dry, flaky skin look much more moisturized and the flaky spots were gone. The Collagen mask is such a nice way to pamper your skin. The Cellulite gel feels so soothing to apply and absorbs quickly so I don&#x27;t have to stand up waiting for it to try on the back of my thighs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is truly a GREAT sampler set for either yourself or for a gift. The product size is perfect for traveling and you can even keep them in your purse. The adorable box they came in just was icing on the already awesome cake that this Sublime Beauty sampler is. I was able to try out new skin care products and find stuff I really enjoyed and will be purchasing the full size of. I HIGHLY recommend this sampler to everyone. *sample provided for testing and review*</li>
            <li> Great presentation, love the chance to try 9 different products.  So far I have enjoyed all the products with no issues.</li>
