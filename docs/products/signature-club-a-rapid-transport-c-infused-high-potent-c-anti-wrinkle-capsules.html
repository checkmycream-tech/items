            <li>I thought it&#x27;d be a regular oil capsule but was surprised to see that it looked like a gold cream instead, and it went on feeling like silk.</li>
            <li>This product may be old or was not stored properly.</li>
            <li>soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest that you cut the nip off when opening it, as I twisted mine and it spewed a good amount everywhere, but there was still plenty for my whole face and half my neck left in the capsule.</li>

            <li> Will never stop using these. Potent, I can feel them work. Makes skin bright!!</li>
            <li> These are GREAT!!  They take away wrinkles!!!  The capsules do what they are intended for.  I especially love them for chest area and neck.</li>
            <li> Got here fast but ...it was in sealed. Guess they are ok but would of liked sealed.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I really like the way it makes my skin feel.  It has lightened some of my dark spots as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product off and on for years. Not only does it fill in fine lines and wrinkles, it soo good for your skin. It feels good and I look good. Thanks</li>
            <li> THIS REALLY DO THE JOB. IT REALLY WORK.I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> This product has so many great uses! I use it to keep new blemishes from scarring. It will also fade old scars if applied directly to the scar overtime. This product has also come to my aid to keep sudden burns from blistering or scarring. Not to mention, it is a great beauty treatment for the face and neck.</li>
            <li> All I use is signature Club AWorks  for me I use nothing else but some rouge and lipstick and undereye cream.  All Signature Club A</li>
            <li> I give this 4 stars because I&#x27;m 22 so I don&#x27;t exactly have wrinkles, and since this is a promotional item for wrinkles, I give it one star less since I&#x27;m cheating :P&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However! This stuff feels amazing on my skin! I thought it&#x27;d be a regular oil capsule but was surprised to see that it looked like a gold cream instead, and it went on feeling like silk. I have naturally oily skin and it mattefied it quite a bit, and my skin feels super soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest that you cut the nip off when opening it, as I twisted mine and it spewed a good amount everywhere, but there was still plenty for my whole face and half my neck left in the capsule. Just a warning! This does not make my skin oily looking or feeling. If i made more than minimum wage, I&#x27;d buy it myself (my grandma bought it for herself haha).</li>
            <li> This is okay for minor wrinkles.  It is what it is.  Cosmetics is a multi million dollar business first than a consumer product.</li>
            <li> I have use this product for years and can attest to the fact that it works.</li>
            <li> Have been using for years and would not be without this product.  Definitely helps the appearance of the face.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> So my mom loves these I refill her. On me I like the night cream w vit C. These are nice and portable tho. I think they do temporarily plump a little.</li>
            <li> YOU CAN SEE THE EFFECT IN A WEEK</li>
            <li> This product may be old or was not stored properly. There is a gritty texture when applying. I had used this product for years and never had this problem.&lt;br /&gt;Will no be ordering from this seller again, sorry.</li>
            <li> It was not fresh, old and dry</li>
            <li> With these and the pump lotion? It&#x27;s all I need for my face and neck. Feels silky</li>
