            <li>This is the best hair wax product out there.</li>
            <li>The product is definitely top-notch and everything</li>
            <li>Awesome stuff.</li>
            <li>This is good stuff!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>A very nice medium hold without being greasy or flaky.  </li>
            <li>always a good product.. smells great.</li>
            <li>Good hold, flexible somewhat sticky matte finish</li>
            <li>the tigi hair stick before and it worked good</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>I bought this because the reviews were so good.  </li>
            <li>Has a pleasant, unobtrusive scent and a nice matte finish.</li>
            <li>My hair stylist put me onto this product and I love it!  </li>
            <li>Mild good smell, washes out great and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>and it tames my hair nicely.</li>
            <li>It also has better, longer holding power and pairs much more nicely with hair sprays than Fiber.</li>
            <li>While there are many comparable products, this has superb hold while still being soft and not leaving a greasy sheen.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for something more plyable.</li>
            <li>; everything from TIGI Bed Head, Crew, pomade, CAT, and much more.</li>
            <li>After many years of using Tony &amp; Guy products, I have found something even better.</li>
            <li>But another big thing that should be noted is that it washes off the BEST and easiest as well out of 3 products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read great reviews about Bumble and Bumble, but I&#x27;d rather not have to heat up a wax every morning, thanks.</li>
            <li>This has given the best results for a dry matte</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also so easy to apply that split ends and</li>
            <li>Fairly easy to restyle after getting wind blown or from wearing a hat.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and wash out.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell either, so it was quite comfortable for me to use this product.</li>
            <li>It also holds fairly and well and is somewhat manageable later on without adding more (although adding more would obviously help texture and molding).</li>
            <li>I have tried a variety of waxes/fibers/pastes/gels for my thick straight hair, and the Bed Head Matte Workable Wax is just the best.  </li>
            <li>Right away you know you are dealing with a carefully designed product because it has a pop top and comes with a plastic seal that is held into place with the screw top.</li>
            <li>Several times, warm water in the shower is enough to remove most of the gunk.</li>
            <li>This last time I liked the look so much I decided to buy the product he put in it.</li>
            <li>super fast shipping</li>
            <li>wily hairs are easy to stick down, just remember to apply a bit more than you think</li>
            <li>this was exactly what I wanted to buy.</li>
            <li>Delivered exactly as promised.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other high rated waxes such as Crew Fiber (3 stars) and Gatsby (1-2 stars) and this is the one that not only worked best for me but is actually the MOST matte (I don&#x27;t like the shiny look at all).</li>
            <li>It gets better because it is so much easier to apply than any of the other hair waxes because it is less of a lumpy paste and more of a smooth cream.</li>
            <li>Would easily recommend to a friend or relative</li>
            <li>haha)</li>
            <li>Its a bit of a waxy feel going on, but once it sets, it really sets.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got really course and wiry hair</li>
            <li>Works real well with my type of hair.</li>
            <li>It has fantastic hold for short to medium hair, even after working out or playing soccer.</li>
            <li>:)&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to those who can&#x27;t get much hold from other hair products.</li>
            <li>Not a thick hold which I like, holds almost like a gel.</li>
            <li>I keep my hair short about a 2.5 blade and this so far has lasted me more than 5 weeks and have about 1/4 of the container left.</li>
            <li>Good hold, especially for thick hair without leaving a greasy shine.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Havnt tested around with it much, but have used once so far, think i used a little too much, but it seems to do its job, and doesnt give your hair that greasy look since its matte.</li>
            <li>Gone through two jars of American Crew Fiber and a few other knock off, but out of the jar, this stuff beats them all handily.</li>
            <li>I prefer the matte look because it looks more sophisticated and less dirty.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little spendy but well worth it.</li>
            <li>My thinning forehead hair is so weak that nothing else holds enough, but this works magically with a touch of spray, even in humid Oregon.</li>
            <li>I am fairly certain I reviewed this product previously, but was prompted by an email to do so again, so here you go:  </li>
            <li>It held my hair pretty firm, and the texture was similar to the products I purchased in Korea (something that I wanted....</li>
            <li>I used the Redken Maneuver Wax previously, but found the hold to be a little too light.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good hold, flexible somewhat sticky matte finish</li>
            <li> My hair stylist put me onto this product and I love it!  Before this matte wax, I was using the AXE hair stuff which always made my hair feel greasy and shiny.  I prefer the matte look because it looks more sophisticated and less dirty.  I am sticking with this TIGI matte wax for a long time.</li>
            <li> this was exactly what I wanted to buy. It held my hair pretty firm, and the texture was similar to the products I purchased in Korea (something that I wanted....haha) It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell either, so it was quite comfortable for me to use this product.</li>
            <li> its not hard glue and its not weak sauce, a little sticky for fingers going through your hair but a little bit goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;used the tigi hair stick before and it worked good but I prefer this</li>
            <li> Mild good smell, washes out great and lasts all day. I keep my hair short about a 2.5 blade and this so far has lasted me more than 5 weeks and have about 1/4 of the container left. Kinda pricey to get but using less quality product is saving me in the long run.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for something more plyable. The only way I can soften the product enough so I can get it out of the container and onto my fingers is by heating the container with a hair dryer prior to applying. I should have paid closer attention to the description and the reviews. I would recommend the Aveda Men Pure-Formance Grooming Clay. It&#x27;s a little spendy but well worth it.</li>
            <li> Gone through two jars of American Crew Fiber and a few other knock off, but out of the jar, this stuff beats them all handily. Right away you know you are dealing with a carefully designed product because it has a pop top and comes with a plastic seal that is held into place with the screw top. It gets better because it is so much easier to apply than any of the other hair waxes because it is less of a lumpy paste and more of a smooth cream. It also has better, longer holding power and pairs much more nicely with hair sprays than Fiber. My thinning forehead hair is so weak that nothing else holds enough, but this works magically with a touch of spray, even in humid Oregon. It&#x27;s also so easy to apply that split ends and wily hairs are easy to stick down, just remember to apply a bit more than you think you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works so well that I got curious about the ingredients VS Fiber. This stuff uses artificial beeswax near the top of the list where others list lanolin (sheep grease), bonus.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery.  Good product.</li>
            <li> This comes in a very hard paste which is not very pleasant to work with.  During application the wax is so sticky that it literally pulls your hair out.  Not &amp;#34;workable&amp;#34; at all...</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of different mens products over the years.; everything from TIGI Bed Head, Crew, pomade, CAT, and much more. This has given the best results for a dry matte just woke up look. Having thick hair, it can be difficult to find something that works well, so if you have thick hair, give it a try.</li>
            <li> Good hold, especially for thick hair without leaving a greasy shine.  Has a pleasant, unobtrusive scent and a nice matte finish. Fairly easy to restyle after getting wind blown or from wearing a hat.</li>
            <li> After many years of using Tony &amp; Guy products, I have found something even better. This is the best hair wax product out there. Also lasts 1 year using every day! Wow!</li>
            <li> Its a bit of a waxy feel going on, but once it sets, it really sets.  Its not the &#x27;playable&#x27; one, like the Tigi Soufflet, but will hold stronger and last longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got really course and wiry hair and it tames my hair nicely. :)&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to those who can&#x27;t get much hold from other hair products.</li>
            <li> Works real well with my type of hair. Delivered exactly as promised. Would easily recommend to a friend or relative</li>
            <li> My stylist always does up my hair after I get it cut but I never follow through and do it later. This last time I liked the look so much I decided to buy the product he put in it. I would give this a 5 star but I don&#x27;t think you get enough for the money. The product is definitely top-notch and everything but I think it is spendy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;GREAT hold without looking greasy or being hard like gel.&lt;br /&gt;I apply when my hair is a little wet and it stays well.&lt;br /&gt;Can sleep either it in and wear it the next day.&lt;br /&gt;Washes out with some work so rain won&#x27;t wash it away or make it drip down your face like gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> I am Asian and haven that thick hard to manage type of hair. I&#x27;ve tried other high rated waxes such as Crew Fiber (3 stars) and Gatsby (1-2 stars) and this is the one that not only worked best for me but is actually the MOST matte (I don&#x27;t like the shiny look at all). But another big thing that should be noted is that it washes off the BEST and easiest as well out of 3 products I&#x27;ve tried. Several times, warm water in the shower is enough to remove most of the gunk. It also holds fairly and well and is somewhat manageable later on without adding more (although adding more would obviously help texture and molding).</li>
            <li> I am fairly certain I reviewed this product previously, but was prompted by an email to do so again, so here you go:  It&#x27;s great.  I have tried a variety of waxes/fibers/pastes/gels for my thick straight hair, and the Bed Head Matte Workable Wax is just the best.  A very nice medium hold without being greasy or flaky.  I used the Redken Maneuver Wax previously, but found the hold to be a little too light.  I&#x27;ve read great reviews about Bumble and Bumble, but I&#x27;d rather not have to heat up a wax every morning, thanks.</li>
            <li> I bought this because the reviews were so good.  Never have used wax before in my hair.  Easy to apply and wash out.  Not a thick hold which I like, holds almost like a gel.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  This is good stuff!</li>
            <li> I have Asian thick hair and this product holds all day. It is slightly greasy, but works well for me.</li>
            <li> After wax hair does not stick together. I like hairdress of my boyfriend with this wax. I definitely recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to hair care product. It has fantastic hold for short to medium hair, even after working out or playing soccer. I usually have an undercut and usually use a small dab of Bed Head after combing in a thickener and blow-drying my hair.</li>
            <li> While there are many comparable products, this has superb hold while still being soft and not leaving a greasy sheen.</li>
            <li> always a good product.. smells great. super fast shipping</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff. I finally found something that works well</li>
            <li> Wax is a different beast if you&#x27;ve never tried it. This one performs well and will keep your hair wherever you put it. However, the waxiness isn&#x27;t for everyone. Definitely an upgrade from gel though in my mind.</li>
            <li> Havnt tested around with it much, but have used once so far, think i used a little too much, but it seems to do its job, and doesnt give your hair that greasy look since its matte.</li>
