            <li>Nice shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Kind of a tropical-coconut flavor, so make sure you like that kind of smell.</li>
            <li>They smell great but most importantly leave my hair shiny, eliminates the frizz, dryness and brassiness.</li>
            <li>I am a fairly frugal consumer, but this is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Great price and fast delivery!</li>
            <li>This works very well to keep my daughters hair in beautiful condition even though she swims on team 50 weeks out of the year 6 days a week.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li>and I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I was just expecting A more beachy type smell.</li>
            <li>But I think we need a bit more help.</li>
            <li>Wish the conditioner was a bit more moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I will buy more shampoo but not the conditioner.</li>
            <li>My son and daughter are both swimmers, and this is their favorite must have product.</li>
            <li>The smell is light but nice.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this as a clarifying duo (for myself), and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>This stuff is seriously awesome at making my kids&#x27; hair manageable again and removing that coating of &amp;#34;ice&amp;#34; from constant pool exposure!</li>
            <li>I love love love this.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely LOVE this hair care line.  </li>
            <li>recommend this product for sure.</li>
            <li>(the conditioner pump works flawlessly), but I&#x27;m putting it in smaller bottles to use in the locker room, so it&#x27;s not an issue.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo</li>
            <li>The one liter bottles are an excellent deal - especially when available via Prime!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite shampoo and conditioner for swimmers.</li>
            <li>The shampoo smells fantastic, orange/mango kind of scent.  </li>
            <li>more detanglers .Smooth hair after use and stays that wayin the morning.</li>
            <li>The Mailibu swimmers shampoo/conditioner smells great and leaves my hair very soft and very clean.  </li>
            <li>It seemed to have good reviews and was a good deal for the big bottles</li>
            <li>We have tried many other swimmer shampoo/conditioner and this one works the best!!!</li>
            <li>Nice smell and leaves hair feeling soft and manageable!!!!!</li>
            <li>It smells great and leaves my curls soft.</li>
            <li>I am an avid swimmer and this is by far the best product I have found.</li>
            <li>Emphasis on that it smells good because it really does.</li>
            <li>Smells good, strips out the chlorine some and when combined with the packets the combo really helps my hair recover from chlorine abuse.</li>
            <li>I very rarely write product reviews, but Malibu C warrants a huge thumbs up!</li>
            <li>and it still smells the same as it did 20+ years ago, pineapply good!</li>
            <li>with this deal, I couldn&#x27;t turn it down...  very happy with purchase &amp; with the seller!</li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner is a must for anyone with fine hair.</li>
            <li>I would order again, but I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the volume and these bottles are huge, so I won&#x27;t need to order for</li>
            <li>The shampoo is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Makes my daughters hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Wow- great stuff- worth the price.</li>
            <li>I found with using this product that my hair is restored to its original state, it works like a clarifying shampoo.</li>
            <li>I swim 2-3 times per week, and bought the malibu c shampoo and conditioner to replace the ultraswim shampoo and conditioner I originally purchased, which were stolen at the gym.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels chemical clean after.  </li>
            <li>So far I love the Malibu brand my hair smells and feels chlorine free!</li>
            <li>I literally could not get my hair clean-</li>
            <li>My hair has bounce and is full after use.</li>
            <li>Wife really like this stuff and was glad to get it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m loving it so far.</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and the fragrance lingers softly long after use - highly recommend this product and the price is very reasonable</li>
            <li>This is a great product for getting chlorine out and leaving behind healthy, residue-free hair!  </li>
            <li>My color does not fade too quickly and the creme rinse tackles the fuzziness of my hair.</li>
            <li>These guys are efficient, quick and reliable.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find these more reasonably priced larger bottles on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have tried other brands but so far this is had best</li>
            <li>I swim 3 times or more a week and theses products work great in removing harsh chemicals and leaving my hair soft and smooth again.</li>
            <li>Best hair products ever for hard water!</li>
            <li>First time all was good but with the second order, the shampoo had somehow leaked into the bag.  </li>
            <li>She was out of the pool for a week (6 days) and used the Shampoo and Conditioner  daily and her beautiful toe-headedness had returned completely.</li>
            <li>however I did notice it takes quite a bit more product to obtain a good lather as compared to my usual shampoo.</li>
            <li>It leave my hair feeling soft and healthy, but unlike the other chlorine removing shampoos, this one smells very nice.  </li>
            <li>Since then I&#x27;ve been using it religiously and LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Her hair is back to normal, It is soft and smells wonderful,  </li>
            <li>Luckily, the amount I was able to salvage after the bottles arrived cracked open and leaking all over the shipping box has been free, since Amazon issued me a refund.  </li>
            <li>Removed the green from my hair and keeps it great looking .</li>
            <li>I rarely use it</li>
            <li>Love how soft it makes my hair feel, as well as prevents &amp;#34;flyaways&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Nothing else on the market does what this product does and it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I never used to get comments on how healthy and soft my hair was.  </li>
            <li>but this shampoo comes pretty close for good price compared with other swimmer shampoos out there.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly, packaged very well, no damage.</li>
            <li>Great smelling gentle shampoo that killed the chlorine smell from my gym&#x27;s pool.</li>
            <li>My hair is super shiney, non frizzy and very manageable.  </li>
            <li>After a few uses I was able to brush through my hair much more easily, and it actually LOOKED clean, too.</li>
            <li>It does not leave my hair soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li>thanks Malibu for another&lt;br /&gt;wonderful product!</li>
            <li>Being able to buy this in a pump at a lower price per ounce so that I can fill smaller bottles makes a lot of sense.</li>
            <li>It really did get the job done!</li>
            <li>I swim regularly and these shampoo and conditioner set keep my hair healthy despite the chemicals in the water.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be ordering more ultraswim, and I recommend anyone else do the same!!</li>
            <li>I pair this with the Triswim body wash and lotion and the results have been WAY better than traditional shampoos and soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>sure what they changed as the ingredients appear to be the same.</li>
            <li>You need to use this first and then rinse out and then apply the Malibu C Swimmers Weekly Solution.</li>
            <li>This seems to work much better than regular shampoo.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner is enough to last you a very long time, smells delicious, and repairs damage done by chlorine.</li>
            <li>Our 9 year old daughter swims everyday and uses it, works great</li>
            <li>It definitely does not smell like or as nice as my old bottles do.</li>
            <li>This shampoo really gets all the heavy chemicals and grime out of your hair, leaving it feeling light and super clean.  </li>
            <li>The bottle are huge so it lasts a long time making the price worth it.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is drying, if you blow dry and straighten your hair be sure to add a silicone product.  </li>
            <li>Nice citrus smell and my hair feels less britle</li>
            <li>The chlorine was so strong at our Y pool that my daughter&#x27;s hair was so crunchy the next day.  </li>
            <li>It is a large size</li>
            <li>I bought the large bottle and will put some on travel bottles and throw them in my gym bag for convenience.</li>
            <li>I used to have issues with my hair turning bronzy after a few weeks of chlorine exposure, but not any more!</li>
            <li>Since using this product on a daily basis, with the addition of an iron-out pack on the weekends, it keeps my hair bright and blond with absolutely no brassiness or gold streaks.</li>
            <li>These bottles are huge so will last a couple summers.</li>
            <li>Both kids had very stringy, damaged ends and chlorine hair before we had this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I got my order on time and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Much prefer UltraSwim.</li>
            <li>I really like the shampoo</li>
            <li>I have tried Ultra Swim and that works for me very well.  </li>
            <li>I was ready to give up and cuft it all off.</li>
            <li>My hair stylist is impressed with how well my hair retains it artificially enhanced color.  </li>
            <li>Nothing was working, everything made my hair very greasy.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Our hair stylist recommended we try this when we saw her hair becoming dry and losing its luster (even wearing a swim cap).  </li>
            <li>A big plus for me is that it&#x27;s free of harmful ingredients which is the main reason I chose this brand.</li>
            <li>In other words, I like the results better if I use both the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I swim a few times a week and wanted something to protect my hair from the chlorine and moisturize my dry, fly away hair.</li>
            <li>Furthermore this set is a lot of shampoo for a decent price.</li>
            <li>These products keeps my hair healthy despite regular trips to the local pool.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend these combo shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I would highly suggest this product to anyone in and out of a swimming pool.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend buying in this size...great deal.</li>
            <li>The price MIGHT seem high for a clarifying shampoo, but you get a LOT of product here - compared to say Paul Mitchell clarifying shampoo, which is what I was using.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I always wet and wash my hair before swimming with the cheap ymca shampoo, and then shower after.  </li>
            <li>round swimmers love this combo.  </li>
            <li>It eliminates buildup and keeps my straight hair from becoming heavy and droopy.  </li>
            <li>This product also makes your hair smooth as silk and extremely manageable.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t see it doing a fantastic job or anything, compared to other conditioners.  </li>
            <li>Last time I got my hair cut, the hair dresser kept commenting on how soft my hair was...which is a first!  </li>
            <li>I live in a Bay Area close to the beach and our water has lots of iron deposits in it which can do a number on your hair color.</li>
            <li>I have dyed hair and live in Las Vegas.  </li>
            <li>We live on a farm and have a well as our source of water and It stripped the crud out of my hair.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to anyone who participates in any water activity to help keep your hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair very soft and shiny also.</li>
            <li>My hair is healthy even with the heavy swimming that I do!</li>
            <li>my long hair combs right threw.</li>
            <li>After the first shampoo I could tell a difference in the color of my natural blonde hair.</li>
            <li>I have long naturally light blonde hair which is very fine/straight and am in the pool several times a week.  </li>
            <li>My only wish is that the products smelled a little better.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner worked well for my well water hair and good to know that it has little harsh chemicals</li>
            <li>: it&#x27;s also helpful to completely soak your hair in the shower before entering the pool).</li>
            <li>So far this is helping with my daughters hair.</li>
            <li>My hair still feels incredibly soft when I use this</li>
            <li>It  is much cheaper than buying local.  </li>
            <li>When I wash my hair at night, this makes my hair as soft and shiny, as I could hope.</li>
            <li>No hair fading and no green hair.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favourite shampoo/conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel so soft after washing it from a swim.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this brand of shampoo after swimming in chlorine since the late 1990s, and it&#x27;s my favorite of all of the products I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>my hair feels so lite and soft.</li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s like it was an old batch or something)</li>
            <li>My 10 yrs old daughter swim every day for 2 uhr 6 days a week</li>
            <li>This year was the first year that my girls hair did not go green, thanks to this product.  </li>
            <li>This product returned my daughter&#x27;s damaged hair back to normal.</li>
            <li>As a regular 3x weekly swimmer I can make it this last a entire year making these liter bottles the economical choice for me.  </li>
            <li>We live in AZ and are swimming constantly.  </li>
            <li>But I am not that happy with the conditioner, it smells bad</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it often enough to make a comprehensive review, but advised by my hairdresser to use it and have no complaints so far...</li>
            <li>I have medium-blonde hair and it shed its brassy tone and lightened considerably (back to my natural shade).</li>
            <li>The pool I swim in currently is a chlorine and salt water pool so it completely wrecks my hair</li>
            <li>I called the actual company , Malibu directly today and they are sending me two pumps.</li>
            <li>I have normal straight/slight curly long hair.  </li>
            <li>It keeps her hair less crunchy and seems to be a bit more resistant to the green pool hair.  </li>
            <li>One of the boys with curly hair that tends to dry after the pool and a girl with long and very tangle hair after swimming.</li>
            <li>We could barely get a comb through it and 5 minutes later it looked like it hadn&#x27;t been brushed in a week.</li>

            <li> It has a pleasant smell.</li>

            <li> Smells nice and cuts the chlorine.</li>
            <li> Nice shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Kind of a tropical-coconut flavor, so make sure you like that kind of smell.</li>
            <li> They smell great but most importantly leave my hair shiny, eliminates the frizz, dryness and brassiness.</li>
            <li> I am a fairly frugal consumer, but this is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Great price and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> This works very well to keep my daughters hair in beautiful condition even though she swims on team 50 weeks out of the year 6 days a week.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li> and I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I was just expecting A more beachy type smell.</li>
            <li> But I think we need a bit more help.</li>
            <li> Wish the conditioner was a bit more moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I will buy more shampoo but not the conditioner.</li>
            <li> My son and daughter are both swimmers, and this is their favorite must have product.</li>
            <li> The smell is light but nice.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this as a clarifying duo (for myself), and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is seriously awesome at making my kids&#x27; hair manageable again and removing that coating of &amp;#34;ice&amp;#34; from constant pool exposure!</li>
            <li> I love love love this.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this hair care line.  </li>
            <li> recommend this product for sure.</li>
            <li> (the conditioner pump works flawlessly), but I&#x27;m putting it in smaller bottles to use in the locker room, so it&#x27;s not an issue.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo</li>
            <li> The one liter bottles are an excellent deal - especially when available via Prime!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo and conditioner for swimmers.</li>
            <li> The shampoo smells fantastic, orange/mango kind of scent.  </li>
            <li> more detanglers .Smooth hair after use and stays that wayin the morning.</li>
            <li> The Mailibu swimmers shampoo/conditioner smells great and leaves my hair very soft and very clean.  </li>
            <li> It seemed to have good reviews and was a good deal for the big bottles</li>
            <li> We have tried many other swimmer shampoo/conditioner and this one works the best!!!</li>
            <li> Nice smell and leaves hair feeling soft and manageable!!!!!</li>
            <li> It smells great and leaves my curls soft.</li>
            <li> I am an avid swimmer and this is by far the best product I have found.</li>
            <li> Emphasis on that it smells good because it really does.</li>
            <li> Smells good, strips out the chlorine some and when combined with the packets the combo really helps my hair recover from chlorine abuse.</li>
            <li> I very rarely write product reviews, but Malibu C warrants a huge thumbs up!</li>
            <li> and it still smells the same as it did 20+ years ago, pineapply good!</li>
            <li> with this deal, I couldn&#x27;t turn it down...  very happy with purchase &amp; with the seller!</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is a must for anyone with fine hair.</li>
            <li> I would order again, but I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the volume and these bottles are huge, so I won&#x27;t need to order for</li>
            <li> The shampoo is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Makes my daughters hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Wow- great stuff- worth the price.</li>
            <li> I found with using this product that my hair is restored to its original state, it works like a clarifying shampoo.</li>
            <li> I swim 2-3 times per week, and bought the malibu c shampoo and conditioner to replace the ultraswim shampoo and conditioner I originally purchased, which were stolen at the gym.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels chemical clean after.  </li>
            <li> So far I love the Malibu brand my hair smells and feels chlorine free!</li>
            <li> I literally could not get my hair clean-</li>
            <li> My hair has bounce and is full after use.</li>
            <li> Wife really like this stuff and was glad to get it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m loving it so far.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful and the fragrance lingers softly long after use - highly recommend this product and the price is very reasonable</li>
            <li> This is a great product for getting chlorine out and leaving behind healthy, residue-free hair!  </li>
            <li> My color does not fade too quickly and the creme rinse tackles the fuzziness of my hair.</li>
            <li> These guys are efficient, quick and reliable.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find these more reasonably priced larger bottles on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands but so far this is had best</li>
            <li> I swim 3 times or more a week and theses products work great in removing harsh chemicals and leaving my hair soft and smooth again.</li>
            <li> Best hair products ever for hard water!</li>
            <li> First time all was good but with the second order, the shampoo had somehow leaked into the bag.  </li>
            <li> She was out of the pool for a week (6 days) and used the Shampoo and Conditioner  daily and her beautiful toe-headedness had returned completely.</li>
            <li> however I did notice it takes quite a bit more product to obtain a good lather as compared to my usual shampoo.</li>
            <li> It leave my hair feeling soft and healthy, but unlike the other chlorine removing shampoos, this one smells very nice.  </li>
            <li> Since then I&#x27;ve been using it religiously and LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Her hair is back to normal, It is soft and smells wonderful,  </li>
            <li> Luckily, the amount I was able to salvage after the bottles arrived cracked open and leaking all over the shipping box has been free, since Amazon issued me a refund.  </li>
            <li> Removed the green from my hair and keeps it great looking .</li>
            <li> I rarely use it</li>
            <li> Love how soft it makes my hair feel, as well as prevents &amp;#34;flyaways&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Nothing else on the market does what this product does and it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I never used to get comments on how healthy and soft my hair was.  </li>
            <li> but this shampoo comes pretty close for good price compared with other swimmer shampoos out there.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly, packaged very well, no damage.</li>
            <li> Great smelling gentle shampoo that killed the chlorine smell from my gym&#x27;s pool.</li>
            <li> My hair is super shiney, non frizzy and very manageable.  </li>
            <li> After a few uses I was able to brush through my hair much more easily, and it actually LOOKED clean, too.</li>
            <li> It does not leave my hair soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li> thanks Malibu for another&lt;br /&gt;wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Being able to buy this in a pump at a lower price per ounce so that I can fill smaller bottles makes a lot of sense.</li>
            <li> It really did get the job done!</li>
            <li> I swim regularly and these shampoo and conditioner set keep my hair healthy despite the chemicals in the water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be ordering more ultraswim, and I recommend anyone else do the same!!</li>
            <li> I pair this with the Triswim body wash and lotion and the results have been WAY better than traditional shampoos and soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> sure what they changed as the ingredients appear to be the same.</li>
            <li> You need to use this first and then rinse out and then apply the Malibu C Swimmers Weekly Solution.</li>
            <li> This seems to work much better than regular shampoo.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is enough to last you a very long time, smells delicious, and repairs damage done by chlorine.</li>
            <li> Our 9 year old daughter swims everyday and uses it, works great</li>
            <li> It definitely does not smell like or as nice as my old bottles do.</li>
            <li> This shampoo really gets all the heavy chemicals and grime out of your hair, leaving it feeling light and super clean.  </li>
            <li> The bottle are huge so it lasts a long time making the price worth it.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is drying, if you blow dry and straighten your hair be sure to add a silicone product.  </li>
            <li> Nice citrus smell and my hair feels less britle</li>
            <li> The chlorine was so strong at our Y pool that my daughter&#x27;s hair was so crunchy the next day.  </li>
            <li> It is a large size</li>
            <li> I bought the large bottle and will put some on travel bottles and throw them in my gym bag for convenience.</li>
            <li> I used to have issues with my hair turning bronzy after a few weeks of chlorine exposure, but not any more!</li>
            <li> Since using this product on a daily basis, with the addition of an iron-out pack on the weekends, it keeps my hair bright and blond with absolutely no brassiness or gold streaks.</li>
            <li> These bottles are huge so will last a couple summers.</li>
            <li> Both kids had very stringy, damaged ends and chlorine hair before we had this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I got my order on time and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Much prefer UltraSwim.</li>
            <li> I really like the shampoo</li>
            <li> I have tried Ultra Swim and that works for me very well.  </li>
            <li> I was ready to give up and cuft it all off.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist is impressed with how well my hair retains it artificially enhanced color.  </li>
            <li> Nothing was working, everything made my hair very greasy.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Our hair stylist recommended we try this when we saw her hair becoming dry and losing its luster (even wearing a swim cap).  </li>
            <li> A big plus for me is that it&#x27;s free of harmful ingredients which is the main reason I chose this brand.</li>
            <li> In other words, I like the results better if I use both the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I swim a few times a week and wanted something to protect my hair from the chlorine and moisturize my dry, fly away hair.</li>
            <li> Furthermore this set is a lot of shampoo for a decent price.</li>
            <li> These products keeps my hair healthy despite regular trips to the local pool.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend these combo shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I would highly suggest this product to anyone in and out of a swimming pool.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend buying in this size...great deal.</li>
            <li> The price MIGHT seem high for a clarifying shampoo, but you get a LOT of product here - compared to say Paul Mitchell clarifying shampoo, which is what I was using.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I always wet and wash my hair before swimming with the cheap ymca shampoo, and then shower after.  </li>
            <li> round swimmers love this combo.  </li>
            <li> It eliminates buildup and keeps my straight hair from becoming heavy and droopy.  </li>
            <li> This product also makes your hair smooth as silk and extremely manageable.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t see it doing a fantastic job or anything, compared to other conditioners.  </li>
            <li> Last time I got my hair cut, the hair dresser kept commenting on how soft my hair was...which is a first!  </li>
            <li> I live in a Bay Area close to the beach and our water has lots of iron deposits in it which can do a number on your hair color.</li>
            <li> I have dyed hair and live in Las Vegas.  </li>
            <li> We live on a farm and have a well as our source of water and It stripped the crud out of my hair.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend to anyone who participates in any water activity to help keep your hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair very soft and shiny also.</li>
            <li> My hair is healthy even with the heavy swimming that I do!</li>
            <li> my long hair combs right threw.</li>
            <li> After the first shampoo I could tell a difference in the color of my natural blonde hair.</li>
            <li> I have long naturally light blonde hair which is very fine/straight and am in the pool several times a week.  </li>
            <li> My only wish is that the products smelled a little better.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner worked well for my well water hair and good to know that it has little harsh chemicals</li>
            <li> : it&#x27;s also helpful to completely soak your hair in the shower before entering the pool).</li>
            <li> So far this is helping with my daughters hair.</li>
            <li> My hair still feels incredibly soft when I use this</li>
            <li> It  is much cheaper than buying local.  </li>
            <li> When I wash my hair at night, this makes my hair as soft and shiny, as I could hope.</li>
            <li> No hair fading and no green hair.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favourite shampoo/conditioner.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel so soft after washing it from a swim.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand of shampoo after swimming in chlorine since the late 1990s, and it&#x27;s my favorite of all of the products I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> my hair feels so lite and soft.</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s like it was an old batch or something)</li>
            <li> My 10 yrs old daughter swim every day for 2 uhr 6 days a week</li>
            <li> This year was the first year that my girls hair did not go green, thanks to this product.  </li>
            <li> This product returned my daughter&#x27;s damaged hair back to normal.</li>
            <li> As a regular 3x weekly swimmer I can make it this last a entire year making these liter bottles the economical choice for me.  </li>
            <li> We live in AZ and are swimming constantly.  </li>
            <li> But I am not that happy with the conditioner, it smells bad</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it often enough to make a comprehensive review, but advised by my hairdresser to use it and have no complaints so far...</li>
            <li> I have medium-blonde hair and it shed its brassy tone and lightened considerably (back to my natural shade).</li>
            <li> The pool I swim in currently is a chlorine and salt water pool so it completely wrecks my hair</li>
            <li> I called the actual company , Malibu directly today and they are sending me two pumps.</li>
            <li> I have normal straight/slight curly long hair.  </li>
            <li> It keeps her hair less crunchy and seems to be a bit more resistant to the green pool hair.  </li>
            <li> One of the boys with curly hair that tends to dry after the pool and a girl with long and very tangle hair after swimming.</li>
            <li> We could barely get a comb through it and 5 minutes later it looked like it hadn&#x27;t been brushed in a week.</li>
            <li> In the summer when the girls don&#x27;t wear swim caps as often, we&#x27;ve also used the Malibu wellness actives swimmers weekly solution - this is the dry packet that you dampen and rub into their hair - this is the first product I&#x27;ve used where I could see the green being pulled out of their blond hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sorry now that I didn&#x27;t just buy more ultraswim, which is a little pricier, but SO worth it.  </li>
            <li> May be pricey, but these bottles will last you sooo long</li>
            <li> so will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> just a couple times a week during swimming season works for us - ad it tended to dry out my daughter&#x27;s hair a bit when used daily...</li>
            <li> The products don&#x27;t over dry our hair (mine is a bit coarse) and my girls like it.</li>
            <li> My hair is not coarse and dry.</li>
            <li> This time something is different, in just one use my hair went from shiny to dull and flat, just as if I was using a normal shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I have always wanted to purchase it because of our hard water, but never would spend that much money on it ~</li>
            <li> The bottle says to use it once a week, but I used it daily for the first two weeks and was shocked by how much my hair changed!</li>
            <li> And her hair is long.</li>
            <li> It was my stylist who suggested it and actually used the deep conditioning product on me at the shop to eliminate the green which was starting to build.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and it works well in protecting it.</li>
            <li> She could not believe how did i managed to keep up with her long hair maintenance</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t last long with other shampoos.  </li>
            <li> I have long, straight, thin blonde hair.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for anyone suffering from hard water issues.  </li>
            <li> Their hair was not so dry and tangle.</li>
            <li> I put conditioner on my dry hair before swimming, comb it through and just before getting in pool</li>
            <li> The products do not \\&quot;dry out\\</li>
            <li> Also, their hair isn&#x27;t brittle or dry when they use this shampoo.</li>
            <li> My family is not new to the product, as my son who was a competitive swimmer used to use the product.</li>
            <li> Not only did it take out the green from my naturally white hair, it removed other impurities as well.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how much the condition of my hair had deteriorated until Malibu reversed the effects of my hard water!</li>
            <li> Only thing I&#x27;ve found that gets rid of that slimy, green, tangled mess that pools create with my daughter&#x27;s long, blonde hair.</li>
            <li> this help manage the daily summer pool green hair.  </li>
            <li> I like it and this is my 2nd round of purchasing it.</li>
            <li> Came exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> These bottles themselves seem thin and one of the pumps doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> After my lifelong stylist closed up shop, I looked at every salon around for Malibu shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> and this is the only shampoo we have found that helps keep the green out of their hair.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and bouncy without slowly stripping my color.</li>
            <li> I have thick, dark brown hair, and at first I thought maybe I need to shampoo twice and leave the conditioner in for a few minutes, but it made no difference.  </li>
            <li> Wish it were less expensive, but still feel the price is worth it for the results I get.</li>
            <li> It saved my hair from our soft water, which left my blonde hair looking dirty even after a wash with other shampoos.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to Malibu products years ago and am extremely thankful.</li>
            <li> I can truly say that this product has saved my hair with its ability to get rid of the chlorine and other residues from the pool water.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a week (every other day)</li>
            <li> Despite wearing a cap the chlorinated water seeps in, I find that Malibu C lessens the chlorine damage to my salon colored hair when to compared to other regular products that I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> We tried a lo of other products before trying this one.</li>
            <li> I was told by my stylist that it was due to my water softner that this was happening.  </li>
            <li> I can feel my hair less stiff and frizzy than when I shower with a regular shampoo after swimming.</li>
            <li> And the price at Amazon is half from other stores.</li>
            <li> I have dark hair and this softens it up after swimming.</li>
            <li> I swim at least 4 days a week and use this product daily.</li>
            <li> She is blonde and her hair never turns green or brittle!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this shampoo/conditioner in smaller quantities and it is obscenely expensive in a smaller quantity.</li>
            <li> I do not use this product any other time because it adds too much moisture and makes my hair look and feel dirty.  </li>
            <li> It was a gummy sticky mess that took forever to comb out.</li>
            <li> I swim a couple times a week and have long thick hair.</li>
            <li> Definitely a must buy for swimming or hard water!</li>
            <li> My well water is very bad, full of copper that turns my blonde hair into a brassy gold mess.</li>
            <li> I said all i did is use a little bit of science.</li>
            <li> Swimming is really stressing her hair out and is making it crazy.</li>
            <li> does not smooth my hair.</li>
            <li> Keeps the green out of my daughter&#x27;s blond hair.</li>
            <li> (or mom) crying as we try to untangle and comb hair.</li>
            <li> My hair turning green from the chlorine (like it did as a kid) is always a concern for me.  </li>
            <li> I googled how to rid green tint out of hair washed in well water.</li>
            <li> I have two daughters that both swim a few times a week.  </li>
            <li> My hair &amp;#34;came clean&amp;#34; in just a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I was having trouble with shampoo/conditioner</li>
            <li> I have two girls with blond hair who swim year round</li>
            <li> It rids of the texture chlorine and salt water leave behind, smooths out the potential for tangle and rids of any smell for the pool.</li>
            <li> The shampoo bottle was missing.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use and recommend this product to anyone who has well water and tendency to a green tint in hair due to the copper or hard water of the well.</li>
            <li> before I realized it worked just as well using less often! ).</li>
            <li> My daughter had stiff crunchy hair after swimming, I didnt know what to do.</li>
            <li> I have had green hair for the past nine months.  </li>
            <li> No more two-toned green hair.  </li>
            <li> Our small person swims twice a week in a heavily chlorinated pool.</li>
            <li> No more kids</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair dry and rough feeling, the smell is not pleasant, and I&#x27;m overall so disappointed with this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a swimmer &amp; whitewater kayaker &amp; my hair gets pretty filthy.  </li>
            <li> Very concerning and disappointed with this.</li>
            <li> My hair is hard to brush through after swimming and washing.</li>
            <li> This product was listed for hard water and from reviews I read, I would try anything.</li>
            <li> I swim at least three times a week at a health club.</li>
            <li> I could not find a shampoo and conditioner that would at least repair the hair damage that both my kids had.  </li>
            <li> It also brightened my dirty blond daughter&#x27;s hair, and, finally, softened and de-chlorinated my ultra blond daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo lathers well and conditioner is thick.</li>
            <li> I have extremely hard water at my house and noticed my hair became very dull, orange colored and brittle.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately my daughter still has green hair.</li>
            <li> I have very hard water and my hair coloring</li>
            <li> Living in Austin also means very hard water.  </li>
            <li> As a swimmer, I find that the pool is very hard on my hair.  </li>
            <li> After a year of showering in very hard</li>
            <li> I thought I was sent the wrong one but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had well water that unfortunately comes with the lime, calcium etc..</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this product.</li>
            <li> It was very frustrating.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s too expensive !</li>
            <li> and I promise you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It might have froze because it was a very cold week?</li>
            <li> I do water aerobics and hate my hair to smell like the pool.</li>
            <li> Then the worst part is that you can&#x27;t return it.</li>
            <li> and my hair is miserable and nasty</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> does not smooth my hair. I rarely use it</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!!!  We live in AZ and are swimming constantly.  This year was the first year that my girls hair did not go green, thanks to this product.  Smells wonderful too!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff made my hair feel like straw. Then the worst part is that you can&#x27;t return it.</li>
            <li> My hair still has a chlorine smell in it after two washings and conditioning. It does not leave my hair soft and tangle free. My hair is hard to brush through after swimming and washing. The smell of the shampoo isn&#x27;t very nice either. I wanted a good shampoo to get the chlorine out of my hair after my swim therapy and this isn&#x27;t it. I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I bought these products for my daughter for the summer being in chlorine and sun. Her hair looked great at the end of the season..still very healthy.</li>
            <li> I swim at least three times a week at a health club. I also have colored hair. I LOVE this shampoo/conditioner. It leaves my hair soft and bouncy without slowly stripping my color. I used to have issues with my hair turning bronzy after a few weeks of chlorine exposure, but not any more! (FYI: it&#x27;s also helpful to completely soak your hair in the shower before entering the pool). My local retailers only carry high-priced smaller bottles. I was thrilled to find these more reasonably priced larger bottles on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have used Malibu before and I love this product.  I would highly recommend it.  My hair has bounce and is full after use.</li>
            <li> These are thee BEST products I&#x27;ve ever tried for my chlorinated hair.  Love how soft it makes my hair feel, as well as prevents &amp;#34;flyaways&amp;#34;.  Bonus is it smells great.  My hairdresser just bought some for her salon.</li>
            <li> My 2 kids who are year round swimmers love this combo.  I could not find a shampoo and conditioner that would at least repair the hair damage that both my kids had.  Both kids had very stringy, damaged ends and chlorine hair before we had this shampoo.  Now both have none of the damages that they had because years of swimming.  Highly recommend these combo shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Great for my daughter on swim team!  Smells great too!</li>
            <li> Recommended by our stylist and unlike another product that we have ordered online, this is well packed and arrived in great conditions ... no leaks whatsoever.  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Easily the best pool hair product available.</li>
            <li> I ordered the products because my hairstylist recommended them. I live in a Bay Area close to the beach and our water has lots of iron deposits in it which can do a number on your hair color. I found with using this product that my hair is restored to its original state, it works like a clarifying shampoo. My hairstylist recommended using it 2 to 3 times per week, and definitely before I color my hair at home. The conditioner is really nice as well. it conditions like A pretty pricey conditioner I&#x27;ve used in the past. My only wish is that the products smelled a little better. They smell Good I was just expecting A more beachy type smell. I will definitely be using this product regularly!</li>
            <li> Wife really like this stuff and was glad to get it.She said that it was a good buy.&lt;br /&gt;Luck&lt;br /&gt;Bill</li>
            <li> So far this is helping with my daughters hair. But I think we need a bit more help. Swimming is really stressing her hair out and is making it crazy. Thoughts??</li>
            <li> I have dyed hair and live in Las Vegas.  I&#x27;m in the pool a lot.  My hair still feels incredibly soft when I use this and my hair color hasn&#x27;t been effected.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this! It saved my hair from our soft water, which left my blonde hair looking dirty even after a wash with other shampoos. Also, great smell, great deal, AND animal friendly: Hurray!</li>
            <li> I got my order on time and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and a great product!</li>
            <li> Only thing I&#x27;ve found that gets rid of that slimy, green, tangled mess that pools create with my daughter&#x27;s long, blonde hair. May be pricey, but these bottles will last you sooo long (you don&#x27;t need to use them for every shampoo/conditioner...just a couple times a week during swimming season works for us - ad it tended to dry out my daughter&#x27;s hair a bit when used daily...before I realized it worked just as well using less often! ).</li>
            <li> Consistently excellent product and value.  Always well-packaged and promptly delivered.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful and the fragrance lingers softly long after use - highly recommend this product and the price is very reasonable</li>
            <li> The shampoo smells great and it gets the chlorine smell out of my hair after swimming. Wish the conditioner was a bit more moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Great product! My girls are on swim team and this product has saved their hair during the swim season! Great price and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I was introduced to Malibu products years ago and am extremely thankful. My well water is very bad, full of copper that turns my blonde hair into a brassy gold mess. Since using this product on a daily basis, with the addition of an iron-out pack on the weekends, it keeps my hair bright and blond with absolutely no brassiness or gold streaks. Nothing else on the market does what this product does and it is worth every penny. I also use the \\&quot;goo be gone\\&quot; once a month which get out all of the product I put in my hair -- hairspray, gel, curling spray. Works like a charm. This product also makes your hair smooth as silk and extremely manageable. I LOVE IT!! Try it and I promise you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!  I have very hard water and my hair coloring didn&#x27;t last long with other shampoos.  This shampoo stops the hair from turning a &#x27;brassy&#x27; tone. FYI:  Malibu did change the name, container, and color of the shampoo.  I thought I was sent the wrong one but a search on-line at Malibu&#x27;s site tells about the changes.</li>
            <li> This is truly an amazing product! I hope to never have to go without this shampoo and conditioner. My entire family uses it daily after swimming. I can truly say that this product has saved my hair with its ability to get rid of the chlorine and other residues from the pool water. This deserves 10 stars! Thank You!</li>
            <li> I used this shampoo and conditioner when i swim.  My hair feels chemical clean after.  I also use it as a body wash and it takes out the chlorine smell out of my hair and off my skin...</li>
            <li> Much prefer UltraSwim.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this pack of shampoo/conditioner twice now.  It  is much cheaper than buying local.  First time all was good but with the second order, the shampoo had somehow leaked into the bag.  It might have froze because it was a very cold week?</li>
            <li> Our 9 year old daughter swims everyday and uses it, works great</li>
            <li> I swim a few times a week and wanted something to protect my hair from the chlorine and moisturize my dry, fly away hair. This works. The fragrance is pleasant but not overpowering. My color does not fade too quickly and the creme rinse tackles the fuzziness of my hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter swims 3-5 times a week and this is her shampoo of choice! Smells nice and cuts the chlorine.</li>
            <li> Pump on conditioner does not work</li>
            <li> My youngest is a toe head blond and this help manage the daily summer pool green hair.  I comb through the conditioner when I am braiding her hair.  It keeps her hair less crunchy and seems to be a bit more resistant to the green pool hair.  She was out of the pool for a week (6 days) and used the Shampoo and Conditioner  daily and her beautiful toe-headedness had returned completely.</li>
            <li> Best hair products ever for hard water!</li>
            <li> I had a Malibu done, and use this product daily. I have colored treated hair,and it does not hurt the color.&lt;br /&gt;the shampoo is wonderful and the conditioner is excellent. my long hair combs right threw. thanks Malibu for another&lt;br /&gt;wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I have 3 daughters with 3 different types of hair and in the summer they are in the pool every day.  This product worked on my brunette daughter to take away the brassy effect the chlorine gave her hair.  It also brightened my dirty blond daughter&#x27;s hair, and, finally, softened and de-chlorinated my ultra blond daughter&#x27;s hair.  Works for everyone!</li>
            <li> Realistically, you&#x27;re probably not going to find a shampoo that will totally get rid of all the chlorine from being in the pool but this shampoo comes pretty close for good price compared with other swimmer shampoos out there. I have dark hair and this softens it up after swimming. I got the combo shampoo/conditioner. Bottomline: I like it and this is my 2nd round of purchasing it. Oh, by the way, I swim approx 1x/week and this lasted me &amp;#62;3 months...maybe even close to 6 months?</li>
            <li> Received in perfect condition and sealed.. I would order again, but I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the volume and these bottles are huge, so I won&#x27;t need to order for like 10 years lol</li>
            <li> Good product and smells really nice. I can tell it helps with getting rid of chlorine however I did notice it takes quite a bit more product to obtain a good lather as compared to my usual shampoo. Wonderful product nonetheless!</li>
            <li> I am a daily swimmer. When I wash my hair at night, this makes my hair as soft and shiny, as I could hope. Love this product!</li>
            <li> Just ordered this today. I started training for a triathalon and couldn&#x27;t remember what it was called but found it! So excited to get it soon :D I used this when I swam competitively 20 or so years ago and was so happy they still make it! Definitely a must buy for swimming or hard water! **Just got it and it still smells the same as it did 20+ years ago, pineapply good!</li>
            <li> 5 months back when I purchased , it was  $32.96  for 1 lt shampoo and conditioner.  Now the price is hiked to 54.99. That&#x27;s too expensive ! Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! We live on a farm and have a well as our source of water and It stripped the crud out of my hair.</li>
            <li> I really like the shampoo and it takes the chlorine smell out.  The conditioner is drying, if you blow dry and straighten your hair be sure to add a silicone product.  I will buy more shampoo but not the conditioner.</li>
            <li> My daughter swims 4 to 5 nights a week, so a good swimmers shampoo and conditioner is a must.  This works great.  No hair fading and no green hair.</li>
            <li> Keeps the green out of my daughter&#x27;s blond hair. Smells good! We have tried many other swimmer shampoo/conditioner and this one works the best!!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all.....</li>
            <li> The shampoo is fantastic.  Removed the green from my hair and keeps it great looking . The conditioner is probably equal to others I have used.</li>
            <li> This product was suggested to us by a family member who is a beautician. I have three kids on the swim team and they are in the water 4 to 5 times per week. For lack of a better description, their hair was crunchy!! No amount of conditioning seemed to help. We could barely get a comb through it and 5 minutes later it looked like it hadn&#x27;t been brushed in a week. It was very frustrating. This shampoo/conditioner is a God send. No more kids (or mom) crying as we try to untangle and comb hair. I am a fairly frugal consumer, but this is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this shampoo/conditioner in smaller quantities and it is obscenely expensive in a smaller quantity. Being able to buy this in a pump at a lower price per ounce so that I can fill smaller bottles makes a lot of sense. Amazon was the only place I could find this size. My son and daughter are both swimmers, and this is their favorite must have product.</li>
            <li> I have long naturally light blonde hair which is very fine/straight and am in the pool several times a week.  My hair turning green from the chlorine (like it did as a kid) is always a concern for me.  Living in Austin also means very hard water.  The Mailibu swimmers shampoo/conditioner smells great and leaves my hair very soft and very clean.  No residual chlorine smell, which I get with regular shampoos.  Wish it were less expensive, but still feel the price is worth it for the results I get.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly, packaged very well, no damage. Came exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> The smell is light but nice. Kind of a tropical-coconut flavor, so make sure you like that kind of smell. I use these to refill smaller bottles so that my girls can keep it their swim bags to use after swim team practice. These bottles themselves seem thin and one of the pumps doesn&#x27;t really work. It could just be the pair that I bought, but since I&#x27;m only using them to refill smaller bottles it&#x27;s not bothersome. The shampoo lathers well and conditioner is thick. I add some jojoba oil into the conditioner for added moisture. The products don&#x27;t over dry our hair (mine is a bit coarse) and my girls like it.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner worked well for my well water hair and good to know that it has little harsh chemicals</li>
            <li> Great smelling gentle shampoo that killed the chlorine smell from my gym&#x27;s pool. I have tried other brands but so far this is had best</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it often enough to make a comprehensive review, but advised by my hairdresser to use it and have no complaints so far...</li>
            <li> Works great to get chlorine out!!! Must have in the summer! It really did get the job done! My daughters hair was healthier again.</li>
            <li> I have three swimmers. One of the boys with curly hair that tends to dry after the pool and a girl with long and very tangle hair after swimming. As soon as they started to use the shampoo and conditioner I could tell the difference. Their hair was not so dry and tangle. And the price at Amazon is half from other stores.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried several different swim shampoos/conditioners -- ultra swim, paul mitchell chlorine removal shampoo, etc. This seems to work the best and leave hair the softest and most manageable.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this as a clarifying duo (for myself), and I LOVE it. It smells great and leaves my curls soft. I haven&#x27;t used it to get chlorine out of my own hair; however, I will buy this again to use for clarifying!</li>
            <li> This product is not for my hair.  I have tried Ultra Swim and that works for me very well.  Will keep using Ultra Swim.</li>
            <li> I have extremely hard water at my house and noticed my hair became very dull, orange colored and brittle.  I have been using this product for over a week (every other day) and I have noticed a drastic change.  My hair is super shiney, non frizzy and very manageable.  I highly recommend this product for anyone suffering from hard water issues.  I will definitely be ordering again from this seller!</li>
            <li> I swim regularly and these shampoo and conditioner set keep my hair healthy despite the chemicals in the water. I can feel my hair less stiff and frizzy than when I shower with a regular shampoo after swimming. A big plus for me is that it&#x27;s free of harmful ingredients which is the main reason I chose this brand. Furthermore this set is a lot of shampoo for a decent price. I&#x27;m happy I got it.</li>
            <li> good product and good price</li>
            <li> Awesome shampoo and conditioner I have ever found!!!!!  Swim 3 days a week, have colored treated hair and this product works the best I have ever seen.  I put conditioner on my dry hair before swimming, comb it through and just before getting in pool I rinse my hair in shower. Than swim. This is without wearing a cap (caps don&#x27;t work for me). Eventually hair fades a bit but no changes in color or drying out!!!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing! This product returned my daughter&#x27;s damaged hair back to normal. She swims 3-4 times a week and her hair was briitle, breaking, and strangly like cotton candy.  She is also a weekly user of the 5 minute recovery paste packets.</li>
            <li> Once again... These guys are efficient, quick and reliable. I will keep ordering from them. This shampoo and conditioner is a must for anyone with fine hair.</li>
            <li> A great product.  I keep it in my laundry room to refill bottles I use after swimming.</li>
            <li> My second purchase. As a regular 3x weekly swimmer I can make it this last a entire year making these liter bottles the economical choice for me.  Does the job. Despite wearing a cap the chlorinated water seeps in, I find that Malibu C lessens the chlorine damage to my salon colored hair when to compared to other regular products that I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> This stuff is seriously awesome at making my kids&#x27; hair manageable again and removing that coating of &amp;#34;ice&amp;#34; from constant pool exposure!</li>
            <li> I work in a pool so I needed some swimmers shampoo and conditioner. So far I love the Malibu brand my hair smells and feels chlorine free!</li>
            <li> The minerals in the water from our well just turns my (color treated) hair red, which is not the color that it should be.  This shampoo and conditioner is perfect.  It eliminates buildup and keeps my straight hair from becoming heavy and droopy.  The products do not \\&quot;dry out\\&quot; my hair.  I love love love this.  My hair stylist, who is the best, recommended this product and I&#x27;m so happy with it.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is enough to last you a very long time, smells delicious, and repairs damage done by chlorine. Emphasis on that it smells good because it really does. I would buy this again and again!</li>
            <li> Works great on my swimmers hair</li>
            <li> This works very well to keep my daughters hair in beautiful condition even though she swims on team 50 weeks out of the year 6 days a week. And her hair is long. Works well!!</li>
            <li> I teach swim lessons and these products help</li>
            <li> I have been using both the Malibu C Swimmers Wellness shampoo and conditioner after each time in the pool and have noticed wonderful results. My family is not new to the product, as my son who was a competitive swimmer used to use the product. It was my stylist who suggested it and actually used the deep conditioning product on me at the shop to eliminate the green which was starting to build. Since then I&#x27;ve been using it religiously and LOVE IT! I would highly recommend to anyone who participates in any water activity to help keep your hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I googled how to rid green tint out of hair washed in well water. This product was listed for hard water and from reviews I read, I would try anything. After the first shampoo I could tell a difference in the color of my natural blonde hair. I will continue to use and recommend this product to anyone who has well water and tendency to a green tint in hair due to the copper or hard water of the well. I am not one to use chemicals in the water. So this was a god-send for me.</li>
            <li> I swim 2-3 times per week, and bought the malibu c shampoo and conditioner to replace the ultraswim shampoo and conditioner I originally purchased, which were stolen at the gym.  It seemed to have good reviews and was a good deal for the big bottles so I thought why not?  I&#x27;m very sorry now that I didn&#x27;t just buy more ultraswim, which is a little pricier, but SO worth it.  Luckily, the amount I was able to salvage after the bottles arrived cracked open and leaking all over the shipping box has been free, since Amazon issued me a refund.  I always wet and wash my hair before swimming with the cheap ymca shampoo, and then shower after.  I can still smell chlorine in my hair, two days and two showers after swimming and using malibu c products, with no swimming in between.  It leaves my hair dry and rough feeling, the smell is not pleasant, and I&#x27;m overall so disappointed with this product.  I have thick, dark brown hair, and at first I thought maybe I need to shampoo twice and leave the conditioner in for a few minutes, but it made no difference.  I&#x27;ll be ordering more ultraswim, and I recommend anyone else do the same!!</li>
            <li> I have two daughters that both swim a few times a week.  This has been thier savior for thier hair.  I would highly suggest this product to anyone in and out of a swimming pool.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favourite shampoo/conditioner.  I&#x27;m a swimmer &amp; whitewater kayaker &amp; my hair gets pretty filthy.  This shampoo really gets all the heavy chemicals and grime out of your hair, leaving it feeling light and super clean.  I highly recommend buying in this size...great deal.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this hair care line.  It leave my hair feeling soft and healthy, but unlike the other chlorine removing shampoos, this one smells very nice.  Last time I got my hair cut, the hair dresser kept commenting on how soft my hair was...which is a first!  I never used to get comments on how healthy and soft my hair was.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Smells good, strips out the chlorine some and when combined with the packets the combo really helps my hair recover from chlorine abuse.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my daughter still has green hair. The product does not work it did not get the chlorine out. Bummer!</li>
            <li> My daughter plays water polo and it is a great product. She is blonde and her hair never turns green or brittle!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is GREAT!  I have had green hair for the past nine months.  NOthing worked to remove it until i tried Malibu C.  It works like a charm.  Not only did it take out the green from my naturally white hair, it removed other impurities as well. My hair &amp;#34;came clean&amp;#34; in just a few weeks.  No more two-toned green hair.  I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Works well. It is a large size so will last me a long time. I swim 5 days a week and use it often.</li>
            <li> As a swimmer, I find that the pool is very hard on my hair.  I was happy to learn about Malibu!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I swim a couple times a week and have long thick hair. This stuff cleans and moisturizes very effectively. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of swimmers&#x27; shampoos and conditioners and this is THE one.</li>
            <li> Good product and good service.</li>
            <li> I swim 3 to 4 miles a week in an indoor competition pool and this product has saved my hair!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!  Saved my 7 year olds hip lenght hair. Pleasant fragrance, not overpowering.  Our small person swims twice a week in a heavily chlorinated pool. I was ready to give up and cuft it all off. It was a gummy sticky mess that took forever to comb out. We tried a lo of other products before trying this one. None of them worked. This one WORKS for us. We used the treatment pack that was included with purchase, followed by the shampoo and conditioner. Amazing results!</li>
            <li> After my lifelong stylist closed up shop, I looked at every salon around for Malibu shampoo and conditioner. Thank you Amazon for the competitive pricing. The products are amazing. I&#x27;ve always had well water that unfortunately comes with the lime, calcium etc..that destroys my hair. They smell great but most importantly leave my hair shiny, eliminates the frizz, dryness and brassiness.</li>
            <li> After a year of showering in very hard well water I literally could not get my hair clean- it was always oily and unmanageable despite my experimentation with a number of shampoos and conditioners. Thankfully, my aunt is a hairdresser and she recommended Malibu C. The bottle says to use it once a week, but I used it daily for the first two weeks and was shocked by how much my hair changed! After a few uses I was able to brush through my hair much more easily, and it actually LOOKED clean, too. I have medium-blonde hair and it shed its brassy tone and lightened considerably (back to my natural shade). I didn&#x27;t realize how much the condition of my hair had deteriorated until Malibu reversed the effects of my hard water! After months of using the products weekly my hair is in good condition. I very rarely write product reviews, but Malibu C warrants a huge thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this product. 100% Vegan &amp; removes chlorine.</li>
            <li> This product works great. It makes my hair feel so soft after washing it from a swim.</li>
            <li> College Swimmer son likes it, seems to help with swimmer hair.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get even one bottle of this Malibu product in this size at any of our salons in town for what I paid for both of these together!  I have always wanted to purchase it because of our hard water, but never would spend that much money on it ~ with this deal, I couldn&#x27;t turn it down...  very happy with purchase &amp; with the seller!</li>
            <li> Nice shampoo and conditioner.  I swim several miles a week, and this shampoo gets all the chlorine out of my hair.  It leaves my hair very soft and shiny also.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for getting chlorine out and leaving behind healthy, residue-free hair!  Would definitely recommend to others.</li>
            <li> The price MIGHT seem high for a clarifying shampoo, but you get a LOT of product here - compared to say Paul Mitchell clarifying shampoo, which is what I was using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I swim 3 miles a day over 2 sessions, so I&#x27;m showering a ton. So far, this stuff is very good, but it DOES work best as a 2-part solution. In other words, I like the results better if I use both the shampoo and conditioner. The product smells like orange cream-cycle which is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m loving it so far. I pair this with the Triswim body wash and lotion and the results have been WAY better than traditional shampoos and soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this product for sure.</li>
            <li> My daughter had stiff crunchy hair after swimming, I didnt know what to do. She swims every week for lessons and I was worried that her hair would break. This shampoo/conditioner works amazing! Her hair is back to normal, It is soft and smells wonderful,  I use it too because the product is amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand of shampoo after swimming in chlorine since the late 1990s, and it&#x27;s my favorite of all of the products I&#x27;ve tried.  This is a great price (I had been paying about $10 for one 9 ounce bottle of shampoo).  The pump on my shampoo bottle doesn&#x27;t work well (the conditioner pump works flawlessly), but I&#x27;m putting it in smaller bottles to use in the locker room, so it&#x27;s not an issue.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo my hair feels so lite and soft. The bottle are huge so it lasts a long time making the price worth it.</li>
            <li> These products keeps my hair healthy despite regular trips to the local pool.  My hair stylist is impressed with how well my hair retains it artificially enhanced color.  I&#x27;ve been using these products for almost three years now and wouldn&#x27;t dream of using anything else.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for four years and it has worked wonderfully.  This time something is different, in just one use my hair went from shiny to dull and flat, just as if I was using a normal shampoo.  I&#x27;m on day four and my hair is miserable and nasty feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what they changed as the ingredients appear to be the same. It definitely does not smell like or as nice as my old bottles do.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 10 years! My hair is healthy even with the heavy swimming that I do! It is also great when I am not in the pool!</li>
            <li> Have been using Malibu C for 7 months.  Best swim shampoo/conditioner EVER!  I swim in outdoor pools 5 days per week.  My hair is in great condition.  Always recommend  this shampoo/conditioner to fellow swimmers.</li>
            <li> I use this product while I am at the beach because it adds moisture and nourishes my hair after a day in the sun.  I do not use this product any other time because it adds too much moisture and makes my hair look and feel dirty.  It has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> So happy to have a sulfate free product for my girls to use after swim team practice!  The one liter bottles are an excellent deal - especially when available via Prime!</li>
            <li> I discovered this shampoo via my Salon.  I was having trouble with shampoo/conditioner build up in my hair.  Nothing was working, everything made my hair very greasy.  I have normal straight/slight curly long hair.  I was told by my stylist that it was due to my water softner that this was happening.  She recommended Malibu Swimmers and I have had ZERO problems since!  Love this stuff!  I order via Amazon since it is way cheaper then the salon!  It comes very quickly and packaged great.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for swimmers.  Leaves hair silky and no cholrine smell.  I tried small bottles first...loved it and moved up to the liters with pumps.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo and conditioner for swimmers. I have two girls with blond hair who swim year round and this is the only shampoo we have found that helps keep the green out of their hair. Also, their hair isn&#x27;t brittle or dry when they use this shampoo. In the summer when the girls don&#x27;t wear swim caps as often, we&#x27;ve also used the Malibu wellness actives swimmers weekly solution - this is the dry packet that you dampen and rub into their hair - this is the first product I&#x27;ve used where I could see the green being pulled out of their blond hair. I can&#x27;t recommend the Malibu products enough for swimmer&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I swim a lot great shampoo</li>
            <li> Wonderful for swimming pool use. I do water aerobics and hate my hair to smell like the pool. Nice citrus smell and my hair feels less britle</li>
            <li> Nice smell and leaves hair feeling soft and manageable!!!!! Will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> The pool I swim in currently is a chlorine and salt water pool so it completely wrecks my hair this works great and haven&#x27;t had any complaints. I swim at least 4 days a week and use this product daily. I have long, straight, thin blonde hair. It can easily go brittle, get split ends and tangle - however, this product works excellent. It rids of the texture chlorine and salt water leave behind, smooths out the potential for tangle and rids of any smell for the pool. I bought the large bottle and will put some on travel bottles and throw them in my gym bag for convenience. Will definitely continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Just received this shampoo and conditioner in the mail.  When I opened the box there was only 1 bottle of conditioner.  The shampoo bottle was missing.  There was suppose to be a 1 liter bottle of shampoo as well.  Very concerning and disappointed with this.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly. very effective products. Repeat purchase</li>
            <li> Initially I gave this product 1 star because when I received it and pump did not work . Amazon said I needed to return both items which I did not want to do and did not want the $7.00 credit either. I called the actual company , Malibu directly today and they are sending me two pumps. I am an avid swimmer and this is by far the best product I have found.</li>
            <li> Good quality product. I swim 3 days a week and it keeps the chlorine out of my hair. I have long hair and it works well in protecting it. They also have chlorine conditioning packets which are great too. Good speedy shipping as well.</li>
            <li> I use this every time I swim and it keeps my hair in good shape. My hair is not coarse and dry. You need to use this first and then rinse out and then apply the Malibu C Swimmers Weekly Solution. It works great.</li>
            <li> The shampoo seems to work well on my kids&#x27; hair after swimming.  The chlorine was so strong at our Y pool that my daughter&#x27;s hair was so crunchy the next day.  This seems to work much better than regular shampoo.  But I am not that happy with the conditioner, it smells bad (It&#x27;s like it was an old batch or something) and I don&#x27;t see it doing a fantastic job or anything, compared to other conditioners.  So I might just purchase the shampoo if it is an option.  The shampoo smells fantastic, orange/mango kind of scent.  I wish the conditioner smelled the same.</li>
            <li> Great product .No more detanglers .Smooth hair after use and stays that wayin the morning.My 10 yrs old daughter swim every day for 2 uhr 6 days a week and I discovered this product when my wife left me alone with kids for two weeks.And went to Europe .When she came back She could not believe how did i managed to keep up with her long hair maintenance that well.I said all i did is use a little bit of science.Thanks</li>
            <li> Wow- great stuff- worth the price. These bottles are huge so will last a couple summers. Makes my daughters hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I swim 3 times or more a week and theses products work great in removing harsh chemicals and leaving my hair soft and smooth again.</li>
            <li> My daughter is a swimmer and is constantly in the pool.  Our hair stylist recommended we try this when we saw her hair becoming dry and losing its luster (even wearing a swim cap).  Malibu worked great - it gets any chlorine out and conditions her hair beautifully.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re swimming in a chlorine pool, this is a must have.  My daughter has very blonde hair, almost white in the summer. These products have saved us hundreds of dollars over the years having the chemicals taken out of her hair every summer.  I guarantee, it works!</li>
