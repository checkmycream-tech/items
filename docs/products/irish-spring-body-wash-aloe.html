            <li>My wife introduced me to this wonderful product.  </li>
            <li>am convinced it is the best out there esp for your money.</li>
            <li>aroma is great morning or night!</li>
            <li>The price was very good , everything was in good shape upon arrival.</li>
            <li>but I am happy even for Body Wash</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleans well, smells great but not too strongly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The aloe in it is very kind to the skin.  </li>
            <li>I find it to be very handy to use in the shower rather  than a bar of soap.</li>
            <li>This is just a good product over all.  </li>
            <li>It is a good value.</li>
            <li>Body wash good,, received a damaged bottle wash</li>
            <li>Perhaps for some of you that&#x27;s a good thing.  </li>

            <li>the aroma is refreshing!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I give this product 5 stars because I love the smell, it leaves my skin feeling healthy/moisturized, and I saved money purchasing it on the site!</li>
            <li>But then came my first bath and it flowed smoothly and produced incredible sudsiness.  </li>
            <li>It is a winner, for sure.</li>

            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It is a better value than in the stores.</li>
            <li>but perhaps it could be packaged better.</li>
            <li>just love the smell.</li>
            <li>It  remains my favorite soap to date.</li>
            <li>I tried this body wash as I really enjoyed the scent.  </li>
            <li>Keep it up!! :)</li>
            <li>I love this body</li>
            <li>The pleasant scent is really good, not too strong, not too dim.  </li>
            <li>I like the fresh, clean scent and the fact that it&#x27;s Irish Spring-always loved the soap but, not so convenient to use in the shower, so, the shower gel is perfect!</li>
            <li>LOVE THE EASY TO USE BOTTLE...</li>
            <li>I love the aloe scent &amp; Irish Spring body wash gives you a great clean, non-waxy feeling!</li>
            <li>I love this body wash because it leaves me feeling fresh and very clean.  </li>
            <li>Every penny saved, is a penny earned and it all adds up quick!</li>
            <li>When I found out that it was available in liquid form I immediately ordered it.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll love the fresh smell that lasts&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a clean, refreshing, fresh smell.</li>
            <li>I use the powerful I.S. bar soap for a reason and the liquid stuff just doesn&#x27;t do the job!</li>
            <li>Comes right to the door!  </li>
            <li>So feel this is right product for me herer!</li>
            <li>And it is at a good price, delivered, and no lugging it around in the store or the back of the car.  </li>
            <li>My IRISH  friends laugh at the name, but I&#x27;ve always liked the scent of this soap.</li>
            <li>I use Irish Spring bar soap and love it.</li>
            <li>Happy to buy the three-pack at such a reasonable price that I decided to try out the Irish Spring and agree with my husband</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>Yea I&#x27;m lazy, but I can get away with it :P</li>
            <li>I discovered that the unit price runs about $.75 higher and the size is 15 oz and at the store the size is $.18</li>
            <li>I was at my national chain local brick and mortar superstore and I picked up this Irish Spring, same thing I&#x27;ve been using for years because it is innexpensive, smells great, and works fine.</li>
            <li>and he really appreciates the benefits of the body wash and glad I found it in Irish Spring.  </li>
            <li>the smell was different (not as strong or crisp.)</li>
            <li>I live in the area with desert climate and water is kind of hard as well, first time baught from Ralph, and it gave me smooth and cool feeling after shower,  and my skin feel more itchy due to dryness.</li>
            <li>The delivery time was pretty fast.</li>
            <li>great product  little spendy though  sams clu was cheaper for the same size</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soap so there isn&#x27;t much to review.  </li>
            <li>SO MUCH EASIER THAN A BAR OF SOAP....</li>
            <li>Getting back to the product itself, for the money, there is nothing special about this soap.</li>
            <li>After the first time he used it in the shower I was walking by and was completely offended by the smell.</li>
            <li>And I admit I am very sensitive to certain perfumes and this is one I cannot stand to be around.  </li>
            <li>So it you enjoy is particular fragrance, rest assured, it will last and last.  </li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I think that&#x27;s pretty gross.</li>
            <li>I will not be ordering Irish Spring again or at least not for quite a long time, however, what I dislike about it may just be what you find attractive.</li>
            <li>After I got out of the shower I picked my old bottle out of the trash and compared it against this one to see if they had changed the formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just wish they&#x27;d bring back the corny old tv commercials.&lt;br</li>
            <li>shouldn&#x27;t have bought this from amazon as even the \\&quot;discounted\\&quot; amazon price is a few dollars higher than the \\&quot;undisounted\\&quot; price at my local target.</li>
            <li>It lathers really well with just a little gel.  </li>

            <li> I am ordering Irish Spring Aloe next because the regular seems to dry my skin.</li>
            <li> Admittedly, I purposely used it heavily for a St. Patrick&#x27;s Day party since the identifiable scent makes one think Irish.</li>
            <li> I just couldn&#x27;t go back to Dial or any other type.</li>
            <li> I dig the smell, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, and my girlfriend loves it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- 3 Irish Spring body wash for a little over 10 bucks!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It can help you perk up during that early morning shower or it can be soothing late at night and help you relax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The soap is very drying to the skin and when it arrived,most of the contents, from 2 bottles were spilled in the box, since the tops were broken off.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, not so much for me.  </li>
            <li> A word of warning:  this body wash is extremely drying and does not moisturize.  </li>
            <li> This specific wash did leave my skin feeling softer than usual after showering, and I believe that&#x27;s because the aloe helps to keep your skin from drying out.</li>
            <li> have previously used the bar soap version of this body wash and have found this counterpart to be every bit as good&lt;</li>
            <li> I am disabled and take sit down showers where a slippery bar of soap can be a problem.</li>
            <li> I work outside, and inclement weather can certainly be tough on your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels like harsh detergent, with that scent added, that makes it, &amp;#34;Irish Spring.&amp;#34; What would we do without advertising in this country?</li>
            <li> My husband has used Irish Spring for years and because he has a difficult time holding onto the bar soap, I switched him over to the body wash</li>
            <li> Plus, these shower gels do not leave soap scum in your shower/tub.  </li>
            <li> In fact, it was really disappointing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am very disappointed in Amazon.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was looking at the things that could come to the house without me going to the store, and there was the Irish Spring Body Wash!  Wow!  And it is at a good price, delivered, and no lugging it around in the store or the back of the car.  Comes right to the door!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I love this body wash because it leaves me feeling fresh and very clean.  The aloe in it is very kind to the skin.  It is a winner, for sure.</li>
            <li> The price was very good , everything was in good shape upon arrival. The delivery time was pretty fast. Thank You for the satisfying Purchase. Ken Calif.</li>
            <li> I am not Irish, or related to Irish or Manufacturer. I just love it!  The pleasant scent is really good, not too strong, not too dim.  It will make you love shower.</li>
            <li> I love the smell from this body wash. It has a clean, refreshing, fresh smell. Although it&#x27;s advertised that the scent lasts for 8 hours, I find that the smell is unnoticeable within an hour or two. However, I like this body wash because it doesn&#x27;t leave any lotion residue like some soaps do (that I personally do not like).  However, I did find the body wash cheaper elsewhere, like at a local Target or Walmart, compared to Amazon&#x27;s prices.</li>
            <li> I was at my national chain local brick and mortar superstore and I picked up this Irish Spring, same thing I&#x27;ve been using for years because it is innexpensive, smells great, and works fine. I didn&#x27;t bother to smell it because I know what Irish Spring smells like. But when I used it that night, I noticed the consistency was different (more liquid) and the smell was different (not as strong or crisp.) After I got out of the shower I picked my old bottle out of the trash and compared it against this one to see if they had changed the formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And they did, it is now MADE IN MEXICO. I don&#x27;t know if it has filtered into Amazon&#x27;s warehouse yet, but it will as Colgate restructures their company. So do yourself a favor and jump to another brand as I did. I recommend Dove.</li>
            <li> I use Irish Spring bar soap and love it. I just couldn&#x27;t go back to Dial or any other type. But, this liquid stuff is NOT in the league of the bar soap. In fact, it was really disappointing. I&#x27;d put it in the Dial soap category, which for me, is not what I wanted. I tossed my two 16oz bottles out after 3 washes and went back to the Irish Spring bar soap. I use the powerful I.S. bar soap for a reason and the liquid stuff just doesn&#x27;t do the job!</li>
            <li> My husband has used Irish Spring for years and because he has a difficult time holding onto the bar soap, I switched him over to the body wash and he really appreciates the benefits of the body wash and glad I found it in Irish Spring.  Happy to buy the three-pack at such a reasonable price that I decided to try out the Irish Spring and agree with my husband the aroma is refreshing!  It was packaged so well in shrink wrap that there was no leakage and it arrived soon after I placed my order.  Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling soap I have ever used!  I love this stuff.  Plus, these shower gels do not leave soap scum in your shower/tub.  I only wash the shower once a month now.  Yea I&#x27;m lazy, but I can get away with it :P</li>
            <li> My roommate decided to use this body wash. After the first time he used it in the shower I was walking by and was completely offended by the smell. It smelled like a men&#x27;s urinal. I don&#x27;t know what they put in it, but it smells like walking in to a men&#x27;s urinal at a bar. I think that&#x27;s pretty gross. If you don&#x27;t smell pee after using this product, then maybe it&#x27;s for you.</li>
            <li> This is just a good product over all.  Admittedly, I purposely used it heavily for a St. Patrick&#x27;s Day party since the identifiable scent makes one think Irish.</li>
            <li> It is a good value. It&#x27;s soap so there isn&#x27;t much to review.  It is a better value than in the stores.</li>
            <li> The soap is very drying to the skin and when it arrived,most of the contents, from 2 bottles were spilled in the box, since the tops were broken off. No fault of Amazon or the Marketplace Vendor but perhaps it could be packaged better. Getting back to the product itself, for the money, there is nothing special about this soap. It feels like harsh detergent, with that scent added, that makes it, &amp;#34;Irish Spring.&amp;#34; What would we do without advertising in this country? Madison Avenue, could potentially take Rat droppings and spin them into a product that we all wish we could afford...I will not be ordering Irish Spring again or at least not for quite a long time, however, what I dislike about it may just be what you find attractive. Who knows? But for myself, it just did not work.</li>
            <li> Body wash good,, received a damaged bottle wash was all over inside of plastic bag.&lt;br /&gt;I just love the smell. I am ordering Irish Spring Aloe next because the regular seems to dry my skin.</li>
            <li> great product  little spendy though  sams clu was cheaper for the same size bottle  how ever it is nice not to have to go shopping in the cold weather</li>
            <li> My wife introduced me to this wonderful product.  It felt like molasses. Another loser, I thought.  But then came my first bath and it flowed smoothly and produced incredible sudsiness.  Some loser!  We always use it now.</li>
            <li> I got away from using bar soap several years ago, and discovered this body wash shortly after. It  remains my favorite soap to date. I love the aloe scent &amp; Irish Spring body wash gives you a great clean, non-waxy feeling!</li>
            <li> I am disabled and take sit down showers where a slippery bar of soap can be a problem. Have used Irish Spring for years and like it. When I found out that it was available in liquid form I immediately ordered it. I find it to be very handy to use in the shower rather  than a bar of soap.</li>
            <li> I live in the area with desert climate and water is kind of hard as well, first time baught from Ralph, and it gave me smooth and cool feeling after shower,  and my skin feel more itchy due to dryness.So feel this is right product for me herer!</li>
            <li> I have received this product in subscribe and save for several months. When the price increased, I shopped around locally. I discovered that the unit price runs about $.75 higher and the size is 15 oz and at the store the size is $.18 oz.&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed in Amazon.</li>
            <li> My IRISH  friends laugh at the name, but I&#x27;ve always liked the scent of this soap. I just wish they&#x27;d bring back the corny old tv commercials.&lt;br /&gt;Great value in the 3-pack, and speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> I tried this body wash as I really enjoyed the scent.  The product promised that it created \\&quot;healthy-feeling skin\\&quot;.  A word of warning:  this body wash is extremely drying and does not moisturize.  Use Irish Spring only as a hand soap if you must.</li>
            <li> I always choose Amazon for almost everything but I am happy even for Body Wash I could save some more bucks and get the product I love!! Keep it up!! :)</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;I have previously used the bar soap version of this body wash and have found this counterpart to be every bit as good&lt;br /&gt;Cleans well, smells great but not too strongly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I shouldn&#x27;t have bought this from amazon as even the \\&quot;discounted\\&quot; amazon price is a few dollars higher than the \\&quot;undisounted\\&quot; price at my local target.</li>
            <li> My husband uses the Irish Spring bar soap and I like it.  I decided to get him the body wash.  It lathers really well with just a little gel.  However, I made the mistake of getting the 8hr scent gel and it has a perfume smell to it that lasts and lasts and it gives me a sore throat and a headache.  And I admit I am very sensitive to certain perfumes and this is one I cannot stand to be around.  I had some on my hands and have washed my hands several times trying to get rid of this smell and its still there.  So it you enjoy is particular fragrance, rest assured, it will last and last.  Perhaps for some of you that&#x27;s a good thing.  Unfortunately, not so much for me.  It&#x27;s going in the garbage or he&#x27;s sleeping in the guest room from now on.  I will try the regular Irish Spring gel.  Hopefully it&#x27;s not as &amp;#34;lingering&amp;#34; and has a &amp;#34;fresher&amp;#34; smell like the bar soap.</li>
            <li> Giving this five stars because its awesome&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- 3 Irish Spring body wash for a little over 10 bucks!&lt;br /&gt;- plus you get a 20% discount when you subscribe&lt;br /&gt;- you&#x27;ll love the fresh smell that lasts&lt;br /&gt;- does the job 100%&lt;br /&gt;- this one is the deal! the steal!</li>
            <li> My wife wanted me to switch to liquid soap because it supposedly does not leave soap residue in our shower. Unfortunately, like most liquid soaps I have tried, it seems to leave a soap residue on me... I can&#x27;t seem to get it to totally rinse it off.</li>
            <li> I dig the smell, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, and my girlfriend loves it. It&#x27;ll last you quite awhile too. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Only wash my son will use</li>
            <li> i think they changed the formula&lt;br /&gt;and now my entire skin itches and feels like something is crawling on me&lt;br /&gt;i been using this for years but never again,</li>
            <li> Gives a delightful clean and freshness to the body while you bath shower or while you just wash up, you do your body a favor.</li>
            <li> LOVE THE EASY TO USE BOTTLE... SO MUCH EASIER THAN A BAR OF SOAP....</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years and comparing it to others,&lt;br /&gt;I am convinced it is the best out there esp for your money.</li>
            <li> I love this body wash!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The aroma is great morning or night! It can help you perk up during that early morning shower or it can be soothing late at night and help you relax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the Aloe version because it was the cheapest option, however, I want to say I like all Irish Spring body washes. This specific wash did leave my skin feeling softer than usual after showering, and I believe that&#x27;s because the aloe helps to keep your skin from drying out. I work outside, and inclement weather can certainly be tough on your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I give this product 5 stars because I love the smell, it leaves my skin feeling healthy/moisturized, and I saved money purchasing it on the site! Every penny saved, is a penny earned and it all adds up quick!</li>
            <li> I like the fresh, clean scent and the fact that it&#x27;s Irish Spring-always loved the soap but, not so convenient to use in the shower, so, the shower gel is perfect!</li>
