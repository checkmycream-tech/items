            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be any happier with this case.  It is quality all the way.  Strong, pretty.  I have been using it for a year, I keep all my cosmetics, including face toners and cleansers inside.  When I dump everything out, you have no clue how it all fits in the case, and yet, when everything is in, you can still put in things.  I keep brushes and spongess in the durable plastic pocket in the top.  This is money VERY well spent.</li>
            <li> great little makeup case, I really like it.</li>
            <li> My daughter liked the case very much.  It will be great to use when traveling.</li>
            <li> Wife was pleased with the quality and size of the bag for the very low price. She liked the fact that it is easy to clean in case something spills inside. If she&#x27;s happy I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> It is a very nice case.  Seems as though it will hold all the required cosmetics for a trip.  Material is attractive along with the design.  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Received promptly and exactly as described. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Great travel or make up bag. Only problem: if theres not enough stuff in it, it goes limp a little. But other than that, I absolutely love the design and feel of it.</li>
            <li> Wish the whole thing was lined with plastic but  I put tmy travel bottles and make up in baggies and stand them in here. It&#x27;s plenty tall for my travel bottles. Stuff in your shower cap or whatever and it will keep the bottles standing.  No dividers inside but comes with a plastic sealed pouch along the top inside of the lid that is removable although it is not big enough to hold more than like toothpaste and toothbrush. Durable.</li>
            <li> Love this bag for storing my toiletries while traveling.</li>
            <li> Great item with a very good price!.. There is very little not to love about this cosmetic bag/train case.. so GET ONE WHILE YOU CAN!&lt;br /&gt;I am really true fan of the Ecotools Alicia Silverstone product line.. they are usually great stuff, and often, outstanding products...</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the look and quality of this train case. There was plenty of room for all my make-up.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for myself to match the other Ecotools bag I have but somehow it shipped to my daughter in law.  Apparently I didn&#x27;t click the right shipping address.  If it&#x27;s made as well as my smaller bag I give it 5 starts.  Great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> I need a new clean make up bag and when this one came I was very pleased.  I love it and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I am a professional traveler.  As a professional traveler who is constantly on the road, this is the perfect grab and go kit for makeup.  It fits all of my items perfectly.  The case is soft, and fits easily in my bag, and will kind of squish to make room no matter how packed your bag is.  And I do carry a lot of stuff.  This makeup case is perfect.  It appears to be durable, and fits my makeup perfectly.  It is a nice size as well.</li>
            <li> THIS CASE IS THE PERFECT SIZE.THE QUALITY IS SUPERIOR.IT IS ALL PLASTIC LINED, JUST IN CASE SOMETHING LEAKS,IT CAN BE EASILY WIPED CLEAN.IT LOOKS HAND PAINTED.</li>
            <li> they are great to hold make up, hair stuff, etc.  They are nice enough to be displayed on a dresser.</li>
            <li> Well made and gorgeous is the only way to describe this case.  I can&#x27;t find a single thing to complain about.</li>
            <li> I bought this bag to be my \\&quot;pill\\&quot; bag&lt;br /&gt; I needed something where I could put all of my vitamin supplements and other medications I am taking so everything was easily accessible and transportable. This bag can really be used for anything. I love how stylish and cute it is.</li>
            <li> This cosmetic bag is quite sturdy and very attractive. Would withstand a lot of travel and not lose its shape. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for everything I carry. I absolutely love the removable pouch on the inside.</li>
            <li> The bag is durable , spacious, and cute to look at. It will definitely hold all your beauty essentials. I have no complaints!</li>
            <li> I needed a larger makeup tote and was partial to the eco-conscious philosophy of the brand. The design is lovely and I like the hemp-like texture. The only drawback is if it is only partially full, the sides sag but it&#x27;s only a very minor inconvenience. Just what I needed.</li>
            <li> I was expecting this to be smaller, but the actual size is perfect. I needed something for all my makeup and brushes, because I do my makeup in random parts of my house, depending on when my one year old wakes up! This bag is easy to carry, has plenty of storage and I love the detachable plastic bag for makeup brushes. It is also even more beautiful in person than in the picture. I couldn&#x27;t rave about this more!</li>
            <li> Loved this item. Great quality and my granddaughter loved it</li>
            <li> The product arrived just fine, and just as described. I&#x27;ve had it for about 2 months and one of the zipper pulls just broke. It doesn&#x27;t close the zipper anymore. It&#x27;s not a huge inconvenience because there are two, so I can use the other one. It&#x27;s just a little disappointing because the product is so new. Everything else about it is fine, especially for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> Super cute travel bag to put your essentials in. :) I love the material, design, and the small compartment inside the bag where you can put your QTips, BandAids, Bobby Pins, etc. This is a MUST HAVE!</li>
            <li> I bought several of these for my four daughters.  I put their birthday gifts ( bracelets and amazon gift cards) inside so it was a nice gift inside a nice gift.  The case is well made and very attractive.</li>
            <li> This makeup is amazing, it as an excellent quality, smooth and soft. The bag can hold all of my makeup and more. Great Buy.</li>
            <li> Great case it comes with a small plastic bag i am going to put my extra makup in hete</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this make up bag. Very pretty, practical, and durable.</li>
            <li> Attractive, sturdy and I especially love the plastic case that velcro&#x27;s to the lid for my brushes or small items.  The size is good and I would recommend this to my friends.</li>
            <li> This item was for my wife&#x27;s birthday. She is totally happy with the Train Case.&lt;br /&gt;She carried one before and wore it out. Thrilled to find a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;The case arrived before expected delivery date.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll do business here again.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and perfect for traveling.</li>
            <li> very nice but a little flimsy, doesn&#x27;t hold it&#x27;s shape very well.</li>
            <li> Quality product that looks and performs just like the ad.  I would definitely buy Ecotools products in the future.</li>
            <li> Wonderful Bag for my cosmetics!  I love the beautiful painting on the front.  Would order again  when I need another.</li>
            <li> Pretty, but very thin and collapses.</li>
            <li> This is a great bag. I like the fabric, lining, soft siding, size for every day cosmetics and travel. I highly recommend this case</li>
            <li> VERY NICE FOR MAKE UP !</li>
            <li> Recycled materials, well made, roomy, with a removable clear small pouch, and nice to look at. Great size for traveling, big enough to hold toiletries as well.  This is a soft- sided case.</li>
            <li> Very well made, it has an interior small, clear accessory bag that detaches and can be taken separately if needed.</li>
            <li> This bag is unexpectedly great! I tend not to buy things with celeb names attached, but this one fit the bill for what I need, and it&#x27;s pretty great. I like the insert. I use it alternately for holding brushes or as an on-the-go travel makeup bag. It is nice quality and the visual design on the bag is inoffensive enough (it&#x27;s hard to find one I REALLY like the look of and has what I need). Nice job!</li>
            <li> Love it! very sturdy and easy to clean. I can&#x27;t fit a regular can of mousse nor a flat iron but it holds all my little travel items that get lost during travel.</li>
            <li> I have lotions, bottles of cleanser  and creams. It holds all the make up I use daily and then some extra&#x27;s and a pouch for the make up brushes</li>
            <li> I love this bag. It&#x27;s adorable, earthy, and has a lot of room on the inside. I love how the clear top compartment detaches as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing but good things to say. A great buy for the price.</li>
            <li> Bought 1 for me and 1 as gift.  Very nice and a good size to fits lots of makeup.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Size it perfect and the detachable case inside is great!  Very stylish!  Glad I purchased this case.  Worthwhile and a fair price.</li>
            <li> It is a good quality case. Based on other descriptions on here, I thought that it would be a little bigger. But it&#x27;s big enough for me to transport my daily makeup, and then some. I use it daily!&lt;br /&gt;I love this brand.</li>
            <li> Love it! It&#x27;s a great makeup case for weekend getaways. It holds a lot of my makeup for a small case.</li>
            <li> Larger than I need, but nice quality. I really appreciate that it&#x27;s made out of biodegradeable materials. I moved my plastic case over to my travel luggage. The color and texture work well with my bathroom decor, so I store it on an open shelf, freeing up some under storage space that Ineeded.</li>
            <li> Great Makeup bag and really pretty. Holds all my makeup and brushes.</li>
            <li> Did not meet expectations.  Does not have hard sides, so is too floppy and things fall out when open</li>
            <li> was having trouble finding the right size and love the design. it is very functional with a Velcro attached case in the cover of it so makes traveling without a mess much easier.</li>
            <li> got it for a friend for an xmas gift...shipped fast looked just like the picture! washable and durable! love! this is great if you need something for on the go or for a teenager who doesn&#x27;t have alot of make up.</li>
            <li> The design is awesome, exactly as it shows in the picture, and is sturdy and durable. More than enough space (although I&#x27;m no cosmetic hoarder) and I especially love the removable plastic pouch.&lt;br /&gt;More than glad I decided to buy the item.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay especially if you have a lot of makeup or accessories. It&#x27;s just okay for me. My fault, it was a bad  purchase because i did not need such a large makeup bag. Maybe it will come in handy when i travel.</li>
            <li> Perfect size exactly what I needed !</li>
            <li> I bought this to take my makeups and toiletries to labor and delivery. It was a perfect size. A bit on the large side but that is just what I needed and it was not too big at all. Very good quality. Held up well for the few days I was in the hospital and I am excited now I have a decent case to travel with in the future</li>
