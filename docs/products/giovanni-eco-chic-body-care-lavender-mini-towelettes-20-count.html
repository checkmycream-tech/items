            <li>I REALLY loved it...</li>
            <li>They smell really good and feel nice.</li>
            <li>Love this product, and when i share they want to where to purchase!</li>
            <li>Love this brand!</li>
            <li>These are my go to for dual purpose hand sanitizing towelettes - lovely scent and effective cleaning.</li>
            <li>So refreshing, smell lovely, and are a nice size.</li>
            <li>I have to warn about the grapefruit scent, I love eating grapefruit, drinking grapefruit juice, and I like most grapefruit body sprays and lotions; however there is something off-putting about the Giovanni grapefruit scent.</li>
            <li>So glad that AmericaRX had these available through Amazon!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried both the Lavender and Grapefruit scents and love them both.</li>
            <li>Love these.  </li>
            <li>I love these - I brought them in to work to refresh me during the day.  </li>
            <li>The size of the towelette is also good, just right to rub between your hands.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really know about the calm, but the scent is great.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not too strong and doesn&#x27;t have a chemically smell at all</li>
            <li>I have been a huge fan of these towelettes for years.  </li>
            <li>These smell fantastic</li>
            <li>They smell wonderful and fresh and natural--not cloying like some other brands.</li>
            <li>Very nice scent like individually packed</li>
            <li>If you were a Mom using a lot of them it might not be justified, but for my occasional use, just the pleasant scent of these is worth the price.</li>
            <li>They smell so genuinely of lavender and they just make me smile whenever I use them.</li>
            <li>I have pulled them out for a lot of things recently which reminds me I need to buy some more!</li>
            <li>I really think this product is worth the cost which is higher than most towelettes.</li>
            <li>I restock often and makes a great little gift for my sister, mother and friends.</li>
            <li>They sanitize and calm.</li>
            <li>Bit pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>The peppermint scent is also nice, I personally like it, but if I were to offer one to a friend, I think the peppermint is a stronger scent that some people might not like.</li>
            <li>I buy these for my grand daughter on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li>They really do relax her before she goes to bed.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Giovanni and Amazon</li>
            <li>They make you feel very refreshed.</li>
            <li>really like these.</li>
            <li>I keep these handy and have a few in my bag all the time.</li>
            <li>As for the scents Giovanni offers, I think lavender is the most universally pleasing</li>
            <li>The packaging is very nice, I always have a few in my purse, especially when I travel.</li>
            <li>They are my go-to remedy for a quick freshen-up, especially in the summer heat.  </li>
            <li>The towelettes are very sturdy and soft.</li>
            <li>The towlettes are large enough to get the job done.</li>
            <li>For a &amp;#34;wet nap&amp;#34; they are very classy looking and the packaging is sturdy, so they never dry out if, for example, you keep them in the car.</li>
