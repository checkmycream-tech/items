            <li>Dries hair a little but when used with conditioner it is awesome!</li>
            <li>Perfect everyday shampoo.</li>
            <li>It is a good product and we were able to purchase it cheaper than at a local store.  </li>
            <li>My hair is healthy and very manageable and I have itch free skin!</li>
            <li>Good shampoo for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This is a fine product that  is aptly named &#x27;Free and Clear&#x27; and does what one expects from a shampoo.  </li>
            <li>The formula of the shampoo I was originally using was changed and it began to make my head itch.  </li>
            <li>It keeps your hair clean and shiny, and doesn&#x27;t cause irritation.</li>
            <li>I was happy, however, it does over dry the hair, my hair never look so fuzzy after washing.</li>
            <li>It give me a feeling that it damages my hair, although it leaves my scalp clean.</li>
            <li>Can cause your hair to dry out somewhat but otherwise a great shampoo.</li>
            <li>No scent and leaves my hair clean.</li>
            <li>The only good thing about this shampoo is that it did clean my hair.</li>
            <li>Truly fragrance free for those with allergies; and does a great job of getting your hair clean without being overly harsh on it</li>
            <li>Like the conditioner, my head does not itch as much and my hair is very clean.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipment was quick and problem-free.</li>
            <li>Her skin is much better since we started using the Free and Clear Shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have also used Free and Clear hair spray and seem to be pleased with it as well.</li>
            <li>now anyway, we have found a new shampoo for our family, until something better comes along.</li>
            <li>Pricey but worth it in no allergic reactions or sensitivities .</li>
            <li>My hairdresser turned me on to this no artificial ingredient product...</li>
            <li>but if I smell lavender I better be near a lavender plant.</li>
            <li>I am allergic and sensitive to most shampoo&#x27;s on the market and this one does not break me out.  </li>
            <li>I completely switched my hair products to Free &amp; Clear and love them.</li>
            <li>It seems to take more of the product than it should to produce the necessary suds or cleaning capacity, otherwise it would get a five.</li>
            <li>It is not really unscented, in my opinion, and might benefit from a more appealing natural scent.  </li>
            <li>This is the hair care line my dermatologist recommended and the only shampoo I can use more than three days in a row without having problems.</li>
            <li>After using this product a couple of times, I must say this is the first time in 6 months that my scalp &amp; forehead hasn&#x27;t itched and caused a rash.  </li>
            <li>â€”it lathers better and it goes further.</li>
            <li>I use Free and Clear shampoo &amp; conditioner all the time &amp; it</li>
            <li>A year ago I found Free and Clear on Amazon, tried it and have been using it since that time.  </li>
            <li>It does lather nicely, it does not dry my hair or scalp and my hair is soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that I can skip and day of washing with no problem and my hair feels soft, my scalp feels clean.</li>
            <li>he is allergic to pretty much everything but</li>
            <li>This product does not strip your body with strong detergents or artificial colors or perfumes... just a great product.</li>
            <li>It is supposed to be gentle and pure.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;She has commented that her head does not itch as much, and is not as flaky as it used to be.</li>
            <li>it does not make much for suds, but no problems with rash, or itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>The liquid is very sticky and plugs up the outlet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and thorough.</li>
            <li>This shampoo works very well.</li>
            <li>I started using Free and Clear shampoo and it started healing in a couple of days and completely healed in about a week.</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to fragrances or are just tired of having your sense of smell constantly attacked by that which isn&#x27;t really there, this is and excellent product.</li>
            <li>It worked great for  a few months, but i developed a sudden allergy to it of course after i ordered a 3 bottle deal from amazon, I would like to have returned it, but they were going to charge me a 30% restocking fee</li>
            <li>I would often have flares around my eyes that caused a lot of embarrassment for me but those have almost totally cleared up since I started using Free and Clear Shampoo.</li>
            <li>highly recommended if you have skin allergies</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for about a year and highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I now use this and all of the other Free and Clear products exclusively.</li>
            <li>After a lot of research and reading of other people&#x27;s experiences, I tried Free and Clear shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>My husband has verrrry sensitive skin and a pharmacist recommended this shampoo and it is proving to be helpful.</li>
            <li>So far, this has been a winner for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have developed a skin sensitivity and this shampoo has relieved me of the problem.  </li>
            <li>I will recommend this product to people who have sensitive skin for it does not irritate your scalp at all.</li>
            <li>I had dry patches on my face and scalp and the dermatologist could not confirm the exact allergen.</li>
            <li>I am a person who needs a fragrance free shampoo and have not had problems with this in the past, but will not purchase again.</li>
            <li>The cleanser has the same smell only much lighter.  </li>
            <li>this shampoo and my aunts soap she makes for him are about all he can use without breaking out in every sensitive area especially his eye lid areas.</li>
            <li>It actually burned my scalp and left huge irritated red patches on my scalp that crept down onto my forehead and neck.</li>
            <li>It does what it says it&#x27;s going to do at a reasonable price and without the risk of skin or other allergy sensitivity.</li>

            <li> It does what it says it&#x27;s going to do at a reasonable price and without the risk of skin or other allergy sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling clean and no residue left behind.</li>
            <li> This is very unfortunate because I liked the way it made my hair look and feel.  </li>
            <li> His dermatologist recommended it due to dry and sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> It also left my scalp extremely dry.</li>
            <li> It will only cause trouble for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be using this for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> I had a scalp infection that would not clear up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other shampoos that left my hair softer or shinier, but they all make me itch eventually.</li>
            <li> her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two other members in our family have noticed it has helped with some minor scalp flakiness they had as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo that I can use without any trouble.</li>
            <li> As expected.</li>
            <li> This shampoo was very thick, unlike the same product I have used in the past (new and improved!??)  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Pricey but worth it in no allergic reactions or sensitivities . A good product.</li>
            <li> this was recomended by the allergist. It worked great for  a few months, but i developed a sudden allergy to it of course after i ordered a 3 bottle deal from amazon, I would like to have returned it, but they were going to charge me a 30% restocking fee so why bother? Guess thats what they count on. and who can open 3 bottles in a 30 day span&amp;#62; So i have 3 unopened bottles if anyone needs them and sunscreen and shaving cream,ETC.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to formaldehyde - which is in an amazing number of products.  This shampoo is formaldehyde free and works great for me.</li>
            <li> I have sulfite sensitivity and other allergies. This is the only shampoo that I can use without any trouble. I love it!</li>
            <li> Perfect if you have allergies</li>
            <li> Like the conditioner, my head does not itch as much and my hair is very clean.  I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> For someone with many allergies, this has been a godsend.</li>
            <li> It is a good product and we were able to purchase it cheaper than at a local store.  Good deal!</li>
            <li> It was bought for my wife. She has to use it because of her allergies.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great for sensitive skin and oily-ish hair. I&#x27;ve noticed that I can skip and day of washing with no problem and my hair feels soft, my scalp feels clean. Love it.</li>
            <li> The issue for me is finding an unscented shampoo. This product passes the test. It seems to take more of the product than it should to produce the necessary suds or cleaning capacity, otherwise it would get a five. Service from the supplier was excellent.</li>
            <li> I have contact senstivities to fragrances.  I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for over a year, and it doesn&#x27;t make my scalp, ears and face itch.  I&#x27;ve used other shampoos that left my hair softer or shinier, but they all make me itch eventually.</li>
            <li> My husband has verrrry sensitive skin and a pharmacist recommended this shampoo and it is proving to be helpful.</li>
            <li> Our daughter has suffered with eczema all her life. We continue to try products to help relieve her urge to itch as much as possible. So far, this has been a winner for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has commented that her head does not itch as much, and is not as flaky as it used to be. And visually looking at her, we agree that there has been an improvement. We are not making any claims that this is a cure, just saying it has helped her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two other members in our family have noticed it has helped with some minor scalp flakiness they had as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now anyway, we have found a new shampoo for our family, until something better comes along.</li>
            <li> he loves this shampoo...he is allergic to pretty much everything but this shampoo and my aunts soap she makes for him are about all he can use without breaking out in every sensitive area especially his eye lid areas. highly recommended if you have skin allergies</li>
            <li> This shampoo was very thick, unlike the same product I have used in the past (new and improved!??)  I tried adding water to it and still couldn&#x27;t get it to lather and cover my hair well.  After a while it started to smell really bad, also.  Don&#x27;t know if that is because I added the water and it became rancid or what.  The cleanser has the same smell only much lighter.  This scent became so bad it was making me sick and I had to throw it out.  This is very unfortunate because I liked the way it made my hair look and feel.  It gave it body and fullness and even seemed to restore the color in it.  But I just cannot stand the thickness, lack of lathering quality and the smell.  It is not really unscented, in my opinion, and might benefit from a more appealing natural scent.  I am a person who needs a fragrance free shampoo and have not had problems with this in the past, but will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I had a scalp infection that would not clear up. I started using Free and Clear shampoo and it started healing in a couple of days and completely healed in about a week. Also I have been loosing hair and finding it in my comb for years, and this also stopped almost Immediately. I now use this and all of the other Free and Clear products exclusively.</li>
            <li> My wife has allergies to perfume smells.  This product is great for no smells, and does a very good job of keeping your hair clean.</li>
            <li> I thought I would try this shampoo, and it works ok, and as others have said. it does not make much for suds, but no problems with rash, or itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> This product is so harsh, it stripped my hair!  It is supposed to be gentle and pure.  ugh.  I wish I didn&#x27;t buy a 3 pack!</li>
            <li> After a severe poison ivy reaction I found that I could no longer tolerate any of the soaps or shampoos that I previously used. After a lot of research and reading of other people&#x27;s experiences, I tried Free and Clear shampoo and conditioner. I&#x27;m back to washing my hair in the shower without worrying about breaking out in hives over my entire body! The shampoo takes very little to work. It does not lather up as much as other shampoos, but that&#x27;s because it doesn&#x27;t have the added chemicals that make the lather. My hair is healthy and very manageable and I have itch free skin! Highly recommend this shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo for people with sensitive skin and scalp. It keeps your hair clean and shiny, and doesn&#x27;t cause irritation.</li>
            <li> The only good thing about this shampoo is that it did clean my hair. It also left my scalp extremely dry. I had the worst case of dandruff that I have ever had in my life. It actually burned my scalp and left huge irritated red patches on my scalp that crept down onto my forehead and neck. My skin is still healing from using this product. I repeat, do not buy this product. It will only cause trouble for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo on my daughter for about 4 years.  It works great and keeps her skin from breaking out.</li>
            <li> I have a problem with my skin through many years of sun abuse. My hairdresser turned me on to this no artificial ingredient product... and I have been a user ever since. This product does not strip your body with strong detergents or artificial colors or perfumes... just a great product.</li>
            <li> I have a freaky immune system, lots of weird allergic reactions. This is the hair care line my dermatologist recommended and the only shampoo I can use more than three days in a row without having problems.</li>
            <li> Good shampoo for those with sensitive skin. Have had no problems since I started using it.&lt;br /&gt;Shipment was quick and problem-free.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this shampoo.  I have been using it for about a year and highly recommend it.  &amp;#34;Free and Clear&amp;#34; also has other hair care products - conditioner, hairspray, gel, etc.</li>
            <li> For this type of product it is excellent.</li>
            <li> Really happy about this product. Perfect everyday shampoo. If you are sensitive to fragrances or are just tired of having your sense of smell constantly attacked by that which isn&#x27;t really there, this is and excellent product. To each his own but if I smell lavender I better be near a lavender plant. Following this logic I have eliminated all &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; perfumes and fragrances. This is a good step in the right direction. I&#x27;ll be using this for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> I have developed a skin sensitivity and this shampoo has relieved me of the problem.  I will continue to order this product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, wish it came in non-plastic container.</li>
            <li> The liquid is very sticky and plugs up the outlet.</li>
            <li> My daughter has severe skin allergy. Her skin is much better since we started using the Free and Clear Shampoo and Conditioner. The only draw back is they are so much more expensive than the regular shampoo and conditioners.</li>
            <li> What a great shampoo. Heard about it from my sister in AZ.&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t find locally. Headed to Amazon and there it was.&lt;br /&gt;Me and my wife both like it.</li>
            <li> After a week or usage, my itchiness on the scalp stopped. I was happy, however, it does over dry the hair, my hair never look so fuzzy after washing. It give me a feeling that it damages my hair, although it leaves my scalp clean. I will recommend this product to people who have sensitive skin for it does not irritate your scalp at all.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this shampoo.  His dermatologist recommended it due to dry and sensitive scalp. His hair is thin and blond  and works for him.&lt;br /&gt; I used it, like it but dont love it because after I used it  my hair was shiny but my scalp was itchy.</li>
            <li> After using this product a couple of times, I must say this is the first time in 6 months that my scalp &amp; forehead hasn&#x27;t itched and caused a rash.  I have also used Free and Clear hair spray and seem to be pleased with it as well. Allergies are so frustrating, since it is so difficult to pinpoint the etiology of the  allergy and rash.</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo that helps with my allergies &amp; buying through Amazon is always a bonus. Price is lower then I have found at various pharmacies.</li>
            <li> I have used this for about five years and have reviewed in the past. Dr. recommended. I have given away bottles to friends and they all like it, Best price you can find is on Amazon. You do have to buy three but if you have a family it is great for any age group,no perfume,no oil,will not irritate your face,rinses clean.</li>
            <li> Nothing to comment. As expected.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good product and it was fast and easy to place the order and get the product.</li>
            <li> This is a fine product that  is aptly named &#x27;Free and Clear&#x27; and does what one expects from a shampoo.  It is fragrance and perfume free and therefore and excellent solution for those allergic to these ingredients.</li>
            <li> Only shampoo I can use with my allergies.  Great product!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I had dry patches on my face and scalp and the dermatologist could not confirm the exact allergen. I switched to this shampoo, conditioner and face wash and I saw immediate improvement.  I have been using all for years and now take small containers of the products with me when I travel.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this shampoo because I am allergic to many fragrances.  It does a good job of getting my hair clean and keeps my scalp from itching.  Itâ€™s very thick, so I dilute it with waterâ€”it lathers better and it goes further.</li>
            <li> I use Free and Clear shampoo &amp; conditioner all the time &amp; it it&#x27;s milder than baby shampoo. I have psoriasis and these products are recommended by my Dermatologist, as well as the hair spray, soap, lotions, creams and sun lotion.&lt;br /&gt;I was pleased that my order arrived within the scheduled time period.</li>
            <li> I am allergic and sensitive to most shampoo&#x27;s on the market and this one does not break me out.  Can cause your hair to dry out somewhat but otherwise a great shampoo.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Great shampoo!  I&#x27;m trying to lessen chemical exposures and this is a great option for avoiding the known carcinogens in most commercial shampoos.</li>
            <li> When my wife and I started having excessive itching after shampooing, a pharmacist recommended this shampoo.  It worked, and has continued to do so for over a decade.  Excellent product!</li>
            <li> Great for those with fragrance sensitivities.  It&#x27;s gentle and thorough.</li>
            <li> Having a multitude of sensitivities and allergies to animals and various products I am always searching for items that are compatible with my body.  The formula of the shampoo I was originally using was changed and it began to make my head itch.  A year ago I found Free and Clear on Amazon, tried it and have been using it since that time.  It does lather nicely, it does not dry my hair or scalp and my hair is soft and shiny.  I would recommed this product to anyone, even if you have no allergy concerns.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years every day.  My scalp doesn&#x27;t itch and my hair is in really good shape.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Leaves hair feeling clean and no residue left behind. helps to repair damage made by coloring and hair is healthier.</li>
            <li> My daughter has severe eczema. we have been using this since she was a baby and it seems to keep the eczema at bay for the most part.</li>
            <li> This is a good quality shampoo with no scents or odors.  It does what it says it&#x27;s going to do at a reasonable price and without the risk of skin or other allergy sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo..Has made a big difference in my scalp &amp; hair..</li>
            <li> In the last year I&#x27;ve discovered a fragrance sensitivity. I completely switched my hair products to Free &amp; Clear and love them. I think if my fragrance sensitivity went away I wouldn&#x27;t switch back! Dries hair a little but when used with conditioner it is awesome!</li>
            <li> I am allergic to most shampoos.  This one works.</li>
            <li> Truly fragrance free for those with allergies; and does a great job of getting your hair clean without being overly harsh on it</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this and, despite that it&#x27;s quite expensive a little bit goes a long, LONG way. Great shampoo and now I won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It does not stip my hair.  Amazingly shiny.  Just remember it&#x27;s not supposed to lather.  I have been using this product for at least 3 years now.  I have severe chemical sensitivities and no issues with this product.  I will never switch products again.</li>
            <li> I am happy that I am not getting sores on my scalp any longer. No scent and leaves my hair clean.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for years. I am unable to use any hair product that is scented or has a lot of ingredients. This shampoo works very well.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and am completely satisfied with it.  I have asthma and the perfumes from other shampoos cause me to have asthma attacks.  I have never had a problem or issue with this product. My only concern is fear it will someday be off the market. This is am excellent product and I am a very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> The only product that does not have cocamidopropylbetaine in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had eczema for years and have also had problems with contact dermatitis. I would often have flares around my eyes that caused a lot of embarrassment for me but those have almost totally cleared up since I started using Free and Clear Shampoo.</li>
