            <li>I love this product because it is one that lasts!</li>
            <li>so it doesnt bother me and in the morning i put on some nice smelling lotion and perfume.</li>
            <li>I just apply lotion to my feet, knees, ankles and elbows, and I rub it in really well into my legs before I hit my feet and knees and it blends perfectly.</li>
            <li>even had complements, nice change from &amp;#34;are</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best tanning lotion out there</li>
            <li>However after using it for quite some time I&#x27;ve kinda perfected my own way of putting it on.&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li>Excellent to get a fast tan</li>
            <li>you a nice glow.</li>
            <li>but sun is not my friend, so this is the best i can do for this old bod, and it works well .</li>
            <li>This is by far the best self-tan (sunless) stuff I&#x27;ve used!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot better than the sprays which seem to rub off very easy.</li>
            <li>and i absolutlely love it.</li>
            <li>Its also very affordable and does a great job, ive had my bottle for over 2 years now and am planning on buying another one soon,</li>
            <li>Im assuming this product also works better on some people than others</li>
            <li>product will give you anything but a healthy glow...</li>
            <li>and please stock more.</li>
            <li>you eating too many carrots again&amp;#34;?</li>
            <li>This is such an excellent product !&lt;</li>
            <li>would recommend it to all whom want to look &amp;#34; healthy.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff been using it since it has been on the market.</li>
            <li>I have used Many Self Tanners over the years.  </li>
            <li>I love this and can&#x27;t understand why they stopped making it.</li>
            <li>I love the tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>Completely satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I had been using the regular fair to medium for a week, it worked great.</li>
            <li>They are making more write more words here</li>
            <li>color is ok, not that</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>so was glad I found it online.</li>
            <li>But other than that it works wonderful and gives me that amazing tan.</li>
            <li>This is the first product I have found that gives good results.</li>
            <li>If you put it on then spray ur body with neutragena tanning spray then use a fan or blow dryer to dry it, u will have a beautiful tan in one day!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it three times so far, and I think it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>, that also did a great job of covering various imperfections that are more visible on translucent skin like mine.</li>
            <li>Because i tan easily</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and provides even all-over results.  </li>
            <li>I am naturally quite fair, and although I tan easily, I prefer to stay out of the sun, and my legs especially are very fair.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t streak, gives a nice color and works really fast!</li>
            <li>The scent is much more pleasant, although still a bit strong for my taste, than the regular JNG.  </li>
            <li>and if you do it can look like you have a nice real tan going on but sometimes sort of look orange</li>
            <li>Best tanning lotion, but hard to find.</li>
            <li>On my second application, I found a good solution is to exfoliate around the edges to blend the tan lines.</li>
            <li>Very awsome, to look healthy :</li>
            <li>Boat Summer Color self-tanning mist--color is good but only lasts for a day or two&lt;br /&gt;-Body</li>
            <li>I prefer this one more for when your an indoor person who wants to keep their glowing color.</li>
            <li>( i dont use every day, only now and then when i want a nice tan or have an important date)</li>
            <li>This lotion would probably be okay for touching up an individual area of your body that is already tan.</li>
            <li>But I can not purchase it any more because of the high price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is a great quick way to add a little bit of color to your skin.</li>
            <li>works very well and quick!</li>
            <li>The scent is not too bad--it is much lighter than the daily scent, the color is unbelievably beautiful and realistic</li>
            <li>Worth it.</li>
            <li>I only need to use this twice a week to maintain a nice color.</li>
            <li>It has a great smell, and it looks natural, especially on my face.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>I normally love Jergens natural glow products.</li>
            <li>It is not an effective overall self tanner however.</li>
            <li>The stuff was coming right off 18</li>
            <li>I liked the color it made my skin, but the whole less is more concept applies here.</li>
            <li>Love this product since it works quickly and actually is noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I am fair skinned and use this for my legs ,doesn&#x27;t make it look too dark or orange.</li>
            <li>Love this product but be careful to smooth in evenly and WASH your hands after applying.</li>
            <li>It really gave good tanning, and dried quickly</li>
            <li>Love the product, have been using it daily for years.  </li>
            <li>Foam first, then lotion.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like looking tan on my legs and my feet white. :)</li>
            <li>Plus, you get an instant tint, so if you are going out you have a bit of color that you know will just get better as the day goes on.  </li>
            <li>Quick and last a long time looks good</li>
            <li>You will be much darker by morning, shower and enjoy your new tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Compares very favorably with higher priced products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not orange, I am a nice tan color, but it&#x27;s only enough tan to keep from blinding people with your pasty tan, it&#x27;s not this deep sexy tan.</li>
            <li>the color is natural and develops quickly.</li>
            <li>I have white skin and tan easily except my legs.</li>
            <li>This product goes on easily, dries fairly quickly, and stays on longer than any other tanning agent that I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>It has a very low odor and what you can smell is pleasant, unlike other self-tanners.</li>
            <li>This gave me a great amount of color after one application and it didn&#x27;t take as much to cover the same areas, so this will actually save me money over the regular JNG!  </li>
            <li>It was easy to apply, but you need to take a bit more care to get it even than the regular JNG, which I would expect with a more dramatic effect product.  </li>
            <li>Rub the product in very well to avoid streaking.    </li>
            <li>so it works really well for me.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t have much else to say.</li>
            <li>this stuff can really turn you orangeish color</li>
            <li>Which keeps from drying my skin so much</li>
            <li>This product works very well.  </li>
            <li>I applied it the night before I needed it, and then once again in the morning, but the second application wasn&#x27;t really necessary for me to be perfectly honest.</li>
            <li>This product is becoming very hard to find, but I love it.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m glad I tried it after reading other reviews.  </li>
            <li>I had actually never applied a self-tanning moisturizer before, but this was extremely straightforward.</li>
            <li>smells better than any other one I have tried.</li>
            <li>daily Natural Glow--the kind you have to apply daily</li>
            <li>Great product - have used it before but sometimes hard to find locally.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It can be a little overwhelming if you don&#x27;t know how to get it on your body.  </li>
            <li>Allow to dry which is quick</li>
            <li>The tan is very natural looking</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to buy this as the cost is about twice as much per ounce as they regular formula of Jergens Natural Glow (JNG).  </li>
            <li>Not with Jergens Natural Glow Express Body.  </li>
            <li>Buy this product AND Jergens Natural Glow FOAMING moisturizer for medium to tan skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gives me a natural color tan on my legs after one application.  </li>
            <li>I thought this product was not harsh or orangish.</li>
            <li>which product I choose or it will not look natural.  </li>
            <li>I only use it on my legs arms and chest, and there is no line where I stop using it around my legs or back, it blends very well.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this new lotion and thought the express factor of that would mean it is faster to apply.</li>
            <li>(many people have asked me if I just got back from vacation) and the ease of application is good--the lotion is very thick and creamy so a little goes a long way, and it feels very smooth and silky when applied.</li>
            <li>The product is white and becomes clear when rubbed into the skin.</li>
            <li>guess I will have to live with extra white legs.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I really like the color and not having to worry about uneven application causing unsightly areas, but found that I had to use it very frequently to keep color</li>
            <li>drench Quicktan--awesome and very deep natural tan color, but starts flaking off the next day, and if you start sweating it can run off your skin</li>
            <li>deep though, smells kind of weird, leaves you looking shimmery</li>
            <li>But it dosent make you dark as fast for some reason like this one dose.</li>
            <li>I have used this for a few years and it works very well!</li>
            <li>But in a pinch, if you&#x27;re very careful, this express tanner coupled with a decent exfoliator (I use [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>It looks natural and it will come off some when you shower and dry off.</li>
            <li>It works more quickly than any other I&#x27;ve tried and doesn&#x27;t smell bad.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> This gave me a great amount of color after one application and it didn&#x27;t take as much to cover the same areas, so this will actually save me money over the regular JNG!  </li>
            <li> It was easy to apply, but you need to take a bit more care to get it even than the regular JNG, which I would expect with a more dramatic effect product.  </li>
            <li> Rub the product in very well to avoid streaking.    </li>
            <li> so it works really well for me.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t have much else to say.</li>
            <li> this stuff can really turn you orangeish color</li>
            <li> Which keeps from drying my skin so much</li>
            <li> This product works very well.  </li>
            <li> I applied it the night before I needed it, and then once again in the morning, but the second application wasn&#x27;t really necessary for me to be perfectly honest.</li>
            <li> This product is becoming very hard to find, but I love it.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m glad I tried it after reading other reviews.  </li>
            <li> I had actually never applied a self-tanning moisturizer before, but this was extremely straightforward.</li>
            <li> smells better than any other one I have tried.</li>
            <li> daily Natural Glow--the kind you have to apply daily</li>
            <li> Great product - have used it before but sometimes hard to find locally.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It can be a little overwhelming if you don&#x27;t know how to get it on your body.  </li>
            <li> Allow to dry which is quick</li>
            <li> The tan is very natural looking</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this as the cost is about twice as much per ounce as they regular formula of Jergens Natural Glow (JNG).  </li>
            <li> Not with Jergens Natural Glow Express Body.  </li>
            <li> Buy this product AND Jergens Natural Glow FOAMING moisturizer for medium to tan skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gives me a natural color tan on my legs after one application.  </li>
            <li> I thought this product was not harsh or orangish.</li>
            <li> which product I choose or it will not look natural.  </li>
            <li> I only use it on my legs arms and chest, and there is no line where I stop using it around my legs or back, it blends very well.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this new lotion and thought the express factor of that would mean it is faster to apply.</li>
            <li> (many people have asked me if I just got back from vacation) and the ease of application is good--the lotion is very thick and creamy so a little goes a long way, and it feels very smooth and silky when applied.</li>
            <li> The product is white and becomes clear when rubbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> guess I will have to live with extra white legs.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I really like the color and not having to worry about uneven application causing unsightly areas, but found that I had to use it very frequently to keep color</li>
            <li> drench Quicktan--awesome and very deep natural tan color, but starts flaking off the next day, and if you start sweating it can run off your skin</li>
            <li> deep though, smells kind of weird, leaves you looking shimmery</li>
            <li> But it dosent make you dark as fast for some reason like this one dose.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a few years and it works very well!</li>
            <li> But in a pinch, if you&#x27;re very careful, this express tanner coupled with a decent exfoliator (I use [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> It looks natural and it will come off some when you shower and dry off.</li>
            <li> It works more quickly than any other I&#x27;ve tried and doesn&#x27;t smell bad.  </li>
            <li> one of the few products on the market, (god knows ive spent a small fortune trying the most costly and the cheapest,)</li>
            <li> The only downside is the color is bit more orangy than the regular JNG, but not as bad as the old self-tanning lotions.  </li>
            <li> It takes about ten minutes to dry though, which is probably the only downside in my opinion.</li>
            <li> it goes on even and gives a natural looking dark tan in just one day</li>
            <li> Too bad it is getting more and more difficult to find.</li>
            <li> This naych must have been sitting somewhere a long time.</li>
            <li> even as pale as I am I can use the &amp;#34;deep&amp;#34; color and look natural.  </li>
            <li> I applied the product at night and let it dry for 2 hours before bed  </li>
            <li> I purchased this in a store for a dress \\&quot;emergency\\&quot; as this was the only product that looked like it would do the trick instantly, and the lighter shade was not available.</li>
            <li> and so I am a white girl with dark hair and eyes.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-Neutrogena spray tan--smells terrible, but the color is decent, can look kind of orangey though&lt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of other brands and they take a long time to work.</li>
            <li> Its my go to tanning product and works way better then months at a tanning salon (which is really bad for you).</li>
            <li> Next time I will probably opt for one of slower acting Jergens tanning products, or at least one that is made for my skin tone, even if it takes longer.</li>
            <li> this is a winner, although i realize different folks have  different skin types,,, so, im part nordic and northern European ,  thin skin</li>
            <li> Now it has left my skin white with a lot of very small orange spots.</li>
            <li> This might not be a problem for people who are frequent self- tanners but no amount of &amp;#34;mid- winter color&amp;#34; is worth me stinking for days on end :(</li>
            <li> I am very pale and very blonde, so I have to be careful</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a drag they don&#x27;t sell it in the stores!</li>
            <li> No streaking which is a problem I have always had with other Self Tanners.  </li>
            <li> I use it every other day &amp; trust me if it turned me orange</li>
            <li> And I have not gotten the other two bottles I paid for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Never had that happen before with other self tanners</li>
            <li> Let dry a little and dress for bed.  </li>
            <li> With other self tanners when I shower I see the brown going down the drain.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not a particularly stinky person, but for some reason these things stink super bad when your body mixes with them.</li>
            <li> Also, it does not go down the drain when I take a shower.  </li>
            <li> Please send me the other two bottles I paid for!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and am very mad Jergens has taken it off the market.  </li>
            <li> I have previously used this product with ease.</li>
            <li> I use the tanning bed then put this self tan on for a beatiful tan in much less time in the tanning bed.</li>
            <li> That is not true in my case.  </li>
            <li> I got this product because I wanted my legs to look a little tan for a wedding I was in.</li>
            <li> I have a little Indian in me</li>
            <li> It is very hard to apply this to your entire body.</li>
            <li> you repeat in two days, you will be VERY dark.  </li>
            <li> A few of them I have tried smell like hair perm treatments.</li>
            <li> I have read a few reviews where they say they have some orange.  </li>
            <li> Here are a few of my tips.  </li>
            <li> My experience with this is that I do like the heavy lotion feel, but it takes 3  applications before I look &amp;#34;tan.&amp;#34;  Also there is a hint of orange to the tone on me.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like it stay pale.</li>
            <li> The one negative is the smell, but its a lot nicer of a smell when compared to other tanners.</li>
            <li> , color never truly deepens and the smell is pretty bad</li>
            <li> However, My bra and capris ( white ) are stained so badly that I can&#x27;t get them white</li>
            <li> I paid $20 for this small bottle and it did nothing for my skin, but break it out.</li>
            <li> Unable to find it locally</li>
            <li> The product works so to rate it bad because it might not be that great for your health when you going after a fake tan is silly!</li>
            <li> sunless tanner is extremely hard to find in stores now for some reason--maybe it is being discontinued?</li>
            <li> Of course it stinks like all self tanners, and when mixed with your body odor it smells HORRENDOUS.</li>
            <li> Others where an icky orange color and made my skin itch.</li>
            <li> it is a thick cream.  </li>
            <li> This lotion is extremely thick and paste like.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not a good as the express lotion.</li>
            <li> It was also very difficult to get it \\&quot;right\\&quot; around my toes and the soles of my feet--if you stop before the soles, you get a pretty ugly tan line.</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t smell bad like some of the other ones.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So sad about that.</li>
            <li> My question is, why was it so expensive?  </li>
            <li> It was a bit expensive but it will get me through the summer.  </li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Stinks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed!</li>
            <li> Literally, smells terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this as the cost is about twice as much per ounce as they regular formula of Jergens Natural Glow (JNG).  But I&#x27;m glad I tried it after reading other reviews.  The scent is much more pleasant, although still a bit strong for my taste, than the regular JNG.  I&#x27;ve been using regular JNG during spring and summertime for years.  I really like the color and not having to worry about uneven application causing unsightly areas, but found that I had to use it very frequently to keep color and I&#x27;m not fond of the odor.  This gave me a great amount of color after one application and it didn&#x27;t take as much to cover the same areas, so this will actually save me money over the regular JNG!  It was easy to apply, but you need to take a bit more care to get it even than the regular JNG, which I would expect with a more dramatic effect product.  The only downside is the color is bit more orangy than the regular JNG, but not as bad as the old self-tanning lotions.  Worth it.</li>
            <li> I am naturally quite fair, and although I tan easily, I prefer to stay out of the sun, and my legs especially are very fair. I purchased this in a store for a dress \\&quot;emergency\\&quot; as this was the only product that looked like it would do the trick instantly, and the lighter shade was not available. I had actually never applied a self-tanning moisturizer before, but this was extremely straightforward. The product is white and becomes clear when rubbed into the skin. I applied it the night before I needed it, and then once again in the morning, but the second application wasn&#x27;t really necessary for me to be perfectly honest. This gave me a very nice brown (not orange!) glow, that also did a great job of covering various imperfections that are more visible on translucent skin like mine. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the effect it had on areas that \\&quot;crease\\&quot; such as the skin on the front and back of my knees and Achilles tendon. It was also very difficult to get it \\&quot;right\\&quot; around my toes and the soles of my feet--if you stop before the soles, you get a pretty ugly tan line. On my second application, I found a good solution is to exfoliate around the edges to blend the tan lines. Rub the product in very well to avoid streaking.    Next time I will probably opt for one of slower acting Jergens tanning products, or at least one that is made for my skin tone, even if it takes longer. But in a pinch, if you&#x27;re very careful, this express tanner coupled with a decent exfoliator (I use [[ASIN:B000T5UL5K Sally Hansen Airbrush Sun Pre-Tan Exfoliator-6 oz.]]) is the way to go.</li>
            <li> I use it on my legs, arms, and once in awhile on my face.  It works more quickly than any other I&#x27;ve tried and doesn&#x27;t smell bad.  I&#x27;ve tried lots of other brands and they take a long time to work.</li>
            <li> Jergens - Please bring this back to stores!</li>
            <li> This product does wonders for my tan. For me it works perfectly and gives me a really nice tan when i want one, i use it at night and after three nights you will deffintly see a difference. Its my go to tanning product and works way better then months at a tanning salon (which is really bad for you). The tan is very natural looking and i absolutlely love it. Its also very affordable and does a great job, ive had my bottle for over 2 years now and am planning on buying another one soon, ( i dont use every day, only now and then when i want a nice tan or have an important date) but when i do use it, it works wonders. Im assuming this product also works better on some people than others, i guess its just your skin type. Because i tan easily so it works really well for me. The one negative is the smell, but its a lot nicer of a smell when compared to other tanners. But i put it on at night so it doesnt bother me and in the morning i put on some nice smelling lotion and perfume. But other than that it works wonderful and gives me that amazing tan.</li>
            <li> works witout xtra grease on you, gradual effect that I dont seem to get all over my clothes.  Allow to dry which is quick and you are set</li>
            <li> I got this product because I wanted my legs to look a little tan for a wedding I was in. When I got home I put it on my legs. Then I read the label! It has BHT in it! Which could potentially cause cancer.&lt;br /&gt;I guess I will have to live with extra white legs.&lt;br /&gt;This product will give you anything but a healthy glow... I&#x27;m so disappointed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m white and tan well, but am not tan now but chose to get the darker formula. I&#x27;ve used it three times so far, and I think it&#x27;s great. I&#x27;m not orange, I am a nice tan color, but it&#x27;s only enough tan to keep from blinding people with your pasty tan, it&#x27;s not this deep sexy tan. I only use it on my legs arms and chest, and there is no line where I stop using it around my legs or back, it blends very well. Of course it stinks like all self tanners, and when mixed with your body odor it smells HORRENDOUS. I can&#x27;t keep it on longer than 12 hours, I don&#x27;t sweat a lot and I&#x27;m not a particularly stinky person, but for some reason these things stink super bad when your body mixes with them. I just apply lotion to my feet, knees, ankles and elbows, and I rub it in really well into my legs before I hit my feet and knees and it blends perfectly.</li>
            <li> Cant find this stuff in the stores anywhere. I need to buy more to get me well into the summer for the spots the sun don&#x27;t get to LOL. I look tan all winter too. Thanks. and please stock more.</li>
            <li> I use this over the more expensive ones. the color is natural and develops quickly. smells better than any other one I have tried.</li>
            <li> It works really great you can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore they have something else it&#x27;s the same brand and for face. But it dosent make you dark as fast for some reason like this one dose. I&#x27;m so glad I found it here!!</li>
            <li> Love this product since it works quickly and actually is noticeable.  Too bad it is getting more and more difficult to find.</li>
            <li> one of the few products on the market, (god knows ive spent a small fortune trying the most costly and the cheapest,) this is a winner, although i realize different folks have  different skin types,,, so, im part nordic and northern European ,  thin skin but sun is not my friend, so this is the best i can do for this old bod, and it works well . even had complements, nice change from &amp;#34;are you eating too many carrots again&amp;#34;?</li>
            <li> This is such an excellent product !&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to all whom want to look &amp;#34; healthy. &amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great seller and product.  Very awsome, to look healthy :</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion works great. I tan and I use this as well. It looks natural and it will come off some when you shower and dry off. But with every one on the market they will come off a bit. I have tried them all and this is the very best and a nice price. And it doesn&#x27;t smell bad like some of the other ones. A few of them I have tried smell like hair perm treatments.</li>
            <li> This is the first product I have found that gives good results. Others where an icky orange color and made my skin itch. I only need to use this twice a week to maintain a nice color.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best self-tan (sunless) stuff I&#x27;ve used!  It doesn&#x27;t streak; the tan lasts several days and works overnight!</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best tanning lotion out there and it&#x27;s a drag they don&#x27;t sell it in the stores! If you put it on then spray ur body with neutragena tanning spray then use a fan or blow dryer to dry it, u will have a beautiful tan in one day!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff been using it since it has been on the market.</li>
            <li> I have used Many Self Tanners over the years.  This one I have to say is the best.  No streaking which is a problem I have always had with other Self Tanners.  Also, it does not go down the drain when I take a shower.  With other self tanners when I shower I see the brown going down the drain. Not with Jergens Natural Glow Express Body.  I will keep purchasing this item.  Plus No orange.  I have read a few reviews where they say they have some orange.  That is not true in my case.  I use it every other day &amp; trust me if it turned me orange I would tell you.  If you want a great self tanner this is it.</li>
            <li> This is a product that they no longer make and it works great it goes on even and gives a natural looking dark tan in just one day I love this and can&#x27;t understand why they stopped making it.</li>
            <li> i love this product! it&#x27;s a shame Jergens has discontinued it. It has been replaced with another 3 day lotion but it&#x27;s not a good as the express lotion.</li>
            <li> Use this product daily, for my skin not a sun person. At a good price. But I can not purchase it any more because of the high price.&lt;br /&gt;So sad about that.</li>
            <li> Love the product, have been using it daily for years.  My question is, why was it so expensive?  Never payed that rediculous price in the store!</li>
            <li> I ordered and paid for four bottles. I only received two bottles. I left feedback stating this, but no one has responded. And I have not gotten the other two bottles I paid for.&lt;br /&gt;It has been weeks. Please send me the other two bottles I paid for!</li>
            <li> I have used this for a few years and it works very well! Cancer??? Anytime you use a product that gives you fake beauty , you can&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to be free of any risk! The product works so to rate it bad because it might not be that great for your health when you going after a fake tan is silly! 5 Stars.. Don&#x27;t like it stay pale.</li>
            <li> I have previously used this product with ease. This naych must have been sitting somewhere a long time. It was like water. Did not w p rk at all snd i would not purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and am very mad Jergens has taken it off the market.  It really gave good tanning, and dried quickly</li>
            <li> I love the tanning lotion. It has a great smell, and it looks natural, especially on my face. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> works very well and quick!</li>
            <li> Great product - have used it before but sometimes hard to find locally. Easy to apply and provides even all-over results.  Completely satisfied.  Compares very favorably with higher priced products.</li>
            <li> I had been using the regular fair to medium for a week, it worked great. Then I wanted to try this, so I put it on yesterday afternoon. This morning I went running and noticed orange/brown colored sweat. The stuff was coming right off 18+ hours after applying it! Now it has left my skin white with a lot of very small orange spots. Hopefully lemon juice will get this out. Do not buy this product if there is any chance that you&#x27;ll sweat in the next 24 hours.</li>
            <li> This product goes on easily, dries fairly quickly, and stays on longer than any other tanning agent that I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> Just the product i wanted.  They are making more write more words here but I don&#x27;t have much else to say.</li>
            <li> I have tried the following:&lt;br /&gt;-Jergens daily Natural Glow--the kind you have to apply daily, color never truly deepens and the smell is pretty bad&lt;br /&gt;-Neutrogena spray tan--smells terrible, but the color is decent, can look kind of orangey though&lt;br /&gt;-Loreal Sublime glow--color is ok, not that deep though, smells kind of weird, leaves you looking shimmery which I do not like&lt;br /&gt;-Banana Boat Summer Color self-tanning mist--color is good but only lasts for a day or two&lt;br /&gt;-Body drench Quicktan--awesome and very deep natural tan color, but starts flaking off the next day, and if you start sweating it can run off your skin (no lasting power)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sunless tanner is extremely hard to find in stores now for some reason--maybe it is being discontinued? It is no longer in my local Target or Walmart which is why I am purchasing online. The scent is not too bad--it is much lighter than the daily scent, the color is unbelievably beautiful and realistic (many people have asked me if I just got back from vacation) and the ease of application is good--the lotion is very thick and creamy so a little goes a long way, and it feels very smooth and silky when applied. It takes about ten minutes to dry though, which is probably the only downside in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It is a very good self tanner.  However after using it for quite some time I&#x27;ve kinda perfected my own way of putting it on.&lt;br /&gt;Yes it is a thick cream.  It can be a little overwhelming if you don&#x27;t know how to get it on your body.  Here are a few of my tips.  It may work for you too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Buy this product AND Jergens Natural Glow FOAMING moisturizer for medium to tan skin.&lt;br /&gt;2. Exfoliate in bath before bed.  Shave also.&lt;br /&gt;3. Put a generous amount of both in your hands.  Foam first, then lotion.  Rub together with hands until combined.&lt;br /&gt;4.  Start with legs and work up.  I do my feet, in-between my toes, knees, everywhere. I don&#x27;t like looking tan on my legs and my feet white. :)&lt;br /&gt;5.  Repeat process with second amount in hands for arms, neck and face.  Go all the way into your hairline.&lt;br /&gt;6. Let dry a little and dress for bed.  I have yet to ever have it come off on my sheets, but I don&#x27;t have white sheets either.  Use at your discretion.&lt;br /&gt;7.  You will be much darker by morning, shower and enjoy your new tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you repeat in two days, you will be VERY dark.  I love this product because it is one that lasts!</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion is there best stuff around. Problem is they don&#x27;t make it anymore and those who sell it charge a premium.</li>
            <li> this stuff can really turn you orangeish color and you have to keep using it and if you do it can look like you have a nice real tan going on but sometimes sort of look orange</li>
            <li> Stinks! Literally, smells terrible. This might not be a problem for people who are frequent self- tanners but no amount of &amp;#34;mid- winter color&amp;#34; is worth me stinking for days on end :(</li>
            <li> I paid $20 for this small bottle and it did nothing for my skin, but break it out. This was overpriced and it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> The best self tan on the market. I use the tanning bed then put this self tan on for a beatiful tan in much less time in the tanning bed. Which keeps from drying my skin so much</li>
            <li> It gives me a natural color tan on my legs after one application.  The color lasts for several days before you need to reapply.</li>
            <li> My local store stopped carrying this and I was thankful to find it on Amazon. This product is a great quick way to add a little bit of color to your skin. It has a very low odor and what you can smell is pleasant, unlike other self-tanners. I stay stocked with this item.</li>
            <li> I have white skin and tan easily except my legs. I have a little Indian in me and so I am a white girl with dark hair and eyes. I thought this product was not harsh or orangish. I liked the color it made my skin, but the whole less is more concept applies here. Do Not smother your legs or you will look like a Dorito.</li>
            <li> Excellent to get a fast tan</li>
            <li> They no longer sell this in the store so I was happy to find it.  It was a bit expensive but it will get me through the summer.  It&#x27;s a lot better than the sprays which seem to rub off very easy.</li>
            <li> Best tanning lotion, but hard to find.</li>
            <li> I love the way this product tans me, but unfortunately Jergens has chosen to discontinue it. Please bring it back,</li>
            <li> This stuff works great. Worth the money. I am fair skinned and use this for my legs ,doesn&#x27;t make it look too dark or orange. I get compliments all the time.</li>
            <li> Quick and last a long time looks good</li>
            <li> This product works very well.  You can see the difference after two applications.  Only have to use it about twice per week.  Unable to find it locally so was glad I found it online.</li>
            <li> I kept my tan off of this for almost a couple of weeks when I ran out. I prefer this one more for when your an indoor person who wants to keep their glowing color.</li>
            <li> Love this product but be careful to smooth in evenly and WASH your hands after applying. It definitely works and&lt;br /&gt;gives you a nice glow.</li>
            <li> great product have seen the changes of my skin tone, i would recommend this product, however you must be consistant in the usage to see results</li>
            <li> I applied the product at night and let it dry for 2 hours before bed  I dressed in the morning and thought I looked tan  However, My bra and capris ( white ) are stained so badly that I can&#x27;t get them white no matter which product I use&lt;br /&gt;Never had that happen before with other self tanners</li>
            <li> I normally love Jergens natural glow products. I was excited to try this new lotion and thought the express factor of that would mean it is faster to apply. I was wrong. This lotion is extremely thick and paste like. It is very hard to apply this to your entire body. This lotion would probably be okay for touching up an individual area of your body that is already tan. It is not an effective overall self tanner however.</li>
            <li> I am very pale and very blonde, so I have to be careful which product I choose or it will not look natural.  My experience with this is that I do like the heavy lotion feel, but it takes 3  applications before I look &amp;#34;tan.&amp;#34;  Also there is a hint of orange to the tone on me.  My number 1 recommendation is L&#x27;Oreal Sublime Bronze tinted self-tanning lotion.  Zero orange, all brown, and even as pale as I am I can use the &amp;#34;deep&amp;#34; color and look natural.  Plus, you get an instant tint, so if you are going out you have a bit of color that you know will just get better as the day goes on.  Again, this is from a woman who is almost &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; skin color-wise, lol.  Good luck!</li>
            <li> This product is becoming very hard to find, but I love it. It doesn&#x27;t streak, gives a nice color and works really fast!</li>
