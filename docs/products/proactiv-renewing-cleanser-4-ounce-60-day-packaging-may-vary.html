            <li>/&gt;Proactiv is good stuff.</li>

            <li>good</li>
            <li>They are very healthy and beneficial for my skin.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love proactiv!</li>
            <li>If you have been suffering from acne for years, Accutane is faster, more effective, and cheaper!</li>
            <li>Love proactiv!</li>
            <li>This product has been amazing.</li>
            <li>It apparently is so potent that any residual amount on your hands or face, when coming in contact with carpet, turns the carpet bright orange and its permanent.  </li>
            <li>Proaciv is a highly effective acne treatment brand but, here&#x27;s the catch</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s nice to not have her beauty clouded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And he&#x27;s kind.</li>
            <li>fast shipping, best prices</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t completely remove acne, but I&#x27;ve tried a lot of acne treatments and this probably the best one I have tried.</li>
            <li>I have always found the cleanser to be super effective!</li>
            <li>Quick delivery of goods!!</li>
            <li>Great product and price, thankful to be able to order this without having to commit to auto delivery every 3 months, thanks!</li>
            <li>Accutane is a strong drug and a pain to manage in terms of appointments and monthly blood work, but the results are simply astounding.</li>
            <li>Since it was formulated to work as a set, it is better to use it that way in the end.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if this stuff was going to work since I found out about it through infomircials</li>
            <li>but this one works better.</li>
            <li>and if she needs more of this great product Thanks</li>
            <li>and my skin was completely free of acne and had an amazing glow,</li>
            <li>this product, like many others, may or may not work for you, but you just gotta try it because you never know</li>
            <li>Hopefully you find this helpful. :)</li>
            <li>It works wonderfully but be sure to use the proper regimens, if you stop using it...I tend to break out even more.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and GREAT price:):)</li>
            <li>this works ok</li>
            <li>I love proactiv cleansers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used proactiv for years and love it.</li>
            <li>She is acne free!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with proactive, since I started using it</li>
            <li>I love how yet his works</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Love this, use it every time I wash my hair (2-3 days).</li>
            <li>Love love love this face wash.</li>
            <li>However, my teenage daughter has had excellent luck with this product.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Within 2 weeks my skin was showing a significant improvement!</li>
            <li>sure the beads aren&#x27;t felt as strongly,</li>
            <li>Top gets clogged n won&#x27;t easily unclog.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say it makes my face perfect, but it makes it much much better than it would be with any other product.</li>
            <li>The original is great, I don&#x27;t like the new stuff!</li>
            <li>Can be strong and cause swelling or puffiness of eyes with irritation of the skin</li>
            <li>I have noticed a huge difference on the way my face looks</li>
            <li>I wish this product would have been available when I was growing up</li>
            <li>but Proactive has kept it free of blemishes and blackheads.</li>
            <li>The combination of Benzol Peroxide and just enough moisturizers is great for my oily skin, without drying it out.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy to finally find something that works.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone and the seller was fantastic also.  </li>
            <li>i have been a proactiv user for a few years now and find that the renewing cleanser works best for me.  </li>
            <li>Anyone with acne who has given it a fair shot will most likely agree.</li>
            <li>I like the smell and it makes my face feel really smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li>I began using this product consistently after seeing many ads on tv and deciding to give it a shot.</li>
            <li>When I ordered this product I thought I was getting the ORIGINAL renewing cleaser</li>
            <li>It is not the original Proactiv</li>
            <li>likes it because it keeps her face clean and blemish</li>
            <li>my face is finally clean, I don&#x27;t think I would use anything else ever again.</li>
            <li>So far my Grand-Daughter is very pleased with this product,the price was more then fair,quick shipping,and so far great results;i&#x27;am sur i will be back once</li>
            <li>Fortunately I was able to find something pretty close in a CVS called ACNE FREE, which carries a fairly LARGE size of the Cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I have mild to moderate acne with oily skin that tends to break out and scar very easily and this product worked wonders for me!</li>
            <li>So, folks looking for a quick solution to their problem (i.e. - clearing up your skin in time for prom or a wedding, for example) will be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wanted the ORIGINAL so next time I think this product should be specified better!</li>
            <li>been using this mild benzoyl peroxide wash without the rest of the &amp;#34;system&amp;#34; for years.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s better than going through the normal channels of proactiv to procure it.</li>
            <li>Great product &amp; super price, but next time going to try new line x-out</li>
            <li>I have since been purchasing it through Amazon which is easy with fast response time.</li>
            <li>It is gentle and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Product is exactly what I ordered!</li>
            <li>The bumps went away after a short period of time and now my skin is amazing...</li>
            <li>My skin looks healthy, refreshed and clear when using this product.</li>
            <li>It took me about 4-6 wks to really see it clear up nicely.</li>
            <li>But worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth trying.</li>
            <li>They also ran out of the supersize, which I think might be worth ordering the cleanser separately.  </li>
            <li>Its not as \\&quot;gritty\\&quot; as the Proactiv Renewing Cleanser, but certainly worth it</li>
            <li>Clear skin is about more than just using the right brands....</li>
            <li>awesome product, plastic seal in original form, only suggestion is to lesson packaging for a small product.</li>
            <li>for those people who say the new formula doesn&#x27;t work...it works just fine for me.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem as good or the same as the product i get directly from Proactiv</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it did very much to help my acne, anyway.</li>
            <li>..if you are a avid proactiv user you know that they changed the formula from the original to the new</li>
            <li>Better than dealing with Proactive when u only want wash for maintenance.  </li>
            <li>I have purhased Proactiv products for years for my granddaughters; they cleared up their skin problems and we avoided medication many years ago and now they use them regularly for \\&quot;maintenance\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say use this product if you can afford to consistently buy it.</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what is says it will do.  </li>
            <li>think she&#x27;s pretty with or without blemishes.</li>
            <li>and I have to say that my skin did react to the product at first, but my skin ended up getting use to the product.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re thinking about trying Proactiv, get the minis first, and see how it goes.</li>
            <li>Personally, my skin has never been better.</li>
            <li>many days I dont need to wear any foundation/makeup, which saves me money overall.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for the first time about 10 years ago at the age of about 55.  </li>
            <li>The first month I was on it</li>
            <li>This product is exactly what its advertised as.  </li>
            <li>Will be using this seller again for future Proactiv Solution needs :)</li>
            <li>But try this first.  </li>
            <li>and we needed more before we got our next shipment.</li>
            <li>Overall we are satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>And i got my order 2 days early!!!!</li>
            <li>great service, good product, I love it, But price little bit expensive!</li>
            <li>I use it every morning in the shower, and it keeps my face clean and clear of breakouts.</li>
            <li>The price is decent and it will be worth it.</li>
            <li>really - you just HAVE to be consistent and give it time.</li>
            <li>The title really says it all.</li>
            <li>but my skin really seems to respond to benzoyl peroxide and not salicylic acid.</li>
            <li>This stuff really keeps the pimples from popping out on my face.</li>
            <li>Proactiv really works to prevent them from coming to the surface.</li>
            <li>This one really keeps away about 90% of the acne</li>
            <li>This is my favrotite cleaner in the whole world.</li>
            <li>Proactiv really works.</li>
            <li>I got this for my son and it seems to work really well.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>so my skin is usually VERY tan )...</li>
            <li>It made my skin smooth and totally got rid of all my acne and scaring!</li>
            <li>so this is very helpful to me</li>
            <li>Very embarrassing, kids did not understand, so there was teasing and looks of horror.and</li>
            <li>Overall I like Proactiv, its a bit pricey, but because it keeps my skin acne free, theres</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t use it for a day or two I can really tell a difference.</li>
            <li>Is very helpful.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and I had no issues.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the whole regimine, just the cleanser twice a day.</li>
            <li>It keeps your skin clear and feeling fresh every time you use it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Proactive.</li>
            <li>That way I don&#x27;t stain my towels or use this product too much.</li>
            <li>I had experienced several hard bumps that hurt the first week or two that I used this product, I Googled to see if I could find some answers, but had no luck...</li>
            <li>Most of the other treatments out there contain Salicytic Acid, which dries out my skin.  </li>
            <li>The Refining mask is NOT really a mask, but a heavy sulfur smelling cream that works great as a overnight blemish remover.  </li>
            <li>This product is highly advertised but did nothing.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend going on Accutane to treat and cure acne.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday and love the results.  </li>
            <li>When we went to use this we noiced that it is thinner than what we normally use.</li>
            <li>(they made the scubbing beads smaller and less effective)</li>
            <li>After the second week is when I saw that it was working I&#x27;ve always had a lot of brake outs on the right side of my face but with this product they have faded away.</li>
            <li>Firstly, it takes a few weeks before you see significant results.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the new version.</li>
            <li>This product destroyed a new $8,000 carpet.  </li>
            <li>The first time I purchased this,  I scrubbed my face like I normally did, then used this and a white facecloth to rinse.  </li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>It has always been very embarrassing to walk around with zits on my face especially as I got older.  </li>
            <li>I use it everyday with results that no other acne product has ever been able to match.</li>
            <li>right when you start to break out 1-2X a day, and you should see your blemish \\&quot;dry</li>
            <li>having clear skin is about understanding skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It cleans deep and well leaving my skin feeling dry and clean for the day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i found the same exact ingredient in a knock off at Dollar General</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and the proactive cleanser does not irritate it.</li>
            <li>I use the whole system daily.  </li>
            <li>This product BLEACHED my skin nearly 4 shades lighter than the rest of my body.</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have suffered with acne since I was 7 years old.</li>
            <li>Im over 40 yrs old and have been using Proactiv  for over 5 yrs now.  </li>
            <li>Accutane is a natural retinoid.</li>
            <li>I am 70 years old and still have a problem with acne.  </li>
            <li>And it works even with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I Bought it long time ago when it just came to market, tried a couple of times and use it as a scrub for my feet - very</li>
            <li>like it states on this description, only to find it was the NEW renewing cleanser</li>
            <li>Harsh on your skin but works like a charm for those who have mild to severe acne.  </li>
            <li>I had heard mixed reviews on Proactiv for clear skin.</li>
            <li>I am 30 years old with moderate acne.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 67 yrs old and have used this product for years due to the fact that my skin has large pores and needs to exfoliate on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li>Although I have tried other products, some even prescription, I always have to use Proactiv when I need clearing up fast.</li>
            <li>I started using proactive with no cracy expectation, I&#x27;ve used so many other products in the past and all they do is dry my face.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> this product, like many others, may or may not work for you, but you just gotta try it because you never know</li>
            <li> Hopefully you find this helpful. :)</li>
            <li> It works wonderfully but be sure to use the proper regimens, if you stop using it...I tend to break out even more.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and GREAT price:):)</li>
            <li> this works ok</li>
            <li> I love proactiv cleansers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used proactiv for years and love it.</li>
            <li> She is acne free!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with proactive, since I started using it</li>
            <li> I love how yet his works</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Love this, use it every time I wash my hair (2-3 days).</li>
            <li> Love love love this face wash.</li>
            <li> However, my teenage daughter has had excellent luck with this product.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> Within 2 weeks my skin was showing a significant improvement!</li>
            <li> sure the beads aren&#x27;t felt as strongly,</li>
            <li> Top gets clogged n won&#x27;t easily unclog.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it makes my face perfect, but it makes it much much better than it would be with any other product.</li>
            <li> The original is great, I don&#x27;t like the new stuff!</li>
            <li> Can be strong and cause swelling or puffiness of eyes with irritation of the skin</li>
            <li> I have noticed a huge difference on the way my face looks</li>
            <li> I wish this product would have been available when I was growing up</li>
            <li> but Proactive has kept it free of blemishes and blackheads.</li>
            <li> The combination of Benzol Peroxide and just enough moisturizers is great for my oily skin, without drying it out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy to finally find something that works.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone and the seller was fantastic also.  </li>
            <li> i have been a proactiv user for a few years now and find that the renewing cleanser works best for me.  </li>
            <li> Anyone with acne who has given it a fair shot will most likely agree.</li>
            <li> I like the smell and it makes my face feel really smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li> I began using this product consistently after seeing many ads on tv and deciding to give it a shot.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this product I thought I was getting the ORIGINAL renewing cleaser</li>
            <li> It is not the original Proactiv</li>
            <li> likes it because it keeps her face clean and blemish</li>
            <li> my face is finally clean, I don&#x27;t think I would use anything else ever again.</li>
            <li> So far my Grand-Daughter is very pleased with this product,the price was more then fair,quick shipping,and so far great results;i&#x27;am sur i will be back once</li>
            <li> Fortunately I was able to find something pretty close in a CVS called ACNE FREE, which carries a fairly LARGE size of the Cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I have mild to moderate acne with oily skin that tends to break out and scar very easily and this product worked wonders for me!</li>
            <li> So, folks looking for a quick solution to their problem (i.e. - clearing up your skin in time for prom or a wedding, for example) will be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wanted the ORIGINAL so next time I think this product should be specified better!</li>
            <li> been using this mild benzoyl peroxide wash without the rest of the &amp;#34;system&amp;#34; for years.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s better than going through the normal channels of proactiv to procure it.</li>
            <li> Great product &amp; super price, but next time going to try new line x-out</li>
            <li> I have since been purchasing it through Amazon which is easy with fast response time.</li>
            <li> It is gentle and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Product is exactly what I ordered!</li>
            <li> The bumps went away after a short period of time and now my skin is amazing...</li>
            <li> My skin looks healthy, refreshed and clear when using this product.</li>
            <li> It took me about 4-6 wks to really see it clear up nicely.</li>
            <li> But worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth trying.</li>
            <li> They also ran out of the supersize, which I think might be worth ordering the cleanser separately.  </li>
            <li> Its not as \\&quot;gritty\\&quot; as the Proactiv Renewing Cleanser, but certainly worth it</li>
            <li> Clear skin is about more than just using the right brands....</li>
            <li> awesome product, plastic seal in original form, only suggestion is to lesson packaging for a small product.</li>
            <li> for those people who say the new formula doesn&#x27;t work...it works just fine for me.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem as good or the same as the product i get directly from Proactiv</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it did very much to help my acne, anyway.</li>
            <li> ..if you are a avid proactiv user you know that they changed the formula from the original to the new</li>
            <li> Better than dealing with Proactive when u only want wash for maintenance.  </li>
            <li> I have purhased Proactiv products for years for my granddaughters; they cleared up their skin problems and we avoided medication many years ago and now they use them regularly for \\&quot;maintenance\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say use this product if you can afford to consistently buy it.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what is says it will do.  </li>
            <li> think she&#x27;s pretty with or without blemishes.</li>
            <li> and I have to say that my skin did react to the product at first, but my skin ended up getting use to the product.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re thinking about trying Proactiv, get the minis first, and see how it goes.</li>
            <li> Personally, my skin has never been better.</li>
            <li> many days I dont need to wear any foundation/makeup, which saves me money overall.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for the first time about 10 years ago at the age of about 55.  </li>
            <li> The first month I was on it</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what its advertised as.  </li>
            <li> Will be using this seller again for future Proactiv Solution needs :)</li>
            <li> But try this first.  </li>
            <li> and we needed more before we got our next shipment.</li>
            <li> Overall we are satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> And i got my order 2 days early!!!!</li>
            <li> great service, good product, I love it, But price little bit expensive!</li>
            <li> I use it every morning in the shower, and it keeps my face clean and clear of breakouts.</li>
            <li> The price is decent and it will be worth it.</li>
            <li> really - you just HAVE to be consistent and give it time.</li>
            <li> The title really says it all.</li>
            <li> but my skin really seems to respond to benzoyl peroxide and not salicylic acid.</li>
            <li> This stuff really keeps the pimples from popping out on my face.</li>
            <li> Proactiv really works to prevent them from coming to the surface.</li>
            <li> This one really keeps away about 90% of the acne</li>
            <li> This is my favrotite cleaner in the whole world.</li>
            <li> Proactiv really works.</li>
            <li> I got this for my son and it seems to work really well.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> so my skin is usually VERY tan )...</li>
            <li> It made my skin smooth and totally got rid of all my acne and scaring!</li>
            <li> so this is very helpful to me</li>
            <li> Very embarrassing, kids did not understand, so there was teasing and looks of horror.and</li>
            <li> Overall I like Proactiv, its a bit pricey, but because it keeps my skin acne free, theres</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t use it for a day or two I can really tell a difference.</li>
            <li> Is very helpful.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and I had no issues.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the whole regimine, just the cleanser twice a day.</li>
            <li> It keeps your skin clear and feeling fresh every time you use it.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Proactive.</li>
            <li> That way I don&#x27;t stain my towels or use this product too much.</li>
            <li> I had experienced several hard bumps that hurt the first week or two that I used this product, I Googled to see if I could find some answers, but had no luck...</li>
            <li> Most of the other treatments out there contain Salicytic Acid, which dries out my skin.  </li>
            <li> The Refining mask is NOT really a mask, but a heavy sulfur smelling cream that works great as a overnight blemish remover.  </li>
            <li> This product is highly advertised but did nothing.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend going on Accutane to treat and cure acne.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and love the results.  </li>
            <li> When we went to use this we noiced that it is thinner than what we normally use.</li>
            <li> (they made the scubbing beads smaller and less effective)</li>
            <li> After the second week is when I saw that it was working I&#x27;ve always had a lot of brake outs on the right side of my face but with this product they have faded away.</li>
            <li> Firstly, it takes a few weeks before you see significant results.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the new version.</li>
            <li> This product destroyed a new $8,000 carpet.  </li>
            <li> The first time I purchased this,  I scrubbed my face like I normally did, then used this and a white facecloth to rinse.  </li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> It has always been very embarrassing to walk around with zits on my face especially as I got older.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday with results that no other acne product has ever been able to match.</li>
            <li> right when you start to break out 1-2X a day, and you should see your blemish \\&quot;dry</li>
            <li> having clear skin is about understanding skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It cleans deep and well leaving my skin feeling dry and clean for the day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i found the same exact ingredient in a knock off at Dollar General</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and the proactive cleanser does not irritate it.</li>
            <li> I use the whole system daily.  </li>
            <li> This product BLEACHED my skin nearly 4 shades lighter than the rest of my body.</li>
            <li> I also have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have suffered with acne since I was 7 years old.</li>
            <li> Im over 40 yrs old and have been using Proactiv  for over 5 yrs now.  </li>
            <li> Accutane is a natural retinoid.</li>
            <li> I am 70 years old and still have a problem with acne.  </li>
            <li> And it works even with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I Bought it long time ago when it just came to market, tried a couple of times and use it as a scrub for my feet - very</li>
            <li> like it states on this description, only to find it was the NEW renewing cleanser</li>
            <li> Harsh on your skin but works like a charm for those who have mild to severe acne.  </li>
            <li> I had heard mixed reviews on Proactiv for clear skin.</li>
            <li> I am 30 years old with moderate acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 67 yrs old and have used this product for years due to the fact that my skin has large pores and needs to exfoliate on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> Although I have tried other products, some even prescription, I always have to use Proactiv when I need clearing up fast.</li>
            <li> I started using proactive with no cracy expectation, I&#x27;ve used so many other products in the past and all they do is dry my face.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe the dirt that my original acne cleanser left behind.  </li>
            <li> but price is little bit high comparing to the similar product.</li>
            <li> I religiously use Proactiv in the AM and evening, and only have minor breakouts now</li>
            <li> /&gt;Secondly, it is not a magic potion capable of \\&quot;curing\\&quot; acne.</li>
            <li> First, let me state that I NEVER had acne until late 30s.</li>
            <li> This is personal preference, but I would rather find a cleanser that does not feel rough on the skin.</li>
            <li> If you join as a Proactiv \\&quot;member\\&quot; you get access to other products such as their Sunscreen, powder and foundations,</li>
            <li> This cleanser does dry out your face, but I use Palmer&#x27;s face oil to help with that.</li>
            <li> Not completely sure it is the same thing as doesn&#x27;t have same smell &amp; feel.  </li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t, understand the ways to help keep your skin healthy since, if you don&#x27;t take those steps, it is HIGHLY likely be disappointed</li>
            <li> I used proactiv for about a year and although it was expensive and a lot of steps it cleared up my mild acne.</li>
            <li> I saw my skin go from painful, red, cystic acne to completely smooth.</li>
            <li> I suggest for anyone with acne to at least try one of the smaller systems to see if it works and then start to purchase regularly.</li>
            <li> But have only used a few times</li>
            <li> I have had my daughter to the doctor &amp; spent $100&#x27;s on appointments &amp; medications.  </li>
            <li> Be careful about use as it dries out an irritates your skin if it&#x27;s not used to the chemicals.</li>
            <li> Once you stop using the product, your acne will return unless you take active steps to maintain the health of your skin.</li>
            <li> This was how I found out that Benzoyl peroxide was not right for me.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that I ordered 2  </li>
            <li> For APO/FPO boxes, this is not true.  </li>
            <li> It does leave your face a bit tight afterwards, but I haven’t come across an acne product that hasn’t.</li>
            <li> but I have a few less pimples.</li>
            <li> A little costly, but it works wonders</li>
            <li> A little pricey, but</li>
            <li> Hope price lower a little.  </li>
            <li> works without overdrying but perhaps not much better than any other benzoyl peroxide product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Pro-Active for a little over two years and my skin cleared up immediately and stayed that way.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t have any problems with sun exposure as I tan a few times a week.</li>
            <li> The only reason I give it a 4 and not a 5 is that if I miss even one day my face brakes out and almost worse than before I started using it.</li>
            <li> It dried up my skin pretty badly, and I noticed that it was bleaching my towels when I dried my face.</li>
            <li> unfortunately, after sticking with this product for a further month, all my friends and family began to comment on how sick and pale my skin looked ( i am mixed and live in the tropics</li>
            <li> It is often believed that merely using a product can be the only change made to help your skin.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the formula is differnt for this product.</li>
            <li> needless to say i do not go through this in less than a month and am disappointed they would send me one that expired that quickly.</li>
            <li> Did not like it, to hard to get out of bottle.</li>
            <li> I was forced to stop using the product despite its acne healing properties as bleaching one&#x27;s skin in the Caribbean is taboo and within 2 weeks my acne had returned with a vengeance.</li>
            <li> I think that the first couple uses of the product get whatever evil is in your skin out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit expensive for a small bottle but with it if you need a reliable product for face wash</li>
            <li> Approximately 7 years ago a TV add prompted my trying Proactive.</li>
            <li> It smelled bad, was the wrong color and consistency.</li>
            <li> and I was very unhappy.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this company</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Better than dealing with Proactive when u only want wash for maintenance.  Not completely sure it is the same thing as doesn&#x27;t have same smell &amp; feel.  But have only used a few times so we&#x27;ll see if I get the same results.</li>
            <li> I have purhased Proactiv products for years for my granddaughters; they cleared up their skin problems and we avoided medication many years ago and now they use them regularly for \\&quot;maintenance\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Proaciv is a highly effective acne treatment brand but, here&#x27;s the catch - you have to keep at it. Firstly, it takes a few weeks before you see significant results. This is the case for any acne treatment product really - you just HAVE to be consistent and give it time. So, folks looking for a quick solution to their problem (i.e. - clearing up your skin in time for prom or a wedding, for example) will be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, it is not a magic potion capable of \\&quot;curing\\&quot; acne. Once you stop using the product, your acne will return unless you take active steps to maintain the health of your skin. It is often believed that merely using a product can be the only change made to help your skin. Clear skin is about more than just using the right brands.... having clear skin is about understanding skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say use this product if you can afford to consistently buy it. If you can&#x27;t, understand the ways to help keep your skin healthy since, if you don&#x27;t take those steps, it is HIGHLY likely be disappointed once you stop using Proactiv.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: Do use all three components of the set if you can. Since it was formulated to work as a set, it is better to use it that way in the end.</li>
            <li> The title really says it all. My skin looks healthy, refreshed and clear when using this product.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m 40 and have had problems with breakouts forever it seems and I must say if you can stick with the Proactiv Solution products - they do work. It took me about 4-6 wks to really see it clear up nicely. i&#x27;m a big fan now.  you must use it every morning and night or you&#x27;ll breakout likely.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what is says it will do.  I use it everyday with results that no other acne product has ever been able to match.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this stuff was going to work since I found out about it through infomircials but my skin really seems to respond to benzoyl peroxide and not salicylic acid. This stuff really keeps the pimples from popping out on my face. I am 40+ and get pimples..I think from hormones. I don&#x27;t have cystic acne but can have multiple blemishes at times. Proactiv really works to prevent them from coming to the surface. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I have used every product out there. This one really keeps away about 90% of the acne I would otherwise get. I can&#x27;t say it makes my face perfect, but it makes it much much better than it would be with any other product. Definitely follow with the lotion (or try the benzoyl peroxide treatment at [...], which works fantastically).</li>
            <li> I ordered this proactive for my daughter and it was counterfeit.It smelled bad, was the wrong color and consistency. (She has used it before, so she could tell)  Very disappointed with this company</li>
            <li> I love proactiv! This is my favrotite cleaner in the whole world. I used to use Neutrogena but this one works better. Pricey, though. But worth it.</li>
            <li> Proactiv really works. Anyone with acne who has given it a fair shot will most likely agree. Can be strong and cause swelling or puffiness of eyes with irritation of the skin but if you use a bit at a time so the skin adjusts, this works wonders.</li>
            <li> So far my Grand-Daughter is very pleased with this product,the price was more then fair,quick shipping,and so far great results;i&#x27;am sur i will be back once and if she needs more of this great product Thanks</li>
            <li> My wife orders this stuff (\\&quot;Suurrrre!!!\\&quot; say the gentlemen reading this).&lt;br /&gt;She likes it because it keeps her face clean and blemish-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think she&#x27;s pretty with or without blemishes. But it&#x27;s nice to not have her beauty clouded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proactiv is good stuff. I, er... SHE would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and the proactive cleanser does not irritate it. It&#x27;s worth trying. I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I ordered on Amazon.com thinking I could get it faster than the company.  For APO/FPO boxes, this is not true.  They also ran out of the supersize, which I think might be worth ordering the cleanser separately.  I ordered through Proactive, and both products came on the same day.  I have always found the cleanser to be super effective!</li>
            <li> I got this for my son and it seems to work really well.  I noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> A little costly, but it works wonders</li>
            <li> Proactiv Renewing Cleanser is great!  I use it everyday and love the results.  A little pricey, but I can see the difference in my skin when I am not using it.  Buying through Amazon was cheaper than the Proactiv site.</li>
            <li> I used proactiv for about a year and although it was expensive and a lot of steps it cleared up my mild acne. The thing is if I even skipped one day my face would break out. I just use a Neutrogena bar of soap to wash my face now and coconut oil as a moisturizer and my skin is clearer than it has ever been. It&#x27;s a lot cheaper too!</li>
            <li> I use the whole system daily.  I suggest for anyone with acne to at least try one of the smaller systems to see if it works and then start to purchase regularly.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Excellent product for acne</li>
            <li> I began using this product consistently after seeing many ads on tv and deciding to give it a shot.Within 2 weeks my skin was showing a significant improvement! Another 2 weeks later and my skin was completely free of acne and had an amazing glow, unfortunately, after sticking with this product for a further month, all my friends and family began to comment on how sick and pale my skin looked ( i am mixed and live in the tropics so my skin is usually VERY tan )... This product BLEACHED my skin nearly 4 shades lighter than the rest of my body. I was forced to stop using the product despite its acne healing properties as bleaching one&#x27;s skin in the Caribbean is taboo and within 2 weeks my acne had returned with a vengeance. So ** BUYER&#x27;S BEWARE**!!!! This product bleaches the skin!</li>
            <li> Great price and no monthly fee coming out of my account if I was to&lt;br /&gt;order from Proactive. That in itself is worth it!!!!</li>
            <li> awesome product, plastic seal in original form, only suggestion is to lesson packaging for a small product. Thank you</li>
            <li> I am 30 years old with moderate acne. This soap is wonderful. It&#x27;s the only thing that works. You have to give it a week or two though.</li>
            <li> for those people who say the new formula doesn&#x27;t work...it works just fine for me.  sure the beads aren&#x27;t felt as strongly, but i think it still works.  and it&#x27;s better than going through the normal channels of proactiv to procure it.</li>
            <li> This was how I found out that Benzoyl peroxide was not right for me. My eyes swelled up, my face puffed up and so I had to immediately go to the doctor and had to be placed on steroids. He said I was allergic to it. It will not be applicable for everyone but please be cautious when using this product.</li>
            <li> Always happy with proactive</li>
            <li> When I ordered this product I thought I was getting the ORIGINAL renewing cleaser like it states on this description, only to find it was the NEW renewing cleanser..if you are a avid proactiv user you know that they changed the formula from the original to the new (they made the scubbing beads smaller and less effective) I wanted the ORIGINAL so next time I think this product should be specified better!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gritty texture actually causes breakouts for me.  This is personal preference, but I would rather find a cleanser that does not feel rough on the skin.</li>
            <li> I have mild to moderate acne with oily skin that tends to break out and scar very easily and this product worked wonders for me! It made my skin smooth and totally got rid of all my acne and scaring! It&#x27;s like a miracle in a bottle! I also have sensitive skin and I have to say that my skin did react to the product at first, but my skin ended up getting use to the product. The original is great, I don&#x27;t like the new stuff! This is my personal preference people so this product, like many others, may or may not work for you, but you just gotta try it because you never know if that one product could of saved your life! LOL.</li>
            <li> It works. That is about all I can say about it. It helps get rid of my acne. It is not a cure all but it helps...a lot.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and do not want not want to have it sent to be on auto delivery so this is very helpful to me</li>
            <li> I had experienced several hard bumps that hurt the first week or two that I used this product, I Googled to see if I could find some answers, but had no luck...The bumps went away after a short period of time and now my skin is amazing... I think that the first couple uses of the product get whatever evil is in your skin out. I had been out of the cleanser for almost a week, and I can tell the difference when I&#x27;m not using the product... I also don&#x27;t have any problems with sun exposure as I tan a few times a week. If you&#x27;re thinking about trying Proactiv, get the minis first, and see how it goes. Personally, my skin has never been better. Hopefully you find this helpful. :)</li>
            <li> I stopped using this. It dried up my skin pretty badly, and I noticed that it was bleaching my towels when I dried my face. I don&#x27;t think bleach on your face is any good. I don&#x27;t think it did very much to help my acne, anyway.</li>
            <li> This product has been amazing. Doing all it says it will do.I have suffered with acne since I was 7 years old. Very embarrassing, kids did not understand, so there was teasing and looks of horror.and also there was the pain.  I tried everything, even prescription meds. I wish this product would have been available when I was growing up,I know it would have saved me from emotional and physical pain. Thank you proactive.If you are having skin break outs don&#x27;t hesitate to use this product. The price is decent and it will be worth it. Cindy Pack</li>
            <li> This product is highly advertised but did nothing. A doctor has some samples that work so see a doctor after obamacare covers you we hope.</li>
            <li> Use this every day, great product. It doesn&#x27;t completely remove acne, but I&#x27;ve tried a lot of acne treatments and this probably the best one I have tried. This cleanser does dry out your face, but I use Palmer&#x27;s face oil to help with that.</li>
            <li> Great product &amp; super price, but next time going to try new line x-out</li>
            <li> First, let me state that I NEVER had acne until late 30s. 😠. Although I have tried other products, some even prescription, I always have to use Proactiv when I need clearing up fast.</li>
            <li> I started using proactive with no cracy expectation, I&#x27;ve used so many other products in the past and all they do is dry my face. After the second week is when I saw that it was working I&#x27;ve always had a lot of brake outs on the right side of my face but with this product they have faded away. And any breakouts that I do get they fade away within 2 to 3 days with no leftover marks like before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 67 yrs old and have used this product for years due to the fact that my skin has large pores and needs to exfoliate on a daily basis.  I&#x27;m not blessed with beautiful skin but Proactive has kept it free of blemishes and blackheads.</li>
            <li> great service, good product, I love it, But price little bit expensive! Hope price lower a little.  Hope larger bottle will be cheaper!</li>
            <li> It works wonderfully but be sure to use the proper regimens, if you stop using it...I tend to break out even more.</li>
            <li> like I can buy without renewal agreement</li>
            <li> Some people say this dries their face out, but I have never had any problem.  I use it every morning in the shower, and it keeps my face clean and clear of breakouts. I like the smell and it makes my face feel really smooth and clean.  I will always use it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and GREAT price:):)</li>
            <li> Im over 40 yrs old and have been using Proactiv  for over 5 yrs now.  Most of the other treatments out there contain Salicytic Acid, which dries out my skin.  The combination of Benzol Peroxide and just enough moisturizers is great for my oily skin, without drying it out.  I agree with the others that once you start using this, your skin DOES become dependent on it.  I was away on vacation and forgot my Proactiv bottles, after about 3 days I started breaking out.  Fortunately I was able to find something pretty close in a CVS called ACNE FREE, which carries a fairly LARGE size of the Cleanser.  Its not as \\&quot;gritty\\&quot; as the Proactiv Renewing Cleanser, but certainly worth it (Especially if you can find it on sale or have a store coupon!)  I religiously use Proactiv in the AM and evening, and only have minor breakouts now 1-2x a month.   The Refining mask is NOT really a mask, but a heavy sulfur smelling cream that works great as a overnight blemish remover.  Use as a spot treatment right when you start to break out 1-2X a day, and you should see your blemish \\&quot;dry out\\&quot; in about 2-3 days.  If you join as a Proactiv \\&quot;member\\&quot; you get access to other products such as their Sunscreen, powder and foundations, which I find work very well at controlling \\&quot;shine\\&quot; and giving enough cover without feeling like you have heavy foundation on.  Overall I like Proactiv, its a bit pricey, but because it keeps my skin acne free, theres many days I dont need to wear any foundation/makeup, which saves me money overall.</li>
            <li> It is drying out my face but I have a few less pimples.</li>
            <li> Did not like it, to hard to get out of bottle. Top gets clogged n won&#x27;t easily unclog. It wasn&#x27;t the product I thought I was getting I tried it anywas and I was very unhappy.</li>
            <li> been using this mild benzoyl peroxide wash without the rest of the &amp;#34;system&amp;#34; for years. works without overdrying but perhaps not much better than any other benzoyl peroxide product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit expensive for a small bottle but with it if you need a reliable product for face wash</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy to finally find something that works.  I purchased this for the first time about 10 years ago at the age of about 55.  It has always been very embarrassing to walk around with zits on my face especially as I got older.  The first time I purchased this,  I scrubbed my face like I normally did, then used this and a white facecloth to rinse.  I couldn&#x27;t believe the dirt that my original acne cleanser left behind.  The only complaint I have is that I ordered 2  and they were delivered with the same expiration date only 4 months away.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend going on Accutane to treat and cure acne. I have been suffering from acne for eleven years, and have been on all different kinds of topical creams and washes, oral antibiotics and regime programs like Proactive. Accutane is a strong drug and a pain to manage in terms of appointments and monthly blood work, but the results are simply astounding. The first month I was on it I saw my skin go from painful, red, cystic acne to completely smooth. Accutane is a natural retinoid. If you have been suffering from acne for years, Accutane is faster, more effective, and cheaper!</li>
            <li> this works ok but id rather get the proactiv+ face wash. i would still deffinetly  recommend it to anyone with acne .</li>
            <li> What can I say about this cleanser. It has changed my life. I have been using it for years and don&#x27;t see myself stopping anytime soon. I use it twice a day. If I don&#x27;t use it for a day or two I can really tell a difference. I would recommend this to anyone at any age.</li>
            <li> I love proactiv cleansers. They are very healthy and beneficial for my skin. I suffer with a lot acne and allergic reactions. This is perfect for me and it&#x27;s a great improvement on my skin.</li>
            <li> I am 70 years old and still have a problem with acne.  Approximately 7 years ago a TV add prompted my trying Proactive. It worked on my skin like a miracle.  I no longer have to rely on antibiotics and will continue to use this product and share my situation with those who are looking for a skin miracle.  I have since been purchasing it through Amazon which is easy with fast response time.</li>
            <li> I bought the  proactiv renewl cleanser. It&#x27;s a great product. And it works even with my sensitive skin. The man that owns the company. Is very helpful. And he&#x27;s kind. And i got my order 2 days early!!!! Thank you!!!!</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what its advertised as.  It works great.  The shipping was fast and I had no issues.</li>
            <li> I received this very quickly, I was very impressed with the speed! Product is exactly what I ordered! It&#x27;s perfect! Will be using this seller again for future Proactiv Solution needs :)&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem as good or the same as the product i get directly from Proactiv</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used proactiv for years and love it. I don&#x27;t use the whole regimine, just the cleanser twice a day. It cleans deep and well leaving my skin feeling dry and clean for the day.</li>
            <li> I have had my daughter to the doctor &amp; spent $100&#x27;s on appointments &amp; medications.  One tube of lotion was $100!!! She was given antibiotics &amp; everything.  I bought Proactive (the kit)  She has been faithful to the schedule &amp; OMG!!! ACNE FREE!!!!!!!!! She is so happy &amp; so am I.  I even use it for my breakouts. This stuff is so good!!!!! Don&#x27;t go to the doctor. PLEASE!!! No offence to doctors.  But try this first.  I am telling you I wish I would have, it would have saved me a pile of frustration, time &amp; money.  My daughter would have been happier sooner.  She is acne free!</li>
            <li> Love proactiv! when used as directed, it works great!</li>
            <li> This cleansing cream is great!  It keeps your skin clear and feeling fresh every time you use it.  I would recommend this product to anyone and the seller was fantastic also.  Quick delivery of goods!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with proactive, since I started using it I have noticed a huge difference on the way my face looks</li>
            <li> I love how yet his works</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it.  Unless I want to look like I&#x27;m wearing the surface of Mars, I have to have it.  Thanks Proactive.</li>
            <li> The only product my daughter in law will use. I purchase it every year for Christmas.</li>
            <li> i have been a proactiv user for a few years now and find that the renewing cleanser works best for me.  i only gave 3 stars because i purchased product in august 2012 and they gave me a bottle that expired in september 2012.  needless to say i do not go through this in less than a month and am disappointed they would send me one that expired that quickly.</li>
            <li> I’ve been using this product on a regular basis for quite some time. I only use this step and it has been helping with clearing up my skin. It does leave your face a bit tight afterwards, but I haven’t come across an acne product that hasn’t. It also has tiny micro beads that help get a cleaner finish.</li>
            <li> It worked for me 10 years ago, I thought I&#x27;d try it again when I started with the break outs. My skin changed.  I used all product and my skin was inflamed.</li>
            <li> After a year of breakout my face is finally clean, I don&#x27;t think I would use anything else ever again. Love it</li>
            <li> Item is not the product shown in the picture. It is not the original Proactiv it&#x27;s the new version.</li>
            <li> Love this, use it every time I wash my hair (2-3 days). That way I don&#x27;t stain my towels or use this product too much. For my skin, it&#x27;s just perfect!</li>
            <li> fast shipping, best prices</li>
            <li> Just as described. Pleasant transaction.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have been Proactive for a while and we needed more before we got our next shipment. When we went to use this we noiced that it is thinner than what we normally use. Not sure if the formula is differnt for this product. It still worked for the both of us. We also have issues with proactive staining our towels if we do not rinse properly. We did not have that issue with this product.  Overall we are satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Love love love this face wash. it is the only thing I Use to washoping my face. The only reason I give it a 4 and not a 5 is that if I miss even one day my face brakes out and almost worse than before I started using it.</li>
            <li> I had heard mixed reviews on Proactiv for clear skin. However, my teenage daughter has had excellent luck with this product. It has been very effective and gentler on her skin. It&#x27;s pricey, but buying it through Amazon has helped.</li>
            <li> I Bought it long time ago when it just came to market, tried a couple of times and use it as a scrub for my feet - very helpful!!!!...&lt;br /&gt;But eventually doesnt cost that money...</li>
            <li> This product destroyed a new $8,000 carpet.  It apparently is so potent that any residual amount on your hands or face, when coming in contact with carpet, turns the carpet bright orange and its permanent.  The manufacturer refused to cover any of the cost, claiming that the warning on the bottle which warns about &amp;#34;fabric&amp;#34; also applies to carpet.  Wow!  now you tell me!?  I can just imagine what this product does to clothing and furniture.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy it, could be the most expensive mistake you make.</li>
            <li> good but price is little bit high comparing to the similar product.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s too expensive&lt;br /&gt;i found the same exact ingredient in a knock off at Dollar General</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have acne when I was a teen, but now that I&#x27;m in menopause, I have pimples! This product keeps them at bay if I use it like I should. It is gentle and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Product works great, always want to keep some on hand.</li>
            <li> This is the only stuff that works for me! I use the toner and cream as well with great results.</li>
            <li> Harsh on your skin but works like a charm for those who have mild to severe acne.  Be careful about use as it dries out an irritates your skin if it&#x27;s not used to the chemicals.</li>
            <li> Great product and price, thankful to be able to order this without having to commit to auto delivery every 3 months, thanks!</li>
            <li> This is the only product I can and will use. It is great for blackheads and helps with oily skin.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Works at keeping acne at bay.  I&#x27;ve been using Pro-Active for a little over two years and my skin cleared up immediately and stayed that way.</li>
