            <li>I also apply the warm saffron setting powder.</li>
            <li>Funny cast to color, grayish, not an attractive color.  </li>
            <li>You need to apply a moisturizer before application so the makeup will better blend on the skin</li>
            <li>Tan is soooo light!</li>
            <li>Very good product, although I do not seem to think it stays on as long as it claims it does...</li>

            <li>This product is easy to apply, glides  right on.  </li>
            <li>The suntan was a bit dark, but I blended the Natural and Suntan together for a perfect blend.  </li>

            <li>right I would probably be happy with this product,it gives good coverage however you do need to put quite a few layers on to cover a dark</li>
            <li>once you find the right shade.  </li>
            <li>I had to beg to return the first one even though it was unused and my attempt occurred within 24 hours of receipt.</li>
            <li>I first ordered the Natural shade, but it was too light.  </li>
            <li>You must use light layers - not just one big glob.    </li>
            <li>I bought the toast color since I am very tanned.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product to help cover spider veins during summer shorts season.  </li>
            <li>It blends really well</li>
            <li>The color shades in website are identical to the real</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find a high street store that stocked it</li>
            <li>so there are no hard lines.</li>
            <li>It completely camouflages my scar and blends in with my skin color.  </li>
            <li>The key is you must PRACTICE with it beforehand, and you cannot rush applying it and expect the makeup to look natural.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I really would recommend</li>

            <li> Excellent product great price great service!!!i will order again ðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> Despite the negative reviews, I&#x27;ve had success with this product. I used this to cover a tattoo on my ankle for a wedding. The key is you must PRACTICE with it beforehand, and you cannot rush applying it and expect the makeup to look natural. You must use light layers - not just one big glob.    I watched some application tip videos on YouTube and that helped. You need to apply a moisturizer before application so the makeup will better blend on the skin and you have to feather the edges so there are no hard lines. I used the Leg &amp; Body Cover along with the Cover Creme and Setting Powder and had very close to flawless results. If you can, try sample shades of this makeup in department stores versus buying online.     Just like makeup you wear on your face, you can \\&quot;notice\\&quot; this product when it&#x27;s on your skin (especially when looking at it up close). It&#x27;s vital that you experiment with different shades to get a color that is close as possible to your skin tone. But from a distance the cover-up couldn&#x27;t be detected.</li>
            <li> I bought this to cover veins on my legs, and while the product is fairly effective- and DEFINITELY does not run or fade away until you wash in shower with rag- it&#x27;s nearly impossible to match the shade based on swatches shown online.  I&#x27;d recommend buying from a store such as Ulta so you won&#x27;t have to bother returning it- and if you do buy online, DON&#x27;T go through Beauty Bridge- I had to beg to return the first one even though it was unused and my attempt occurred within 24 hours of receipt.</li>
            <li> I ordered &#x27;light&#x27; and was rather disappointed when I tried it on my legs.Despite studying the colour chart carefully it was not really as depicted,way too dark and pinky for my pale legs. If I could get the colour right I would probably be happy with this product,it gives good coverage however you do need to put quite a few layers on to cover a dark mark.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve now ordered &#x27;ivory&#x27; and if that doesn&#x27;t match maybe I will try blending these two colours together,so its proving to be more expensive than I anticipated. I couldn&#x27;t find a high street store that stocked it so you just have to take pot luck ordering it online and hope for the best as the samples are not easy to find and also rather expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The makers of Dermablend leg cover should make samples cheaper,smaller and easier to get hold of so that you don&#x27;t have all this hassle and expense.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t cover tattoo or spider veins and makes your legs look fake! Don&#x27;t waste your money! Very unhappy with the product.</li>
            <li> Tan is soooo light! Beware of color. If I was pale it would be great!</li>
            <li> I bought this to cover my tummy tuck scar when wearing bikinis.  This stuff is amazing.  It completely camouflages my scar and blends in with my skin color.  It stays on until I shower  and apply soap.  I am very happy with this product.  I bought the toast color since I am very tanned.  I also apply the warm saffron setting powder.</li>
            <li> I really like this product to help cover spider veins during summer shorts season.  It blends really well once you find the right shade.  I first ordered the Natural shade, but it was too light.  The suntan was a bit dark, but I blended the Natural and Suntan together for a perfect blend.  Now that summer is in full swing and my legs are more tan, the suntan color alone is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It stays on well during the day, doesn&#x27;t transfer onto clothing and lasts through swimming, sweat and rain.</li>
            <li> No fill my expectations</li>
            <li> Perfect shade for me when wearing sunless tanners. - I have used the product in a different color but prefer this color for the summer sun.</li>
            <li> Funny cast to color, grayish, not an attractive color.  Not seller&#x27;s fault, but was hoping for a suntan look but rather it turned out a &amp;#34;dead corpse look&amp;#34;.  Sorry, but that is what it appears to me.  Needless to say I won&#x27;t be using it again.</li>
            <li> Very good product, although I do not seem to think it stays on as long as it claims it does...Other than that, I really would recommend</li>
            <li> This product is easy to apply, glides  right on.  The coverage is very good.  It stays on as expected.  I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> The color shades in website are identical to the real products.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t cover scars and causes fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;Have to throw it away.</li>
            <li> I have used dermablend for years to cover up spider veins on my legs. It covers them well and stays on well. I don&#x27;t know what I would do without it. Thank you for producing such a great makeup!&lt;br /&gt;Julie Ben Avraham</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast! The product is great. (as expected)</li>
