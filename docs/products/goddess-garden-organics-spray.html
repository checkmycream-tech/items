            <li>Love the product!</li>
            <li>Amazing product.  </li>
            <li>Coverage is excellent but lacking one star as my bottle is leaking at the sprayer - a forgivable issue had I not paid so much for the product.</li>
            <li>This lotion also has a nice lavender scent</li>
            <li>The opinions I have expressed are my own.</li>
            <li>The opinions I have expressed are my own.</li>
            <li>Smells nice.</li>
            <li>Really liked the lotion, but the dispenser mechanism sprays like a garden hose out of control.</li>
            <li>The opinions I have expressed are my own.</li>
            <li>The opinions I have expressed are my own.</li>
            <li>I also find the smell to be pleasant and very mild.</li>
            <li>It sprays on and ribs in very easily.  </li>
            <li>But extremely easy to apply!</li>
            <li>Easy to apply - gets the job done and safe!</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, light texture, provides good protection from the sun.</li>
            <li>I get around this by just spraying onto my hand and rubbing it in, which is probably ensures better coverage anyways.</li>
            <li>Never was able to use the product because it arrived split all over the box.</li>
            <li>There are many better sunscreen out there and for one:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the applicator pump as well.</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars instead of five because it is more of a pump than a spray so you still have to rub it in.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I have an allergy to something in most sunscreens but this one doesn&#x27;t bother my skin at all.</li>
            <li>I thought there would be more coverage</li>
            <li>so that might be more in line with my expectations.</li>
            <li>It served its purpose:-)</li>
            <li>Most importantly it is non toxic and won&#x27;t harm my boys!</li>
            <li>Love this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this because it was recommended to have safe ingredients.</li>
            <li>Love it for the beach.</li>
            <li>I knew I had to find something better.</li>
            <li>Most of them feel sticky and tacky while you are wearing them.  </li>
            <li>is what we love about it:&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this...</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Not greasy, nice light scent.  </li>
            <li>My favorite sunscreen, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot.</li>
            <li>I love that it squirts on, as opposed to a spray.</li>
            <li>Sunscreen is good but the pump broke on first use.  </li>
            <li>My favorite and easy to apply in kids.</li>
            <li>It sprays and rubs in more easily than a cream sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product and one I have recommended to many people interested in switching to an all natural sunscreen.</li>
            <li>so I put it to the test right away and love it!</li>
            <li>We are starting into August in Texas and not one sun burn for my very fair complexion child.</li>
            <li>The have partnered with the Environmental Working Group which is huge, so the chemicals they put in their products are about as safe as you can get.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Regardless of the name \\&quot;Kids Natural Sunscreen\\&quot;, it is great for adults.</li>
            <li>Its great stuff.prob need to buy 2 at a time.my 4 yr old</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and has a nice, mild scent.</li>
            <li>I have tried many, many, natural sunscreens, but this is the best one by far.  </li>
            <li>but I received a full replacement bottle - thank you!  </li>
            <li>Sprays on easily and rubs in just as easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to spray on and spread.</li>

            <li>This product goes on so easy.  </li>
            <li>it spreads so easily and my kids don&#x27;t get burned.</li>
            <li>It spreads easily and smells fine.</li>
            <li>Even when in a spray bottle with a fine mister the sunblock dribbled out.</li>
            <li>I have used many all natural sunscreens and I absolutely LOVE THIS ONE!</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t get burned, but I was so scared that I didn&#x27;t really enjoy myself.  </li>
            <li>The lotion glides on smoothly.</li>
            <li>The lotion glides on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Any light breeze during the day</li>
            <li>This is much easier to put on than the others I have tried and it smells nice.  </li>
            <li>The spray bottle is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Also, I have done research on this company and they are fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Have to see if I can find another nozzle that will fit or else</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s our \\&quot;go-to\\&quot; sunscreen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low-value free gift from the manufacturer for posting this review.</li>
            <li>Yes, costs a bit more, but completely worth it.  </li>
            <li>I will receive a low-value free gift from the manufacturer for posting this review.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fabulous.  </li>
            <li>: I will receive a low-value free gift from the manufacturer for posting this review.</li>
            <li>I was comfortable putting this on myself and my kids.</li>
            <li>It works, doesn&#x27;t irritate their sensitive skin and as a parent, I feel good about its ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Good stuff for kids with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Goes on easily when trying to do it quickly at the pool.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to apply and run in.</li>
            <li>Super easy to apply.</li>
            <li>super easy to use</li>
            <li>We try to buy eco- and kid friendly sunscreen any time we can and we had to get something we can spray for summer</li>
            <li>I just used this sunscreen for the first time on myself and my child and just love it.</li>
            <li>Before buying my 3rd bottle, I again value shopped, and it remains the best value by far for the zinc and titanium blockers.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen is by far the best I have tried on my children, who have multiple chemical sensitivities.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, I feel like it works better than our standard Banana Boat - thicker sunscreen</li>
            <li>The spray nozzle helped with application and it rubbed in much better than most natural sunscreens.</li>
            <li>The treatment area is frequently exposed to the sun and for the treatment to be effective there can be no tanning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Kids Natural Sunscreen for 2 years and it has been 100% effective for me.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a true *spray* bottle.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this sunscreen.....</li>
            <li>Best application in all natural products- not thick and goes on clear</li>
            <li>The thing I love most though, is that it does not go on white.  </li>
            <li>The spray makes it super easy to apply: I spray it into my palm and apply where wanted ~ no tube squeezing or pouring too much.</li>
            <li>It is NOT an aerosol spray which is another great plus (less inhalation risk).</li>
            <li>It has never failed me!</li>
            <li>Love this so far!</li>
            <li>We rolled again with the punches, but once the entire desired area was covered, we realized our child looked like a ghost and smelled of lavender, and you better like lavender because it was really strong</li>
            <li>I have been recently looking for more natural products and this was highly rated by the EWG as being non-toxic and very effective sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Spray pump is really convenient too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low-value free gift from the manufacturer for posting this review.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried many natural sunscreen&#x27;s and this one is by far our favorite.</li>
            <li>My favorite sunscreen for my kids so far.</li>
            <li>right?  </li>
            <li>My son burns very easily, and this is the only sunscreen he will use now.  </li>
            <li>Compared to other natural sunscreens, this lotion absorbs really well and has done a great job keeping my family free of sunburns.</li>
            <li>love the natural formulation and it&#x27;s very highly rate on EWG</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this product since it&#x27;s all natural</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was great on our cruise, when we were outside for short time periods.</li>
            <li>All natural sun protection using zinc in a easy to use and apply spray container.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to spray and rub in, no harsh odor and not greasy.</li>
            <li>According to the label, the product is a non-GMO and reef safe sheer mineral lotion comprised of 6% Zinc Oxide and 6.4% Titanium Dioxide with organics AloeVera, Glycerin, GlycineSoja</li>
            <li>, I felt it was worth mentioning just how much we dislike it.  </li>
            <li>It does have a very white residue when applied, which I am ok with.</li>
            <li>We love this sun cream for our entire family.</li>
            <li>only reef safe /</li>
            <li>But this product does not leave the skin really white like most.</li>
            <li>where the sun was hot as could be and no one got sunburned.  </li>
            <li>My kids (ages 9 and 8) apply it themselves to places they can reach, and I do their faces, ears, back of neck...</li>
            <li>He will wear this sunscreen with no problem, which makes my life so much easier!  </li>
            <li>Use it in small amounts and rub it in good to make sure you don&#x27;t turn white.</li>
            <li>Good chemical free option but leaves a greasy film behind.</li>
            <li>He is extremely fair, with platinum blonde hair and blue eyes.</li>
            <li>I was not required or compelled to write a positive review.</li>

            <li>TiOxide- Zinc Oxide sun lotion that actually spreads easily.</li>
            <li>My children not only don&#x27;t break out at all with this product, but it wears well and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>What is even better is that my kids did not sustain a single sunburn all summer.</li>
            <li>Certainly, the application procedure needs to be defined individually.advertent lotion extraction.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not clogged, it squirts streams and certainly doesn&#x27;t come out as an even spray.  </li>
            <li>The one by the lake is frequently used by myself and guests and the 3rd bottle was ordered so to have 2 at the lake and be sure a supply is consistently available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this is a great product protect in that sense, but it&#x27;s very hard to put on.</li>
            <li>What little bit that was salvaged seemed to be nice.  </li>
            <li>The other thing that&#x27;s great is the price--less than twenty dollars for an 8oz container is a steal, especially when you look at other popular mineral sunscreen brands for kids, most of which sell only 3oz for the same price.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t spray in a mist, just a straight stream, but it&#x27;s a lot easier than squeezing a bottle.  </li>
            <li>My grandson&#x27;s heavier self-application can leave a white trace and he&#x27;s comfortable having the product on his skin.</li>
            <li>My grandson&#x27;s heavier self-application can leave a white trace and he&#x27;s comfortable having the product on his skin.</li>
            <li>This one is so unusual though</li>
            <li>So now it had to be spread; so much for convenience and saving time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and we walked &amp;#34;around the world&amp;#34; at Epcot (an area notorious for being very sunny without a lot of shade).</li>
            <li>It does not produce a wide spray, more like a string of sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I use it for the whole family and has worked well for all of us.</li>
            <li>It goes on very well.</li>
            <li>All in all this is our go-to sunscreen now for the whole family.</li>
            <li>It stays on really well and sprays well without all that aerosol junk to inhale.</li>
            <li>The spray is not aerosol type so the concerns related to inhaling the sunscreen is not pertinent and it rubs on smooth.</li>
            <li>Gets uaed up fast.</li>
            <li>It also has an herbal scent which both of my children really like.  </li>
            <li>Definitely be careful to make sure it&#x27;s in the &amp;#34;off position&amp;#34; before putting it in your purse or diaper bag.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done a lot of research and comparisons of the right sunscreen for my 16 month old son.</li>
            <li>Only reason for rating it a 4 vs. 5 is it is quite higher in price but still worth it.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen does not leave that heavy residue on the skin, it is by far my most favorite that we&#x27;ve used, and I love that it is natural and organic plant based without the harsh chemicals!</li>
            <li>It seems as if we have tried every single natural sunscreen that has been in the top 100 list of the EWG website.</li>
            <li>The level of protection seemed fine while dry.</li>
            <li>I noticed when my husband would use the typical spray sunblock the odor after spraying it would be an overwhelming chemical smell.</li>
            <li>and I will most likely buy again unless I can find an alternative that actually sprays.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway - Based on the fact that I have tried so many different kinds I have to say that this is THE one we keep going back to because it works</li>
            <li>Sprays on nicely and easy to rub in to small, active toddlers.</li>
            <li>I find the Goddess Garden spray sunscreen to be thinner than other non-chemical formulas; it&#x27;s easy to spread and my kids don&#x27;t end up looking ghostly or goth.</li>
            <li>Even on a week long vacation in Mexico when he was in the extra hot sun 8+ hours a day he stayed burn free.</li>
            <li>I used to buy lots of different sunscreens depending on my family&#x27;s needs - waterproof, sweat proof, extra sensitive for children - this sunscreen covers all our bases and I really love having just ONE bottle for everyone.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to rub in, whereas with other organic sunscreens we spend a long time rubbing it in, which meets with much kid resistance.  </li>
            <li>The lotion itself is fine, but the spray comes out like any other lotion that must be rubbed in.</li>
            <li>Most natural sunscreens leave a little film on the skin.  </li>
            <li>This pasty white girl of German and Irish heritage needs something a little more potent.</li>
            <li>It comes out a little runny so use it in an area where it can be cleaned easily.</li>
            <li>I received this sunscreen right before a long camping trip</li>
            <li>While this works fine as a sunscreen, there are a few things I&#x27;m not too fond of.</li>
            <li>Certainly, the application procedure needs to be defined individually.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a clear mist spray.</li>
            <li>All natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Very sticky and white.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve used this a lot this summer for my 15 month old.</li>
            <li>Two hours at the pool, and children were completely protected with just one application.&lt;br</li>
            <li>His sensitive skin didn&#x27;t have any reaction to the natural plant based sun screen.</li>
            <li>I read aother revies and ao I as adult use it too.</li>
            <li>and so far works well</li>
            <li>I still wasn&#x27;t satisfied that I got every part of their body because it&#x27;s so thick</li>
            <li>It goes on so much easier than many of the thick white options out there.</li>
            <li>I got my first bottle from Whole Foods, loved it and find it&#x27;s less expensive on Amazon.</li>
            <li>seems to mean better coverage - who knew?</li>
            <li>I thought this would be really easy for my kids to apply, but it was messy!  </li>
            <li>It sprays on easily without mess or fuss or turning white.</li>
            <li>I purchased this because it was supposed to be easy to apply via the spray feature but after several uses, the spray was clogged and messy.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product for applying sunscreen to small kids.</li>
            <li>The sprayer does get clogged but a few quick pumps sorts that out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-rubs on easily (despite the fact that it is quite thick and pasty)&lt;br /&gt;-fabulous sun protection (never once have we had a sunburn with this)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Burnout KIDS Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Spf 30 by BurnOut which I also have for out of school use:&lt;br</li>
            <li>And it rubs in soooo much easier than a lot of other natural sunblocks.</li>
            <li>This is my first natural sunscreen product and you can see it a little</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s generally out 2-4 hours in the sand, water and boat on one application.  </li>
            <li>He&#x27;s generally out 2-4 hours in the sand, water and boat on one application.  </li>
            <li>It takes a second to soak in and then it is clear.  </li>
            <li>The 3rd bottle has a clearly marked expiration date of 5/15.</li>
            <li>ratings on EWG for being a low hazard natural sunscreen&lt;br</li>
            <li>I might go back to the cream as the spray wasn&#x27;t exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>very active 16 month old boy) was MUCH EASIER than lotion from a tub or bottle.</li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t spray it directly on the body part you want to cover, or it makes a mess.  </li>
            <li>And I love that it&#x27;s not full of harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>This product is more expensive than other natural sunscreens I&#x27;ve used, but it worked really well.</li>
            <li>but it does come out white and in a stream (all because its a natural zinc oxide lotion) spray lotions that you buy that leave no color on the skin have chemicals that&#x27;s why there&#x27;s no white residue.</li>
            <li>And all natural as well and the bottle has lasted a long time.</li>
            <li>Looks a little white at first, but then absorbs and is colorless.</li>
            <li>First off, it is extremely greasy, so much so my daughter&#x27;s hair becomes matted at the slightest touch of this stuff and it leaves the skin extremely slick.</li>
            <li>The consistency is thin and easy to spread.</li>
            <li>It sprays well and the formula is thin enough to spread easily and is not overly white and chalky on the skin once rubbed in.</li>

            <li> Love the product!</li>
            <li> Amazing product.  </li>
            <li> Coverage is excellent but lacking one star as my bottle is leaking at the sprayer - a forgivable issue had I not paid so much for the product.</li>
            <li> This lotion also has a nice lavender scent</li>
            <li> The opinions I have expressed are my own.</li>
            <li> The opinions I have expressed are my own.</li>
            <li> Smells nice.</li>
            <li> Really liked the lotion, but the dispenser mechanism sprays like a garden hose out of control.</li>
            <li> The opinions I have expressed are my own.</li>
            <li> The opinions I have expressed are my own.</li>
            <li> I also find the smell to be pleasant and very mild.</li>
            <li> It sprays on and ribs in very easily.  </li>
            <li> But extremely easy to apply!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply - gets the job done and safe!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, light texture, provides good protection from the sun.</li>
            <li> I get around this by just spraying onto my hand and rubbing it in, which is probably ensures better coverage anyways.</li>
            <li> Never was able to use the product because it arrived split all over the box.</li>
            <li> There are many better sunscreen out there and for one:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the applicator pump as well.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars instead of five because it is more of a pump than a spray so you still have to rub it in.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I have an allergy to something in most sunscreens but this one doesn&#x27;t bother my skin at all.</li>
            <li> I thought there would be more coverage</li>
            <li> so that might be more in line with my expectations.</li>
            <li> It served its purpose:-)</li>
            <li> Most importantly it is non toxic and won&#x27;t harm my boys!</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this because it was recommended to have safe ingredients.</li>
            <li> Love it for the beach.</li>
            <li> I knew I had to find something better.</li>
            <li> Most of them feel sticky and tacky while you are wearing them.  </li>
            <li> is what we love about it:&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this...</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Not greasy, nice light scent.  </li>
            <li> My favorite sunscreen, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot.</li>
            <li> I love that it squirts on, as opposed to a spray.</li>
            <li> Sunscreen is good but the pump broke on first use.  </li>
            <li> My favorite and easy to apply in kids.</li>
            <li> It sprays and rubs in more easily than a cream sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product and one I have recommended to many people interested in switching to an all natural sunscreen.</li>
            <li> so I put it to the test right away and love it!</li>
            <li> We are starting into August in Texas and not one sun burn for my very fair complexion child.</li>
            <li> The have partnered with the Environmental Working Group which is huge, so the chemicals they put in their products are about as safe as you can get.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Regardless of the name \\&quot;Kids Natural Sunscreen\\&quot;, it is great for adults.</li>
            <li> Its great stuff.prob need to buy 2 at a time.my 4 yr old</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and has a nice, mild scent.</li>
            <li> I have tried many, many, natural sunscreens, but this is the best one by far.  </li>
            <li> but I received a full replacement bottle - thank you!  </li>
            <li> Sprays on easily and rubs in just as easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to spray on and spread.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and my kids never got a sunburn all summer.  </li>
            <li> This product goes on so easy.  </li>
            <li> it spreads so easily and my kids don&#x27;t get burned.</li>
            <li> It spreads easily and smells fine.</li>
            <li> Even when in a spray bottle with a fine mister the sunblock dribbled out.</li>
            <li> I have used many all natural sunscreens and I absolutely LOVE THIS ONE!</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t get burned, but I was so scared that I didn&#x27;t really enjoy myself.  </li>
            <li> The lotion glides on smoothly.</li>
            <li> The lotion glides on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Any light breeze during the day</li>
            <li> This is much easier to put on than the others I have tried and it smells nice.  </li>
            <li> The spray bottle is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Also, I have done research on this company and they are fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Have to see if I can find another nozzle that will fit or else</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s our \\&quot;go-to\\&quot; sunscreen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low-value free gift from the manufacturer for posting this review.</li>
            <li> Yes, costs a bit more, but completely worth it.  </li>
            <li> I will receive a low-value free gift from the manufacturer for posting this review.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fabulous.  </li>
            <li> : I will receive a low-value free gift from the manufacturer for posting this review.</li>
            <li> I was comfortable putting this on myself and my kids.</li>
            <li> It works, doesn&#x27;t irritate their sensitive skin and as a parent, I feel good about its ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Good stuff for kids with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily when trying to do it quickly at the pool.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to apply and run in.</li>
            <li> Super easy to apply.</li>
            <li> super easy to use</li>
            <li> We try to buy eco- and kid friendly sunscreen any time we can and we had to get something we can spray for summer</li>
            <li> I just used this sunscreen for the first time on myself and my child and just love it.</li>
            <li> Before buying my 3rd bottle, I again value shopped, and it remains the best value by far for the zinc and titanium blockers.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is by far the best I have tried on my children, who have multiple chemical sensitivities.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, I feel like it works better than our standard Banana Boat - thicker sunscreen</li>
            <li> The spray nozzle helped with application and it rubbed in much better than most natural sunscreens.</li>
            <li> The treatment area is frequently exposed to the sun and for the treatment to be effective there can be no tanning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Kids Natural Sunscreen for 2 years and it has been 100% effective for me.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a true *spray* bottle.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this sunscreen.....</li>
            <li> Best application in all natural products- not thick and goes on clear</li>
            <li> The thing I love most though, is that it does not go on white.  </li>
            <li> The spray makes it super easy to apply: I spray it into my palm and apply where wanted ~ no tube squeezing or pouring too much.</li>
            <li> It is NOT an aerosol spray which is another great plus (less inhalation risk).</li>
            <li> It has never failed me!</li>
            <li> Love this so far!</li>
            <li> We rolled again with the punches, but once the entire desired area was covered, we realized our child looked like a ghost and smelled of lavender, and you better like lavender because it was really strong</li>
            <li> I have been recently looking for more natural products and this was highly rated by the EWG as being non-toxic and very effective sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Spray pump is really convenient too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low-value free gift from the manufacturer for posting this review.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried many natural sunscreen&#x27;s and this one is by far our favorite.</li>
            <li> My favorite sunscreen for my kids so far.</li>
            <li> right?  </li>
            <li> My son burns very easily, and this is the only sunscreen he will use now.  </li>
            <li> Compared to other natural sunscreens, this lotion absorbs really well and has done a great job keeping my family free of sunburns.</li>
            <li> love the natural formulation and it&#x27;s very highly rate on EWG</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product since it&#x27;s all natural</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was great on our cruise, when we were outside for short time periods.</li>
            <li> All natural sun protection using zinc in a easy to use and apply spray container.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to spray and rub in, no harsh odor and not greasy.</li>
            <li> According to the label, the product is a non-GMO and reef safe sheer mineral lotion comprised of 6% Zinc Oxide and 6.4% Titanium Dioxide with organics AloeVera, Glycerin, GlycineSoja</li>
            <li> , I felt it was worth mentioning just how much we dislike it.  </li>
            <li> It does have a very white residue when applied, which I am ok with.</li>
            <li> We love this sun cream for our entire family.</li>
            <li> only reef safe /</li>
            <li> But this product does not leave the skin really white like most.</li>
            <li> where the sun was hot as could be and no one got sunburned.  </li>
            <li> My kids (ages 9 and 8) apply it themselves to places they can reach, and I do their faces, ears, back of neck...</li>
            <li> He will wear this sunscreen with no problem, which makes my life so much easier!  </li>
            <li> Use it in small amounts and rub it in good to make sure you don&#x27;t turn white.</li>
            <li> Good chemical free option but leaves a greasy film behind.</li>
            <li> He is extremely fair, with platinum blonde hair and blue eyes.</li>
            <li> I was not required or compelled to write a positive review.</li>

            <li> TiOxide- Zinc Oxide sun lotion that actually spreads easily.</li>
            <li> My children not only don&#x27;t break out at all with this product, but it wears well and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> What is even better is that my kids did not sustain a single sunburn all summer.</li>
            <li> Certainly, the application procedure needs to be defined individually.advertent lotion extraction.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not clogged, it squirts streams and certainly doesn&#x27;t come out as an even spray.  </li>
            <li> The one by the lake is frequently used by myself and guests and the 3rd bottle was ordered so to have 2 at the lake and be sure a supply is consistently available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is a great product protect in that sense, but it&#x27;s very hard to put on.</li>
            <li> What little bit that was salvaged seemed to be nice.  </li>
            <li> The other thing that&#x27;s great is the price--less than twenty dollars for an 8oz container is a steal, especially when you look at other popular mineral sunscreen brands for kids, most of which sell only 3oz for the same price.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t spray in a mist, just a straight stream, but it&#x27;s a lot easier than squeezing a bottle.  </li>
            <li> My grandson&#x27;s heavier self-application can leave a white trace and he&#x27;s comfortable having the product on his skin.</li>
            <li> My grandson&#x27;s heavier self-application can leave a white trace and he&#x27;s comfortable having the product on his skin.</li>
            <li> This one is so unusual though</li>
            <li> So now it had to be spread; so much for convenience and saving time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and we walked &amp;#34;around the world&amp;#34; at Epcot (an area notorious for being very sunny without a lot of shade).</li>
            <li> It does not produce a wide spray, more like a string of sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I use it for the whole family and has worked well for all of us.</li>
            <li> It goes on very well.</li>
            <li> All in all this is our go-to sunscreen now for the whole family.</li>
            <li> It stays on really well and sprays well without all that aerosol junk to inhale.</li>
            <li> The spray is not aerosol type so the concerns related to inhaling the sunscreen is not pertinent and it rubs on smooth.</li>
            <li> Gets uaed up fast.</li>
            <li> It also has an herbal scent which both of my children really like.  </li>
            <li> Definitely be careful to make sure it&#x27;s in the &amp;#34;off position&amp;#34; before putting it in your purse or diaper bag.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done a lot of research and comparisons of the right sunscreen for my 16 month old son.</li>
            <li> Only reason for rating it a 4 vs. 5 is it is quite higher in price but still worth it.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen does not leave that heavy residue on the skin, it is by far my most favorite that we&#x27;ve used, and I love that it is natural and organic plant based without the harsh chemicals!</li>
            <li> It seems as if we have tried every single natural sunscreen that has been in the top 100 list of the EWG website.</li>
            <li> The level of protection seemed fine while dry.</li>
            <li> I noticed when my husband would use the typical spray sunblock the odor after spraying it would be an overwhelming chemical smell.</li>
            <li> and I will most likely buy again unless I can find an alternative that actually sprays.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway - Based on the fact that I have tried so many different kinds I have to say that this is THE one we keep going back to because it works</li>
            <li> Sprays on nicely and easy to rub in to small, active toddlers.</li>
            <li> I find the Goddess Garden spray sunscreen to be thinner than other non-chemical formulas; it&#x27;s easy to spread and my kids don&#x27;t end up looking ghostly or goth.</li>
            <li> Even on a week long vacation in Mexico when he was in the extra hot sun 8+ hours a day he stayed burn free.</li>
            <li> I used to buy lots of different sunscreens depending on my family&#x27;s needs - waterproof, sweat proof, extra sensitive for children - this sunscreen covers all our bases and I really love having just ONE bottle for everyone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to rub in, whereas with other organic sunscreens we spend a long time rubbing it in, which meets with much kid resistance.  </li>
            <li> The lotion itself is fine, but the spray comes out like any other lotion that must be rubbed in.</li>
            <li> Most natural sunscreens leave a little film on the skin.  </li>
            <li> This pasty white girl of German and Irish heritage needs something a little more potent.</li>
            <li> It comes out a little runny so use it in an area where it can be cleaned easily.</li>
            <li> I received this sunscreen right before a long camping trip</li>
            <li> While this works fine as a sunscreen, there are a few things I&#x27;m not too fond of.</li>
            <li> Certainly, the application procedure needs to be defined individually.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a clear mist spray.</li>
            <li> All natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Very sticky and white.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used this a lot this summer for my 15 month old.</li>
            <li> Two hours at the pool, and children were completely protected with just one application.&lt;br</li>
            <li> His sensitive skin didn&#x27;t have any reaction to the natural plant based sun screen.</li>
            <li> I read aother revies and ao I as adult use it too.</li>
            <li> and so far works well</li>
            <li> I still wasn&#x27;t satisfied that I got every part of their body because it&#x27;s so thick</li>
            <li> It goes on so much easier than many of the thick white options out there.</li>
            <li> I got my first bottle from Whole Foods, loved it and find it&#x27;s less expensive on Amazon.</li>
            <li> seems to mean better coverage - who knew?</li>
            <li> I thought this would be really easy for my kids to apply, but it was messy!  </li>
            <li> It sprays on easily without mess or fuss or turning white.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because it was supposed to be easy to apply via the spray feature but after several uses, the spray was clogged and messy.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic product for applying sunscreen to small kids.</li>
            <li> The sprayer does get clogged but a few quick pumps sorts that out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-rubs on easily (despite the fact that it is quite thick and pasty)&lt;br /&gt;-fabulous sun protection (never once have we had a sunburn with this)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Burnout KIDS Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Spf 30 by BurnOut which I also have for out of school use:&lt;br</li>
            <li> And it rubs in soooo much easier than a lot of other natural sunblocks.</li>
            <li> This is my first natural sunscreen product and you can see it a little</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s generally out 2-4 hours in the sand, water and boat on one application.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s generally out 2-4 hours in the sand, water and boat on one application.  </li>
            <li> It takes a second to soak in and then it is clear.  </li>
            <li> The 3rd bottle has a clearly marked expiration date of 5/15.</li>

            <li> I might go back to the cream as the spray wasn&#x27;t exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> very active 16 month old boy) was MUCH EASIER than lotion from a tub or bottle.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t spray it directly on the body part you want to cover, or it makes a mess.  </li>
            <li> And I love that it&#x27;s not full of harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> This product is more expensive than other natural sunscreens I&#x27;ve used, but it worked really well.</li>
            <li> but it does come out white and in a stream (all because its a natural zinc oxide lotion) spray lotions that you buy that leave no color on the skin have chemicals that&#x27;s why there&#x27;s no white residue.</li>
            <li> And all natural as well and the bottle has lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> Looks a little white at first, but then absorbs and is colorless.</li>
            <li> First off, it is extremely greasy, so much so my daughter&#x27;s hair becomes matted at the slightest touch of this stuff and it leaves the skin extremely slick.</li>
            <li> The consistency is thin and easy to spread.</li>
            <li> It sprays well and the formula is thin enough to spread easily and is not overly white and chalky on the skin once rubbed in.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant smell, is not greasy, stays on for a long time, and doesn&#x27;t have the bad chemicals that are supposed to be avoided.</li>
            <li> for the sunscreen, my child swears that this one burns his little face when no other natural sunscreen I try to put on him evokes the same reaction.  </li>
            <li> If they were a little older, I would see how it does, but I can&#x27;t deal with a burnt baby.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of using sunscreen made with just zinc and titanium active ingredients but by 20 month old does not sit still.  </li>
            <li> They just need to stand up in the tub for a short moment and you can see grey streaks on them where we missed SCRUBBING this stuff off them and the dirt has stuck to them.  </li>
            <li> Hate the white residue, but overall a good product.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen feels dry and incredibly sheer.  </li>
            <li> Some of them are great, others are okay, a few of them are terrible and almost all of them are ridiculously expensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t apply it early enough you might leave an oil slick in the pool.</li>
            <li> And it takes long to rub in.</li>
            <li> This product definitely did NOT provide &amp;#34;40 minutes of water resistance.&amp;#34; After 25 minutes in the pool, my kids were pink.</li>
            <li> Applying this sunscreen to a squirmy monkey (read:</li>
            <li> : the spray is a little messy when you first put it on, so be careful to hold the sprayer close to your skin to avoid drips.</li>
            <li> This product might create health concerns for boys due to the inclusion of the essential oil, lavender.  </li>
            <li> The bottle lasts a very long time.  </li>
            <li> But this is a very minor inconvenience for the all-natural protection that this product provides.</li>
            <li> The label directs to apply it every 2 hours, or after 40 minutes of swimming or sweating, or after toweling dry.</li>

            <li> You cannot blended in so you end up having either white looking skin or my daughters dark skin</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s basically like thinner sunscreen that directly sprays one small area</li>
            <li> The pump dispenser is leaky and the lotion is pretty thin.</li>
            <li> least, they don&#x27;t pretend it sprays; it doesn&#x27;t streak and spreads evenly and clear; it is actually eco-friendly and no nanoparticles among other things.  </li>
            <li> but I was not pleased with the white residue that was left on my children&#x27;s skin as well as their clothing (it didn&#x27;t come out when washed either).</li>
            <li> Lastly, there is really no good reason for there to be a trigger on this because the sunscreen just blobs out of it, there is no spraying action to speak of.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll stick with Blue Lizard for now, until I can get a hold of something a little thinner that works.</li>
            <li> The container makes it hard to spray directly onto the body.</li>
            <li> I was using this for my baby and 4 year old on the beach, so the little pale coat gives me security that their covered well.  </li>
            <li> Not even a hint of pink on their skin.</li>
            <li> Not much use since it&#x27;s a spray sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> The trigger has stopped working on us after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> and he&#x27;s never gotten the slightest bit pink.</li>
            <li> We reapplied only a few times each day and he never burned.</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve found many natural sunscreens are difficult to rub in and leave a heavy white zinc coverage behind.</li>
            <li> and I do find myself going for other sunscreens we have in the house because they are less mess and dispense properly.</li>
            <li> that wasn&#x27;t annoying enough, we found out it dries out too quickly to spread evenly and made streaks with white jagged edges.  </li>

            <li> He thinks that is embarassing in front of other kids.  </li>
            <li> It was in a separate, waterproof bag so it didn&#x27;t leak into other things</li>
            <li> The pump does send out a stream of lotion, but it must be rubbed in like any other lotion.  </li>
            <li> Only complaint is the squirt bottle tends to get clogged up every few applications with dried sunscreen, but we simply wipe it off and it works again.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that a lot of it leaked in the package.</li>
            <li> It sprays about a 3 foot wide circle that gets on everything so half the lotion is wasted.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the packaging fool you though--- any bottle that you can turn upside down</li>
            <li> It just allows you to squirt it out without turning it upside down, if that makes any sense.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> I have since wiped my car down with water, soap and vinegar, all with no luck of getting all of this off of the black leather.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It sprays on easily without mess or fuss or turning white.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is great. The convenience of a spray bottle without the concern of kids breathing in aerosol particles. And all natural as well and the bottle has lasted a long time. Just ordered my second to get two kids through the summer.</li>
            <li> I like that this is a spray.  It doesn&#x27;t spray in a mist, just a straight stream, but it&#x27;s a lot easier than squeezing a bottle.  The problem is that it rubbed in totally.  Most natural sunscreens leave a little film on the skin.  I was using this for my baby and 4 year old on the beach, so the little pale coat gives me security that their covered well.  With this I couldn&#x27;t tell.  It rubs in totally and dries all the way, so you can&#x27;t feel it either.  I didn&#x27;t know if I had put enough on, so I had to recoat them every 30 minutes or so.  They didn&#x27;t get burned, but I was so scared that I didn&#x27;t really enjoy myself.  I don&#x27;t know that one coat would have done the trick, and It was to risky to test it.  I&#x27;ll probably try something different next time.  If they were a little older, I would see how it does, but I can&#x27;t deal with a burnt baby.</li>
            <li> A skin conditions requires me to have periodic laser treatments. The treatment area is frequently exposed to the sun and for the treatment to be effective there can be no tanning. I&#x27;ve found the chemical blockers insufficient and choose not to apply chemicals unnecessarily. I&#x27;ve been using Kids Natural Sunscreen for 2 years and it has been 100% effective for me. This bottle is the 3rd I&#x27;ve purchased. Of the 1st 2, one is at home and another at a lake cottage. There has been no problem with product \\&quot;aging\\&quot;. Based on a number on the bottom, I believe the expiration is 4/14. The 3rd bottle has a clearly marked expiration date of 5/15. The one by the lake is frequently used by myself and guests and the 3rd bottle was ordered so to have 2 at the lake and be sure a supply is consistently available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of the name \\&quot;Kids Natural Sunscreen\\&quot;, it is great for adults. Before buying my 3rd bottle, I again value shopped, and it remains the best value by far for the zinc and titanium blockers. According to the label, the product is a non-GMO and reef safe sheer mineral lotion comprised of 6% Zinc Oxide and 6.4% Titanium Dioxide with organics AloeVera, Glycerin, GlycineSoja (Soybean) Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil. Other ingredients are Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Gluconolactone, LavandulaAngustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Ionicera Caprifolium (Honeysuckle) Extract,Ionicera Japonica (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Polyhydroxystearic Acid,Populus Tremuloides (Aspen) Bark Extract, Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, StearicAcid, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Xanthan Gum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my use, I apply it before going outside and only once per day. Washing to remove it results in no residual trace of the product and my laser surgeon finds no trace of tan where the product has been applied on my skin. The spray makes it super easy to apply: I spray it into my palm and apply where wanted ~ no tube squeezing or pouring too much. The spray has an on/off tab preventing inadvertent lotion extraction. The lotion glides on smoothly. My manner of application leaves no visible sign of the lotion and I do not feel it on my skin. My grandson&#x27;s heavier self-application can leave a white trace and he&#x27;s comfortable having the product on his skin. He&#x27;s generally out 2-4 hours in the sand, water and boat on one application.  The label directs to apply it every 2 hours, or after 40 minutes of swimming or sweating, or after toweling dry. Certainly, the application procedure needs to be defined individually.advertent lotion extraction. The lotion glides on smoothly.

            <li> I received this sunscreen right before a long camping trip so I put it to the test right away and love it! The kids are well protected even when swimming all day (after reapplying as needed). I also used it myself and had great results! This is my first natural sunscreen product and you can see it a little but I don&#x27;t mind that in exchange for knowing I am not putting chemicals on my or my kids skin!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product since it&#x27;s all natural and it&#x27;s the only product in this type of spray bottle.  Don&#x27;t let the packaging fool you though--- any bottle that you can turn upside down applies just like this one.  This isn&#x27;t a true *spray* bottle.  It just allows you to squirt it out without turning it upside down, if that makes any sense.&lt;br /&gt;As for the sunscreen, my child swears that this one burns his little face when no other natural sunscreen I try to put on him evokes the same reaction.  AND the kids become dirt magnets with this on them!  Any light breeze during the day and they have dirt stuck to where ever this sunscreen is on their bodies.  It&#x27;s impossible to wash off too.  We let them play in the tub at night and wash them with a washcloth.  They just need to stand up in the tub for a short moment and you can see grey streaks on them where we missed SCRUBBING this stuff off them and the dirt has stuck to them.  It&#x27;s disgusting.  I don&#x27;t usually review sunscreen because I usually find it works and there are no problems.  This one is so unusual though, I felt it was worth mentioning just how much we dislike it.  For my husband to notice how adhesive it is, it must be pretty bad!</li>
            <li> I thought this would be really easy for my kids to apply, but it was messy!  The pump dispenser is leaky and the lotion is pretty thin.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed when I received this product. It did not spray at all but streamed out. The sunblock left the skin white &amp; didn&#x27;t rub in well. I tried putting the sunblock in a different spray container hoping the sprayer was the issue. It wasn&#x27;t. Even when in a spray bottle with a fine mister the sunblock dribbled out. This is not comparable to other spray sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Coverage is excellent but lacking one star as my bottle is leaking at the sprayer - a forgivable issue had I not paid so much for the product.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this sunscreen.....&lt;br /&gt;It was great on our cruise, when we were outside for short time periods. I don&#x27;t even have a problem with the spray nozzle.&lt;br /&gt;However, we used it yesterday at the beach. Now before you think, &#x27;well, you have to reapply&#x27;. We did almost every 1 1/2 hours!&lt;br /&gt;My kids got WAY too much sun for the amount of sunscreen we put on them! :( We&#x27;ll stick with Blue Lizard for now, until I can get a hold of something a little thinner that works. :/</li>
            <li> This was fairly nice sunscreen, ingredients wise.  I don&#x27;t see the point of having it in a spray bottle when it comes out just the same as it would if it were in a regular bottle.  It does have a very white residue when applied, which I am ok with.</li>
            <li> It works well as a sunblock. It comes out a little runny so use it in an area where it can be cleaned easily. No odor that would attract insects.</li>
            <li> The container makes it hard to spray directly onto the body. I get around this by just spraying onto my hand and rubbing it in, which is probably ensures better coverage anyways. It it a tad white, but it&#x27;s hard to get around that with the zinc.</li>
            <li> The very best on the market and the best money can buy.  Very happy to have sunscreen that is safe for my child.  It has never failed me!</li>
            <li> Never was able to use the product because it arrived split all over the box. What little bit that was salvaged seemed to be nice.  Very disappointing. I have pictures. It was a total loss.</li>
            <li> We try to buy eco- and kid friendly sunscreen any time we can and we had to get something we can spray for summer school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump clogs. Duh, you might say because of the zinc and titanium particles... We figured, they have a pump, so they figured out how to make it so it sprays, right?  Wrong.&lt;br /&gt;When it&#x27;s not clogged, it squirts streams and certainly doesn&#x27;t come out as an even spray.  So now it had to be spread; so much for convenience and saving time.&lt;br /&gt;If that wasn&#x27;t annoying enough, we found out it dries out too quickly to spread evenly and made streaks with white jagged edges.  Just perfect.  We rolled again with the punches, but once the entire desired area was covered, we realized our child looked like a ghost and smelled of lavender, and you better like lavender because it was really strong smelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One star because our child didn&#x27;t get sunburned when reapplied as directed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: The pump has to be a gimmick to sell the product which has no merit per se imo. There are many better sunscreen out there and for one:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burnout KIDS Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Spf 30 by BurnOut which I also have for out of school use:&lt;br /&gt;amzn.com/B0037AO682 (similar)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least, they don&#x27;t pretend it sprays; it doesn&#x27;t streak and spreads evenly and clear; it is actually eco-friendly and no nanoparticles among other things.  We&#x27;re never going back!</li>
            <li> I like this stuff a lot. Compared to other natural sunscreens, this lotion absorbs really well and has done a great job keeping my family free of sunburns. I used to buy lots of different sunscreens depending on my family&#x27;s needs - waterproof, sweat proof, extra sensitive for children - this sunscreen covers all our bases and I really love having just ONE bottle for everyone.</li>
            <li> Love this so far! It sprays well and the formula is thin enough to spread easily and is not overly white and chalky on the skin once rubbed in.</li>
            <li> We love this sun cream for our entire family. Love the applicator pump as well. Goes on easily when trying to do it quickly at the pool. And I love that it&#x27;s not full of harsh chemicals. A must  have.</li>
            <li> only reef safe / TiOxide- Zinc Oxide sun lotion that actually spreads easily.</li>
            <li> Sunscreen works great. Leaves an oily film on everything. It clogs my facial pores every time so I need a different product for my face.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of using sunscreen made with just zinc and titanium active ingredients but by 20 month old does not sit still.  This is much easier to put on than the others I have tried and it smells nice.  I gave it 4 stars instead of five because it is more of a pump than a spray so you still have to rub it in. It is also quite expensive.  That being said, it should last the summer and I will most likely buy again unless I can find an alternative that actually sprays.</li>
            <li> It is very thick and it&#x27;s so hard to rub in. You cannot blended in so you end up having either white looking skin or my daughters dark skin so she looks purple. And it takes long to rub in. This does protect you from the Sun this is a great product protect in that sense, but it&#x27;s very hard to put on. It took me about 15 minutes on each of my two children I still wasn&#x27;t satisfied that I got every part of their body because it&#x27;s so thick</li>
            <li> I purchased this because it was supposed to be easy to apply via the spray feature but after several uses, the spray was clogged and messy.  I usually end up applying it to my hands first and then onto skin.  Somewhat defeats the purpose of a spray.  However, I do like the product itself.  It has a pleasant smell, is not greasy, stays on for a long time, and doesn&#x27;t have the bad chemicals that are supposed to be avoided.</li>
            <li> I have used California Baby sunscreen in the past but I was not pleased with the white residue that was left on my children&#x27;s skin as well as their clothing (it didn&#x27;t come out when washed either). I decided to try this Goddess Garden product instead this summer and I LOVE it. It rubs in great without feeling sticky, or claylike. It doesn&#x27;t leave a white residue on their skin. What is even better is that my kids did not sustain a single sunburn all summer. We were in Disney in June; it was 98 degrees and we walked &amp;#34;around the world&amp;#34; at Epcot (an area notorious for being very sunny without a lot of shade). Not even a hint of pink on their skin. I reapply every 2-3 hours or after being in water.  The squirt bottle has help up awesome without breakage or clogging. This lotion also has a nice lavender scent so I have also found it helps keep bugs away as well.  Excellent product and one I have recommended to many people interested in switching to an all natural sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This works well. I have an allergy to something in most sunscreens but this one doesn&#x27;t bother my skin at all. It spreads easily and smells fine.</li>
            <li> Smells like lavender! My toddler actually looks forward to getting sprayed by this SPF. It does leave a bit of an white/opaque tint on the skin after application but that doesn&#x27;t bother me. My kid likes it and it works!</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is by far the best I have tried on my children, who have multiple chemical sensitivities.  My children not only don&#x27;t break out at all with this product, but it wears well and is easy to apply. The spray bottle is fantastic.  Also, I have done research on this company and they are fantastic.  The have partnered with the Environmental Working Group which is huge, so the chemicals they put in their products are about as safe as you can get.  I got my first bottle from Whole Foods, loved it and find it&#x27;s less expensive on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good price and item. When I received this item it was a total messsssss!! Everything spilled all over, I was not happy at all.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! All natural sun protection using zinc in a easy to use and apply spray container. Sprays on easily and rubs in just as easily.</li>
            <li> It would be great if the spray worked.  Not much use since it&#x27;s a spray sunscreen.  Have to see if I can find another nozzle that will fit or else I&#x27;ve wasted a lot of sunscreen that can&#x27;t be used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Revised: June 13/14&lt;br /&gt;I e-mailed customer service and they mailed out a replacement.  I only asked for a replacement spray nozzle but I received a full replacement bottle - thank you!  Now that I&#x27;ve had a chance to try the sunscreen, here are my findings:&lt;br /&gt;1. great value as you get quite a bit of sunscreen for the cost&lt;br /&gt;2. love the natural formulation and it&#x27;s very highly rate on EWG&lt;br /&gt;3. I might go back to the cream as the spray wasn&#x27;t exactly what I expected.  I thought there would be more coverage but it&#x27;s basically like thinner sunscreen that directly sprays one small area and you have to rub it to get it to spread it around.  I haven&#x27;t tried the continuous spray option yet so that might be more in line with my expectations.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s super easy to apply and run in. We are starting into August in Texas and not one sun burn for my very fair complexion child.</li>
            <li> Protects, but it goes on reeeeeal think and white. It does not produce a wide spray, more like a string of sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen! I have used 2 bottles already this summer. Compared to the Badger brand, I find that this one goes on a lot easier. The consistency is thin and easy to spread. I would definitely recommend this sunscreen to anyone looking for a non-toxic alternative to traditional sunscreens.</li>
            <li> I find the Goddess Garden spray sunscreen to be thinner than other non-chemical formulas; it&#x27;s easy to spread and my kids don&#x27;t end up looking ghostly or goth. It&#x27;s our \\&quot;go-to\\&quot; sunscreen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low-value free gift from the manufacturer for posting this review.

            <li> This sunscreen is great. I use it for the whole family and has worked well for all of us. It goes on very well. The sprayer does get clogged but a few quick pumps sorts that out.</li>
            <li> Best organic sunscreen I have found!! It is not greasy and it rubs in great. It is NOT an aerosol spray which is another great plus (less inhalation risk). I also find the smell to be pleasant and very mild.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried many natural sunscreen&#x27;s and this one is by far our favorite. It goes on so much easier than many of the thick white options out there. We reply often so I don&#x27;t trust anything for hours upon hours of protection while in the water.  Only complaint is the squirt bottle tends to get clogged up every few applications with dried sunscreen, but we simply wipe it off and it works again.  Not the same performance as an arosol spray, but you also don&#x27;t have to worry about breathing in the chemicals.  All in all this is our go-to sunscreen now for the whole family.</li>
            <li> This product might create health concerns for boys due to the inclusion of the essential oil, lavender.  For information on some of the potential serious side effects, please see the report from the National Institute of Health on the issue:&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> I like the bigger size bottle and the lavender smells. My kids are happy to apply sunscreen themselves on it is in a spray bottle.</li>
            <li> Kids always complain sunscreen &amp;#34;makes them sweat&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;itchy&amp;#34;.  Finally found one that my kids will let me apply without complaint!  It works, doesn&#x27;t irritate their sensitive skin and as a parent, I feel good about its ingredients.  Yes, costs a bit more, but completely worth it.  The bottle lasts a very long time.  The spray is a bit messy upon application so I apply in the garage or outside to avoid drops of sunscreen on the floor inside.&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low-value free gift from the manufacturer for posting this review.

            <li> great sunscreen. I use it every day on my arms, chest, face. Looks a little white at first, but then absorbs and is colorless. Non greasy and smells faintly of lavender at first. Protects well--important to me as I&#x27;ve had skin cancer. All natural ingredients. We&#x27;ll be friends for life.</li>
            <li> Good stuff for kids with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply - gets the job done and safe! Note that you do just spray onto the skin or on your hand and then rub it in. Fantastic product for applying sunscreen to small kids.</li>
            <li> Easy to spray on and spread. It served its purpose:-)</li>
            <li> Very sticky and white.  Great for kids but not for adults.</li>
            <li> It takes some rubbing in, but it does a great job!  Honestly, I feel like it works better than our standard Banana Boat - thicker sunscreen seems to mean better coverage - who knew?</li>
            <li> Hate the white residue, but overall a good product.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.  It is easy to apply and my kids never got a sunburn all summer.  It also smells very nice.  Most importantly it is non toxic and won&#x27;t harm my boys!</li>
            <li> Sunscreen is good but the pump broke on first use.  very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen.  It sprays on and ribs in very easily.  Great protection.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because it was recommended to have safe ingredients. While this works fine as a sunscreen, there are a few things I&#x27;m not too fond of. First off, it is extremely greasy, so much so my daughter&#x27;s hair becomes matted at the slightest touch of this stuff and it leaves the skin extremely slick. It basically has stained the leather in my car; I had sprayed some (I&#x27;m not sure if &amp;#34;spray&amp;#34; is the verb I&#x27;d use) on my daughter and it got everywhere. I have since wiped my car down with water, soap and vinegar, all with no luck of getting all of this off of the black leather. Lastly, there is really no good reason for there to be a trigger on this because the sunscreen just blobs out of it, there is no spraying action to speak of. Maybe I got a bad batch? Not sure, but I won&#x27;t spend my money on it again.</li>
            <li> This product goes on so easy.  Love it for the beach.</li>
            <li> I have used many all natural sunscreens and I absolutely LOVE THIS ONE! It is a spray lotion but it does come out white and in a stream (all because its a natural zinc oxide lotion) spray lotions that you buy that leave no color on the skin have chemicals that&#x27;s why there&#x27;s no white residue. Any zinc oxide lotion will be white. But this product does not leave the skin really white like most. Holds up extremely well while swimming at the beach etc. best sunscreen!!! Super easy to apply. You do have to rub it in as well. But extremely easy to apply!</li>
            <li> It stays on really well and sprays well without all that aerosol junk to inhale. And it rubs in soooo much easier than a lot of other natural sunblocks. I don&#x27;t know where this has been all my life, but I will not go back!</li>
            <li> Almost-albino proof! My son burns very easily, and this is the only sunscreen he will use now.  It&#x27;s fabulous.  Keeps him covered.  Doesn&#x27;t destroy or stain his clothes.  I accidentally lost a bottle in Orlando at a pool and mourned the loss.  This is our second purchase, and all I can say is our home will never be without it again!</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of the Kids spray but they changed their packaging this year. The trigger has stopped working on us after only a few uses. When you squeeze it basically collapses.</li>
            <li> This is the only brand of sunscreen I&#x27;ve used on my son and he&#x27;s never had a burn in his life (started at 6 months, now he&#x27;s 3.) I think it rubs it well compared to other mineral sunscreens--he isn&#x27;t running around looking like a ghost. And it lasts! I reapply every 2 hours and he&#x27;s never gotten the slightest bit pink. Even on a week long vacation in Mexico when he was in the extra hot sun 8+ hours a day he stayed burn free. The other thing that&#x27;s great is the price--less than twenty dollars for an 8oz container is a steal, especially when you look at other popular mineral sunscreen brands for kids, most of which sell only 3oz for the same price.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, light texture, provides good protection from the sun. Use it on my kids. and myself.</li>
            <li> Great product---I bought this and so did my daughter-in-law (for her baby).  We just returned from Orlando, Fl. where the sun was hot as could be and no one got sunburned.  Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> The ease of applying this helped me improve at keeping my kids covered in sunscreen daily. Not only does the non-aerosol spray bottle help, but also the liquidity of the lotion. It&#x27;s very easy to rub in, whereas with other organic sunscreens we spend a long time rubbing it in, which meets with much kid resistance.  This product definitely did NOT provide &amp;#34;40 minutes of water resistance.&amp;#34; After 25 minutes in the pool, my kids were pink. The level of protection seemed fine while dry.</li>
            <li> I just used this sunscreen for the first time on myself and my child and just love it. It&#x27;s easy to spray and rub in, no harsh odor and not greasy. I have been recently looking for more natural products and this was highly rated by the EWG as being non-toxic and very effective sunscreen. I noticed when my husband would use the typical spray sunblock the odor after spraying it would be an overwhelming chemical smell. I knew I had to find something better. This is it, just ordered my second bottle for our upcoming vacation.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re outside all the time at home.  We keep a bottle of this by the back door and use it whenever we&#x27;re going to be outside playing, or working in the garden, etc.  My kids (ages 9 and 8) apply it themselves to places they can reach, and I do their faces, ears, back of neck...we spray it into our hands, then rub them together and apply like a regular lotion.  You really can&#x27;t spray it directly on the body part you want to cover, or it makes a mess.  But this is a very minor inconvenience for the all-natural protection that this product provides.</li>
            <li> My favorite and easy to apply in kids. Best application in all natural products- not thick and goes on clear</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used this a lot this summer for my 15 month old. It seems to protect her from the sun well. Unfortunately the pump on the bottle has not been pumping properly and appears to get stuck. This is an inconvenience and I do find myself going for other sunscreens we have in the house because they are less mess and dispense properly.</li>
            <li> This product is more expensive than other natural sunscreens I&#x27;ve used, but it worked really well. The spray nozzle helped with application and it rubbed in much better than most natural sunscreens. Two hours at the pool, and children were completely protected with just one application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note: the spray is a little messy when you first put it on, so be careful to hold the sprayer close to your skin to avoid drips.</li>
            <li> Terrible! Leaves a white slime on the skin that won&#x27;t come off!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done a lot of research and comparisons of the right sunscreen for my 16 month old son. He is extremely fair, with platinum blonde hair and blue eyes. We used this sunscreen on a 2 week vacation to HI and I was more than impressed. His sensitive skin didn&#x27;t have any reaction to the natural plant based sun screen. We reapplied only a few times each day and he never burned. The spray is not aerosol type so the concerns related to inhaling the sunscreen is not pertinent and it rubs on smooth. Applying this sunscreen to a squirmy monkey (read: very active 16 month old boy) was MUCH EASIER than lotion from a tub or bottle. In the past I&#x27;ve found many natural sunscreens are difficult to rub in and leave a heavy white zinc coverage behind. This sunscreen does not leave that heavy residue on the skin, it is by far my most favorite that we&#x27;ve used, and I love that it is natural and organic plant based without the harsh chemicals!</li>
            <li> Good chemical free option but leaves a greasy film behind. If you don&#x27;t apply it early enough you might leave an oil slick in the pool. Smells nice. Application is no different than a traditional lotion since the trigger shoots a stream not a mist.</li>
            <li> Good sun protection. As non-toxic as possible, though check the ingredient list if you have allergies to some botanical extracts.</li>
            <li> The sprayer was broken when i received the item. The sunblock hardly comes out. When it&#x27;s on the body it leaves a blue tint. Would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Really liked the lotion, but the dispenser mechanism sprays like a garden hose out of control. I had to put it on outside in the grass. It sprays about a 3 foot wide circle that gets on everything so half the lotion is wasted. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again solely because of the poor spray mechanism. Otherwise the lotion works and rubs in well enough.</li>
            <li> Gets uaed up fast.I read aother revies and ao I as adult use it too.I combine drop of water and my neutrogena spf amd it rubs in nicely.my 50yrold wrinkled skin can look icky the product does stay in little wrinkles lol.I dont mind. Its great stuff.prob need to buy 2 at a time.my 4 yr old and I are out daily.</li>
            <li> I have tried many, many, natural sunscreens, but this is the best one by far.  Most of them feel sticky and tacky while you are wearing them.  Really awful.  This sunscreen feels dry and incredibly sheer.  You don&#x27;t even know you&#x27;re wearing it.  The thing I love most though, is that it does not go on white.  It takes a second to soak in and then it is clear.  My son fights with me about wearing sunblock because he does not like how it makes him look white, especially on his face.  He thinks that is embarassing in front of other kids.  He will wear this sunscreen with no problem, which makes my life so much easier!  It also has an herbal scent which both of my children really like.  Spray pump is really convenient too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low-value free gift from the manufacturer for posting this review.

            <li> super easy to use and so far works well</li>
            <li> It seems as if we have tried every single natural sunscreen that has been in the top 100 list of the EWG website. Some of them are great, others are okay, a few of them are terrible and almost all of them are ridiculously expensive.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway - Based on the fact that I have tried so many different kinds I have to say that this is THE one we keep going back to because it works great.&lt;br /&gt;Here is what we love about it:&lt;br /&gt;-smells great&lt;br /&gt;-great ratings on EWG for being a low hazard natural sunscreen&lt;br /&gt;-rubs on easily (despite the fact that it is quite thick and pasty)&lt;br /&gt;-fabulous sun protection (never once have we had a sunburn with this)</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Use it in small amounts and rub it in good to make sure you don&#x27;t turn white. We never burn when we use this!</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a clear mist spray. It&#x27;s white and I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love this... it spreads so easily and my kids don&#x27;t get burned. The trigger lock is clutch... it doesn&#x27;t slip off in a bag.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It sprays and rubs in more easily than a cream sunscreen.  Not greasy, nice light scent.  I use it myself and recommend it for my patients!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low-value free gift from the manufacturer for posting this review.

            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky and doesn&#x27;t seem to burn the eyes.  My favorite sunscreen for my kids so far.</li>
            <li> Although pricey, this product is great that it doesn&#x27;t have the toxic ingredients in it that others do and it comes in a spray.  Only reason for rating it a 4 vs. 5 is it is quite higher in price but still worth it.</li>
            <li> I was comfortable putting this on myself and my kids. No offending odor, non greasy feel. But I got sunburned. This pasty white girl of German and Irish heritage needs something a little more potent. And possibly a bigger sunhat.</li>
            <li> My favorite sunscreen, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot. I love that it squirts on, as opposed to a spray. It&#x27;s not greasy at all. It goes on smooth and has a nice, mild scent.</li>
            <li> Love the product! Sprays on nicely and easy to rub in to small, active toddlers. They haven&#x27;t had a sunburn or tanned at all since we started using it. My only complaint is that a lot of it leaked in the package. It was in a separate, waterproof bag so it didn&#x27;t leak into other things but it&#x27;s disappointing that so much of it leaked out of the bottle. Definitely be careful to make sure it&#x27;s in the &amp;#34;off position&amp;#34; before putting it in your purse or diaper bag.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a &amp;#34;spray&amp;#34; sunscreen, look elsewhere.  The pump does send out a stream of lotion, but it must be rubbed in like any other lotion.  The lotion itself is fine, but the spray comes out like any other lotion that must be rubbed in.</li>
