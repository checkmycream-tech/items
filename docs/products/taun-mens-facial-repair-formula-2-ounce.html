            <li>it a try if you are looking for a good anti-aging cream or just good moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, this product is undeniably a good skin cream.  </li>
            <li>Also loved the ingredients list...</li>
            <li>Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate is a very potent and stable form of vitamin c. Niacinamide is a form of vitamin b3.</li>

            <li>IT&#x27;s amazing.</li>

            <li>My hubby was already using and loving it</li>
            <li>regimen\\&quot; kind of guy</li>
            <li>/&gt;We would kindly ask that you remove or amend your review in the meantime as it is misleading and unfair.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been so impressed thus far</li>
            <li>I am now using it and loving it as well :)</li>
            <li>This four star rating, as mentioned above, is based on the fact that while I do think that this skin cream is very good, I do not think that it is $80 good.  </li>
            <li>It goes on lightly and easily, and indeed makes your skin feel good.  </li>
            <li>and you know you will want more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one thing for me to spout off the many benefits of Taun, but you have to try it to believe it.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are top of the line and the results are even better.</li>
            <li>I got it for my boyfriend because I noticed he was using my face cream a lot more often.</li>
            <li>Well, things have changed and now I am using HIS face cream a lot more often.</li>
            <li>TAUN has better ingredients on paper than stuff</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love them to make one for women</li>
            <li>My favorite is post-shaving.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to see 2 more</li>
            <li>all top shelf.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li>My face feels smoother and tighter and I&#x27;ll be buying some more.  </li>
            <li>I now apply a layer of virgin, cold-pressed coconut oil on top.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still the most comprehensive cream for men out there, with scientifically proven ingredients, and I&#x27;ve made it work for me.</li>
            <li>It really does make the skin on my face feel great.</li>
            <li>My skin looks even better.  </li>
            <li>This skin cream is definitely top of the line.</li>
            <li>So, at the beginning it just felt refreshing with no</li>
            <li>My skin is noticeably better from using it.  </li>
            <li>I bought this mostly to soothe my skin after shaving and to moisturize my skin after showering.  </li>
            <li>Loved it right away.  </li>
            <li>Easily the best men&#x27;s facial moisturizer on the market.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other face creams and in my opinion Taun is the best.  </li>
            <li>The anti-aging ingredients they&#x27;ve chosen are very powerful and I&#x27;ll be watching to make sure my skin doesn&#x27;t get irritated.</li>
            <li>/&gt;\\&quot;Thank you for trying out our Facial Repair Formula, we&#x27;re happy to hear you enjoyed it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re on the fence about Taun, I strongly encourage you to try it.</li>
            <li>would strongly recommend this product to any one.</li>
            <li>Seriously high quality product that delivers good result over time.</li>
            <li>Taun was the first product of its kind that I ever bought and user on my face.  </li>
            <li>If on the fence about this stuff, let me tell you, it is pricey, BUT, its pretty darn nice.</li>
            <li>and I was a little hesitant because of the price, but I went ahead with it and am very happy I did.  </li>
            <li>Taun has been a great addition to my daily routine.</li>
            <li>I must say, it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>TAUN is a great choice choice when it comes to facial cream.  </li>
            <li>We are happy to discuss this further if you&#x27;d like to email customer support, or through the Amazon messaging system.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not only is the product great</li>
            <li>it is indeed true that many of the reviews have been posted in good faith by real customers who were asked by the company to provide an Amazon review, and I have no reason to believe otherwise, then I retract my concern about certain reviews being made by sock accounts and upgrade my rating to four stars.  </li>
            <li>This product seems to do all it claims, it feels very fresh and not oily.  </li>
            <li>But, this stuff is very nice and almost instantly smooths your skin.</li>
            <li>Feels great on application, absorbs quickly and seems to provide enough moisture for the day.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny in my opinion!</li>
            <li>, er significant.</li>
            <li>After an application of TAUN my face feels clean and fresh!  </li>
            <li>Someone gently pointed out that when I smiled my wrinkles lasted longer than my smile.</li>
            <li>The product came highly recommended to me as \\&quot;way better than the cheap stuff bro, seriously\\&quot; -- and I must admit that&#x27;s an accurate assessment.  </li>
            <li>Have had my container for 3 weeks, use it every day, and still 3/4 full.  </li>
            <li>I was accustomed to, yet is actually, and surprisingly, cheaper.  </li>
            <li>I think the ingredient deck may not be true.</li>
            <li>I never knew that the skin on my face could actually feel good.</li>
            <li>So far I am loving how it feels on my skin</li>
            <li>If it were this price, then I would give it the full five stars.</li>
            <li>Keep your expectations realistic and you will be pleased.</li>
            <li>We asked many of our customers to provide reviews, these customers were not compensated in any manner and this is fully within Amazon&#x27;s normal practices.</li>
            <li>My skin feels great and look healthier and have been using this product for less than two</li>
            <li>My wife regularly mentions how much better my skin looks!</li>
            <li>I am okay to admit that I want something to help me stay looking young.  </li>
            <li>TAUN is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>A male friend who is somewhat more inclined than I (and your standard frog would be somewhat more inclined than I) to use a men&#x27;s moisturizer gifted me a cooly packaged jar of something called TAUN.</li>
            <li>This is why I do not feel that the product is worth the money.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to try this at first, but must admit, it goes on nicely, disappears quickly, yet feels like it&#x27;s protecting and enhancing my mug all day long.</li>
            <li>Not only did Taun reverse the effects of winter, but as a daily use product I have found my face and neck to be more healthy and smooth than ever before.  </li>
            <li>Another pleasant side effect is that I haven&#x27;t been getting the same cuts on my neck when shaving -- I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s a direct result of the product or the psychological effect of me treating my well-moisturized neck with more respect, but either way I&#x27;ll take it.  </li>
            <li>It is light, clean, and most importantly not greasy or oily.  </li>
            <li>that I figured it was worth sharing some positive feedback.  </li>
            <li>I like that it has no sent, and your skin just eats this stuff up, it absorbs very readily.</li>
            <li>Its like the first time I took a yoga class.</li>
            <li>Thanks Taun!</li>
            <li>Taun&#x27;s has not eliminated any wrinkles or lines, but it has made my face look smoother, and hopefully will help prevent more wrinkles in the future.</li>
            <li>Not only does it offer long term benefits, it feels great today.</li>
            <li>I have always pride myself for having good skin and generally look younger than my age</li>
            <li>If TAUN or TAUNING is not in the English dictionary,and I haven&#x27;t been able to find it, it should be.</li>
            <li>I suspect this because many of the 5-star reviewers have reviewed only this product.  </li>
            <li>When complaining out loud about this, a good friend erupted into a passionate sales pitch for Taun.</li>
            <li>As another reviewer pointed out, many of the \\&quot;reviews\\&quot; of this product are likely from sock accounts- accounts created by the seller for the express purpose of giving themselves positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s packed with supposedly good stuff - it contains several compounds such as retinol, peptides and esters hat are scientifically proven to help with aging skin.</li>
            <li>Along with regular chemical peels, and a good sunblock, Taun&#x27;s facial repair formula is an invaluable part of my skin care.</li>
            <li>I read some positive reviews of this product and there was some website where a guy used it for 3 months or something and took pictures</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think that I&#x27;d be able to tell the difference between Taun and the brand I normally buy at CVS, but I definitely have, both in the way that it feels and the results that I&#x27;ve gotten.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve switched back to using coconut oil as a moisturizer - greasy but easy.</li>
            <li>I am so impressed with this product that I am seriously considering submitting the word TAUN to the panel that recommends new word entries into the English lexicon.</li>
            <li>100%\\&quot; - Taun reduced the depth and visibility of my existing wrinkles and that is really all you can ask for in these types of products.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it !&lt;</li>
            <li>absolutely buy again!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am giving this 4 stars though because I think they may have tried to pack too much into one product.  </li>
            <li>rest of my face and neck feel very itchy and irritated after a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s dense and intense.</li>
            <li>Turns out it is really all he cracked it up to be.</li>
            <li>It is, however, slightly more oily than I expected, and does leave a bit of a shine.  </li>
            <li>We encourage you to contact Amazon - they will tell you these are all real accounts and real people.</li>
            <li>In addition, I&#x27;ve started using their renewal program which saves an additional 25% and is very convenient.</li>
            <li>This is not the silver bullet of anti-aging creams for men, especially those of us who have more sensitive</li>
            <li>Well worth the price and will definitely buy again, really like this product a lot!</li>
            <li>At first nearly indescernible, the benifit of the product manifest in a softness and smoothness noticeable to my wife and others.</li>
            <li>I have really started to notice a difference in my skin as well which I don&#x27;t think can be attributed to February in New York.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product to all guys, even those that don&#x27;t use moisturizer every day.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>If you need some something worth the coin and that works well without smelling like apple-cucumber-berry-tini, look no further men.</li>
            <li>am a guy who has never liked using any kind of moisturizers.</li>
            <li>I also feel that it will probably delay the onset of new wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>won&#x27;t make you live longer</li>
            <li>We are a new company, establishing our brand in the marketplace and on Amazon.</li>
            <li>A friend suggested I try this new product out</li>
            <li>but really I&#x27;m not sure they need to - this works just fine for me!</li>
            <li>As opposed to the other balms and lotions I have tried, this is a high quality, clean product that doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue on your hands or give your skin an unnatural shine.  </li>
            <li>A bit  pricey, but then...I only have one face ;-)</li>
            <li>Just got my first order of the Facial Repair Formula a couple days ago.  </li>
            <li>so much I&#x27;m actually writing my first ever Amazon review.</li>
            <li>Happily surprised to see Taun on Amazon!</li>
            <li>Absolutely no greasy residue whatsoever, and even after only a few applications my face feels super smooth and fresh.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, my first impression was that the bottle was small and wouldn&#x27;t last very long, but I&#x27;ve been using it nightly for about 5 weeks and am not even halfway done with the bottle, so I&#x27;ve been very pleased with that.  </li>
            <li>It leaves the skin feeling great and over the past few weeks my girlfriend has stopped telling me how dry my face looks, which is well worth the price of admission in my book.  </li>
            <li>I wear it nightly without fail, and it keeps my skin tone even, bright, and youthful.</li>
            <li>Taun did not do this, it was completely hypo</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fairly young guy</li>
            <li>I have complete confidence in the quality.</li>
            <li>I have been using Taun now for several months and can really tell a difference.  </li>
            <li>I recently came to the harsh realization that I needed to start taking better care of my face.</li>
            <li>B006UK3G0U TAUN]] for a little over a month, and I already notice a big improvement in skin texture and fine lines.  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t speak to the long term benefits yet, but I am very hopeful based on the ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I have spent consider amount of money and wasted many creams as they did not suit me.</li>
            <li>So I read a couple reviews and went for this stuff mainly because of another review similar to this, and I felt compelled to reinforce the last guy&#x27;s review.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t often indulge in high-end skin care products (read: I never have before), but I have no regrets about switching over to Taun.  </li>
            <li>so, ten years early, here we are.</li>
            <li>As a matter of fact I need to be careful not to use too much at a time because within a minute or so of application there&#x27;s no oily indication that anything had been applied.</li>
            <li>far as your concerns about our reviews, this is a fairly simply explanation.</li>
            <li>Given that I&#x27;m in my 30s, live in San Diego, work too much, play too hard, and spend as much time I can outside in the sun...</li>
            <li>In a few weeks of use, I have noticed a smoother feel to my skin and daily shaves in particular have been much easier.  </li>

            <li> I bought this mostly to soothe my skin after shaving and to moisturize my skin after showering.  </li>
            <li> Loved it right away.  </li>
            <li> Easily the best men&#x27;s facial moisturizer on the market.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other face creams and in my opinion Taun is the best.  </li>
            <li> The anti-aging ingredients they&#x27;ve chosen are very powerful and I&#x27;ll be watching to make sure my skin doesn&#x27;t get irritated.</li>
            <li> /&gt;\\&quot;Thank you for trying out our Facial Repair Formula, we&#x27;re happy to hear you enjoyed it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re on the fence about Taun, I strongly encourage you to try it.</li>
            <li> would strongly recommend this product to any one.</li>
            <li> Seriously high quality product that delivers good result over time.</li>
            <li> Taun was the first product of its kind that I ever bought and user on my face.  </li>
            <li> If on the fence about this stuff, let me tell you, it is pricey, BUT, its pretty darn nice.</li>
            <li> and I was a little hesitant because of the price, but I went ahead with it and am very happy I did.  </li>
            <li> Taun has been a great addition to my daily routine.</li>
            <li> I must say, it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> TAUN is a great choice choice when it comes to facial cream.  </li>
            <li> We are happy to discuss this further if you&#x27;d like to email customer support, or through the Amazon messaging system.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not only is the product great</li>
            <li> it is indeed true that many of the reviews have been posted in good faith by real customers who were asked by the company to provide an Amazon review, and I have no reason to believe otherwise, then I retract my concern about certain reviews being made by sock accounts and upgrade my rating to four stars.  </li>
            <li> This product seems to do all it claims, it feels very fresh and not oily.  </li>
            <li> But, this stuff is very nice and almost instantly smooths your skin.</li>
            <li> Feels great on application, absorbs quickly and seems to provide enough moisture for the day.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny in my opinion!</li>
            <li> , er significant.</li>
            <li> After an application of TAUN my face feels clean and fresh!  </li>
            <li> Someone gently pointed out that when I smiled my wrinkles lasted longer than my smile.</li>
            <li> The product came highly recommended to me as \\&quot;way better than the cheap stuff bro, seriously\\&quot; -- and I must admit that&#x27;s an accurate assessment.  </li>
            <li> Have had my container for 3 weeks, use it every day, and still 3/4 full.  </li>
            <li> I was accustomed to, yet is actually, and surprisingly, cheaper.  </li>
            <li> I think the ingredient deck may not be true.</li>
            <li> I never knew that the skin on my face could actually feel good.</li>
            <li> So far I am loving how it feels on my skin</li>
            <li> If it were this price, then I would give it the full five stars.</li>
            <li> Keep your expectations realistic and you will be pleased.</li>
            <li> We asked many of our customers to provide reviews, these customers were not compensated in any manner and this is fully within Amazon&#x27;s normal practices.</li>
            <li> My skin feels great and look healthier and have been using this product for less than two</li>
            <li> My wife regularly mentions how much better my skin looks!</li>
            <li> I am okay to admit that I want something to help me stay looking young.  </li>
            <li> TAUN is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> A male friend who is somewhat more inclined than I (and your standard frog would be somewhat more inclined than I) to use a men&#x27;s moisturizer gifted me a cooly packaged jar of something called TAUN.</li>
            <li> This is why I do not feel that the product is worth the money.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try this at first, but must admit, it goes on nicely, disappears quickly, yet feels like it&#x27;s protecting and enhancing my mug all day long.</li>
            <li> Not only did Taun reverse the effects of winter, but as a daily use product I have found my face and neck to be more healthy and smooth than ever before.  </li>
            <li> Another pleasant side effect is that I haven&#x27;t been getting the same cuts on my neck when shaving -- I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s a direct result of the product or the psychological effect of me treating my well-moisturized neck with more respect, but either way I&#x27;ll take it.  </li>
            <li> It is light, clean, and most importantly not greasy or oily.  </li>
            <li> that I figured it was worth sharing some positive feedback.  </li>
            <li> I like that it has no sent, and your skin just eats this stuff up, it absorbs very readily.</li>
            <li> Its like the first time I took a yoga class.</li>
            <li> Thanks Taun!</li>
            <li> Taun&#x27;s has not eliminated any wrinkles or lines, but it has made my face look smoother, and hopefully will help prevent more wrinkles in the future.</li>
            <li> Not only does it offer long term benefits, it feels great today.</li>
            <li> I have always pride myself for having good skin and generally look younger than my age</li>
            <li> If TAUN or TAUNING is not in the English dictionary,and I haven&#x27;t been able to find it, it should be.</li>
            <li> I suspect this because many of the 5-star reviewers have reviewed only this product.  </li>
            <li> When complaining out loud about this, a good friend erupted into a passionate sales pitch for Taun.</li>
            <li> As another reviewer pointed out, many of the \\&quot;reviews\\&quot; of this product are likely from sock accounts- accounts created by the seller for the express purpose of giving themselves positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s packed with supposedly good stuff - it contains several compounds such as retinol, peptides and esters hat are scientifically proven to help with aging skin.</li>
            <li> Along with regular chemical peels, and a good sunblock, Taun&#x27;s facial repair formula is an invaluable part of my skin care.</li>
            <li> I read some positive reviews of this product and there was some website where a guy used it for 3 months or something and took pictures</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think that I&#x27;d be able to tell the difference between Taun and the brand I normally buy at CVS, but I definitely have, both in the way that it feels and the results that I&#x27;ve gotten.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve switched back to using coconut oil as a moisturizer - greasy but easy.</li>
            <li> I am so impressed with this product that I am seriously considering submitting the word TAUN to the panel that recommends new word entries into the English lexicon.</li>
            <li> 100%\\&quot; - Taun reduced the depth and visibility of my existing wrinkles and that is really all you can ask for in these types of products.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it !&lt;</li>
            <li> absolutely buy again!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am giving this 4 stars though because I think they may have tried to pack too much into one product.  </li>
            <li> rest of my face and neck feel very itchy and irritated after a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s dense and intense.</li>
            <li> Turns out it is really all he cracked it up to be.</li>
            <li> It is, however, slightly more oily than I expected, and does leave a bit of a shine.  </li>
            <li> We encourage you to contact Amazon - they will tell you these are all real accounts and real people.</li>
            <li> In addition, I&#x27;ve started using their renewal program which saves an additional 25% and is very convenient.</li>
            <li> This is not the silver bullet of anti-aging creams for men, especially those of us who have more sensitive</li>
            <li> Well worth the price and will definitely buy again, really like this product a lot!</li>
            <li> At first nearly indescernible, the benifit of the product manifest in a softness and smoothness noticeable to my wife and others.</li>
            <li> I have really started to notice a difference in my skin as well which I don&#x27;t think can be attributed to February in New York.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product to all guys, even those that don&#x27;t use moisturizer every day.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> If you need some something worth the coin and that works well without smelling like apple-cucumber-berry-tini, look no further men.</li>
            <li> am a guy who has never liked using any kind of moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I also feel that it will probably delay the onset of new wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t make you live longer</li>
            <li> We are a new company, establishing our brand in the marketplace and on Amazon.</li>
            <li> A friend suggested I try this new product out</li>
            <li> but really I&#x27;m not sure they need to - this works just fine for me!</li>
            <li> As opposed to the other balms and lotions I have tried, this is a high quality, clean product that doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue on your hands or give your skin an unnatural shine.  </li>
            <li> A bit  pricey, but then...I only have one face ;-)</li>
            <li> Just got my first order of the Facial Repair Formula a couple days ago.  </li>
            <li> so much I&#x27;m actually writing my first ever Amazon review.</li>
            <li> Happily surprised to see Taun on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Absolutely no greasy residue whatsoever, and even after only a few applications my face feels super smooth and fresh.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, my first impression was that the bottle was small and wouldn&#x27;t last very long, but I&#x27;ve been using it nightly for about 5 weeks and am not even halfway done with the bottle, so I&#x27;ve been very pleased with that.  </li>
            <li> It leaves the skin feeling great and over the past few weeks my girlfriend has stopped telling me how dry my face looks, which is well worth the price of admission in my book.  </li>
            <li> I wear it nightly without fail, and it keeps my skin tone even, bright, and youthful.</li>
            <li> Taun did not do this, it was completely hypo</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fairly young guy</li>
            <li> I have complete confidence in the quality.</li>
            <li> I have been using Taun now for several months and can really tell a difference.  </li>
            <li> I recently came to the harsh realization that I needed to start taking better care of my face.</li>
            <li> B006UK3G0U TAUN]] for a little over a month, and I already notice a big improvement in skin texture and fine lines.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t speak to the long term benefits yet, but I am very hopeful based on the ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I have spent consider amount of money and wasted many creams as they did not suit me.</li>
            <li> So I read a couple reviews and went for this stuff mainly because of another review similar to this, and I felt compelled to reinforce the last guy&#x27;s review.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often indulge in high-end skin care products (read: I never have before), but I have no regrets about switching over to Taun.  </li>
            <li> so, ten years early, here we are.</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact I need to be careful not to use too much at a time because within a minute or so of application there&#x27;s no oily indication that anything had been applied.</li>
            <li> far as your concerns about our reviews, this is a fairly simply explanation.</li>
            <li> Given that I&#x27;m in my 30s, live in San Diego, work too much, play too hard, and spend as much time I can outside in the sun...</li>
            <li> In a few weeks of use, I have noticed a smoother feel to my skin and daily shaves in particular have been much easier.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, be very careful about Taun&#x27;s face cream.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend TAUN for anyone in the market for an everyday moisturizer.</li>
            <li> As a 53 year old man people definitely notice a difference in my appearance, thinking I look younger than my years after using this product for a few months now.</li>
            <li> After using Tuan though I can see the difference in quality that I was missing - skin stays fresh throughout the day, no need to reapply, even against harsh winter winds.  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had some decent initial results - my skin looked a bit smoother and brighter than before, however, it wasn&#x27;t long before my skin reacted negatively.</li>
            <li> old age is hell there is nothing on this gods earth that will change it a few wrinkles  </li>
            <li> I like to do my research before buying something, which is why I am ashamed to admit I wasn&#x27;t careful enough before buying this.  </li>
            <li> The biggest deal has always been this greasy feeling from other moisturizers that had kept me from using anything my entire life, until now.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wife kept not so subtly hinting about the new wrinkles, especially on my forehead.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Clever, but dishonest and I don&#x27;t care for this behavior at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not normally one for high-end skin care products (or for reviewing products on Amazon), but my wife bought me a bottle of Taun for Christmas</li>
            <li> I have actually never really had a problem with dry skin, but decided to give this product a try.  </li>
            <li> The price is a little high, but for the quality and the small amount needed per application, I can justify it.  </li>
            <li> Then, within a few weeks I actually saw a difference in my complection.</li>
            <li> Both are widely touted to help with skin elasticity and discoloration.</li>
            <li> And a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> As they say, a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Just click on \\&quot;see my other</li>
            <li> , I live in cold and windy Chicago and my face is always feeling dry and as I approach mid 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li> product has clearly been rated 5/5 by multiple FAKE accounts.</li>
            <li> Agree with previous commenter that a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> As a recent transplant to the Northeast my face began to steadily chap and crack in the cold winter weather.  </li>
            <li> I also notice that some of the dark spots in my skin have begun to fade.  </li>
            <li> Well, i figured these writers are probably in their mid to late 30&#x27;s, and im in my mid to late 20&#x27;s,</li>
            <li> I hate shaving, but Taun makes it all better.</li>
            <li> after application oil feel that I get when forced to use lotions for winter itch and such.</li>
            <li> I will say that I think the pores on my checks have tightened slightly and are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Less wrinkles, healthier, softer, etc.</li>
            <li> Typically face moisturizer &#x3D; oily feel . . .</li>
            <li> I am hoping that by taking a proactive approach to ageing that i will be able to slow the effects of gravity and time, as they are already rearing there ugly heads in my direction.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Bonus: I have very sensitive skin, and sunscreen or the wrong type of soap will always make me break out.  </li>
            <li> I too was a little hesitant to spend $79 on lotion for my face</li>
            <li> My face seems to get a little &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; to it like its refreshed or just scrubbed.</li>
            <li> little expensive but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Definitely a game changer for anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> My Fiancee has started to steal it from me because there is no overwhelming sent.  </li>
            <li> You put no more than a small dab on your finger and it spreads evenly</li>
            <li> I usually put lotion on my face in the morning</li>
            <li> Small blemish were removed and my skin feels firmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll provide the definition as well: A men&#x27;s anti-aging moisturizer for all men who never thought about using a men&#x27;s moisturizer or men who have used them in the past and gotten no satisfaction.</li>
            <li> Received a small sample in my March 2013 Birchbox.  </li>
            <li> Im not sure I see a difference.  </li>
            <li> I mean nothing.</li>
            <li> However, just because this cream can dish it doesn&#x27;t mean your skin can take</li>
            <li> A little expensive for something that does not fully work.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s tough to find something that doesn&#x27;t smell fruity or feel greasy.  </li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t work as it says and somehow i have been only using for few moth, one day it became liquid like water and the smell is horrible.</li>
            <li> My wife bought Taun for me and I was skeptical.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is expensive and after using it for 2 months</li>
            <li> FAKE</li>
            <li> In a sea of mediocre men&#x27;s skin care, Taun has made a standout product.</li>
            <li> Is it expensive?  </li>
            <li> The reviewer who said the 5-Star Ratings were bogus is wrong.</li>
            <li> Ill keep putting two applications of this one till it runs out.</li>
            <li> She had said it&#x27;s for men, but I needed moisturizer...and how wrong she was!</li>
            <li> and I hate getting that greasy feeling.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Let me start this review by saying that I am not a \\&quot;cream\\&quot; user.  Taun was the first product of its kind that I ever bought and user on my face.  The reason?  My wife kept not so subtly hinting about the new wrinkles, especially on my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The verdict? I don&#x27;t know what they put in there, but it definitely reduced the visible wrinkles.  There is no \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; cream that can \\&quot;get rid of wrinkles 100%\\&quot; - Taun reduced the depth and visibility of my existing wrinkles and that is really all you can ask for in these types of products.  I also feel that it will probably delay the onset of new wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus: I have very sensitive skin, and sunscreen or the wrong type of soap will always make me break out.  Taun did not do this, it was completely hypo-allergenic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I container lasted me about 2 months, and I plan on being a repeat customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review helped.  Keep your expectations realistic and you will be pleased.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it.  He had recently been trying my facial moisturizers and felt they were too feminine.  He loves that there is no smell and the way this product feels on his skin.</li>
            <li> This product definitely works as advertised.  I have been using [[ASIN:B006UK3G0U TAUN]] for a little over a month, and I already notice a big improvement in skin texture and fine lines.  I also notice that some of the dark spots in my skin have begun to fade.  Living in Southern California has taken a toll on my skin but now through the use of this product I&#x27;m starting to reverse some of that damage.</li>
            <li> Ordered this on a recommendation from a friend and I was a little hesitant because of the price, but I went ahead with it and am very happy I did.  It feels great, I live in cold and windy Chicago and my face is always feeling dry and as I approach mid 30&#x27;s I am okay to admit that I want something to help me stay looking young.  This product seems to do all it claims, it feels very fresh and not oily.  My Fiancee has started to steal it from me because there is no overwhelming sent.  I would recommend signing up for the monthly option as it will save you money and you know you will want more.</li>
            <li> My wife bought Taun for me and I was skeptical.  I had never heard of Taun, and I was content with using a $10 moisturizer post-shave.  After using Tuan though I can see the difference in quality that I was missing - skin stays fresh throughout the day, no need to reapply, even against harsh winter winds.  Agree with previous commenter that a little goes a long way.  Have had my container for 3 weeks, use it every day, and still 3/4 full.  The price is a little high, but for the quality and the small amount needed per application, I can justify it.  Good product - hopefully they expand their offerings.</li>
            <li> Taun is really great for men of all skin types and ages. It&#x27;s one thing for me to spout off the many benefits of Taun, but you have to try it to believe it. The ingredients are top of the line and the results are even better. If you&#x27;re on the fence about Taun, I strongly encourage you to try it.</li>
            <li> I must admit I am by no means a connoisseur of men&#x27;s facial creams, but this stuff is legit. My face and hands get murdered in the winter and I my girlfriend suggested I get some face balm...pfff. So I read a couple reviews and went for this stuff mainly because of another review similar to this, and I felt compelled to reinforce the last guy&#x27;s review. If you need some something worth the coin and that works well without smelling like apple-cucumber-berry-tini, look no further men.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often indulge in high-end skin care products (read: I never have before), but I have no regrets about switching over to Taun.  The product came highly recommended to me as \\&quot;way better than the cheap stuff bro, seriously\\&quot; -- and I must admit that&#x27;s an accurate assessment.  It leaves the skin feeling great and over the past few weeks my girlfriend has stopped telling me how dry my face looks, which is well worth the price of admission in my book.  Another pleasant side effect is that I haven&#x27;t been getting the same cuts on my neck when shaving -- I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s a direct result of the product or the psychological effect of me treating my well-moisturized neck with more respect, but either way I&#x27;ll take it.  Only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is I&#x27;d like to have the option of buying a bigger jar in the future.</li>
            <li> As a recent transplant to the Northeast my face began to steadily chap and crack in the cold winter weather.  Not only did Taun reverse the effects of winter, but as a daily use product I have found my face and neck to be more healthy and smooth than ever before.  I also find myself allergic to a lot of face creams and lotions but I have no issues with this product.  It is light, clean, and most importantly not greasy or oily.  Taun has been a great addition to my daily routine.</li>
            <li> I too was a little hesitant to spend $79 on lotion for my face but it&#x27;s tough to find something that doesn&#x27;t smell fruity or feel greasy.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier with TAUN. Definitely a game changer for anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a believer! I started using Taun about 2 months ago hoping it would&lt;br /&gt;reduce some discoloration and wrinkles I have on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Unbelievable!! After using it for a couple of weeks, I noticed the discoloration (age spots)&lt;br /&gt;faded somewhat and my wrinkles around my eyes seem to have gotten smaller.&lt;br /&gt;The product is greaseless and hydrates my skin nicely...I highly recommend it !&lt;br /&gt; [[ASIN:B006UK3G0U TAUN Facial Repair Formula: Men&#x27;s Anti-Aging Moisturizer, 1.7 ounce]]</li>
            <li> Excellent product!!&lt;br /&gt;Non Greasy and I&#x27;m very happy with the results!&lt;br /&gt;Will absolutely buy again!&lt;br /&gt;A little expensive but a little goes a long way. Worth every penny in my opinion!</li>
            <li> Excellent Product, worth getting it for sure...Planning to gift my Dad. Cant wait to see how it works on him...</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I got it for my boyfriend because I noticed he was using my face cream a lot more often. Well, things have changed and now I am using HIS face cream a lot more often. TAUN has better ingredients on paper than stuff I was accustomed to, yet is actually, and surprisingly, cheaper.  I have really started to notice a difference in my skin as well which I don&#x27;t think can be attributed to February in New York.  I&#x27;d love them to make one for women but really I&#x27;m not sure they need to - this works just fine for me!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try this at first, but must admit, it goes on nicely, disappears quickly, yet feels like it&#x27;s protecting and enhancing my mug all day long. A bit  pricey, but then...I only have one face ;-)</li>
            <li> I was reading the ingredient list and knowing some chemistry of ingredient listing I think the ingredient deck may not be true.</li>
            <li> Easily the best men&#x27;s facial moisturizer on the market. I have actually never really had a problem with dry skin, but decided to give this product a try.  Absolutely no greasy residue whatsoever, and even after only a few applications my face feels super smooth and fresh.  Highly recommend this product to all guys, even those that don&#x27;t use moisturizer every day.  You will love it!</li>
            <li> Just got my first order of the Facial Repair Formula a couple days ago.  Feels great on application, absorbs quickly and seems to provide enough moisture for the day.  I am giving this 4 stars though because I think they may have tried to pack too much into one product.  The anti-aging ingredients they&#x27;ve chosen are very powerful and I&#x27;ll be watching to make sure my skin doesn&#x27;t get irritated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not normally one for high-end skin care products (or for reviewing products on Amazon), but my wife bought me a bottle of Taun for Christmas and I&#x27;ve been so impressed thus far that I figured it was worth sharing some positive feedback.  I didn&#x27;t think that I&#x27;d be able to tell the difference between Taun and the brand I normally buy at CVS, but I definitely have, both in the way that it feels and the results that I&#x27;ve gotten.  Additionally, my first impression was that the bottle was small and wouldn&#x27;t last very long, but I&#x27;ve been using it nightly for about 5 weeks and am not even halfway done with the bottle, so I&#x27;ve been very pleased with that.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> TAUN is great because it&#x27;s not greasy at all, and produces noticeable results within a matter of weeks. Well worth the price and will definitely buy again, really like this product a lot!</li>
            <li> I read some positive reviews of this product and there was some website where a guy used it for 3 months or something and took pictures and it seemed effective in reducing wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this now for about 2 months and I cant say I see anything, er significant. I will say that I think the pores on my checks have tightened slightly and are less noticeable. I have crows feet (I&#x27;m 39) and perhaps they have shrunk but I dont notice it. Again this is only 2 months of daily use. They recommend twice daily but I only do it morning after a shower. You put no more than a small dab on your finger and it spreads evenly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what will make me buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;I am a guy who has never liked using any kind of moisturizers. Not on my face or hands or arms, anywhere. The feeling of greasiness just bugs me and I would often break out when I put anything on my face. This product is NOTHING like that. Once you&#x27;ve spread it your skin just seems to soak it in and the greasiness or &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; feeling is simply gone. I mean nothing. Not even on your hands. IT&#x27;s amazing. I dont have to wash my hands after applying and my face doesnt break out or feel greasy during the day. My face seems to get a little &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; to it like its refreshed or just scrubbed. The biggest deal has always been this greasy feeling from other moisturizers that had kept me from using anything my entire life, until now.&lt;br /&gt;If you have that same issue this is for you.&lt;br /&gt;It is expensive and after using it for 2 months I would say I have about 50% left. Thats once a day application but fairly heavy.&lt;br /&gt;Good product for me and I will buy it again likely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to go out and buy men&#x27;s facial products but a buddy recommended Taun so I gave it a try. I must say, it&#x27;s fantastic. I usually put lotion on my face in the morning and I hate getting that greasy feeling. Taun actually moisturizes your face but doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling like you just put butter on your skin. I&#x27;m a fairly young guy but I&#x27;ve definitely done a lot to hurt my skin over the years. I&#x27;ve been using Taun for about a month and my skin definitely looks fresher and smoother. All in all, great product. I would recommend it to anyone as a daily face lotion.</li>
            <li> I recently came to the harsh realization that I needed to start taking better care of my face. Someone gently pointed out that when I smiled my wrinkles lasted longer than my smile. Given that I&#x27;m in my 30s, live in San Diego, work too much, play too hard, and spend as much time I can outside in the sun...this all makes sense. When complaining out loud about this, a good friend erupted into a passionate sales pitch for Taun. This is the \\&quot;guy\\&quot; who knows about these things, and I totally trust him, so I went for it. After all, its my face...I want this thing to look good...forever. So I started using Taun two months ago and I&#x27;m sold for life. I like it so much I&#x27;m actually writing my first ever Amazon review. Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It feels AMAZING. I never knew any lotion felt like this. My favorite is post-shaving. Its so, so nice. Not oily in any way, just silky and soothing. And a little bit goes a long way. My face and I hate shaving, but Taun makes it all better. Wish I had this 20 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;2) I can actually feel the benefits. I never knew that the skin on my face could actually feel good. Its like the first time I took a yoga class. You&#x27;ll never know unless you try it. And after 2 months, I can actually see the difference! Less wrinkles, healthier, softer, etc. Can&#x27;t wait to see 2 more months.&lt;br /&gt;3) I have complete confidence in the quality. Check the ingredients...all top shelf.&lt;br /&gt;4) It doesn&#x27;t smell at all. As it shouldn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor - take care of your face. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t work as it says and somehow i have been only using for few moth, one day it became liquid like water and the smell is horrible. I have no idea is the product defect or the date expired.</li>
            <li> TAUN is worth every penny.  As opposed to the other balms and lotions I have tried, this is a high quality, clean product that doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue on your hands or give your skin an unnatural shine.  In a few weeks of use, I have noticed a smoother feel to my skin and daily shaves in particular have been much easier.  I highly recommend TAUN for anyone in the market for an everyday moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have been using Taun now for several months and can really tell a difference.  My face feels smoother and tighter and I&#x27;ll be buying some more.  Thanks Taun!</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, be very careful about Taun&#x27;s face cream. It&#x27;s packed with supposedly good stuff - it contains several compounds such as retinol, peptides and esters hat are scientifically proven to help with aging skin. However, just because this cream can dish it doesn&#x27;t mean your skin can take it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had some decent initial results - my skin looked a bit smoother and brighter than before, however, it wasn&#x27;t long before my skin reacted negatively. It&#x27;s been several years since I&#x27;ve suffered from acne, but this cream caused pimples to appear on my face including in the crease between my nose and cheek, and on my eyelid!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of my face and neck feel very itchy and irritated after a couple of weeks. This cream is like a steak - it&#x27;s dense and intense. I&#x27;ve switched back to using coconut oil as a moisturizer - greasy but easy. There&#x27;s a lot of hype on here about this cream, but please don&#x27;t drink the Koolaid. This is not the silver bullet of anti-aging creams for men, especially those of us who have more sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 6/17/2012:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve continued to use Taun&#x27;s, but with a twist. I now apply a layer of virgin, cold-pressed coconut oil on top. This has stopped all the itchy irritation I used to feel when I used Taun&#x27;s alone. Taun&#x27;s has not eliminated any wrinkles or lines, but it has made my face look smoother, and hopefully will help prevent more wrinkles in the future. It&#x27;s still the most comprehensive cream for men out there, with scientifically proven ingredients, and I&#x27;ve made it work for me.</li>
            <li> FAKE REVIEWS!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has clearly been rated 5/5 by multiple FAKE accounts. Just click on \\&quot;see my other reviews\\&quot; for ANYONE! Especially those with names like \\&quot;Mark\\&quot;. Amazon, if you are reading these, FLAG these reviews as FAKE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smart move on the vendor&#x27;s part. Had I not bothered to look closer, I would have ordered it.</li>
            <li> TAUN is a great choice choice when it comes to facial cream.  Typically face moisturizer &#x3D; oily feel . . . not this stuff.  After an application of TAUN my face feels clean and fresh!  Not only does it offer long term benefits, it feels great today.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pricey, theres no arguing that fact. You can try to rationalize the price all you want, at the end of the day, your still shelling out 60-70 dollars for a non prescription cream. But, this stuff is very nice and almost instantly smooths your skin. And it better, for that price! I like that it has no sent, and your skin just eats this stuff up, it absorbs very readily. All the reviews have the authors saying &amp;#34;i wish i had this stuff ten years ago&amp;#34;. Well, i figured these writers are probably in their mid to late 30&#x27;s, and im in my mid to late 20&#x27;s, so, ten years early, here we are. I am hoping that by taking a proactive approach to ageing that i will be able to slow the effects of gravity and time, as they are already rearing there ugly heads in my direction.  If on the fence about this stuff, let me tell you, it is pricey, BUT, its pretty darn nice. It really does make the skin on my face feel great. I would recommend this stuff.</li>
            <li> This product is not just for men! My hubby was already using and loving it so he sent some to our son-in-law in DC. When our daughter visited this summer I noticed how amazing her skin looked and she said she had been using TAUN! I am now using it and loving it as well :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Taun for only about two weeks. so I can&#x27;t speak to the long term benefits yet, but I am very hopeful based on the ingredients.  So far I am loving how it feels on my skin and it is not oily at all.  B.Rauch</li>
            <li> I have always pride myself for having good skin and generally look younger than my age but recently I received Taun as a birthday gift so I gave it a try.  After a week of using it, I can tell you that this stuff works and that it is absolutely great.  My skin looks even better.  It looks smoother and younger.  Small blemish were removed and my skin feels firmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try if you are looking for a good anti-aging cream or just good moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li> This skin cream is definitely top of the line. As they say, a little bit goes a long way. As a 53 year old man people definitely notice a difference in my appearance, thinking I look younger than my years after using this product for a few months now.</li>
            <li> A male friend who is somewhat more inclined than I (and your standard frog would be somewhat more inclined than I) to use a men&#x27;s moisturizer gifted me a cooly packaged jar of something called TAUN. He said try it, it was a gift, so I did. Turns out it is really all he cracked it up to be. As a matter of fact I need to be careful not to use too much at a time because within a minute or so of application there&#x27;s no oily indication that anything had been applied. So, at the beginning it just felt refreshing with no after application oil feel that I get when forced to use lotions for winter itch and such. Then, within a few weeks I actually saw a difference in my complection. At first nearly indescernible, the benifit of the product manifest in a softness and smoothness noticeable to my wife and others. I am so impressed with this product that I am seriously considering submitting the word TAUN to the panel that recommends new word entries into the English lexicon. If TAUN or TAUNING is not in the English dictionary,and I haven&#x27;t been able to find it, it should be. I&#x27;ll provide the definition as well: A men&#x27;s anti-aging moisturizer for all men who never thought about using a men&#x27;s moisturizer or men who have used them in the past and gotten no satisfaction.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Taun for about a month now and it works great.  I&#x27;m not a \\&quot;daily face regimen\\&quot; kind of guy but after I heard about Taun I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  My skin is noticeably better from using it.  The best review?  My wife regularly mentions how much better my skin looks!</li>
            <li> Along with regular chemical peels, and a good sunblock, Taun&#x27;s facial repair formula is an invaluable part of my skin care. I wear it nightly without fail, and it keeps my skin tone even, bright, and youthful. I attribute this to two ingredients: Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate and Niacinamide. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate is a very potent and stable form of vitamin c. Niacinamide is a form of vitamin b3. Both are widely touted to help with skin elasticity and discoloration. There&#x27;s also vitamins A, E, and some well known peptides such as Matrixyl 3000. In a sea of mediocre men&#x27;s skin care, Taun has made a standout product. Thumbs up.</li>
            <li> old age is hell there is nothing on this gods earth that will change it a few wrinkles  won&#x27;t make you live longer i did not see any difference…but i am 70 lol</li>
            <li> I bought this mostly to soothe my skin after shaving and to moisturize my skin after showering.  I like to do my research before buying something, which is why I am ashamed to admit I wasn&#x27;t careful enough before buying this.  As another reviewer pointed out, many of the \\&quot;reviews\\&quot; of this product are likely from sock accounts- accounts created by the seller for the express purpose of giving themselves positive reviews.  I suspect this because many of the 5-star reviewers have reviewed only this product.  Clever, but dishonest and I don&#x27;t care for this behavior at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, this product is undeniably a good skin cream.  It goes on lightly and easily, and indeed makes your skin feel good.  It is, however, slightly more oily than I expected, and does leave a bit of a shine.  This is why I do not feel that the product is worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For just the quality alone, I&#x27;d rate this product as 4 stars.  However, the unprofessional marketing behavior of the seller knocks off 1 star- and I&#x27;m being generous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I received this comment from the manufacturer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Thank you for trying out our Facial Repair Formula, we&#x27;re happy to hear you enjoyed it.&lt;br /&gt;As far as your concerns about our reviews, this is a fairly simply explanation. We are a new company, establishing our brand in the marketplace and on Amazon. We asked many of our customers to provide reviews, these customers were not compensated in any manner and this is fully within Amazon&#x27;s normal practices. We encourage you to contact Amazon - they will tell you these are all real accounts and real people. We are happy to discuss this further if you&#x27;d like to email customer support, or through the Amazon messaging system.&lt;br /&gt;We would kindly ask that you remove or amend your review in the meantime as it is misleading and unfair.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it is indeed true that many of the reviews have been posted in good faith by real customers who were asked by the company to provide an Amazon review, and I have no reason to believe otherwise, then I retract my concern about certain reviews being made by sock accounts and upgrade my rating to four stars.  This four star rating, as mentioned above, is based on the fact that while I do think that this skin cream is very good, I do not think that it is $80 good.  If I were to price this skin cream, for the amount you receive, I would put it at between $30 and $40.  If it were this price, then I would give it the full five stars.</li>
            <li> A friend suggested I try this new product out and I&#x27;ve now been using it for about 6 months.  I&#x27;ve tried many other face creams and in my opinion Taun is the best.  Not only is the product great (my skin is noticibly cleaner and softer) but it is also a great value.  Comparable products are about double the cost.  In addition, I&#x27;ve started using their renewal program which saves an additional 25% and is very convenient.</li>
            <li> Happily surprised to see Taun on Amazon! I tried taun from a friend who had it in her guest bathroom while I was staying there.  She had said it&#x27;s for men, but I needed moisturizer...and how wrong she was! I am 30,and after the week I stayed there I could already see diminishing forehead lines.  Also loved the ingredients list...retinol, peptides...check.  The only surprise was that it doesn&#x27;t smell flower-y like all of my girly moisturizer...but I don&#x27;t care, and think my skin is not irritated by this lotion because of that fact. A+!</li>
            <li> I am one type of person who never like to put cream on my face. I have spent consider amount of money and wasted many creams as they did not suit me. However, TAUN is one of the creams that has just worked for me from day one. Believe it or not, I actually look forward to applying the cream to my face. Seriously high quality product that delivers good result over time. My skin feels great and look healthier and have been using this product for less than two months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would strongly recommend this product to any one.</li>
            <li> Received a small sample in my March 2013 Birchbox.  Loved it right away.  Is it expensive?  Yes.  Does it work?  Big YES!  Amazing cream.  Retinol is the key but who cares.  Lines under the eyes looked brighter and smoother.  Best age moisturizer I&#x27;ve used yet.  Not greasy at all.  FYI:  my review is legit.  I don&#x27;t work or know anybody at Taun.  The reviewer who said the 5-Star Ratings were bogus is wrong.</li>
            <li> I have to put it on twice for it to moisurize.  A little expensive for something that does not fully work.  Im not sure I see a difference.  Now I am simply applying it in what ever way I need to so I can go to the next product till I find the one that works without having to put on two applications.  Till then Ill keep putting two applications of this one till it runs out.</li>
    </ol>
