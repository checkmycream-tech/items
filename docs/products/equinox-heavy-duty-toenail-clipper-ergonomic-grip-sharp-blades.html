            <li>highly recommend these amazing toenail clippers ,I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li>Surgical quality and easy to operate toenail clippers.</li>
            <li>Works just fine no problems.</li>
            <li>Seriously, it is huge.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing and very helpful for your needs.</li>
            <li>These clippers really fit the bill.</li>
            <li>Makes a clean cut on fingernails and toenails</li>
            <li>was trying to replace a 20+ yr old Karina (can&#x27;t find that one any more) and the Karina still worked better.</li>
            <li>These are excellent if you have thick toenails</li>
            <li>arrived on time have used them once they work great but due to operator error</li>
            <li>these heavy duty ones are way more safe and accurate...</li>
            <li>I do wish it was larger to get better leverage, but it does have compound leverage which does help.  </li>
            <li>Locking Key at Bottom to safely place Toenail Cutter</li>
            <li>When the spring finally broke, I began looking for something with more leverage.</li>
            <li>Heavy duty, worked fine, and the lock was a plus and safe for children around.</li>
            <li>Large handle.</li>
            <li>Very awsome products works very well and is very sturdy</li>
            <li>They look to be very well made.</li>
            <li>Works great on old people&#x27;s thick toenails.</li>
            <li>These are made of high quality surgical grade stainless steel for optimal performance.</li>
            <li>SHARP, EASY TO USE.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and sharp.</li>
            <li>It is kind of hard to work with if you have arthritis in your hands but other than that it is fine.</li>
            <li>This clipper is more like pliers to keep in a garage for heavy duty work.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t try to take the whole nail at once; just clip across in short nips.</li>
            <li>I paid a much higher price for a pair of  &amp;#34; professional &amp;#34; clippers a few years back.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say anything about how long they will last, but no matter, I can buy about 3 pair of these for what I gave for my old pair.</li>

            <li> Just bought this didn&#x27;t think it would be anything different from a regular cutter but I was wrong this is so much better, great buy easy to use I love it</li>
            <li> very sharp ...love them.</li>
            <li> It is kind of hard to work with if you have arthritis in your hands but other than that it is fine.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing and very helpful for your needs. I definitely suggest this to everyone!</li>
            <li> The Old Mountain Goat knows when I find something really good - 5 Stars for Equinox!</li>
            <li> This clipper is more like pliers to keep in a garage for heavy duty work. I cannot use this clipper to cut my toe nails because it is too big for my toe nails. Seriously, it is huge. I wish I could return it.</li>
            <li> It looks like it mechanical advantage to cut thicker male toenails. But actually it has mechanical disadvantage and cannot cut even average toenails. Buy something else for toenails. It works great on finger nails.</li>
            <li> Makes a clean cut on fingernails and toenails</li>
            <li> I have very tough toenails and this tool works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  I do wish it was larger to get better leverage, but it does have compound leverage which does help.  My clipper came with the latch at the bottom not made correctly.  I had to use a grinding wheel to get the latch to work correctly, small detail.  The latch really isn&#x27;t necessary.</li>
            <li> This the one to buy, don&#x27;t even think about it.</li>
            <li> Like this toenail clipper a lot!</li>

            <li> Large handle. Lever actuated. Never seen any better.</li>
            <li> Best nail cutter I&#x27;ve owned. Works on even the toughest toenails. Better than anything else I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> Great clippers. You could cut steel with these.</li>

            <li> BEST NAIL CLIPPERS THAT I EVER HAD</li>
            <li> how to you open the locking key at the bottom?</li>
            <li> Works just fine no problems.</li>
            <li> I am diabetic...proper foot nail care is essential.. regular lever clippers cannot be properly controlled...these heavy duty ones are way more safe and accurate...i should have gotten them sooner.</li>
            <li> If you have hard to cut toenails, these are the clippers for you. I paid a much higher price for a pair of  &amp;#34; professional &amp;#34; clippers a few years back. Cutting my nails with them really gave me a work out. When the spring finally broke, I began looking for something with more leverage. These clippers really fit the bill. long handles and compound leverage. I have no problems cutting my thick nails with these clippers. They look to be very well made. The jaws fit together perfectly and the finish is nice and smooth. I just got them so I can&#x27;t say anything about how long they will last, but no matter, I can buy about 3 pair of these for what I gave for my old pair.I love the way they handle. Trimming is now effortless.</li>
            <li> Best pair of toenail clippers I have purchased.  Easy to use and sharp.</li>
            <li> toenails beware. great product</li>
            <li> best clippers we ever bought</li>
            <li> Surgical quality and easy to operate toenail clippers.</li>
            <li> arrived on time have used them once they work great but due to operator error I cut my toe shoot 911 lol</li>
            <li> Works great. If they they work on my toes, they will work for anyone</li>
            <li> Work very well, the only I would fix on the clippers is that when they are lock its very hard to remove the lock lever.</li>
