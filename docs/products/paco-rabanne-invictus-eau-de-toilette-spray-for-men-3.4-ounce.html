            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;d be nice if it lasted longer than an hour though.  </li>
            <li>But, the aroma is extremely nice.  </li>

            <li>Go easy on it.</li>
            <li>Great, sexy smell especially for the summer.</li>
            <li>When you first spray this fragrance on it smells cheap, but when it drys it has a better smell to it.</li>
            <li>Amazing smell, arrived super fast</li>
            <li>It is rich and yummy.</li>
            <li>Great scent,lasts long time.</li>

            <li>My lady really goes wild for the this one :-)</li>
            <li>Smells great, though doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li>Strong, but smells really good in the dry down.</li>
            <li>I absolutely lovvvve it.</li>
            <li>USPS is really SNAIL mail.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment.  </li>
            <li>decided to take a chance, as much as it bothered me to do so, and trade away from RL Polo for once.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I will say hold it a little more than six inches away from you.</li>
            <li>Spray works fine ( unlike other reviewers complaints )</li>
            <li>I get compliments left and right with it.</li>
            <li>Complex and sophisticated.</li>
            <li>It absolutely demands reapplication after a relatively short period of time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Very powerful stuff, only need a little bit.</li>

            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll never make that mistake again.&lt;br /&gt;Invictus and Paco Rabanne are way too established AND expensive to have a product like this that is virtually useless</li>

            <li> My husband LOVED his gift! This is an EXCELLENT cologne because the scent actually lasts ALL day long and I love a man that smells good all day!</li>
            <li> Excellent price and one of my best cologne</li>
            <li> Nice manly yet playful scent. Last all day but I will say hold it a little more than six inches away from you. It&#x27;s a pretty heavy mist.</li>
            <li> Excellent cologne and great service</li>
            <li> It was a birthday gift for our son. He was very appreciative!</li>
            <li> Strong, but smells really good in the dry down. Go easy on it. It reminds me of Mexico cuz I think every guy in Mexico at the resort we stayed at was wearing it. Oddly enough, a few of them were named &amp;#34;Hugo&amp;#34;. Good juice</li>
            <li> Great, sexy smell especially for the summer.</li>
            <li> Smells great, though doesn&#x27;t last too long. The spray does not really produce a mist, but just kinda shoots out at you.</li>

            <li> Amazing cologne! I get compliments left and right with it. I feel great when I wear it. If you want to be a BOSS. Get this cologne. Best cologne.</li>
            <li> Nothing but compliments every time I wear this Paco Rabanne Spray. Love it and already re-supplied about 4 to 5 times already and will keep doing so. Guaranteed to get compliments from girls every time you wear it.</li>
            <li> Loved 1 million so much thought I&#x27;d give this a try and it smells great. The scent doesn&#x27;t last all day but its still pleasing.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this one!</li>
            <li> This stuff is like liquid sexy. I could sniff my boyfriends neck ALL day long. It is rich and yummy.</li>
            <li> Smells great! My dad loves it!</li>
            <li> When you first spray this fragrance on it smells cheap, but when it drys it has a better smell to it. not impressed enough to buy it again.</li>
            <li> Complex and sophisticated. My lady really goes wild for the this one :-)</li>
            <li> Great smelling. Clean. Very powerful stuff, only need a little bit.</li>

            <li> Being a Creed man, this is still a nice change up, great smell &amp; very complimentary, try and you&#x27;ll love</li>
            <li> Amazing smell, arrived super fast</li>
            <li> Great scent,lasts long time. Not over powering. Spray works fine ( unlike other reviewers complaints )&lt;br /&gt;Would get again. Great price compared to department stores. Same packaging as department stores.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery a little slow. USPS is really SNAIL mail.</li>
            <li> I was actually pretty disappointed with the bottle of cologne because the sprayer shoots out a straight stream and not a mist</li>
            <li> The sprayer does not work well on this - not like in retail stores.  The fragrance, however, is amazing.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment.  Product as descrived, great price!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> My favorite cologne ever</li>
            <li> Quick service.  Everything as advertised</li>
            <li> I love it but the only problem was that it&#x27;s too small</li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t many ways that a fragrance can go wrong. It&#x27;s a great scent for a man.</li>
            <li> The overall scent is very nice, and very pleasing.  It has a great combination of citrus, talc, and wood.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;d be nice if it lasted longer than an hour though.  It absolutely demands reapplication after a relatively short period of time.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to take a chance, as much as it bothered me to do so, and trade away from RL Polo for once.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll never make that mistake again.&lt;br /&gt;Invictus and Paco Rabanne are way too established AND expensive to have a product like this that is virtually useless&lt;br /&gt;after a couple of hours.  It just disappears.  But, the aroma is extremely nice.  Up to you on this, I can&#x27;t really&lt;br /&gt;recommend one way or the other.</li>
            <li> I love the scent. As usual Amazon had the best price</li>
