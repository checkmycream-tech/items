            <li>Am so happy it is still around.</li>

            <li>Also thinking about trying the soap soon, and sure hopes it smells like the powder ....&amp;#34;I like it&amp;#34; so silky feeling:)</li>
            <li>I love this powder.</li>
            <li>I am glad I am able to find it.</li>

            <li>Love the fragrant smell.  </li>
            <li>Love this powder.</li>
            <li>Love this talc power.</li>
            <li>but it is not my favorite smell.  </li>
            <li>I have used this body powder for many, many years.</li>
            <li>I like the smell and drying properties better than the others</li>
            <li>All my life, this has been my favorite - still doesn&#x27;t give me allergies, as all the others do.  </li>
            <li>Love this talc and the price was within reason.</li>
            <li>Not too many places sell this.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite body powder.</li>
            <li>Still has the same wonderful scent I remember!!!!</li>
            <li>This is something you can&#x27;t buy in the store love it</li>
            <li>I have used this powder after a shower for many years</li>
            <li>but I will continue to buy it if I am able to find it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always been my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased to find someone who carries it.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Grandma died in 1977, and this reminds me of her.&lt;br /&gt;It smells like roses, and I love it.</li>
            <li>It works better, and is more finely milled than most drugstore brands.</li>
            <li>Nicely scented talc goes on smoothly and feels like velvet on the skin right after a bath or shower.</li>
            <li>It is an old classic and was the perfect gift for her mother.</li>
            <li>Well I am an old soul with delightfully baby- soft skin!  </li>
            <li>and she is happy to have the fine talc that she remembers from her younger days.  </li>
            <li>the \\&quot;container\\&quot; drives me bananas, makes a HUGE mess-so I asked her \\&quot;why didn&#x27;t she purchase Cashmere powder anymore?\\</li>
            <li>Started using this talc while in the US Navy in 1946 since I do not believe stick deodorant was available at that time.  </li>
            <li>It still smells the same, and I was happy to find it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>This product is no longer available in my area.  </li>
            <li>It used to be available in drugstores and grocery stores but for some reason these stores no longer carry it.</li>
            <li>I like the texture and the light fragrance of the powder.</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s happily contained (almost full) in a trash bag at the local landfill.</li>
            <li>So excited that this is still being made.  </li>
            <li>Any time I try to use this I need to have the vacuum cleaner handy because the top pops off.  </li>
            <li>Excellent and hard to find now.</li>
            <li>I am now 72 yrs old and still loving it.</li>
            <li>so when I pull back the covers it smells so good</li>
            <li>It came so quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Cashmere Bouquet body powder classic floral for many years.</li>
            <li>this product brings back delightful memories...still the same silky stuff!</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy some more when I&#x27;m out!</li>
            <li>I used to find it at local stores, but haven&#x27;t been able to find it anywhere !</li>
            <li>That tidbit aside-the quality of this product is worth the price.</li>
            <li>The texture is the same, fine and smooth and the fragrance is</li>
            <li>It has been greatly reduced, and hardly has a fragrance at all.  </li>
            <li>and it keeps you from being hot and sticky in hot humid climates.</li>
            <li>Thanks for your help.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>Fast service too.</li>
            <li>and I really like the feel of it -</li>
            <li>In recent years, I have only been able to find it online, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find a different powder that I like as much.</li>
            <li>AN OLD FAVORITE FINALLY FOUND.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice change from everyday talc.</li>
            <li>She was really excited actually.  </li>
            <li>This is actually close to the original scent..</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li>Today it still has the same lovely fragrance one remembers, the same luxurious feel</li>
            <li>just like the old days!!  </li>
            <li>so long it is a sweet smell that dosnt get stail</li>
            <li>A nice blast from the past!</li>
            <li>It keeps me dry with a pleasant, but not overwhelming scent.</li>
            <li>I remember this scent from when I was very young.  </li>
            <li>I will be looking for something a little more sporty and/or youthful for my next powder purchase.</li>
            <li>This is the powder my mom remembers using when she was young.  </li>
            <li>Mom was so surprised</li>
            <li>I know do not do that, and think I am an old soul.</li>
            <li>I do not put talc near my face, as to not inhale it.</li>
            <li>My 92 year old mother-in-law, who is is the rest home, requested it.  </li>
            <li>It arrive fine and in good condition; but I was disappointed that it did not have the same fragrance that I remember.</li>
            <li>however I am constantly getting compliments on how amazingly soft my skin is, and I attribute that to the fact</li>
            <li>This powder is silky soft, has a very quiet soapy- floral fragrance, and does not compete with any perfume I wear.</li>
            <li>Not sure if the formula has changed over the years, but the fragrance isn&#x27;t the same as the original.  </li>

            <li> I have been using it for a long time.</li>
            <li> This has been around for a long time.</li>
            <li> Very hard to find and the price was reasonable!</li>
            <li> but I am having trouble finding it locally.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this I was not sure how long I would have to wait for it to be delivered.  </li>
            <li> Waiting for the price to go down.</li>
            <li> My mother loves this product and would purchase it regularly at local stores-then it was no more!</li>
            <li> I ordered this one evening and in less than 2 days I received it.  </li>
            <li> I think it is a little pricey</li>
            <li> Just like yesterday, this powder flooded my memory bank from years past.  </li>
            <li> Reminds me of days past.  </li>
            <li> Bath powder is getting hard to find in the stores, but I couldn&#x27;t imagine a bath without it.</li>
            <li> I prefer talc-based powders, because cornstarch is irritating to me.</li>
            <li> She had long wanted to avail this and was disappointed for lack of stock anywhere else.</li>
            <li> It is too bad it is hard to find, but I am thankful I can get it through Amazon.</li>
            <li> When we moved to Maryland we were unable to find it in any store.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This product was one that we used especially in the summers the entire time I was growing up (along with Breck shampoo and&lt;br /&gt;Camay soap).  It just brings back wonderful memories of my youth, and smells wonderful, too.</li>
            <li> My Grandmother used Cashmere Bouquet all her life, my mother as well. That tidbit aside-the quality of this product is worth the price. It smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> My Mom has been using this product for years.  It&#x27;s the only one that she&#x27;s not allergic to.  When we moved to Maryland we were unable to find it in any store.  Driving back to NJ for this was out of the question.  When we were up visiting I could stock up but now we can&#x27;t find it there either.  I ordered this one evening and in less than 2 days I received it.  Thanks for your help.</li>
            <li> This is the powder my mom remembers using when she was young.  I found it at Amazon and ordered it.  It came so quickly.  Mom was so surprised Christmas morning when she opened it and the fragrance brings back fond memories.  Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have used this product since childhood.  My mother used is forever.  I am now 72 yrs old and still loving it.</li>
            <li> I am not of \\&quot;target age\\&quot; to be using powder after a shower or bath....however I am constantly getting compliments on how amazingly soft my skin is, and I attribute that to the fact I practice such a ritual as powdering oneself after a bath. Most 20 something&#x27;s I know do not do that, and think I am an old soul. Well I am an old soul with delightfully baby- soft skin!  This powder is the best. I prefer talc-based powders, because cornstarch is irritating to me. I do not put talc near my face, as to not inhale it. This powder is silky soft, has a very quiet soapy- floral fragrance, and does not compete with any perfume I wear. It works better, and is more finely milled than most drugstore brands. It is too bad it is hard to find, but I am thankful I can get it through Amazon.</li>
            <li> My mother loves this product and would purchase it regularly at local stores-then it was no more! She purchased another brand-the \\&quot;container\\&quot; drives me bananas, makes a HUGE mess-so I asked her \\&quot;why didn&#x27;t she purchase Cashmere powder anymore?\\&quot; She explained she couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere-so this product became a \\&quot;stocking stuffer\\&quot; surprise along with the Amazon.com/DealsBuzz info. so Mom can still smell like Mom!</li>
            <li> I just received the 2 bottles I ordered last weekend and I&#x27;m glad I listened to my mother. She has been wanting to order it for some time now. She says that she remembered it from when she was growing up. I decided to go ahead and give it a try after several months of adding to my cart then taking it out thinking I wouldn&#x27;t like it...don&#x27;t regret it one bit, will order more when I&#x27;m out. Also thinking about trying the soap soon, and sure hopes it smells like the powder ....&amp;#34;I like it&amp;#34; so silky feeling:)</li>
            <li> Smells great and great price for the large amount of product. perfect after bath addition.  I would definitely purchase again</li>
            <li> I have been using Cashmere Bouquet body powder classic floral for many years. It keeps me dry with a pleasant, but not overwhelming scent. In recent years, I have only been able to find it online, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find a different powder that I like as much.</li>
            <li> Started using this talc while in the US Navy in 1946 since I do not believe stick deodorant was available at that time.  Missed it.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the formula has changed over the years, but the fragrance isn&#x27;t the same as the original.  It has been greatly reduced, and hardly has a fragrance at all.  I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love this powder. I have been using it for a long time. I am glad I am able to find it.</li>
            <li> This body powder was always used by grandmother and my sister started using it also.  Can never find it locally so have to order.  It is very pleasantly scented without being strong. She loves it whenever I give it to her.</li>
            <li> Gift for Mum, and she loves the stuff.  She was really excited actually.  :)</li>
            <li> Excellent and hard to find now.</li>
            <li> Love this powder, so happy to find it on Amazon.Used it as a child!</li>
            <li> AN OLD FAVORITE FINALLY FOUND. THANK YOU AMAZON.</li>
            <li> Just like yesterday, this powder flooded my memory bank from years past.  Great and familiar fragrance, silky on skin and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I gave this a 5 star rating because this is the best talc ever.  When I purchased this I was not sure how long I would have to wait for it to be delivered.  Well, it was packaged perfectly.  Each container was wrapped individually in plastic so no talc could spill out.  I was completely satisfied with the product, the packaging and the delivery.  I had mentioned it to family and friends and hopefully they will order some also.  Will I order again?  You bet I will.  Thanks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dee Scandurra</li>
            <li> Love the fragrant smell.  Will continue to buy.  Bath powder is getting hard to find in the stores, but I couldn&#x27;t imagine a bath without it.</li>
            <li> It arrive fine and in good condition; but I was disappointed that it did not have the same fragrance that I remember.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother-in-law. I had forgotten how good powder feels after a bath and it keeps you from being hot and sticky in hot humid climates. I had also forgotten how good it smells. So.... I bought some for myself! Good times!</li>
            <li> The fragrance I remember! Very hard to find and the price was reasonable! Will definitely buy some more when I&#x27;m out!</li>
            <li> Oh, how I love this powder! But I just have to say...it doesn&#x27;t have quite the same smell that it used to.</li>
            <li> Nicely scented talc goes on smoothly and feels like velvet on the skin right after a bath or shower. The scent is not over powering. I will definitely be ordering more in the future. It&#x27;s a nice change from everyday talc.</li>
            <li> I like to use in on my bed when I make it so when I pull back the covers it smells so good cant get enough of it will order it again and again this last so long it is a sweet smell that dosnt get stail</li>
            <li> So excited that this is still being made.  I remember this scent from when I was very young.  The scent is clean and fresh - just perfect!  So nice to find a reasonably-priced dusting powder these days!</li>
            <li> this product brings back delightful memories...still the same silky stuff!</li>
            <li> A nice blast from the past! When I was growing up in the 60&#x27;s, there was always a container of Cashmere Bouquet Powder in the bathroom. It still smells the same, and I was happy to find it here on Amazon. Perfect as an after bath powder.</li>
            <li> Love this powder. Have searched for it for years. Fast service too.</li>
            <li> This product is no longer available in my area.  My 92 year old mother-in-law, who is is the rest home, requested it.  I was very pleased to find it on Amazon and she is happy to have the fine talc that she remembers from her younger days.  I bought some for myself and as gifts for friends. I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Any time I try to use this I need to have the vacuum cleaner handy because the top pops off.  If I try to hold it on the powder still flies all over.  Now it&#x27;s happily contained (almost full) in a trash bag at the local landfill.</li>
            <li> This is actually close to the original scent..</li>
            <li> Waiting for the price to go down. I used to find it at local stores, but haven&#x27;t been able to find it anywhere !</li>
            <li> My wife told me once before about this product she thought she remembered as a kid. She had long wanted to avail this and was disappointed for lack of stock anywhere else. One time she googled and found this here at Amazon. When she did, she just decided to buy it. She quipped, &amp;#34;My dad would buy it for me as a girl of 8 or 9 and I just enjoyed playing up with it, use it and smell it! It brings back memories of my childhood!&amp;#34; So, this is the product she was referring to, &amp;#34;CASHMERE BOUQUET.&amp;#34; When the shipping came by, she was deliriously happy. &amp;#34;It is almost the same as I remember it decades ago! The only difference is the packaging, otherwise it is like going back to time. The texture is the same, fine and smooth and the fragrance is oh, so wonderful!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Love this talc power. This has been around for a long time.</li>
            <li> This is not in any of my stores so I was delighted to find this on Amazon. Smells great and I am happy to have this item on my bathroom shelf again!</li>
            <li> This product does what it is supposed to and I really like the feel of it - but it is not my favorite smell.  I kinda feel like a granny when I wear it.  I will be looking for something a little more sporty and/or youthful for my next powder purchase.</li>
            <li> smells good I have used this body powder for many, many years. I like the smell and drying properties better than the others</li>
            <li> All my life, this has been my favorite - still doesn&#x27;t give me allergies, as all the others do.  It is hard to find - thanks Amazon.com for having it.  The only drawback is the aluminum in it (in the talc), so I use it sparingly or mix it with baking soda and corn starch.  Wonderful light fragrance!</li>
            <li> My mother just loves this stuff.</li>
            <li> Will continue to order</li>
            <li> Love, love, love!  Reminds me of days past.  We always had this in the house!</li>
            <li> Love this talc and the price was within reason. Would consider buying it again. Not too many places sell this.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite body powder. The scent was the same as I remembered.  I was very pleased with my order.</li>
            <li> Still has the same wonderful scent I remember!!!!</li>
            <li> This is something you can&#x27;t buy in the store love it</li>
            <li> I ordered the Cashmere Bouquet body poweder for a friend who simply loved it.  It is an old classic and was the perfect gift for her mother.</li>
            <li> I have used this powder after a shower for many years but I am having trouble finding it locally. It used to be available in drugstores and grocery stores but for some reason these stores no longer carry it. I think it is a little pricey but I will continue to buy it if I am able to find it. I like the texture and the light fragrance of the powder.</li>
            <li> Have used this product since I was a child.  It&#x27;s always been my favorite.  I was pleased to find someone who carries it. Will reorder.</li>
            <li> Used this as a teen-ager. Am so happy it is still around.</li>
            <li> just like the old days!!  :)</li>
            <li> Cashmere Bouquet body powder harkens back to a time when it was a staple in every lady&#x27;s bath routine! Today it still has the same lovely fragrance one remembers, the same luxurious feel and it is still the same \\&quot;simple pleasure\\&quot; it has been for generations!</li>
            <li> My Grandma from McEwen, Tennessee always sprinkled this on us after we took a bath in her kitchen in a galvanized steel washtub.  She heated the water on the wood stove.  Grandma died in 1977, and this reminds me of her.&lt;br /&gt;It smells like roses, and I love it.</li>
