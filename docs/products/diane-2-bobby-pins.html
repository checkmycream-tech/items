            <li>I LOVE these bobby pins!</li>
            <li>No wonder they give you so many!</li>

            <li>Really amazing value.</li>

            <li>They also come in handy at dance competitions.</li>
            <li>The color is nice and unobtrusive.</li>
            <li>I liked that because I lose bobby pins all the time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also handy that they come in a tub</li>
            <li>The bobby pins are brown, and are of perfectly nice quality.</li>
            <li>They have a really nice grip as well.  </li>
            <li>completely happy will surely order more for friends.</li>
            <li>Grip is good and plan to get more eventually.</li>
            <li>and I love having so many at my finger tips!</li>
            <li>So much better than the drugstore kind.</li>
            <li>The tub reseals for easy storage and transport of 300 bobby pins!  </li>
            <li>Great value for much higher quality bobby pins.</li>
            <li>all of mine were perfectly fine!</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find large, high-quantity tubs of good-quality bobby pins on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love these  love  quantity, I can&#x27;t save a bobby pin to save my life</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these Bobby Pins.</li>
            <li>So many of the bobby pins at the store are coated in plastic and slip out of my hair.  </li>
            <li>These work so much better.  </li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>Thank you for you product, I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I got these</li>
            <li>When I need some more bobby pins, I&#x27;ll repurchase these for sure.</li>
            <li>Whether they are better quality</li>
            <li>and I love the bulk discount.  </li>
            <li>I have to go through the pins before using them to make sure none of them are going to scratch my daughter&#x27;s scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;nice storage container&lt;</li>
            <li>They are not only good quality, but the quantity makes them a great value.</li>
            <li>I purchased these after reading about them from one of my favorite blog thesmallthings.com.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t find a better deal for this quality.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love them.</li>
            <li>I love these pins.  </li>
            <li>I was satisfied with these bobby pins.</li>
            <li>They could have more plastic around the tips, but they have never caused me discomfort.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that I purchased these.</li>
            <li>I love this bulk container of bobby pins, I don&#x27;t know if anyone else, like me just throws them away after use</li>
            <li>Glad I purchased.</li>
            <li>I will not have to buy bobby pins for ever :)</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love the container.</li>
            <li>Love them .they</li>
            <li>I love the price</li>
            <li>Much better quality that the grocery store brands.</li>
            <li>I have blonde hair and these are awesome!</li>
            <li>Bobby pins are just one of things that magically seem to disappear.</li>
            <li>I love that these bobby pins don&#x27;t twist out of shape.</li>
            <li>They do stay in better.</li>
            <li>need i say more?</li>
            <li>Great pins and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>i like the fact that there were so many.</li>
            <li>Recommended by my stylist, much better hold than store pins.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get a better deal for the quality of these bobby pins if I tried to.  </li>
            <li>100% satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>she instagramed it :)</li>
            <li>at this price for this quality you just cannot do better than these.</li>
            <li>There are so many that we don&#x27;t have to run to the store in a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The quality is good, they have a nice grip, and the sturdy tub is great for storage and could be reused for other purposes once the bobby pins are gone.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m very hesitant with pins and was certain I&#x27;d be returning these, but they work perfectly.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love that they come in a tub for easy storage.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, they&#x27;re a great deal; despite being very affordable they don&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have so many issues trying to keep my fine hair in place</li>
            <li>Love the giant tub - I should be good for many years!</li>
            <li>These are basic pins but a very good value.  </li>
            <li>These really are superior pins.</li>
            <li>Recommended to me by a hairdresser - she was right!!</li>
            <li>mostly use these to secure wigs and dread falls and they have done a fine job.</li>
            <li>Great bobby pins, in a good little tub.</li>
            <li>Easy to use--no breaking, pulling, or snagging.</li>
            <li>My hair damages easily</li>
            <li>Bobby pins are so easy to lose</li>
            <li>Easy to store in my drawer of hair products.</li>
            <li>I have a TON of hair and never thought I could get a strong hold on an updo until these were recommended.</li>
            <li>But as I&#x27;ve been using them, I have been struck by how strong these pins are.  </li>
            <li>It smells like mineral/machinery oil, but you can wash that if you strongly dislike that smell.</li>
            <li>These would probably work best for someone with thicker/courser hair, or someone like me who loses bobby pins and doesn&#x27;t use most of them more than a couple of times.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find so many bobby pins for so cheap.</li>
            <li>and they were pretty cheap and they blend nicely into my hair.</li>
            <li>They hid just fine in my medium brown hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>They work just fine for my purposes</li>
            <li>These are great bobby pins and they shipped pretty fast.</li>
            <li>bobby pins are fine, nothing to write home about.</li>
            <li>These are sturdy, comfortable to wear, and easy to use.</li>
            <li>These bobby pins are fine, but they seem like they have some sort of oil or grease from the manufacturing process on them.</li>
            <li>They are fine quality.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even gone for a JOG with about 4 of these holding my hair up and was fine.</li>
            <li>The little tub is perfect for storage.</li>
            <li>Pulse, I got the huge pack</li>
            <li>I know they are cheap and 300 is a lot,</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think they are cheap at all like</li>
            <li>Definitely worth paying more for quality pins.</li>
            <li>However, for a big tub of bobby pins that I lose all the time anyway, these are great</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t make a light colored pin for blond hair, but I have no problem with the bronze color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These bobby pins are fantastic.</li>
            <li>The container comes with a lid to secure them when traveling.</li>
            <li>This is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>This was such a great deal in terms of price &amp; quantity.  </li>
            <li>Big pack for great price.</li>
            <li>Great bin, solid, seals</li>
            <li>happy using the same 2 pins with no problems</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s great to have a big pack of them.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t like those really cheap ones that lose their tension after one use.  </li>
            <li>They were cheap</li>
            <li>they have smooth edges and won&#x27;t tear your hair.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re someone who uses a LOT of bobby pins, this is a fantastic deal-</li>
            <li>Huge tub of great bobby pins for an extraordinary low price.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t enjoy having to clean bobby pins before wearing them.</li>
            <li>or I&#x27;m just better about replacing stretched pins, these were a good buy.</li>
            <li>My bobby pins tend to disappear with astonishing alacrity, so the sheer number of pins in this tub was very appealing.</li>
            <li>All in all definitely worth the buy!</li>
            <li>I counted them, and there was 142 2&amp;#34; bobby pins, and 96 2.5&amp;#34; (more like 2 3/4&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li>These are listed among the best beauty items on &amp;#34;The Small Things&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This tub is HUGE and just chocked full of bobby pins.</li>
            <li>it is very much worth the money!</li>
            <li>at this price, I&#x27;m willing to take a marginally lower-quality product and make sure I&#x27;ve always got bobby pins when I need them, than splurge on a card of 40 at the drug store and lose them all in a month.</li>
            <li>Great quality, as expected, shipped quickly!</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>But Kate is Right!  </li>
            <li>Come in a nice clear plastic tub.</li>
            <li>These Bobby Pins really do hold so much Better.  </li>
            <li>and really holds better that way.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know what more one could ask for when looking for bobby pins.  </li>
            <li>This is a lot of bobby pins, and they actually are of really good quality and don&#x27;t slip out of my hair.</li>
            <li>Not bad</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to have a large supply on hand if only to remind me to throw out the ones that have been streatched beyond uselessness.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s sweet, pretty, funny, and so adorable in her videos.  </li>
            <li>Kate has so many hair tutorials for cute and simple updo hairstyles.  </li>
            <li>Perfect bobby pins and enough to last a while and definatley cheaper than Target...</li>
            <li>We go through bobby pins so quickly</li>
            <li>We don&#x27;t lose them as quickly.</li>
            <li>but I just wish they were truthful with how many were actually included</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t super well made.</li>
            <li>LOVE and will never use any other kind.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s way better than just using the cardstock paper they normally come on.</li>
            <li>but i wasnt aware that they were so cheaply made</li>
            <li>Sure enough for a little bit more $, these Diane bobby pins work great.</li>
            <li>So I have used some of these multiple times and they still hold just as good as they did during the first use.  </li>
            <li>I love to use pins to pull my hair back in neat, professional ways, and I am in love with these!</li>
            <li>It is amazing that not all bobby pins are the same.  </li>
            <li>2\\&quot; bobby pins are great for pinning bangs or a few tendrils of hair.</li>
            <li>They are a light brown/bronze color that matches my auburn hair really well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have enough to leave a bunch in my purse, desk, overnight bag, and bathroom.</li>
            <li>I think that this is the one thing in my house that gets misplaced more than anything else I own.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That being said, for the price I bought it at it is a great value at a cent per pin even after accounting for the less than stellar pin count.</li>
            <li>It is much more cost effective to buy a tub like this than a little card from the drugstore!</li>
            <li>just right.  </li>
            <li>They open easily and remove smoothly without pulling your hair.</li>
            <li>Easily accessible and high quality pins.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems unlikely that I will lose all 300 bobby pins, but if that ever happens, I will be happy to purchase more.</li>
            <li>They arrived quickly and are very substantial pins.</li>
            <li>professional bobby pins like these make a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Work SO much better than the brands you get from Wal-Mart or such.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care!</li>
            <li>Thanks Kate!</li>
            <li>They really are!</li>
            <li>I love this giant tub of pins.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different types, but nothing beats these Diane pins!</li>
            <li>When a YouTube poster mentioned how much better this product is over what we can pick up locally, I had to see if it was true.&lt;br /&gt;True</li>
            <li>but these work great, even with my thick hair.</li>
            <li>Great for thick hair.  </li>
            <li>I would reccomend them to anyone interested in inexpensive..</li>
            <li>Color and size are exactly as described.</li>
            <li>As a last resort I used these to make a bun on top of my head-</li>
            <li>They do have u funny smell</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very please with them!</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;I was taken aback when I first opened the case and they looked NOTHING&lt;</li>
            <li>So much cheaper than any department store!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re somehow not tight on your hair like cheap ones</li>
            <li>Then I found a beauty blog that recommended trying a professional brand (she was a professional stylist for many years).</li>
            <li>They work so much better than the cheap ones I&#x27;ve bought in the past.</li>
            <li>Large quantity.  </li>
            <li>the hold on these bobby pins is great and to get 300 for less than $7 is such a deal!</li>
            <li>my older kids decided to count them and there isnt exactly 300</li>
            <li>Very high quality.  </li>
            <li>Came in a nice little container.</li>
            <li>My daughter has fine dirty blond hair and these work great for keeping her hair out of her face.  </li>
            <li>A pack of 300, from making retro up do&#x27;s, pinning back hair to holding bandanas on, these little bobby pins are a great buy.</li>
            <li>if it really is 300!&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>haha)  </li>
            <li>but they hold REALLY well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like these bobby pins.</li>
            <li>A whole lot of bobby pins...</li>
            <li>these could make that the ones you can buy at the stores, but there really is a difference.</li>
            <li>, this beauty blogger informed me of something I can&#x27;t believe I went my whole life without knowing; bobby pins are supposed to be inserted with wavy side toward your head.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use them that much though.</li>
            <li>I have not tried to do any updo&#x27;s to really test them out, but you get a lot for your money either way.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t hold very well either.</li>
            <li>they work fabulously and will last days without falling out!</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s a whole lot</li>
            <li>Way larger than I had initially thought but they hold nicely.</li>
            <li>They hold at least as good as the ones from the drug store</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing fancy and they are kind of heavy duty.  </li>
            <li>These bobby pins stay in place and hold your hair much better than other brands.</li>
            <li>They were significantly cheaper than those offered at the local Target store.  </li>
            <li>and you can easily afford to use a few extra to make sure things stay up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good thing there are so many, because at least half of them are unusable.</li>
            <li>hold pretty good and they take a long while to break, so you can reuse them a few times.</li>
            <li>They are thinner than normal ones, and don&#x27;t have as much grip on hair.</li>
            <li>Sweet, ordered these last night and got them this afternoon.</li>
            <li>They are as effective a Scrunci or Goody brands, if not better.</li>
            <li>so far they hold my hair pretty well tho.</li>
            <li>This product is only good if you have thicker hair because it does not hold the hair tightly.</li>
            <li>I have pins half this size that hold better.</li>
            <li>would be ok if the bigger ones would work in my hair,(even though there still wouldn&#x27;t be 300 bobby pins total)  </li>
            <li>I would suggest thinking about the ones that are a bit longer, as it seems to take more than one to hold my hair in place because these are only 2&amp;#34;, however with 300 that&#x27;s not a big deal, just something to consider!</li>
            <li>price and decent quality.</li>
            <li>These are decent quality-</li>
            <li>I use them pretty much every day and although my hair is short now, even when it was very long and curly they worked just fine.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I will have these forever--the container is convenient and pins are high quality.</li>
            <li>I saw a few other reviewers say that they didn&#x27;t think these were great quality</li>
            <li>I love the little tub too, makes it easier to keep up with the pins.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t seem to bend out of shape or get chips in the paint as easily as some other bobby pins I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>This is practically a lifetime supply for me as I don&#x27;t often lose bobby pins (just use them in the bathroom normally while I&#x27;m washing my face).</li>
            <li>I would send back, but wouldn&#x27;t be worth the shipping costs.</li>
            <li>normal use the way some of the others do.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your 3 bucks and buy something more durable.</li>
            <li>Seriously, these bobby pins hold SO much better than anything you can buy at the drugstore!</li>
            <li>I can take them out and put them right back where I got them.  </li>
            <li>They smell old and a little &#x27;off&#x27; for lack of a better word.</li>
            <li>For updos, thicker hair, or big pieces, I recommend the 2.5\\&quot; pins by the same brand, also available on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love these little pins!</li>
            <li>These are strong and stay tight</li>
            <li>They hold my hair -- and hold their shape -- much better than the Goody bobby pins I would usually get at the drugstore.  </li>
            <li>They are small, so they are great for holding stray hairs and bangs, nothing heavy.</li>
            <li>Never let your hair get of of hand again with these old skool hair pins.</li>
            <li>I heard about these Professional Bobby Pins from Kate on her blog, TheSmallThingsBlog.com.  </li>
            <li>and I finally got it, thanks.</li>
            <li>These stay in much longer than regular bobby pins....worth it!!</li>
            <li>The tub is so much easier to use than cards of pins because you can reach in and grab a pin with one hand, and you can toss them back into the tub when  you take them out of your hair.</li>
            <li>of my soft hair sometimes they slip off&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>Sometimes I&#x27;m so busy</li>
            <li>At one point I remarked that my hair was surprisingly still in place and someone literally tried to pull it out, and failed.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely thick long hair, and I was able to hold all of my hair up with just 4 pins!</li>
            <li>300 has lasted me a LONG time even though I lose them right and left.</li>
            <li>Recommended by Kate of The Small Things blog on YouTube, these really do hold your style in place better than your average Target or Wal-mart bobby pins.</li>
            <li>Normally, I could buy 20 or them for $3 or $4, but these are hundreds for the same price!</li>
            <li>If your hair is very dark or light, consider going with a different color.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As far as bobby pins work, these do the trick and are pretty average.</li>
            <li>No other clips, ties, or elastics; just these pins and a bit of hairspray for our updos.</li>
            <li>I use these even though my hair is very blonde and they are nearly unnoticeable.</li>
            <li>The pins are fine quality, but I usually loose them after a few wears, so I can&#x27;t speak to what their longevity might be if you used them over and over.</li>
            <li>My hair is long and super thick and they hold really well for me.</li>
            <li>And sorry I don&#x27;t have the time to be sitting there and counting every single bobby pin in the container to make sure it&#x27;s exactly 300...</li>
            <li>I do have thick hair, but only really use these to pin back small braids or section, or to pin down fly aways when my hair is up.</li>
            <li>Was super excited to get a bunch of bobby pins since I go through them like crazy</li>
            <li>so it will take a while before I have to buy again but will definitely buy again in the near future.</li>
            <li>They hold well without being too tight, so I&#x27;m not worried about damage like I was with other cheap pins.</li>
            <li>too flimsy for thick hair but great for short, thin hair (unlike mine)</li>
            <li>They are a pretty standard size in my opinion, maybe a little bit bigger than ones I&#x27;ve used before, but it&#x27;s barely a noticeable difference if any.</li>
            <li>They hold my hair well, and so far I haven&#x27;t had any of them loose their tips.</li>
            <li>I have thin, fine hair and these clips work wonders when I need to pin my hair.</li>

            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these Bobby Pins.</li>
            <li> So many of the bobby pins at the store are coated in plastic and slip out of my hair.  </li>
            <li> These work so much better.  </li>
            <li> Love these.</li>
            <li> Thank you for you product, I love it.</li>

            <li> Whether they are better quality</li>
            <li> and I love the bulk discount.  </li>
            <li> I have to go through the pins before using them to make sure none of them are going to scratch my daughter&#x27;s scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;nice storage container&lt;</li>
            <li> They are not only good quality, but the quantity makes them a great value.</li>
            <li> I purchased these after reading about them from one of my favorite blog thesmallthings.com.</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t find a better deal for this quality.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love them.</li>
            <li> I love these pins.  </li>
            <li> I was satisfied with these bobby pins.</li>
            <li> They could have more plastic around the tips, but they have never caused me discomfort.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that I purchased these.</li>
            <li> I love this bulk container of bobby pins, I don&#x27;t know if anyone else, like me just throws them away after use</li>
            <li> Glad I purchased.</li>
            <li> I will not have to buy bobby pins for ever :)</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love the container.</li>
            <li> Love them .they</li>
            <li> I love the price</li>
            <li> Much better quality that the grocery store brands.</li>
            <li> I have blonde hair and these are awesome!</li>
            <li> Bobby pins are just one of things that magically seem to disappear.</li>
            <li> I love that these bobby pins don&#x27;t twist out of shape.</li>
            <li> They do stay in better.</li>
            <li> need i say more?</li>
            <li> Great pins and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> i like the fact that there were so many.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my stylist, much better hold than store pins.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get a better deal for the quality of these bobby pins if I tried to.  </li>
            <li> 100% satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> she instagramed it :)</li>
            <li> at this price for this quality you just cannot do better than these.</li>
            <li> There are so many that we don&#x27;t have to run to the store in a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The quality is good, they have a nice grip, and the sturdy tub is great for storage and could be reused for other purposes once the bobby pins are gone.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m very hesitant with pins and was certain I&#x27;d be returning these, but they work perfectly.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love that they come in a tub for easy storage.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, they&#x27;re a great deal; despite being very affordable they don&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have so many issues trying to keep my fine hair in place</li>
            <li> Love the giant tub - I should be good for many years!</li>
            <li> These are basic pins but a very good value.  </li>
            <li> These really are superior pins.</li>
            <li> Recommended to me by a hairdresser - she was right!!</li>
            <li> mostly use these to secure wigs and dread falls and they have done a fine job.</li>
            <li> Great bobby pins, in a good little tub.</li>
            <li> Easy to use--no breaking, pulling, or snagging.</li>
            <li> My hair damages easily</li>
            <li> Bobby pins are so easy to lose</li>
            <li> Easy to store in my drawer of hair products.</li>
            <li> I have a TON of hair and never thought I could get a strong hold on an updo until these were recommended.</li>
            <li> But as I&#x27;ve been using them, I have been struck by how strong these pins are.  </li>
            <li> It smells like mineral/machinery oil, but you can wash that if you strongly dislike that smell.</li>
            <li> These would probably work best for someone with thicker/courser hair, or someone like me who loses bobby pins and doesn&#x27;t use most of them more than a couple of times.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find so many bobby pins for so cheap.</li>
            <li> and they were pretty cheap and they blend nicely into my hair.</li>
            <li> They hid just fine in my medium brown hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair</li>
            <li> They work just fine for my purposes</li>
            <li> These are great bobby pins and they shipped pretty fast.</li>
            <li> bobby pins are fine, nothing to write home about.</li>
            <li> These are sturdy, comfortable to wear, and easy to use.</li>
            <li> These bobby pins are fine, but they seem like they have some sort of oil or grease from the manufacturing process on them.</li>
            <li> They are fine quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even gone for a JOG with about 4 of these holding my hair up and was fine.</li>
            <li> The little tub is perfect for storage.</li>
            <li> Pulse, I got the huge pack</li>
            <li> I know they are cheap and 300 is a lot,</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think they are cheap at all like</li>
            <li> Definitely worth paying more for quality pins.</li>
            <li> However, for a big tub of bobby pins that I lose all the time anyway, these are great</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t make a light colored pin for blond hair, but I have no problem with the bronze color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These bobby pins are fantastic.</li>
            <li> The container comes with a lid to secure them when traveling.</li>
            <li> This is fabulous.  </li>
            <li> This was such a great deal in terms of price &amp; quantity.  </li>
            <li> Big pack for great price.</li>
            <li> Great bin, solid, seals</li>
            <li> happy using the same 2 pins with no problems</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s great to have a big pack of them.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t like those really cheap ones that lose their tension after one use.  </li>
            <li> They were cheap</li>
            <li> they have smooth edges and won&#x27;t tear your hair.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re someone who uses a LOT of bobby pins, this is a fantastic deal-</li>
            <li> Huge tub of great bobby pins for an extraordinary low price.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t enjoy having to clean bobby pins before wearing them.</li>
            <li> or I&#x27;m just better about replacing stretched pins, these were a good buy.</li>
            <li> My bobby pins tend to disappear with astonishing alacrity, so the sheer number of pins in this tub was very appealing.</li>
            <li> All in all definitely worth the buy!</li>
            <li> I counted them, and there was 142 2&amp;#34; bobby pins, and 96 2.5&amp;#34; (more like 2 3/4&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li> These are listed among the best beauty items on &amp;#34;The Small Things&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This tub is HUGE and just chocked full of bobby pins.</li>
            <li> it is very much worth the money!</li>
            <li> at this price, I&#x27;m willing to take a marginally lower-quality product and make sure I&#x27;ve always got bobby pins when I need them, than splurge on a card of 40 at the drug store and lose them all in a month.</li>
            <li> Great quality, as expected, shipped quickly!</li>
            <li> Nothing special.</li>
            <li> But Kate is Right!  </li>
            <li> Come in a nice clear plastic tub.</li>
            <li> These Bobby Pins really do hold so much Better.  </li>
            <li> and really holds better that way.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know what more one could ask for when looking for bobby pins.  </li>
            <li> This is a lot of bobby pins, and they actually are of really good quality and don&#x27;t slip out of my hair.</li>
            <li> Not bad</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to have a large supply on hand if only to remind me to throw out the ones that have been streatched beyond uselessness.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s sweet, pretty, funny, and so adorable in her videos.  </li>
            <li> Kate has so many hair tutorials for cute and simple updo hairstyles.  </li>
            <li> Perfect bobby pins and enough to last a while and definatley cheaper than Target...</li>
            <li> We go through bobby pins so quickly</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t lose them as quickly.</li>
            <li> but I just wish they were truthful with how many were actually included</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t super well made.</li>
            <li> LOVE and will never use any other kind.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s way better than just using the cardstock paper they normally come on.</li>
            <li> but i wasnt aware that they were so cheaply made</li>
            <li> Sure enough for a little bit more $, these Diane bobby pins work great.</li>
            <li> So I have used some of these multiple times and they still hold just as good as they did during the first use.  </li>
            <li> I love to use pins to pull my hair back in neat, professional ways, and I am in love with these!</li>
            <li> It is amazing that not all bobby pins are the same.  </li>
            <li> 2\\&quot; bobby pins are great for pinning bangs or a few tendrils of hair.</li>
            <li> They are a light brown/bronze color that matches my auburn hair really well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have enough to leave a bunch in my purse, desk, overnight bag, and bathroom.</li>
            <li> I think that this is the one thing in my house that gets misplaced more than anything else I own.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That being said, for the price I bought it at it is a great value at a cent per pin even after accounting for the less than stellar pin count.</li>
            <li> It is much more cost effective to buy a tub like this than a little card from the drugstore!</li>
            <li> just right.  </li>
            <li> They open easily and remove smoothly without pulling your hair.</li>
            <li> Easily accessible and high quality pins.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems unlikely that I will lose all 300 bobby pins, but if that ever happens, I will be happy to purchase more.</li>
            <li> They arrived quickly and are very substantial pins.</li>
            <li> professional bobby pins like these make a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Work SO much better than the brands you get from Wal-Mart or such.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care!</li>
            <li> Thanks Kate!</li>
            <li> They really are!</li>
            <li> I love this giant tub of pins.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different types, but nothing beats these Diane pins!</li>
            <li> When a YouTube poster mentioned how much better this product is over what we can pick up locally, I had to see if it was true.&lt;br /&gt;True</li>
            <li> but these work great, even with my thick hair.</li>
            <li> Great for thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I would reccomend them to anyone interested in inexpensive..</li>
            <li> Color and size are exactly as described.</li>
            <li> As a last resort I used these to make a bun on top of my head-</li>
            <li> They do have u funny smell</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very please with them!</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;I was taken aback when I first opened the case and they looked NOTHING&lt;</li>
            <li> So much cheaper than any department store!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re somehow not tight on your hair like cheap ones</li>
            <li> Then I found a beauty blog that recommended trying a professional brand (she was a professional stylist for many years).</li>
            <li> They work so much better than the cheap ones I&#x27;ve bought in the past.</li>
            <li> Large quantity.  </li>
            <li> the hold on these bobby pins is great and to get 300 for less than $7 is such a deal!</li>
            <li> my older kids decided to count them and there isnt exactly 300</li>
            <li> Very high quality.  </li>
            <li> Came in a nice little container.</li>
            <li> My daughter has fine dirty blond hair and these work great for keeping her hair out of her face.  </li>
            <li> A pack of 300, from making retro up do&#x27;s, pinning back hair to holding bandanas on, these little bobby pins are a great buy.</li>
            <li> if it really is 300!&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> haha)  </li>
            <li> but they hold REALLY well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like these bobby pins.</li>
            <li> A whole lot of bobby pins...</li>
            <li> these could make that the ones you can buy at the stores, but there really is a difference.</li>
            <li> , this beauty blogger informed me of something I can&#x27;t believe I went my whole life without knowing; bobby pins are supposed to be inserted with wavy side toward your head.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use them that much though.</li>
            <li> I have not tried to do any updo&#x27;s to really test them out, but you get a lot for your money either way.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t hold very well either.</li>
            <li> they work fabulously and will last days without falling out!</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s a whole lot</li>
            <li> Way larger than I had initially thought but they hold nicely.</li>
            <li> They hold at least as good as the ones from the drug store</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing fancy and they are kind of heavy duty.  </li>
            <li> These bobby pins stay in place and hold your hair much better than other brands.</li>
            <li> They were significantly cheaper than those offered at the local Target store.  </li>
            <li> and you can easily afford to use a few extra to make sure things stay up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good thing there are so many, because at least half of them are unusable.</li>
            <li> hold pretty good and they take a long while to break, so you can reuse them a few times.</li>
            <li> They are thinner than normal ones, and don&#x27;t have as much grip on hair.</li>
            <li> Sweet, ordered these last night and got them this afternoon.</li>
            <li> They are as effective a Scrunci or Goody brands, if not better.</li>
            <li> so far they hold my hair pretty well tho.</li>
            <li> This product is only good if you have thicker hair because it does not hold the hair tightly.</li>
            <li> I have pins half this size that hold better.</li>
            <li> would be ok if the bigger ones would work in my hair,(even though there still wouldn&#x27;t be 300 bobby pins total)  </li>
            <li> I would suggest thinking about the ones that are a bit longer, as it seems to take more than one to hold my hair in place because these are only 2&amp;#34;, however with 300 that&#x27;s not a big deal, just something to consider!</li>
            <li> price and decent quality.</li>
            <li> These are decent quality-</li>
            <li> I use them pretty much every day and although my hair is short now, even when it was very long and curly they worked just fine.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I will have these forever--the container is convenient and pins are high quality.</li>
            <li> I saw a few other reviewers say that they didn&#x27;t think these were great quality</li>
            <li> I love the little tub too, makes it easier to keep up with the pins.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t seem to bend out of shape or get chips in the paint as easily as some other bobby pins I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> This is practically a lifetime supply for me as I don&#x27;t often lose bobby pins (just use them in the bathroom normally while I&#x27;m washing my face).</li>
            <li> I would send back, but wouldn&#x27;t be worth the shipping costs.</li>
            <li> normal use the way some of the others do.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your 3 bucks and buy something more durable.</li>
            <li> Seriously, these bobby pins hold SO much better than anything you can buy at the drugstore!</li>
            <li> I can take them out and put them right back where I got them.  </li>
            <li> They smell old and a little &#x27;off&#x27; for lack of a better word.</li>
            <li> For updos, thicker hair, or big pieces, I recommend the 2.5\\&quot; pins by the same brand, also available on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love these little pins!</li>
            <li> These are strong and stay tight</li>
            <li> They hold my hair -- and hold their shape -- much better than the Goody bobby pins I would usually get at the drugstore.  </li>
            <li> They are small, so they are great for holding stray hairs and bangs, nothing heavy.</li>
            <li> Never let your hair get of of hand again with these old skool hair pins.</li>
            <li> I heard about these Professional Bobby Pins from Kate on her blog, TheSmallThingsBlog.com.  </li>
            <li> and I finally got it, thanks.</li>
            <li> These stay in much longer than regular bobby pins....worth it!!</li>
            <li> The tub is so much easier to use than cards of pins because you can reach in and grab a pin with one hand, and you can toss them back into the tub when  you take them out of your hair.</li>
            <li> of my soft hair sometimes they slip off&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> Sometimes I&#x27;m so busy</li>
            <li> At one point I remarked that my hair was surprisingly still in place and someone literally tried to pull it out, and failed.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely thick long hair, and I was able to hold all of my hair up with just 4 pins!</li>
            <li> 300 has lasted me a LONG time even though I lose them right and left.</li>
            <li> Recommended by Kate of The Small Things blog on YouTube, these really do hold your style in place better than your average Target or Wal-mart bobby pins.</li>
            <li> Normally, I could buy 20 or them for $3 or $4, but these are hundreds for the same price!</li>
            <li> If your hair is very dark or light, consider going with a different color.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As far as bobby pins work, these do the trick and are pretty average.</li>
            <li> No other clips, ties, or elastics; just these pins and a bit of hairspray for our updos.</li>
            <li> I use these even though my hair is very blonde and they are nearly unnoticeable.</li>
            <li> The pins are fine quality, but I usually loose them after a few wears, so I can&#x27;t speak to what their longevity might be if you used them over and over.</li>
            <li> My hair is long and super thick and they hold really well for me.</li>
            <li> And sorry I don&#x27;t have the time to be sitting there and counting every single bobby pin in the container to make sure it&#x27;s exactly 300...</li>
            <li> I do have thick hair, but only really use these to pin back small braids or section, or to pin down fly aways when my hair is up.</li>
            <li> Was super excited to get a bunch of bobby pins since I go through them like crazy</li>
            <li> so it will take a while before I have to buy again but will definitely buy again in the near future.</li>
            <li> They hold well without being too tight, so I&#x27;m not worried about damage like I was with other cheap pins.</li>
            <li> too flimsy for thick hair but great for short, thin hair (unlike mine)</li>
            <li> They are a pretty standard size in my opinion, maybe a little bit bigger than ones I&#x27;ve used before, but it&#x27;s barely a noticeable difference if any.</li>
            <li> They hold my hair well, and so far I haven&#x27;t had any of them loose their tips.</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine hair and these clips work wonders when I need to pin my hair.</li>
            <li> Good quality and thick for my thin hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine and thin blond hair and always thought bobby pins were a waste of my time because they would slide out so fast leaving me with hair in my face and strange kinks and bends where the pins had been.</li>
            <li> I go through bobby pins fast and these will last me at least 3 times as long.  </li>
            <li> Me and 3 other bridesmaids all used these for a hot, humid wedding this past weekend - alone.</li>
            <li> There is a strange smell as well.</li>
            <li> I have long, voluminous and wavy hair that always gets in my way when I&#x27;m working on projects.</li>
            <li> It would be so stretched out and bent outta shape that I can&#x27;t reuse it.  </li>
            <li> Even if it was only 148 pins, it would still only come out to less than 4 cents a bobby pin...</li>
            <li> They are sturdy, and actually thicker than more expensive ones I have bought in the past.</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about this set of bobby pins was there were several pins that were missing the protective ends or the ends</li>
            <li> I have tried them to pull back my long bangs with the rest of my hair down and in a side swept bun to keep all my ends tucked in.</li>
            <li> These are a bit dark for blonde hair.</li>
            <li> the only down fall was</li>
            <li> Plus, instead of having a flimsy piece of cardboard to store them on, I can just toss them back in the plastic tub and worry less about losing them.</li>
            <li> The only complaint is the &amp;#34;bronze&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t lighter in color for my blonde hair.</li>
            <li> Just as expected.</li>
            <li> They works as expected.</li>
            <li> These things are ALWAYS disappearing, and a tub of 300 lasts a VERY long time!!</li>
            <li> so I ended up with less then half of what I actually ordered.</li>
            <li> They are quality hair pins--The plastic coating on the tip of the pins doesn&#x27;t peel off after one or two uses like some other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> Some of the bobby pins come stretched out or missing their protective plastic ends.</li>
            <li> Like other reviews mentioned, these do have a funky smell.  </li>
            <li> other note</li>
            <li> end were deformed and sharp</li>
            <li> the other because the pins refused to open!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will never buy other bobby pins again.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bend out of place as easily as other brands</li>
            <li> But at least it will take you a long, long time and cost you less in the long run!</li>
            <li> I have had one snap in half on me, so their quality isn&#x27;t 5 star and their life is expected to be short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have black hair and expected for the bobby pins to be an extreme dark brown,&lt;br /&gt;boy</li>
            <li> Usually you can only find black ones.  </li>
            <li> I ordered them in the wrong color, but you can&#x27;t really see them in my hair.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is a lot of them are bent sideways</li>
            <li> I was skeptical on how much of a difference</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they do not hold very well for their size.</li>
            <li> While I will agree with some other reviewers that the inside of the tub is a little smelly, these bobby pins get the job done.  </li>
            <li> My hair is slightly thicker than average and no matter what bobby pins I purchase from Walmart, Target, etc, they do not hold well.</li>
            <li> The pins are quite heavy and durable, they have not seemed to stretch out on me like a lot of other brands do.</li>
            <li> (These are bronze, I have black hair)</li>
            <li> Where else can you find bobby pins for less then a penny a piece.</li>
            <li> Its hard to find products that will hold up my hair for long periods of time.</li>
            <li> No more searching the corners of my purse for loose bobby pins!</li>
            <li> Hold my hair tight and in place.</li>
            <li> they have those little rubber pieces at the end.</li>
            <li> the little plastic tips sometimes rip out my hair when removing the pin.</li>
            <li> I would give them 5 stars except some of the little tips</li>
            <li> The little tears on the bottoms of the pins were missing.</li>
            <li> I had a bun in my hair that lasted through heavy wind, rolling around the floor with a puppy, and trying on clothes.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s not a huge deal.</li>
            <li> I ordered these because Kate from the small things blog recommended them.</li>
            <li> the past week.  </li>
            <li> but they feel somewhat slick or oily.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any quality or function difference when comparing to a name brand set I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> While the quality of the bobby pins is the same as I would get at the drug store I was quite disappointed with the fact that the packaging says 300 bobby pins while there was only 277 when I counted.</li>
            <li> I keep some of them in a small bag in my purse in case I need one when I&#x27;m not at home.  </li>
            <li> A little disappointed about that as I bought it specifically for storage, but the pins are thick and that&#x27;s really what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> They are a little thick and hard to manage but they do work with holding my hair in place.</li>
            <li> I had to wash them all, the residue also had an unpleasant smell which hasn&#x27;t disappeared completely yet.</li>
            <li> Slides down over the day - my hair is thinly stranded.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to find pins that go with my hair color (redhead)</li>
            <li> I had a hard time styling my hair with them</li>
            <li> Duh.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and whenever I tried to put my hair in a bun, the pins would never stay put and would stretch out when they came out.</li>
            <li> I can put up my hair (shoulder length, reasonably thick) with 3 pins and it stays all day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, not pleased with the color or quality of this product!</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> Seriously, they are bobby pins.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a little absurd if you ask me.</li>
            <li> You may get a few that are not perfect, but at this price I am not complaining.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I hate having to constantly buy them.</li>
            <li> were badly deformed and sharp.  </li>
            <li> I have been through them out because they are useless.  </li>
            <li> I tend to use bobby pins until they are useless.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s silly that I didn&#x27;t know this already, but I always assumed since the tip of the wavy side points out it would hurt my head to put it against my scalp, it doesn&#x27;t at all</li>
            <li> FYI, I was told I&#x27;ve been putting bobby pins in my hair the wrong way for years.</li>
            <li> Boy I was wrong.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve had this container of pins for a year now and have yet to use any of them because they smell so bad.</li>
            <li> I used to use ponytail but found them painful after a while.</li>
            <li> disappointed.</li>
            <li> but I still hate to throw out money.</li>
            <li> but The smell was so horrible</li>
            <li> Nasty</li>

            <li> Just what I needed. I am always running around looking for bobby pins. Came in a nice little container.</li>
            <li> I may never need to buy bobby pins again. I ordered them in the wrong color, but you can&#x27;t really see them in my hair. (These are bronze, I have black hair) They are small, so they are great for holding stray hairs and bangs, nothing heavy. I do have thick hair, but only really use these to pin back small braids or section, or to pin down fly aways when my hair is up.</li>
            <li> A pack of 300, from making retro up do&#x27;s, pinning back hair to holding bandanas on, these little bobby pins are a great buy. Come in a nice clear plastic tub. Never let your hair get of of hand again with these old skool hair pins.</li>
            <li> Work SO much better than the brands you get from Wal-Mart or such. The only complaint is the &amp;#34;bronze&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t lighter in color for my blonde hair.</li>
            <li> Way larger than I had initially thought but they hold nicely. Beats 3$ for 60 pins any day! As well as the quality is very good</li>
            <li> BEST bobby pins I&#x27;ve ever used. They hold so well! I use them daily. I had a bun in my hair that lasted through heavy wind, rolling around the floor with a puppy, and trying on clothes. LOVE and will never use any other kind.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to find pins that go with my hair color (redhead) but this one do the job okay.&lt;br /&gt;They hold pretty good and they take a long while to break, so you can reuse them a few times.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just what I ordered :) Great pricing!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Good quality.  Tub came all smashed up.  A little disappointed about that as I bought it specifically for storage, but the pins are thick and that&#x27;s really what I wanted.  Good quality and thick for my thin hair.</li>
            <li> all of mine were perfectly fine! And sorry I don&#x27;t have the time to be sitting there and counting every single bobby pin in the container to make sure it&#x27;s exactly 300...that&#x27;s a little absurd if you ask me. Regardless if it&#x27;s 148, 257, or 300 bobby pins I don&#x27;t really care! For $5 it was definitely a great buy! Even if it was only 148 pins, it would still only come out to less than 4 cents a bobby pin...let alone the 2 cents a bobby pin if it really is 300!&lt;br /&gt;Good luck finding a deal like that somewhere else!&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think they&#x27;re great!  My hair is long and super thick and they hold really well for me. I say go for it and try them out!!</li>
            <li> Great quality, as expected, shipped quickly!</li>
            <li> not a good choice they r not good quality pins they dont have good grip.once they open they dont grip</li>
            <li> Love these  love  quantity, I can&#x27;t save a bobby pin to save my life so I needed the big quantity. Also they don&#x27;t seem to pull my hair like others. Love them.</li>
            <li> They hold my hair well, and so far I haven&#x27;t had any of them loose their tips.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these Bobby Pins. I bought a second 300-pack Tub for my Sister, Penny.  I heard about these Professional Bobby Pins from Kate on her blog, TheSmallThingsBlog.com.  Kate has so many hair tutorials for cute and simple updo hairstyles.  These Bobby Pins really do hold so much Better.  And also, who knew that the Zig Zag was supposed to go Against your scalp?  But Kate is Right!  She also has a tutorial for opening the Bobby Pin with your fingers, and not using your teeth.  Brilliant!  (I&#x27;ll never put a bobby pin in my mouth again! haha)  Look her up, Kate, at TheSmallThingsBlog.  She&#x27;s sweet, pretty, funny, and so adorable in her videos.  You&#x27;ll learn a lot from her.  Thanks Kate!</li>
            <li> So many of the bobby pins at the store are coated in plastic and slip out of my hair.  These work so much better.  They are a stiffer metal too.  My only complaint is a lot of them are bent sideways and I can&#x27;t slide them into my hair.  I tried bending them back, but nothing has worked to fix them.  I have been through them out because they are useless.  I hope someone else knows what i am talking about and I am not the only one with this problem. I know they are cheap and 300 is a lot, but I still hate to throw out money.</li>
            <li> There are so many, and they&#x27;re really good bobby pins! Nothing like the flimsy ones at the dollar store. I used them for a bridal emergency kit, and they worked perfectly! The container doesn&#x27;t pop open, and the bobby pins hold what you want them to hold. Great investment!</li>
            <li> Love these. So convinient</li>
            <li> I kept hearing that these are the best bobby pins ever and I finally bit the bullet and ordered them. They weren&#x27;t lying! They really are! They&#x27;re somehow not tight on your hair like cheap ones but they hold REALLY well. Don&#x27;t slip at all. Love them! Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Excellent bobby pins!  Usually you can only find black ones.  These camouflage in my hair perfectly.  The package has a yon in them too.  They open easily and remove smoothly without pulling your hair.</li>
            <li> Thank you for you product, I love it. I need to have a lot of pins and I finally got it, thanks. Great product for great price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I got these, they work perfectly, I don&#x27;t have to worry if I lose one or two because I have a lot of them and they were pretty cheap and they blend nicely into my hair. When I need some more bobby pins, I&#x27;ll repurchase these for sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a while now and I don&#x27;t think they are cheap at all like some reviewers were saying. They are a pretty standard size in my opinion, maybe a little bit bigger than ones I&#x27;ve used before, but it&#x27;s barely a noticeable difference if any. They stay in great and I haven&#x27;t had one break on me or anything like that yet.</li>
            <li> These stay in much longer than regular bobby pins....worth it!!</li>
            <li> Love these pins! I have a TON of hair and never thought I could get a strong hold on an updo until these were recommended. I won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li> this is an excellent product</li>
            <li> They are very good they don&#x27;t snair your hair&lt;br /&gt; they have those little rubber pieces at the end. They are fantastic love them!!!</li>
            <li> too flimsy for thick hair but great for short, thin hair (unlike mine)</li>
            <li> Everything you need - I feel like I&#x27;m always buying these things, so it is great to have a sealable tub and a great quality.</li>
            <li> I tend to use bobby pins until they are useless. It&#x27;s great to have a large supply on hand if only to remind me to throw out the ones that have been streatched beyond uselessness. They hold at least as good as the ones from the drug store and I have noticed I don&#x27;t have to re-pin my hair as often through the day as I used to. They hid just fine in my medium brown hair. Whether they are better quality or I&#x27;m just better about replacing stretched pins, these were a good buy.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that I was getting two packs. That was a deal for the price! I don&#x27;t really like these bobby pins. They are a little thick and hard to manage but they do work with holding my hair in place.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never buy bobby pins at the store again. Why pay $4 for a pack of 60 when I can get this giant tub that will last forever? Plus, instead of having a flimsy piece of cardboard to store them on, I can just toss them back in the plastic tub and worry less about losing them. I saw a few other reviewers say that they didn&#x27;t think these were great quality but I&#x27;ve had no problems with them. I use them pretty much every day and although my hair is short now, even when it was very long and curly they worked just fine.</li>
            <li> I love this giant tub of pins. They are quality hair pins--The plastic coating on the tip of the pins doesn&#x27;t peel off after one or two uses like some other brands I have tried. Easy to use--no breaking, pulling, or snagging.</li>
            <li> The tub reseals for easy storage and transport of 300 bobby pins!  Bobby pins are sturdy and durable.  Great value!!  Bobby pins can be reused and reused. Awesome product and quality.</li>
            <li> A whole lot of bobby pins... What&#x27;s to dislike?</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself and my bridesmaids and we loved it. Easily accessible and high quality pins. Made for updos and side dos that held all day and night.</li>
            <li> They are thinner than normal ones, and don&#x27;t have as much grip on hair. Slides down over the day - my hair is thinly stranded. It keeps scarves on alright - holds well on thicker things like fabric+hair. These would probably work best for someone with thicker/courser hair, or someone like me who loses bobby pins and doesn&#x27;t use most of them more than a couple of times.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick long hair, and I was able to hold all of my hair up with just 4 pins!</li>
            <li> Sweet, ordered these last night and got them this afternoon. Perfect bobby pins and enough to last a while and definatley cheaper than Target...</li>
            <li> Seriously, these bobby pins hold SO much better than anything you can buy at the drugstore! I&#x27;ve tried many different types, but nothing beats these Diane pins! Recommended to me by a hairdresser - she was right!!</li>
            <li> Only bobby pins that actually stay in my hair!!!</li>
            <li> These pins do what they&#x27;re supposed to do!  Highly recommend.  I&#x27;m throwing all my Walmart ones away.  These hold my  fine hair perfectly!</li>
            <li> I ordered these because Kate from the small things blog recommended them. They work great. I have fine hair so I needed something that would hold my hair and these are great. I love the little tub too, makes it easier to keep up with the pins.</li>
            <li> These are basic pins but a very good value.  There&#x27;s nothing fancy and they are kind of heavy duty.  (I&#x27;ve had thinner an lighter pins.)  Overall, recommend.</li>
            <li> When a YouTube poster mentioned how much better this product is over what we can pick up locally, I had to see if it was true.&lt;br /&gt;True and will order again as needed</li>
            <li> Some of the bobby pins come stretched out or missing their protective plastic ends. All in all definitely worth the buy! Will purchase again once I lose all of these...</li>
            <li> These are the best bobby pins ever! They work so much better than the cheap ones I&#x27;ve bought in the past. Definitely worth paying more for quality pins. I have thick hair and whenever I tried to put my hair in a bun, the pins would never stay put and would stretch out when they came out. These are strong and stay tight and I can use them again and again. I love this product!!</li>
            <li> I had read about these on Pinterest and decided to give them a try.  Me and my daughter like they are great.  I was skeptical on how much of a difference these could make that the ones you can buy at the stores, but there really is a difference.</li>
            <li> Huge tub of great bobby pins for an extraordinary low price. This is practically a lifetime supply for me as I don&#x27;t often lose bobby pins (just use them in the bathroom normally while I&#x27;m washing my face).</li>
            <li> Like other reviews mentioned, these do have a funky smell.  However, for a big tub of bobby pins that I lose all the time anyway, these are great and I don&#x27;t notice the smell once they are out of the tub.  They work just fine for my purposes and I love the bulk discount.  Would recommend for all the bobby-pin users out there.</li>
            <li> I have fine and thin blond hair and always thought bobby pins were a waste of my time because they would slide out so fast leaving me with hair in my face and strange kinks and bends where the pins had been. Then I found a beauty blog that recommended trying a professional brand (she was a professional stylist for many years). Sure enough for a little bit more $, these Diane bobby pins work great. I have tried them to pull back my long bangs with the rest of my hair down and in a side swept bun to keep all my ends tucked in. Both times they stayed in all day. They don&#x27;t make a light colored pin for blond hair, but I have no problem with the bronze color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other note, this beauty blogger informed me of something I can&#x27;t believe I went my whole life without knowing; bobby pins are supposed to be inserted with wavy side toward your head. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s silly that I didn&#x27;t know this already, but I always assumed since the tip of the wavy side points out it would hurt my head to put it against my scalp, it doesn&#x27;t at all and really holds better that way.</li>
            <li> It is amazing that not all bobby pins are the same.  Definitely by this brand versus the ones you can get at walmart or target.  They do make a big difference in how they hold your hair.</li>
            <li> They work and there are lots of them.</li>
            <li> These are great. The nub on the end that keeps the metal from scratching your scalp doesn&#x27;t come off like the ones I had from Wal-Mart. Pulse, I got the huge pack so I don&#x27;t run out of the constantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to have to use hat pins to hold my hair but these work great, even with my thick hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered 300 2&amp;#34; bobby pins, and received a container that said jumbo 2.5&amp;#34; bobby pins so I looked inside, and it was mixed bobby pins. I counted them, and there was 142 2&amp;#34; bobby pins, and 96 2.5&amp;#34; (more like 2 3/4&amp;#34;) bobby pins. would be ok if the bigger ones would work in my hair,(even though there still wouldn&#x27;t be 300 bobby pins total)  but I ordered these specific ones cause I knew the bigger ones don&#x27;t work in my hair when I ordered. so I ended up with less then half of what I actually ordered. I would send back, but wouldn&#x27;t be worth the shipping costs. disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I got this! No more searching the corners of my purse for loose bobby pins! Every girl should have one of these...</li>
            <li> Great for thick hair.  They don&#x27;t pull.</li>
            <li> These are listed among the best beauty items on &amp;#34;The Small Things&amp;#34; Blog. Love em!!</li>
            <li> Best bobby pin out there!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know what more one could ask for when looking for bobby pins.  They either work, or they don&#x27;t.  While I will agree with some other reviewers that the inside of the tub is a little smelly, these bobby pins get the job done.  For the price and how many you get, you can&#x27;t really go wrong with these.  I will probably never have to buy bobby pins ever again.  I don&#x27;t use them that much though.</li>
            <li> These came recommended by a hair stylist blogger.  I have not tried to do any updo&#x27;s to really test them out, but you get a lot for your money either way.</li>
            <li> Love these! They don&#x27;t just give up and bend all over the place like the bobby pins I&#x27;ve bought everywhere else.</li>
            <li> the hold on these bobby pins is great and to get 300 for less than $7 is such a deal! I would suggest thinking about the ones that are a bit longer, as it seems to take more than one to hold my hair in place because these are only 2&amp;#34;, however with 300 that&#x27;s not a big deal, just something to consider!</li>
            <li> Not a fan. Was super excited to get a bunch of bobby pins since I go through them like crazy but these pins STINK! Literally. They smell old and a little &#x27;off&#x27; for lack of a better word. Great price but I&#x27;ve had this container of pins for a year now and have yet to use any of them because they smell so bad.</li>
            <li> My daughter has fine dirty blond hair and these work great for keeping her hair out of her face.  They also come in handy at dance competitions.</li>
            <li> These bobby pins stay in place and hold your hair much better than other brands.</li>
            <li> These bobby pins actually stay in your hair and can be used again and again.  Great quality.</li>
            <li> Love these pins! So much better than the drugstore kind.</li>
            <li> This product is only good if you have thicker hair because it does not hold the hair tightly. I find myself constantly adjusting the pins. There is a strange smell as well.</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about this set of bobby pins was there were several pins that were missing the protective ends or the ends were badly deformed and sharp.  When I am doing a fancy hairdo for my daughters I have to go through the pins before using them to make sure none of them are going to scratch my daughter&#x27;s scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;nice storage container&lt;br /&gt;good amount in the set&lt;br /&gt;nice length&lt;br /&gt;easily opened and put in the hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;some end were deformed and sharp</li>
            <li> These bobby pins are fantastic. They are not only good quality, but the quantity makes them a great value. These things are ALWAYS disappearing, and a tub of 300 lasts a VERY long time!! This is my second time purchasing bobby pins from this company. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> These really are superior pins. They took forever to shop though.</li>
            <li> I will have these forever--the container is convenient and pins are high quality. The container comes with a lid to secure them when traveling.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints. These good pins for the price. The do smell when you open it but it goes away.</li>
            <li> This is fabulous.  I was so excited to find so many bobby pins for so cheap. Only issue is that the container broke during shipping so I got a box of bobby pins, not a tub! But that&#x27;s not a huge deal. Still a great product.</li>
            <li> This tub is HUGE and just chocked full of bobby pins. The tub is so much easier to use than cards of pins because you can reach in and grab a pin with one hand, and you can toss them back into the tub when  you take them out of your hair. This is especially nice when you are doing large, intricate up-dos or period dos.</li>
            <li> Great bobby pins and great price.  They do the trick just right.  I purchased these after reading about them from one of my favorite blog thesmallthings.com.</li>
            <li> Love these! I&#x27;m always losing my bobby pins and feel like I can never buy enough. These are great bobby pins and they shipped pretty fast. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product to people!</li>
            <li> I would never have bet that there could be such a big difference between brands of Bobby Pins. There is. The price doesn&#x27;t reflect it, so I recommend buying quality, and this product is quality plus. Love them.</li>
            <li> These smell a bit when you get them, so just let them air out for a day or so. Otherwise, they&#x27;re a great deal; despite being very affordable they don&#x27;t feel cheap. My hair damages easily so I&#x27;m very hesitant with pins and was certain I&#x27;d be returning these, but they work perfectly. They hold well without being too tight, so I&#x27;m not worried about damage like I was with other cheap pins. Great product. Get it. Seriously. You won&#x27;t find a better deal for this quality.</li>
            <li> I received 282 with 6 of them unusable (they were stuck together by the plastic and would not come apart). I figured there would be some discrepancy in the number, I did not think it would be that much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bobby pins are fine, nothing to write home about. I have had one snap in half on me, so their quality isn&#x27;t 5 star and their life is expected to be short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, for the price I bought it at it is a great value at a cent per pin even after accounting for the less than stellar pin count.</li>
            <li> They do not open and slide in like they should. When you open them to put them in, they twist and cross over instead.</li>
            <li> These do a great job of holding my very fine hair. I bought them to use for updos and just pinning my hair back on a daily basis and they meet my needs. The color is nice and unobtrusive. The price is very fair and you get a huge number of pins.</li>
            <li> I buy it every time...every year. Love them!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love them. They hold so well!</li>
            <li> I love these pins.  I am not a hairdresser, just someone who is always running out of bobby pins!  This was such a great deal in terms of price &amp; quantity.  But as I&#x27;ve been using them, I have been struck by how strong these pins are.  They hold my hair -- and hold their shape -- much better than the Goody bobby pins I would usually get at the drugstore.  I love to use pins to pull my hair back in neat, professional ways, and I am in love with these!</li>
            <li> Big pack for great price. Nothing special. It smells like mineral/machinery oil, but you can wash that if you strongly dislike that smell.</li>
            <li> Great bin, solid, seals tight.&lt;br /&gt;Bobby Pins are the quality kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy using the same 2 pins with no problems&lt;br /&gt;for the past week.  Doesn&#x27;t bend and/or break&lt;br /&gt;with normal use the way some of the others do.</li>
            <li> I was satisfied with these bobby pins. They are sturdy, and actually thicker than more expensive ones I have bought in the past. They could have more plastic around the tips, but they have never caused me discomfort. Will order again.</li>
            <li> Purchased as an &amp;#34;add on&amp;#34; to another order, so the price was great.  Large quantity.  I&#x27;m glad that I purchased these.</li>
            <li> Yes you get a lot of pins for your money. Unfortunately, they do not hold very well for their size. I have pins half this size that hold better.</li>
            <li> Great bobby pins, in a good little tub. I liked that because I lose bobby pins all the time. Awesome product.</li>
            <li> I love these little pins! They are good quality and durible.I would reccomend them to anyone interested in inexpensive..good quality bobbypins.</li>
            <li> Great product.  What can you say about bobby pins?</li>
            <li> I love this bulk container of bobby pins, I don&#x27;t know if anyone else, like me just throws them away after use so I was constantly buying them over and over! This worked perfect.</li>
            <li> Bobby pins are so easy to lose so it&#x27;s great to have a big pack of them. These are sturdy, comfortable to wear, and easy to use. Color and size are exactly as described. It&#x27;s nice to have enough to leave a bunch in my purse, desk, overnight bag, and bathroom. Great price, too. Glad I purchased.</li>
            <li> A lot of bobby pins.&lt;br /&gt;Really.&lt;br /&gt;A LOT of them.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re great, and you&#x27;ll have replacements for when you lose them by the dozens.</li>
            <li> Really amazing value. I leave a trail of bobbie pins where ever I go, so buying in bulk is great! The pins are fine quality, but I usually loose them after a few wears, so I can&#x27;t speak to what their longevity might be if you used them over and over.</li>
            <li> The paint comes off after 1 use</li>
            <li> I will not have to buy bobby pins for ever :)&lt;br /&gt;Good price and decent quality. You may get a few that are not perfect, but at this price I am not complaining.&lt;br /&gt;I mostly use these to secure wigs and dread falls and they have done a fine job.</li>
            <li> Just as expected. Perfect condition and nothing to complain about :)</li>
            <li> They work great and you get a lot for the price.</li>
            <li> Awesome to be able to buy bobby pins in bulk through Amazon. I love it. We go through bobby pins so quickly and I hate having to constantly buy them. It&#x27;s also handy that they come in a tub so there&#x27;s somewhere for them to be. We don&#x27;t lose them as quickly.</li>
            <li> Love the container. Easy to store in my drawer of hair products. They works as expected. Hold my hair tight and in place.</li>
            <li> there soooo good and handy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;becus of my soft hair sometimes they slip off&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but the color is good you cant tell</li>
            <li> These bobby pins are fine, but they seem like they have some sort of oil or grease from the manufacturing process on them. Not bad but they feel somewhat slick or oily. I had to wash them all, the residue also had an unpleasant smell which hasn&#x27;t disappeared completely yet. They do the job but I didn&#x27;t enjoy having to clean bobby pins before wearing them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good thing there are so many, because at least half of them are unusable. They don&#x27;t hold very well either.</li>
            <li> These bobby pins met all my expectations for day to day use. It is much more cost effective to buy a tub like this than a little card from the drugstore! I don&#x27;t see any quality or function difference when comparing to a name brand set I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> Great value for much higher quality bobby pins. I think I paid $5 for 50 bobby pins from the drugstore.... professional bobby pins like these make a huge difference. I don&#x27;t have so many issues trying to keep my fine hair in place anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems unlikely that I will lose all 300 bobby pins, but if that ever happens, I will be happy to purchase more.</li>
            <li> I bought these in order to practice hairstyles on my doll and my sisters dolls - now I&#x27;m using them on myself! I have long, voluminous and wavy hair that always gets in my way when I&#x27;m working on projects. Its hard to find products that will hold up my hair for long periods of time. I used to use ponytail but found them painful after a while. Then I would use hair clips but my family started noticing my hair was getting thinner where I would continuously put the clip. As a last resort I used these to make a bun on top of my head- they work fabulously and will last days without falling out! They don&#x27;t pull my hair at the scalp either. Sometimes I&#x27;m so busy I don&#x27;t even take them out when I go to sleep and they are still in my hair the next morning! Definitely a great buy :D</li>
            <li> Love them .they work really good !!! They do have u funny smell but that&#x27;s alright for the price I pay..</li>
            <li> My hair is slightly thicker than average and no matter what bobby pins I purchase from Walmart, Target, etc, they do not hold well. These bobby pins, however, are amazing! The actually hold! All day! I&#x27;m very please with them!</li>
            <li> A great price for a ton of bobby pins. The pins are quite heavy and durable, they have not seemed to stretch out on me like a lot of other brands do. Great buy</li>
            <li> I love the price but I haven&#x27;t been so happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I was taken aback when I first opened the case and they looked NOTHING&lt;br /&gt;like the product photo and instead took on an almost gold-like color--&lt;br /&gt;I have black hair and expected for the bobby pins to be an extreme dark brown,&lt;br /&gt;boy was I fooled!&lt;br /&gt;Also, these bobby pins are not sturdy at all! I had a hard time styling my hair with them&lt;br /&gt;because as I tried to pin my hair in place with one hand, my hair style was falling undone&lt;br /&gt;in the other because the pins refused to open!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, not pleased with the color or quality of this product!</li>
            <li> This product is good for many reasons: The price is great for how many you get. I like the tub they come in, it&#x27;s way better than just using the cardstock paper they normally come on. They are as effective a Scrunci or Goody brands, if not better.</li>
            <li> I love this product because i am always buying bobby pins and losing them, this is a great product and there is a ton of them in a nice sturdy tub. my older kids decided to count them and there isnt exactly 300 they counted 283 but that isnt enough to matter. it is very much worth the money!</li>
            <li> These are the best!  Great quality &amp; hold your hair all day.</li>
            <li> Seriously, they are bobby pins. They are fine quality. Unfortunately, I thought I was ordering hair pins, and did not expect a tub o&#x27; bobby pins, but I have them now, and will never have to purchase more.</li>
            <li> These bobby pins are great! Recommended by Kate of The Small Things blog on YouTube, these really do hold your style in place better than your average Target or Wal-mart bobby pins. I&#x27;m tossing out the cheapies since these work great for me! Love the giant tub - I should be good for many years!</li>
            <li> These are awesome. Much better quality that the grocery store brands. The little tub is perfect for storage.</li>
            <li> While the quality of the bobby pins is the same as I would get at the drug store I was quite disappointed with the fact that the packaging says 300 bobby pins while there was only 277 when I counted. The price can&#x27;t be beat but I just wish they were truthful with how many were actually included</li>
            <li> I go through bobby pins fast and these will last me at least 3 times as long.  I will recommend this product to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> These are a bit dark for blonde hair. As far as bobby pins work, these do the trick and are pretty average.</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine hair and these clips work wonders when I need to pin my hair. Will buy again</li>
            <li> I bought these to do an updo for a wedding I was in. Me and 3 other bridesmaids all used these for a hot, humid wedding this past weekend - alone. No other clips, ties, or elastics; just these pins and a bit of hairspray for our updos. I danced all night and marveled that my hair didn&#x27;t budge. At one point I remarked that my hair was surprisingly still in place and someone literally tried to pull it out, and failed.  Today I put my hair up in a bun, again using just these to hold my hair up, with no hairspray. It&#x27;s now 1:15 and I&#x27;m just back from an outdoor workout (it&#x27;s 85 and humid out) and just needed to adjust one pin. Amazing! I will never buy other bobby pins again.  UPDATE: a year later and these are still amazing. I use them constantly. Just used them for another wedding in which there were 40mph winds. Hair didn&#x27;t move. I can put up my hair (shoulder length, reasonably thick) with 3 pins and it stays all day. I&#x27;ve even gone for a JOG with about 4 of these holding my hair up and was fine.</li>
            <li> I love these!  I have blonde hair and these are awesome!</li>
            <li> I needed these for my daughter&#x27;s updo for Prom. They arrived quickly and are very substantial pins. Plenty left over for the next dance.</li>
            <li> I am constantly leaving a trail of bobby pins wherever I go, so I need to replace them semi-regularly. I was so happy to find large, high-quantity tubs of good-quality bobby pins on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These 2\\&quot; bobby pins are great for pinning bangs or a few tendrils of hair. For updos, thicker hair, or big pieces, I recommend the 2.5\\&quot; pins by the same brand, also available on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got 300 bobby pins for a lower price than I would have paid for about 40 at a drugstore or local supermarket. They are a light brown/bronze color that matches my auburn hair really well. If your hair is very dark or light, consider going with a different color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality is good, they have a nice grip, and the sturdy tub is great for storage and could be reused for other purposes once the bobby pins are gone.</li>
            <li> the little plastic tips sometimes rip out my hair when removing the pin. so far they hold my hair pretty well tho.</li>
            <li> Very high quality.  Don&#x27;t bend and crimp like drugstore bobby pins.</li>
            <li> Bobby pins are just one of things that magically seem to disappear. They must go to the same land as hair-ties and socks! So this is a must-have item. You need 300, because you are guaranteed to lose them. But at least it will take you a long, long time and cost you less in the long run!</li>
            <li> I love that these bobby pins don&#x27;t twist out of shape. They are sturdier than the ones you find at a drugstore. I would give them 5 stars except some of the little tips came off in my mouth when open them. FYI, I was told I&#x27;ve been putting bobby pins in my hair the wrong way for years. Put the wavy side next to your head. Duh. They do stay in better.</li>
            <li> bob pins - perfect and good value. need i say more?</li>
            <li> This tub of bobby pins is a great value for someone, like me, who enjoys putting up her hair.  There are 300 in the tub.</li>
            <li> Great pins and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> My bobby pins tend to disappear with astonishing alacrity, so the sheer number of pins in this tub was very appealing. The bobby pins are brown, and are of perfectly nice quality. They don&#x27;t seem to bend out of shape or get chips in the paint as easily as some other bobby pins I&#x27;ve had. No complaints.</li>
            <li> I would have been a great value for my $$ but The smell was so horrible I just threw them away!!! Nasty</li>
            <li> Good quality, durable, great color, TONS of them! So much cheaper than any department store! Normally, I could buy 20 or them for $3 or $4, but these are hundreds for the same price!</li>
            <li> These bobby pins are perfect and the price is great too! I use these even though my hair is very blonde and they are nearly unnoticeable. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> i like the fact that there were so many. but i wasnt aware that they were so cheaply made, i guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I got a good deal on this item, but I am not to happy with the quality. The little tears on the bottoms of the pins were missing. Not all of them, just some. Some had the tears, but not enough. Which means it will hurt when I will be using them in someones hair.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my stylist, much better hold than store pins.</li>
            <li> This package is such a lifesaver.  I am always losing my bobby pins.  I think that this is the one thing in my house that gets misplaced more than anything else I own.  I absolutely love that they come in a tub for easy storage.  I can take them out and put them right back where I got them.  If I lose some, no big deal it&#x27;s a pack of 300!  The bronze color of the bobby pins makes them easier to hide in my brown hair.  They have a really nice grip as well.  They aren&#x27;t like those really cheap ones that lose their tension after one use.  I keep some of them in a small bag in my purse in case I need one when I&#x27;m not at home.  So I have used some of these multiple times and they still hold just as good as they did during the first use.  These are really a great deal for the $5.60 that I paid for them.  I couldn&#x27;t get a better deal for the quality of these bobby pins if I tried to.  100% satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Where else can you find bobby pins for less then a penny a piece. 300 has lasted me a LONG time even though I lose them right and left. They aren&#x27;t super well made. The coloring starts to flake off and they bend. But hey! They were cheap and I don&#x27;t care about losing them anymore.</li>
            <li> got this as a stocking stuffer for my sister in law and they all called it the greatest gift ever.  she instagramed it :)&lt;br /&gt;every girl needs one of these</li>
            <li> I LOVE these bobby pins! the best I&#x27;ve had and I love having so many at my finger tips! the only down fall was I took the time to count them just to see if I actually got 300 and I didn&#x27;t. It only had 200 and something. but still that&#x27;s a lot!</li>
            <li> The container of 300 bobby pins was a great buy.  They were significantly cheaper than those offered at the local Target store.  They are great quality and I will probably never run out.  I am very happy with this purchase and I would recommend this product to friends and family.</li>
            <li> who doesn&#x27;t misplace all of their bobby pins?! at this price for this quality you just cannot do better than these. completely happy will surely order more for friends.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t the fanciest bobby pins out there. There are some name brands I prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But at this price, I&#x27;m willing to take a marginally lower-quality product and make sure I&#x27;ve always got bobby pins when I need them, than splurge on a card of 40 at the drug store and lose them all in a month. These are decent quality- they have smooth edges and won&#x27;t tear your hair. If you&#x27;re someone who uses a LOT of bobby pins, this is a fantastic deal- and you can easily afford to use a few extra to make sure things stay up.</li>
            <li> I purchased these because I&#x27;m always using my bobby pins and then losing them somewhere. This is a lot of bobby pins, and they actually are of really good quality and don&#x27;t slip out of my hair.</li>
            <li> Perfect for our home, two daughters and myself, . There are so many that we don&#x27;t have to run to the store in a couple of weeks. Grip is good and plan to get more eventually.</li>
            <li> Sturdy and well-made.  Don&#x27;t bend out of place as easily as other brands I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Package smelled like machine oil when I opened it though.</li>
            <li> For the price and the amount you get, I thought this was a steal. Boy I was wrong. No wonder they give you so many! It&#x27;s because it&#x27;s one use only.  For example, I would clip my bangs on the side and by the end of my shift my bobby pin would fall to the ground because it won&#x27;t hold my hair up anymore. It would be so stretched out and bent outta shape that I can&#x27;t reuse it.  I would carry two extra ones in my pocket so I could switch it out. Don&#x27;t waste your 3 bucks and buy something more durable. Ya some might say, its 3 bucks, what do you expect? I&#x27;ve warned you so it&#x27;s your choice to buy or not.</li>
            <li> The pins have a good grip and the color blends in great with my light brown hair color. I didn’t count if in fact there was 300 pins but for under $3.00 there&#x27;s a whole lot so it will take a while before I have to buy again but will definitely buy again in the near future.</li>
