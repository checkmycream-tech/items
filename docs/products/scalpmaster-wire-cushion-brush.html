            <li>Greatest brush for not pulling and tangling my hair.</li>
            <li>is the best kind to use.</li>
            <li>The lady at Toplinepet.com has a great selection and service was prompt.</li>
            <li>The best brush for grooming dogs...used many brands.</li>
            <li>A good choice but still prefer the Scalpmaster 125.</li>
            <li>These are our favorite brushes!</li>
            <li>$ PERFECT, THANKS</li>
            <li>it untangles like magic :)...</li>
            <li>I love this brush.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I have found the Phillips wire cushion brush to be of better quality.</li>
            <li>Just be sure you leave a comment on your order that it will be used for a person, and not a dog.</li>
            <li>I have recommended these to many groomers.</li>
            <li>These last and the price is great!</li>
            <li>Much better made than any of the pet product brushes.</li>
            <li>Perfect for grooming long hair cats.</li>
            <li>With fine hair, it pulls a lot of hair out, which I had been trying to grow.  </li>
            <li>The brush glides smoothly through taking care of any knots that may have been in it.  </li>
            <li>Works great to brush out my dogs long fur.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find one of these type brushes for years, so it is so nice to finally have one again-</li>
            <li>I bought 15 of these for Christmas gifts because my wife, sisters, and aunts are loyal to the scalpmaster 125.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to receive my new brush, and I do like it, but I had to fix it because when I removed it from the package and used it for the first time the orange cushion came off on the top part of the brush.</li>
            <li>When my old brush died I thought I would not be able to find another like this again.  </li>
            <li>and I was so surprised and pleased you carried</li>
            <li>Otherwise, she very generously may send you a free dog toy or bow with your order ;)</li>
            <li>thanks you!</li>
            <li>I first used them in 1988.  </li>
            <li>After attempting a few different modern brushes I decided that the Scalpmaster was the best one.  </li>
            <li>I got this for my mother and it is not the real scalpmaster brush!</li>
            <li>I just found a much better alternative since the original Scalpmaster 125 is not available: the Madan pin brush for dog grooming.</li>
            <li>I returned them all and lost money on the whole transaction.</li>
            <li>Very dissatisfied with it.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I think they could have been blunted a little more.  </li>
            <li>It may resemble the old Scalpmaster125 in appearance, but that&#x27;s where the resemblance ends.  </li>

            <li> It may resemble the old Scalpmaster125 in appearance, but that&#x27;s where the resemblance ends.  </li>
            <li> The brush is stiffer than the 125 (my favorite brush) and the bristles are poorly machined, leaving a rough finish that hurts the scalp.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and a  large wire brush</li>
            <li> It would be useful for a dog with a very thick coat.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely long and think hair.  </li>
            <li> if u have long hair i would recommnd this product</li>
            <li> like the fact that the pins are stiff but for those who are use to old SC125</li>
            <li> This is NOT a scalpmaster, it is a cheap knockoff, poor quality, stiff bristles</li>
            <li> I had to superglue the edge down in order for it to work properly.</li>
            <li> are a bit sharp.</li>
            <li> This CHINESE one has a harder rubber that is less flexible and makes it hard on the scalp.</li>
            <li> The brush bristles are a little on the sharp side.  </li>
            <li> The pins are sharp and hurt your head!</li>
            <li> twice the thickness with sharp cut ends and a shorter handle.&lt;br /&gt;Avoid!!</li>
            <li> to correct the problem that the old Scalpmaster had, which was that after a while, the pins slipped down in the rubber base.  </li>
            <li> This is a brush for very thick heavy hair.  </li>
            <li> Poor quality.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> This hair brush is painful and rips your hair out and feels like it&#x27;s cutting into your scalp.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awful!</li>

            <li> This is a brush for very thick heavy hair.  With fine hair, it pulls a lot of hair out, which I had been trying to grow.  It would be useful for a dog with a very thick coat.  It may resemble the old Scalpmaster125 in appearance, but that&#x27;s where the resemblance ends.  I think Scalpmaster&lt;br /&gt;tried to correct the problem that the old Scalpmaster had, which was that after a while, the pins slipped down in the rubber base.  These&lt;br /&gt;won&#x27;t slip as they are held rigidly in place by some sort of underpinning.  I&#x27;  ll never use this brush on my hair again.  Maybe if I get a&lt;br /&gt;Kommondor  dog.......</li>
            <li> This brush works wonder...it untangles like magic :)...</li>
            <li> Not the real French scalp master. This CHINESE one has a harder rubber that is less flexible and makes it hard on the scalp. Amazon should pull this item.</li>
            <li> The brush bristles are a little on the sharp side.  I think they could have been blunted a little more.  Unfortunately I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> This is NOT a scalpmaster, it is a cheap knockoff, poor quality, stiff bristles twice the thickness with sharp cut ends and a shorter handle.&lt;br /&gt;Avoid!!</li>
            <li> It is just what I wanted! I haven&#x27;t been able to find one of these type brushes for years, so it is so nice to finally have one again- my hair thanks you!</li>
            <li> This is not the Scalpmaster 125!  I bought 15 of these for Christmas gifts because my wife, sisters, and aunts are loyal to the scalpmaster 125.  This hair brush is painful and rips your hair out and feels like it&#x27;s cutting into your scalp.  I returned them all and lost money on the whole transaction.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  I have extremely long and think hair.  I have found with brushes with balls on the end or that have rubber pins pull and tangle my hair.  The brush glides smoothly through taking care of any knots that may have been in it.  Greatest brush for not pulling and tangling my hair.</li>
            <li> These are our favorite brushes! I first used them in 1988.  When my old brush died I thought I would not be able to find another like this again.  After attempting a few different modern brushes I decided that the Scalpmaster was the best one.  YAY! I found it on Amazon! AND my mom, stepsister and 3 nieces all like this brush too!  We will be buying extras!</li>
            <li> Works great to brush out my dogs long fur.&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that the pins are stiff but for those who are use to old SC125 this is NOT the same.&lt;br /&gt;Pins are a bit sharp.</li>
            <li> I have looked and looked for a hair brush like this and I was so surprised and pleased you carried it.&lt;br /&gt; I have thick hair and a  large wire brush is the best kind to use. I love it.</li>
            <li> 100 $ PERFECT, THANKS A LOT !!!!!!</li>
            <li> Poor quality. Doesn&#x27;t compare to the Scalpmaster 125. Very dissatisfied with it.&lt;br /&gt;Also bought the Phillips #11. A good choice but still prefer the Scalpmaster 125.</li>
            <li> The brush is stiffer than the 125 (my favorite brush) and the bristles are poorly machined, leaving a rough finish that hurts the scalp. I have found the Phillips wire cushion brush to be of better quality.</li>
            <li> The pins are sharp and hurt your head! I just found a much better alternative since the original Scalpmaster 125 is not available: the Madan pin brush for dog grooming. They have several different firmness choices (for the pneumatic rubber cushion the pins are anchored in). The lady at Toplinepet.com has a great selection and service was prompt. Just be sure you leave a comment on your order that it will be used for a person, and not a dog. Otherwise, she very generously may send you a free dog toy or bow with your order ;)</li>
            <li> I got this for my mother and it is not the real scalpmaster brush! I used it and it hurts to brush my hair! I do not recommend it at all! The bristles hurt and scratch your scalp! It&#x27;s awful!</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive my new brush, and I do like it, but I had to fix it because when I removed it from the package and used it for the first time the orange cushion came off on the top part of the brush. I had to superglue the edge down in order for it to work properly.</li>
            <li> The best brush for grooming dogs...used many brands. I have recommended these to many groomers. These last and the price is great!</li>
            <li> my wife loves these brushes there the only ones she will used we bought a bunch of them and she gave them away for gifts. if u have long hair i would recommnd this product</li>
            <li> Perfect for grooming long hair cats. Much better made than any of the pet product brushes.</li>
