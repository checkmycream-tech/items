            <li>These work great.</li>
            <li>They are great, they do not make my gums bleed like some flossers do and the pic part is very handy for picking stuff out of your teeth</li>

            <li>Just One Has Lasted A Week Or More !</li>
            <li>Love these flossers on the go!</li>
            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>Much better! http://www.amazon.com/Plackers-Twin-Whitening-Floss-Picks-75/dp/B004RSXOCW/</li>
            <li>My favorite flossers!  </li>
            <li>this is your ticket to healthier teeth and one of the more pleasant dentist visits you&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>On the bright side, I love the toothpick at the end of these.</li>
            <li>These are amazing.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tasted the mint flavor very well but these things are durable and work great!</li>
            <li>The pick end hods up nice and doesn&#x27;t bend immediately.</li>
            <li>good price, have re-purchased many times.</li>
            <li>I like the gum brand better but the subscribe and save price on these was really good.</li>
            <li>THEY ARE NICE AND STURDY AND ONE,TWO</li>
            <li>These are extremely nice Plackers that I have never seen in the store.</li>
            <li>but these kind of suck.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s nice to not have to worry about running out of them.</li>
            <li>These are handier for manual flossing but not as effective as the Flossaid</li>
            <li>I like the pick at the bottom of it too as a nice added bonus.</li>
            <li>Very nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>Nice And Strong !</li>
            <li>The floss isn&#x27;t very strong.</li>
            <li>The floss isn&#x27;t very strong.</li>
            <li>So Easy To Keep Around !</li>
            <li>but after I got these, I floss every night since it&#x27;s so easy now!</li>
            <li>This breaks so easily!</li>
            <li>I have tried every kind of flosser and the Plackers brand is definitely the best.</li>
            <li>Take it from someone who has used several brands of these kind of flossers -- these are great!  </li>
            <li>These are nice and smooth and they don&#x27;t shred very easily.</li>
            <li>Very cheap design and construction.  </li>
            <li>Nice &amp; strong - won&#x27;t break during use.  </li>
            <li>I love these things.</li>
            <li>how many times the string broke.</li>
            <li>I like GUM brand better</li>
            <li>Will gladly do business again &amp; again &amp; again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product for the price and very convenient.</li>
            <li>They do an ok job, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase them again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many styles of Plackers brand flossers.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love these.</li>
            <li>These work great &amp; are very sturdy.</li>
            <li>I love these WILL BUY again.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s faster, more convenient, and does a better job of flossing.</li>
            <li>THE MOST, WILL DO THE TRICK.</li>
            <li>Sure, it doesn&#x27;t stay taught, but that hasn&#x27;t impacted my use.</li>
            <li>the floss string looses its tension real quick</li>
            <li>/&gt;Plackers has better floss than this one, save your money.</li>
            <li>Best way to floss regularly.</li>
            <li>These make it a bit more bearable.</li>
            <li>I know most dogs don&#x27;t know how to sit still for dental care</li>
            <li>These are okay for the price.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m sure of it).</li>
            <li>There are definitely better options.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t cut my gums and are more resistant to fraying.</li>
            <li>You need more than one to finish each time you floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love these</li>
            <li>The dual Plackers are way better</li>
            <li>I bought a Waterpik instead and love it.</li>
            <li>I love the ribbon floss that is used.</li>
            <li>The floss part is okay.</li>
            <li>They are better than nothing.</li>
            <li>i simply love these.</li>
            <li>way better</li>
            <li>It makes me wonder if the manufacturer does it on purpose to make you buy more of their product more often.</li>
            <li>Love these things.  </li>
            <li>Not the most durable.</li>
            <li>one redeeming factor about this Flosser is the toothpick feature.  </li>
            <li>I love these and these and my monthly add on item</li>
            <li>I love these, gets the job done.</li>
            <li>These are my favorite flossers.</li>
            <li>Much better than cheaper brands.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it helps keep our gums and teeth healthy.</li>
            <li>there are better brands.</li>
            <li>better dental checkups.</li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s no nasty feeling on your fingers!</li>
            <li>I love these flossers.  </li>
            <li>mostly care about the flossing functionality, but I&#x27;ve docked a star for the tartar pick, since it is mentioned as a feature of the product.  </li>
            <li>This works better.</li>
            <li>How Long On Perfect Teeth ?</li>
            <li>Pretty good.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and even better than using a water flosser.</li>
            <li>I love the easy to use flosser&#x27;s in of wax dental string</li>
            <li>I am enjoying the mint flavor and the floss (which is the most important part) holds up well during use.  </li>
            <li>These picks will last you and most certainly clean your teeth out the best, for a person with a wire in my teeth I could give the floss in between just fine</li>
            <li>I purchased the Plackers Gentle Fine (http://amzn.to/1muHuqT) and they are amazing!  </li>
            <li>A bit more civilized and easier to use.</li>
            <li>not as good quality as the gentle glide tooth pickers....</li>
            <li>These leave a fresh flavor and there is a handy pick on the end.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve been very happy with other Plackers, I thought I would like these also.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a number of other flossers and in my opinion these are the best out there.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased the Plackers floss in other varieties before and have been very happy.</li>
            <li>super easy and convenient!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my 3rd order, maybe more...VERY happy with this product and LOVE</li>
            <li>Goes between easy</li>
            <li>Tried another brand and the floss would break very quickly.  </li>
            <li>The floss frayed easily</li>
            <li>It does, rather easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to throw one or two in your pocket, purse, etc and use it after you eat.</li>
            <li>Too think and they break easily.</li>
            <li>These flossers slide easily through all of my teeth, and taste/smell like mint, which I like.  </li>
            <li>the floss breaks too easily</li>
            <li>The tartar pick is easy to use as well.</li>
            <li>Easy to hold.</li>
            <li>Easy on gums</li>
            <li>Break apart easily.</li>
            <li>but that is easy to remove.</li>
            <li>The floss isn&#x27;t quite as taught as I would like it to be, they stretch out or snap fairly easily.</li>
            <li>easy to use and does not cut gum line.</li>
            <li>but they do stretch out a bit too easy.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and helps me to floss each day.</li>
            <li>These ones don&#x27;t bend as your using them like some others do and the floss does not break easily.</li>
            <li>They also are easy to grip.</li>
            <li>The pieces are easy to hold on to,</li>
            <li>Easy And Quick !</li>
            <li>They deliver great cleaning, and the pick at the other end is a nice addition.</li>
            <li>Otherwise good quality, I got a different one from same company and am very happy.</li>
            <li>I like these so much better than floss, quick and easy.</li>
            <li>Hands Down - The Best!</li>
            <li>THESE FLOSSERS WILL WORK FINE.</li>
            <li>The floss is a fine thickness and works well for</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m on the flossing bandwagon, and these things are super easy to use and very minty (in a good way).</li>
            <li>These are cheap for a reason.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t tear, the tread free itself from plastic flesh.</li>
            <li>While I appreciate the price and free shipping of these flossers on Amazon&#x27;s subscribe and save, the ribbon used on each flosser loosens up between every tooth.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good, recently I switched from Oral-B Glide 3d to Plackers and I am pretty happy with the quality of this floss.</li>
            <li>I keep them in my car since it is important to floss once a day.  </li>
            <li>great item to maintain personal hygiene.</li>
            <li>If I manage to finagle it between my teeth through a series of precise finesses, it just pulls apart when I extract it.</li>
            <li>I use them everyday, one of the best</li>
            <li>You can tell they are extremely cheaply made and</li>
            <li>The green ones are the best don&#x27;t buy this one</li>
            <li>No shredding and they are waxed to fit between the smallest of spaces between teeth.</li>
            <li>Think about the cheap string floss that your dentist provides you after every visit.</li>
            <li>Works great instead of trying to maneuver man hands into mouth with regular floss.  </li>
            <li>Love these they gently slide between my gums these are my favorite plackers and ive tried them all.</li>
            <li>super fine and easy to slide in and out</li>
            <li>/&gt;I cannot suggest more strongly that you avoid these at all costs and get the Gentle Fine instead.</li>
            <li>I have very tight teeth, and these flossers used to work perfectly.</li>
            <li>They might work great if you have well-spaced out teeth, but mine are pretty normal, and these just wore out way too quickly.</li>
            <li>But more importantly, it&#x27;s just easier and more enjoyable to floss with these flossers as compared to traditional flossing.</li>
            <li>If you have tight teeth and hurts to floss...these are amazing!!</li>
            <li>brand is a good brand in general.</li>
            <li>and it does not break easily as I have experienced with other products.</li>
            <li>but you can clean your teeth with one hand.</li>
            <li>I use them at work, or at home when I want to clean my teeth while doing something else.</li>
            <li>and I probably should have gotten this from the name but the flossing material is super smooth</li>
            <li>but they can be trained to allow you to clean and floss their teeth.</li>
            <li>Super cheap.</li>
            <li>I only bought them because the most popular brand was no longer offered on the automatic shipping program.</li>
            <li>Mmmmm.... clean teeth.</li>
            <li>Fine personal hygiene product at fair price delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>They are pretty comfortable to use and looks strong.</li>
            <li>Slides easily to resist shredding or breaking.&amp;#34; This is what it says right on the bag.</li>
            <li>I have it saved as my favorite product &amp; will continue to re-order, as long as it is available!!</li>
            <li>Much more convenient than &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; floss - helps you get to back teeth more easily.</li>
            <li>They work well and are slightly more gentle on my gums</li>
            <li>Effective and easy to use; especially like the mint flavor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To make both our dentist and my husband happy, he settled on this other Plackers variety:</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other types of Plackers before and they&#x27;ve worked great.</li>
            <li>These work great and the tips and floss don&#x27;t break as easily as other brands we tried.</li>
            <li>I was able to find 120 packs for 99 cents consistently at most local groceries stores.</li>
            <li>They have lost a loyal customer.</li>
            <li>The flavor is extremely mild, too.</li>
            <li>The regular ones, which are a bit cheaper are ok but these are so much better.</li>
            <li>Super price.</li>
            <li>Once this is completed, I set her down and she bounces off, tail wagging happily.    </li>
            <li>works great on our tight teeth, no snagging or ramming into gums</li>
            <li>These are also great since they are for tight teeth.</li>
            <li>These flossers work great if you have some teeth that are tight.</li>
            <li>(Plackers gentle fine dental flossers)</li>
            <li>The little stinger on the end is great for poking out chunks of food too.</li>
            <li>My favorite one goes to Oral B complete</li>
            <li>These aren&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find that I like these even more.</li>
            <li>[[VIDEOID:aaf8200bba875cdd2e8c14691b186a81]]I rarely give something a 1 star.</li>
            <li>We also have one of those water flossers, which is nice but can be messy, and use these more often.</li>
            <li>Pick can be useful.</li>
            <li>And finally the curved tip makes a great toothpick to help complete the flossing process.  </li>
            <li>Sooo much more comfortable than the floss picks with a regular string/thread.</li>
            <li>The pick is useful but it sticks out and pokes you when you are trying to floss.</li>
            <li>These fit between my teeth better than the last bag I got from the grocery store and lost during travel.</li>
            <li>Pick is also useful.</li>
            <li>They clean better and hold up better to my teeth, some of which are tightly spaced.</li>
            <li>He uses these daily &amp; gets a clean bill of sale from the dentist:-)</li>
            <li>buy when the price is right</li>
            <li>Plackers Right Angle, 75 ea]]</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s less pleasant.</li>
            <li>Double string, very very strong.</li>
            <li>These are very strong, so even when they get stuck between your teeth, they don&#x27;t tear, which can sometimes be a issue with regular floss.</li>
            <li>These are fine and great if you have sensitive gums and tight spaces between your teeth, as they won&#x27;t shred, but I think it&#x27;s too slippery and loose to make me feel like I&#x27;m really getting a good flossing and</li>
            <li>The other kind of floss would break once in a great while (maybe two or three in a pack of 75), but since these are thicker, they are much more durable and haven&#x27;t broken once.</li>
            <li>NO other brand has that same kind of hook that gets in &amp; gets out that food particle at is in a hard-to-reach place!</li>
            <li>these are not near as good as glide type, and they both seem to break the same, this one just does not go between teeth as easily as glide</li>
            <li>I wish the tooth pick at the back and was bigger but for what it is it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Definitely not the best choice if you have uneven, floss-destroying teeth like mine</li>
            <li>Flat And Easy To Hide !</li>
            <li>anything that gets me and my 4 year old to floss easier is fine by me.</li>
            <li>Pretty good, sometimes they break because of the tight space between teeth.</li>
            <li>These are great especially if your teeth are a tight fit like mine.</li>
            <li>And this particular variety is definitely more gentle than the twin-line which is the one I normally use.</li>
            <li>but overall I&#x27;ve had better.</li>
            <li>Thank you for your fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon !</li>
            <li>Work great, don&#x27;t shred, but I do feel like they&#x27;re a bit thick.</li>
            <li>We tried these, and while the floss is larger (so you&#x27;d think it would give it more strength)</li>
            <li>The floss consistently slips out of the mount nearest the pick end, sometimes on the first use.</li>
            <li>Most of them broke apart while I was flossing, going to try a different brand.</li>
            <li>Makes flossing so much easier!</li>
            <li>I have found better single-use flossers, but I can&#x27;t recall the brand (I know, big help!)</li>
            <li>I rather stick to regular floss, much more efficient.</li>
            <li>I have used many different floss picks and never had one break until using this brand.</li>
            <li>These are used daily in our home and much better than pulling off floss.</li>
            <li>Not as good as the green Plackers.</li>
            <li>I give it 3 stars because we recieved a few packages that were good but</li>
            <li>Nothing as good as the green ones.  </li>
            <li>My most exceptional little Shih Tzu (grin) must be part human.</li>
            <li>These little fellas are totally awesome for the lazy Americans such as myself who want their dentists to not look at them with a shameful tone when they ask the question that you both already know the answer to: &amp;#34;no, I do not floss daily.&amp;#34; I still don&#x27;t floss daily, because who has time, but these flossers make me much more apt to take assault on my gum line on a more regular basis.</li>
            <li>The pick at the end is handy but sharp.</li>
            <li>The pick at the other end of the handle is definitely nice to have though.</li>
            <li>Love em but could not find them locally, They clean well and have a nice &amp;#34;pick&amp;#34; for those hard to get to places.</li>
            <li>Dental picks in general make it more convenient compared to normal floss.</li>
            <li>The green ones have a smaller floss which I feel are more effective at scraping between teeth and getting everything out.</li>
            <li>Some floss sticks shred into uselessness easily, requiring multiple sticks per session, but</li>
            <li>Overall these get the job done and are easy to pack and bring along with you.</li>
            <li>/&gt;One thing to note:  On the back of the package it calls out as a feature &amp;#34;Slides easily to resist shredding or breaking&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>The floss breaks quite easily, resulting in multiple picks being used per flossing session - wasteful!</li>
            <li>Strong enought not to break yet efficent and well made enough not to damage your gums.</li>
            <li>pick tends to be too large to use as a pick.</li>
            <li>Once in a while I get a flosser that works as it should, but more often than not it breaks or gets loose.  </li>
            <li>Advertised for tight teeth, it is being honest, as I have always had an issue with the bottom row of teeth being too close, but with these I do not.</li>
            <li>This kind for tight teeth are just junk.</li>
            <li>These work just as good as the more expensive packs, and you get more for less.</li>
            <li>So these are spectacular: I don&#x27;t really notice the mint flavor, which doesn&#x27;t matter too much, but the string is strong and thin.</li>
            <li>clean nearly as well as the normal ones.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&amp;#34;Slides easily to resist shredding or breaking.&amp;#34; While it is true that the floss neither shreds nor breaks, it is not true that the flosser itself doesn&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t break and are smooth enough to be gentle on the gums</li>
            <li>and I end up going through 3-4 of these just to floss my whole mouth</li>
            <li>I do really like the pick and the handle on this model.</li>
            <li>I am very dissatisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>but since using these I no longer get that issue as much as I used to.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t really seem to floss my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Much easier to close.</li>
            <li>This floss is much stronger and holds up as i floss my teeth.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s too gentle (i.e. stretchy)</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like these</li>
            <li>After lifting her up on the counter, I use this product to remove the fuzzies and then floss her front teeth, which are very crowded together.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Too gentle for me</li>
            <li>These are so much nicer than the thinner ones.</li>
            <li>They are so gentle on my teeth.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I actually think these are much stronger than the regular kind I used to get at the store (micro mint).  </li>
            <li>The string doesn&#x27;t shred as much</li>
            <li>Much easier than flossing.</li>
            <li>But it really does work.</li>
            <li>Very durable and now my go to flossers.</li>
            <li>My teeth are really, really close together</li>
            <li>This uses a band that is much softer and does not cut gums.</li>
            <li>they get in between your teeth very well.</li>
            <li>It makes it much easier for them to floss</li>
            <li>My teeth are very close together</li>
            <li>Glides between my teeth that are very close together.</li>
            <li>I really like this flosser.</li>
            <li>and they really are gentle.</li>
            <li>I had braces so my teeth are very close together</li>
            <li>and it left my teeth junk free</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I hate flossing, I&#x27;m sure most people do (and if you don&#x27;t you are some kind of weirdo OCD psychopath</li>
            <li>The flat floss works great around my tight teeth, and doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s going to pull my veneers out (like others do).</li>
            <li>This product is good, but due to the issue listed above, I will likely be returning to a fine floss pick.</li>
            <li>These are good for touching teeth, but not great for super tight teeth.  </li>
            <li>i use other brands i like more</li>
            <li>As with all Plackers, these don&#x27;t break, which was always my frustration with many other brands.</li>
            <li>This outlasts many other products I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I have a long history of flossing regularly and these little things make it easy to do so (while on the go) without having to first make sure my hands are perfectly clean.  </li>
            <li>Great - don&#x27;t break after one use and if you disinfect after each time it is sturdy enough to reuse and be green!</li>
            <li>I feel this particular floss has too much give.</li>
            <li>This ingenious floss can be rubbed back and forth to get it in gently where most other flosses simply break.</li>
            <li>These are way better than conventional floss.</li>
            <li>It gets loose easily and scratches my mouth to bleed every time!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The floss breaks easily and when it doesn&#x27;t break, it gets loose on the corners when I pull it out from my teeth so the floss gets saggy.  </li>
            <li>The floss itself gets loose so easy</li>
            <li>Loose string, breaks easily.</li>
            <li>I ended up having to use one for the top half of my teeth, and another for the bottom, so</li>
            <li>With subscribe and save, this becomes one less thing I have to remember to buy every month, and in the end it keeps my teeth healthy.</li>
            <li>I also like the pick portion of these better since it&#x27;s slightly thicker and easier to use on my bottom teeth.</li>
            <li>I regularly have to use 2-3 Plackers in order to floss all of my teeth because they wear so quickly.</li>
            <li>The general problem with flossers is that they break easily, sometimes the instant you attempt to use them.  </li>
            <li>so he&#x27;s able to get it between his tight teeth</li>
            <li>the floss itself was more tightly bound.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend plackers gentleslide.</li>
            <li>I have these on a subscription and though the first package was a fluke, but of the first 3 Plackers used out of the most recent package 2 gave it up after a few teeth.</li>
            <li>I should also note that I have not had one of these break on me which is a sign of high quality.</li>
            <li>As a flossing nut, I Highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>It goes easily and pain free between every single one of my teeth, unlike that other purported close teeth flosser.</li>
            <li>If you have ANY tight spaces between your teeth, which most normal people do, this floss isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li>These are different than floss as you have to pull up instead of through, so if you have very tight teeth, they probably aren&#x27;t a good idea.</li>
            <li>My daughters really like these and the four year old</li>
            <li>These things give out after swiping my normal teeth areas.</li>
            <li>Tl;dr: Just buy normal</li>
            <li>the floss wire is flat thin ribbon so great for scraping food off of teeth without a scratchy feeling as with many other brands/ types.</li>
            <li>nice except floss to thick..</li>
            <li>For the many years my hygienist has urged me to floss my teeth, this product is the only one that is easy enough to use to make me floss everyday.  </li>
            <li>whereas, for the previous product i used before this one, and that was identical to this one, only required 1 to floss all my teeth and still remained nicely taut after flossing all my teeth.</li>
            <li>The floss does slide nicely in between tight teeth, but the durability is low.</li>
            <li>Also, the conventional &amp;#34;flat and wide&amp;#34; floss that&#x27;s used isn&#x27;t nearly as effective as the thin, thread-style floss used in many flossers.  </li>
            <li>The other downside is that the point at the bottom is not tucked away, so these aren&#x27;t comfortable to use by kids, or anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to accidentally poke themselves in the hand while flossing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this in our house.</li>
            <li>This picture was taken after I used a brand new flosser between two teeth.</li>
            <li>Much easier than the string in the dispenser type, much easier to reach the back and side teeth.</li>
            <li>Overall these are fine flossers if you&#x27;re not too picky and just want something that&#x27;s convenient and easy, but I personally prefer the green plackers and will continue buying those instead.</li>
            <li>The floss gets loose quick</li>
            <li>The Old Way !</li>
            <li>The floss is a bit flimsy, so I usually have to use one on my bottom teeth and another for my top teeth.</li>
            <li>not sure if my flossers are an exception, but it looks like the top part was ripped off and the package was already opened.  </li>
            <li>I prefer these over regular floss - make the habit much easier to adopt!</li>
            <li>In other words, you won&#x27;t be able to floss your entire mouth with just one.  </li>
            <li>One of these generally makes it through my whole flossing routine without a hitch.  </li>
            <li>Also, the mint flavoring is a little strong for me.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the floss of these separates easily from the plastic handle - rather than sliding easily into the gap.  </li>
            <li>My mouth doesn&#x27;t feel as clean with any other brand.</li>
            <li>Our kids (11, 9, 7 years old) love these, and they&#x27;re definitely easier than regular floss for the younger kids to learn to use.</li>
            <li>but I would prefer something with a less smooth flosser.  </li>
            <li>For the one round of cleaning, I use 5-6 of these, they easily slide out of plastic handle.</li>
            <li>Strong firm pick and handle</li>
            <li>but what other people are saying about the floss coming apart is true.</li>
            <li>If you have any tightly spaced teeth the floss will stretch and bow then pull free from where its attached to the bow.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not perfect, but it is the best I&#x27;ve found for my tight teeth.</li>
            <li>but the pick was to large and get between my teeth well enough.</li>
            <li>I bought them for my 3 year old after she swallowed regular dental floss, these have certainly solved that problem.</li>
            <li>They do &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34; between your teeth and don&#x27;t get torn up near as much as the regular ones.</li>
            <li>Even my 6yr old asked if he could start using them.</li>
            <li>(it bends so much that I can&#x27;t get it between the next teeth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, if you are looking for a flosser that is durable and will really slide between your teeth - look no further.</li>
            <li>However the pointed end is too short to be of much use to me.</li>
            <li>: 10 - thin floss, just as desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effectiveness: 10 - as much as regular floss, perhaps moreso since I can fit it better and likely do an improved job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Using these is so much easier than using regular floss.</li>
            <li>Soft on my gums.</li>
            <li>These plackers are far easier than trying to deal with floss.</li>
            <li>Buy the light green ones.</li>
            <li>Overall, pretty good, but quite a few per package that break while using between teeth with small gaps.</li>
            <li>And this breaks far too easily!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My two-year old uses these sometimes too.</li>
            <li>The regular mint one is much better.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>The attach points will also rake against your gums if you get anywhere near your molars which as it turns out is quite painful.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>They are so much easier to use for me then regular floss.</li>
            <li>Yes, I literally used the flosser once, not once for my whole mouth, not once for my upper or lower sets of teeth, I used it once for the space between two</li>
            <li>Pretty durable as long as your not using it like a jackhammer.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, husband uses these every day, several times.  </li>
            <li>I am not sure what Plackers did to their quality, but they are nowhere near as strong as they used to be.</li>
            <li>However the floss comes loose and does not last long, but they are definitely my favorite type of &amp;#34;Flossers&amp;#34; I use them every day.</li>
            <li>:  too small &amp; breaks too easily -- try Flossaid instead</li>
            <li>I like the placement of the pick, find the mint subtle and nice and they are definitely gentler.</li>
            <li>I have very small spaces between my teeth, so many brands of floss shred trying to go in.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know exactly how to explain plastic as feeling powdery, but I imagine it being similar to the feel of plastic that has be been breaking down in the hot sun for a while would feel....</li>
            <li>These slide nicely between teeth and have a very subtle mint flavor.</li>
            <li>My husband has super tight teeth and</li>
            <li>This it much larger than a normal tooth pick.</li>
            <li>these are the only ones that fit between tight teeth, for me.</li>
            <li>so you constantly have to get a new one after each tooth.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for the pokey back end to scrape your teeth, it wont, it will only poke between but it works very well for that.</li>
            <li>The floss string is sturdy but soft enough for sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>Floss breaks too easily and is too thick.</li>
            <li>The result is, when you have tight teeth, &amp;#34;it just flops around&amp;#34; and doesn&#x27;t actually get a &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; on what you&#x27;re trying to clean out of your teeth.  </li>
            <li>They seem to be a little more expensive, but they are better made (different design) and work well.</li>
            <li>Both statements are only half true.</li>
            <li>The gentleslides don&#x27;t work as well as the regular ones for me, the string gets all bent and loose as soon as I do my first molar</li>
            <li>In some spots (particularly in the back), while I&#x27;m trying to properly get the floss in between my teeth, I end up digging into my gums with the plastic part of the flosser.</li>
            <li>Simply put, it&#x27;s due to the fact the floss slipping out so easily.</li>
            <li>Remember to clear off any debris before inserting into the next space so as not to spread the bacteria around while trying to eliminate the bacteria.</li>
            <li>But one will usually last for a completely flossing.</li>
            <li>, wisdom included and these will NOT reach anywhere near the back of your mouth.  </li>
            <li>They are not too expensive, so that is nice.</li>
            <li>a little pricy over what you can get at a local super market, but they work like they&#x27;re supposed to.</li>
            <li>The reason why I do not like this product as much is because the floss stretches out so much that it is difficult to clean the because of how soft and loose it becomes.</li>
            <li>Hard to get excited about a flosser but hope this helps.</li>
            <li>and they are still consistently problematic (and no I don&#x27;t have super tight teeth or anything out of the ordinary).</li>
            <li>Much stronger than other flossers, does not break (even with use around rear molars, etc).</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s funny is that It says it&#x27;s designed for tight teeth, but I can&#x27;t even floss 3 teeth without it breaking.</li>
            <li>Better than your standard thin string variety.</li>
            <li>The string quickly becomes loose in the holder when used on tight teeth.</li>
            <li>They hold up for an entire mouth floss, but just barely.</li>
            <li>This pick is very gentle as advertise as I have never had so little gum bleeding with other picks, so it does live up to its name.</li>
            <li>They slide really well as my teeth are tightly packed.</li>
            <li>the pointer toothpick part is dumb, its too big to fit between your teeth</li>
            <li>I really like these little guys.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Interestingly, I had my dentist polish down this one tooth that was a particular shredding problem</li>
            <li>I have one area of &#x27;tight teeth&#x27; and that area does shred and make thing difficult for most flosses, picks, and plackers, BUT not my whole mouth.</li>
            <li>I also want to point out that the structure of the &amp;#34;harp&amp;#34; that the floss is strung across has large, round tips that protrude into the surrounding gums and cause pain and discomfort that doesn&#x27;t occur with regular Plackers.</li>
            <li>The strings don&#x27;t cut into your gums when they snap down past the tight squeeze between the teeth, which is really nice.</li>

            <li> Love these!</li>
            <li> Much better! http://www.amazon.com/Plackers-Twin-Whitening-Floss-Picks-75/dp/B004RSXOCW/</li>
            <li> My favorite flossers!  </li>
            <li> this is your ticket to healthier teeth and one of the more pleasant dentist visits you&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> On the bright side, I love the toothpick at the end of these.</li>
            <li> These are amazing.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tasted the mint flavor very well but these things are durable and work great!</li>
            <li> The pick end hods up nice and doesn&#x27;t bend immediately.</li>
            <li> good price, have re-purchased many times.</li>
            <li> I like the gum brand better but the subscribe and save price on these was really good.</li>
            <li> THEY ARE NICE AND STURDY AND ONE,TWO</li>
            <li> These are extremely nice Plackers that I have never seen in the store.</li>
            <li> but these kind of suck.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s nice to not have to worry about running out of them.</li>
            <li> These are handier for manual flossing but not as effective as the Flossaid</li>
            <li> I like the pick at the bottom of it too as a nice added bonus.</li>
            <li> Very nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Nice And Strong !</li>
            <li> The floss isn&#x27;t very strong.</li>
            <li> The floss isn&#x27;t very strong.</li>
            <li> So Easy To Keep Around !</li>
            <li> but after I got these, I floss every night since it&#x27;s so easy now!</li>
            <li> This breaks so easily!</li>
            <li> I have tried every kind of flosser and the Plackers brand is definitely the best.</li>
            <li> Take it from someone who has used several brands of these kind of flossers -- these are great!  </li>
            <li> These are nice and smooth and they don&#x27;t shred very easily.</li>
            <li> Very cheap design and construction.  </li>
            <li> Nice &amp; strong - won&#x27;t break during use.  </li>
            <li> I love these things.</li>
            <li> how many times the string broke.</li>
            <li> I like GUM brand better</li>
            <li> Will gladly do business again &amp; again &amp; again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great product for the price and very convenient.</li>
            <li> They do an ok job, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase them again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many styles of Plackers brand flossers.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love these.</li>
            <li> These work great &amp; are very sturdy.</li>
            <li> I love these WILL BUY again.</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s faster, more convenient, and does a better job of flossing.</li>
            <li> THE MOST, WILL DO THE TRICK.</li>
            <li> Sure, it doesn&#x27;t stay taught, but that hasn&#x27;t impacted my use.</li>
            <li> the floss string looses its tension real quick</li>
            <li> /&gt;Plackers has better floss than this one, save your money.</li>
            <li> Best way to floss regularly.</li>
            <li> These make it a bit more bearable.</li>
            <li> I know most dogs don&#x27;t know how to sit still for dental care</li>
            <li> These are okay for the price.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m sure of it).</li>
            <li> There are definitely better options.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t cut my gums and are more resistant to fraying.</li>
            <li> You need more than one to finish each time you floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love these</li>
            <li> The dual Plackers are way better</li>
            <li> I bought a Waterpik instead and love it.</li>
            <li> I love the ribbon floss that is used.</li>
            <li> The floss part is okay.</li>
            <li> They are better than nothing.</li>
            <li> i simply love these.</li>
            <li> way better</li>
            <li> It makes me wonder if the manufacturer does it on purpose to make you buy more of their product more often.</li>
            <li> Love these things.  </li>
            <li> Not the most durable.</li>
            <li> one redeeming factor about this Flosser is the toothpick feature.  </li>
            <li> I love these and these and my monthly add on item</li>
            <li> I love these, gets the job done.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite flossers.</li>
            <li> Much better than cheaper brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it helps keep our gums and teeth healthy.</li>
            <li> there are better brands.</li>
            <li> better dental checkups.</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s no nasty feeling on your fingers!</li>
            <li> I love these flossers.  </li>
            <li> mostly care about the flossing functionality, but I&#x27;ve docked a star for the tartar pick, since it is mentioned as a feature of the product.  </li>
            <li> This works better.</li>
            <li> How Long On Perfect Teeth ?</li>
            <li> Pretty good.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and even better than using a water flosser.</li>
            <li> I love the easy to use flosser&#x27;s in of wax dental string</li>
            <li> I am enjoying the mint flavor and the floss (which is the most important part) holds up well during use.  </li>
            <li> These picks will last you and most certainly clean your teeth out the best, for a person with a wire in my teeth I could give the floss in between just fine</li>
            <li> I purchased the Plackers Gentle Fine (http://amzn.to/1muHuqT) and they are amazing!  </li>
            <li> A bit more civilized and easier to use.</li>
            <li> not as good quality as the gentle glide tooth pickers....</li>
            <li> These leave a fresh flavor and there is a handy pick on the end.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been very happy with other Plackers, I thought I would like these also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of other flossers and in my opinion these are the best out there.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased the Plackers floss in other varieties before and have been very happy.</li>
            <li> super easy and convenient!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my 3rd order, maybe more...VERY happy with this product and LOVE</li>
            <li> Goes between easy</li>
            <li> Tried another brand and the floss would break very quickly.  </li>
            <li> The floss frayed easily</li>
            <li> It does, rather easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to throw one or two in your pocket, purse, etc and use it after you eat.</li>
            <li> Too think and they break easily.</li>
            <li> These flossers slide easily through all of my teeth, and taste/smell like mint, which I like.  </li>
            <li> the floss breaks too easily</li>
            <li> The tartar pick is easy to use as well.</li>
            <li> Easy to hold.</li>
            <li> Easy on gums</li>
            <li> Break apart easily.</li>
            <li> but that is easy to remove.</li>
            <li> The floss isn&#x27;t quite as taught as I would like it to be, they stretch out or snap fairly easily.</li>
            <li> easy to use and does not cut gum line.</li>
            <li> but they do stretch out a bit too easy.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and helps me to floss each day.</li>
            <li> These ones don&#x27;t bend as your using them like some others do and the floss does not break easily.</li>
            <li> They also are easy to grip.</li>
            <li> The pieces are easy to hold on to,</li>
            <li> Easy And Quick !</li>
            <li> They deliver great cleaning, and the pick at the other end is a nice addition.</li>
            <li> Otherwise good quality, I got a different one from same company and am very happy.</li>
            <li> I like these so much better than floss, quick and easy.</li>
            <li> Hands Down - The Best!</li>
            <li> THESE FLOSSERS WILL WORK FINE.</li>
            <li> The floss is a fine thickness and works well for</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m on the flossing bandwagon, and these things are super easy to use and very minty (in a good way).</li>
            <li> These are cheap for a reason.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t tear, the tread free itself from plastic flesh.</li>
            <li> While I appreciate the price and free shipping of these flossers on Amazon&#x27;s subscribe and save, the ribbon used on each flosser loosens up between every tooth.  </li>
            <li> Pretty good, recently I switched from Oral-B Glide 3d to Plackers and I am pretty happy with the quality of this floss.</li>
            <li> I keep them in my car since it is important to floss once a day.  </li>
            <li> great item to maintain personal hygiene.</li>
            <li> If I manage to finagle it between my teeth through a series of precise finesses, it just pulls apart when I extract it.</li>
            <li> I use them everyday, one of the best</li>
            <li> You can tell they are extremely cheaply made and</li>
            <li> The green ones are the best don&#x27;t buy this one</li>
            <li> No shredding and they are waxed to fit between the smallest of spaces between teeth.</li>
            <li> Think about the cheap string floss that your dentist provides you after every visit.</li>
            <li> Works great instead of trying to maneuver man hands into mouth with regular floss.  </li>
            <li> Love these they gently slide between my gums these are my favorite plackers and ive tried them all.</li>
            <li> super fine and easy to slide in and out</li>
            <li> /&gt;I cannot suggest more strongly that you avoid these at all costs and get the Gentle Fine instead.</li>
            <li> I have very tight teeth, and these flossers used to work perfectly.</li>
            <li> They might work great if you have well-spaced out teeth, but mine are pretty normal, and these just wore out way too quickly.</li>
            <li> But more importantly, it&#x27;s just easier and more enjoyable to floss with these flossers as compared to traditional flossing.</li>
            <li> If you have tight teeth and hurts to floss...these are amazing!!</li>
            <li> brand is a good brand in general.</li>
            <li> and it does not break easily as I have experienced with other products.</li>
            <li> but you can clean your teeth with one hand.</li>
            <li> I use them at work, or at home when I want to clean my teeth while doing something else.</li>
            <li> and I probably should have gotten this from the name but the flossing material is super smooth</li>
            <li> but they can be trained to allow you to clean and floss their teeth.</li>
            <li> Super cheap.</li>
            <li> I only bought them because the most popular brand was no longer offered on the automatic shipping program.</li>
            <li> Mmmmm.... clean teeth.</li>
            <li> Fine personal hygiene product at fair price delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> They are pretty comfortable to use and looks strong.</li>
            <li> Slides easily to resist shredding or breaking.&amp;#34; This is what it says right on the bag.</li>
            <li> I have it saved as my favorite product &amp; will continue to re-order, as long as it is available!!</li>
            <li> Much more convenient than &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; floss - helps you get to back teeth more easily.</li>
            <li> They work well and are slightly more gentle on my gums</li>
            <li> Effective and easy to use; especially like the mint flavor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To make both our dentist and my husband happy, he settled on this other Plackers variety:</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other types of Plackers before and they&#x27;ve worked great.</li>
            <li> These work great and the tips and floss don&#x27;t break as easily as other brands we tried.</li>
            <li> I was able to find 120 packs for 99 cents consistently at most local groceries stores.</li>
            <li> They have lost a loyal customer.</li>
            <li> The flavor is extremely mild, too.</li>
            <li> The regular ones, which are a bit cheaper are ok but these are so much better.</li>
            <li> Super price.</li>
            <li> Once this is completed, I set her down and she bounces off, tail wagging happily.    </li>
            <li> works great on our tight teeth, no snagging or ramming into gums</li>
            <li> These are also great since they are for tight teeth.</li>
            <li> These flossers work great if you have some teeth that are tight.</li>
            <li> (Plackers gentle fine dental flossers)</li>
            <li> The little stinger on the end is great for poking out chunks of food too.</li>
            <li> My favorite one goes to Oral B complete</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find that I like these even more.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:aaf8200bba875cdd2e8c14691b186a81]]I rarely give something a 1 star.</li>
            <li> We also have one of those water flossers, which is nice but can be messy, and use these more often.</li>
            <li> Pick can be useful.</li>
            <li> And finally the curved tip makes a great toothpick to help complete the flossing process.  </li>
            <li> Sooo much more comfortable than the floss picks with a regular string/thread.</li>
            <li> The pick is useful but it sticks out and pokes you when you are trying to floss.</li>
            <li> These fit between my teeth better than the last bag I got from the grocery store and lost during travel.</li>
            <li> Pick is also useful.</li>
            <li> They clean better and hold up better to my teeth, some of which are tightly spaced.</li>
            <li> He uses these daily &amp; gets a clean bill of sale from the dentist:-)</li>
            <li> buy when the price is right</li>
            <li> Plackers Right Angle, 75 ea]]</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s less pleasant.</li>
            <li> Double string, very very strong.</li>
            <li> These are very strong, so even when they get stuck between your teeth, they don&#x27;t tear, which can sometimes be a issue with regular floss.</li>
            <li> These are fine and great if you have sensitive gums and tight spaces between your teeth, as they won&#x27;t shred, but I think it&#x27;s too slippery and loose to make me feel like I&#x27;m really getting a good flossing and</li>
            <li> The other kind of floss would break once in a great while (maybe two or three in a pack of 75), but since these are thicker, they are much more durable and haven&#x27;t broken once.</li>
            <li> NO other brand has that same kind of hook that gets in &amp; gets out that food particle at is in a hard-to-reach place!</li>
            <li> these are not near as good as glide type, and they both seem to break the same, this one just does not go between teeth as easily as glide</li>
            <li> I wish the tooth pick at the back and was bigger but for what it is it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Definitely not the best choice if you have uneven, floss-destroying teeth like mine</li>
            <li> Flat And Easy To Hide !</li>
            <li> anything that gets me and my 4 year old to floss easier is fine by me.</li>
            <li> Pretty good, sometimes they break because of the tight space between teeth.</li>
            <li> These are great especially if your teeth are a tight fit like mine.</li>
            <li> And this particular variety is definitely more gentle than the twin-line which is the one I normally use.</li>
            <li> but overall I&#x27;ve had better.</li>
            <li> Thank you for your fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon !</li>
            <li> Work great, don&#x27;t shred, but I do feel like they&#x27;re a bit thick.</li>
            <li> We tried these, and while the floss is larger (so you&#x27;d think it would give it more strength)</li>
            <li> The floss consistently slips out of the mount nearest the pick end, sometimes on the first use.</li>
            <li> Most of them broke apart while I was flossing, going to try a different brand.</li>
            <li> Makes flossing so much easier!</li>
            <li> I have found better single-use flossers, but I can&#x27;t recall the brand (I know, big help!)</li>
            <li> I rather stick to regular floss, much more efficient.</li>
            <li> I have used many different floss picks and never had one break until using this brand.</li>
            <li> These are used daily in our home and much better than pulling off floss.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the green Plackers.</li>
            <li> I give it 3 stars because we recieved a few packages that were good but</li>
            <li> Nothing as good as the green ones.  </li>
            <li> My most exceptional little Shih Tzu (grin) must be part human.</li>
            <li> These little fellas are totally awesome for the lazy Americans such as myself who want their dentists to not look at them with a shameful tone when they ask the question that you both already know the answer to: &amp;#34;no, I do not floss daily.&amp;#34; I still don&#x27;t floss daily, because who has time, but these flossers make me much more apt to take assault on my gum line on a more regular basis.</li>
            <li> The pick at the end is handy but sharp.</li>
            <li> The pick at the other end of the handle is definitely nice to have though.</li>
            <li> Love em but could not find them locally, They clean well and have a nice &amp;#34;pick&amp;#34; for those hard to get to places.</li>
            <li> Dental picks in general make it more convenient compared to normal floss.</li>
            <li> The green ones have a smaller floss which I feel are more effective at scraping between teeth and getting everything out.</li>
            <li> Some floss sticks shred into uselessness easily, requiring multiple sticks per session, but</li>
            <li> Overall these get the job done and are easy to pack and bring along with you.</li>
            <li> /&gt;One thing to note:  On the back of the package it calls out as a feature &amp;#34;Slides easily to resist shredding or breaking&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> The floss breaks quite easily, resulting in multiple picks being used per flossing session - wasteful!</li>
            <li> Strong enought not to break yet efficent and well made enough not to damage your gums.</li>
            <li> pick tends to be too large to use as a pick.</li>
            <li> Once in a while I get a flosser that works as it should, but more often than not it breaks or gets loose.  </li>
            <li> Advertised for tight teeth, it is being honest, as I have always had an issue with the bottom row of teeth being too close, but with these I do not.</li>
            <li> This kind for tight teeth are just junk.</li>
            <li> These work just as good as the more expensive packs, and you get more for less.</li>
            <li> So these are spectacular: I don&#x27;t really notice the mint flavor, which doesn&#x27;t matter too much, but the string is strong and thin.</li>
            <li> clean nearly as well as the normal ones.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&amp;#34;Slides easily to resist shredding or breaking.&amp;#34; While it is true that the floss neither shreds nor breaks, it is not true that the flosser itself doesn&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t break and are smooth enough to be gentle on the gums</li>
            <li> and I end up going through 3-4 of these just to floss my whole mouth</li>
            <li> I do really like the pick and the handle on this model.</li>
            <li> I am very dissatisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> but since using these I no longer get that issue as much as I used to.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t really seem to floss my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Much easier to close.</li>
            <li> This floss is much stronger and holds up as i floss my teeth.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too gentle (i.e. stretchy)</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like these</li>
            <li> After lifting her up on the counter, I use this product to remove the fuzzies and then floss her front teeth, which are very crowded together.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Too gentle for me</li>
            <li> These are so much nicer than the thinner ones.</li>
            <li> They are so gentle on my teeth.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I actually think these are much stronger than the regular kind I used to get at the store (micro mint).  </li>
            <li> The string doesn&#x27;t shred as much</li>
            <li> Much easier than flossing.</li>
            <li> But it really does work.</li>
            <li> Very durable and now my go to flossers.</li>
            <li> My teeth are really, really close together</li>
            <li> This uses a band that is much softer and does not cut gums.</li>
            <li> they get in between your teeth very well.</li>
            <li> It makes it much easier for them to floss</li>
            <li> My teeth are very close together</li>
            <li> Glides between my teeth that are very close together.</li>
            <li> I really like this flosser.</li>
            <li> and they really are gentle.</li>
            <li> I had braces so my teeth are very close together</li>
            <li> and it left my teeth junk free</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I hate flossing, I&#x27;m sure most people do (and if you don&#x27;t you are some kind of weirdo OCD psychopath</li>
            <li> The flat floss works great around my tight teeth, and doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s going to pull my veneers out (like others do).</li>
            <li> This product is good, but due to the issue listed above, I will likely be returning to a fine floss pick.</li>
            <li> These are good for touching teeth, but not great for super tight teeth.  </li>
            <li> i use other brands i like more</li>
            <li> As with all Plackers, these don&#x27;t break, which was always my frustration with many other brands.</li>
            <li> This outlasts many other products I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I have a long history of flossing regularly and these little things make it easy to do so (while on the go) without having to first make sure my hands are perfectly clean.  </li>
            <li> Great - don&#x27;t break after one use and if you disinfect after each time it is sturdy enough to reuse and be green!</li>
            <li> I feel this particular floss has too much give.</li>
            <li> This ingenious floss can be rubbed back and forth to get it in gently where most other flosses simply break.</li>
            <li> These are way better than conventional floss.</li>
            <li> It gets loose easily and scratches my mouth to bleed every time!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The floss breaks easily and when it doesn&#x27;t break, it gets loose on the corners when I pull it out from my teeth so the floss gets saggy.  </li>
            <li> The floss itself gets loose so easy</li>
            <li> Loose string, breaks easily.</li>
            <li> I ended up having to use one for the top half of my teeth, and another for the bottom, so</li>
            <li> With subscribe and save, this becomes one less thing I have to remember to buy every month, and in the end it keeps my teeth healthy.</li>
            <li> I also like the pick portion of these better since it&#x27;s slightly thicker and easier to use on my bottom teeth.</li>
            <li> I regularly have to use 2-3 Plackers in order to floss all of my teeth because they wear so quickly.</li>
            <li> The general problem with flossers is that they break easily, sometimes the instant you attempt to use them.  </li>
            <li> so he&#x27;s able to get it between his tight teeth</li>
            <li> the floss itself was more tightly bound.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend plackers gentleslide.</li>
            <li> I have these on a subscription and though the first package was a fluke, but of the first 3 Plackers used out of the most recent package 2 gave it up after a few teeth.</li>
            <li> I should also note that I have not had one of these break on me which is a sign of high quality.</li>
            <li> As a flossing nut, I Highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> It goes easily and pain free between every single one of my teeth, unlike that other purported close teeth flosser.</li>
            <li> If you have ANY tight spaces between your teeth, which most normal people do, this floss isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> These are different than floss as you have to pull up instead of through, so if you have very tight teeth, they probably aren&#x27;t a good idea.</li>
            <li> My daughters really like these and the four year old</li>
            <li> These things give out after swiping my normal teeth areas.</li>
            <li> Tl;dr: Just buy normal</li>
            <li> the floss wire is flat thin ribbon so great for scraping food off of teeth without a scratchy feeling as with many other brands/ types.</li>
            <li> nice except floss to thick..</li>
            <li> For the many years my hygienist has urged me to floss my teeth, this product is the only one that is easy enough to use to make me floss everyday.  </li>
            <li> whereas, for the previous product i used before this one, and that was identical to this one, only required 1 to floss all my teeth and still remained nicely taut after flossing all my teeth.</li>
            <li> The floss does slide nicely in between tight teeth, but the durability is low.</li>
            <li> Also, the conventional &amp;#34;flat and wide&amp;#34; floss that&#x27;s used isn&#x27;t nearly as effective as the thin, thread-style floss used in many flossers.  </li>
            <li> The other downside is that the point at the bottom is not tucked away, so these aren&#x27;t comfortable to use by kids, or anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to accidentally poke themselves in the hand while flossing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this in our house.</li>
            <li> This picture was taken after I used a brand new flosser between two teeth.</li>
            <li> Much easier than the string in the dispenser type, much easier to reach the back and side teeth.</li>
            <li> Overall these are fine flossers if you&#x27;re not too picky and just want something that&#x27;s convenient and easy, but I personally prefer the green plackers and will continue buying those instead.</li>
            <li> The floss gets loose quick</li>
            <li> The Old Way !</li>
            <li> The floss is a bit flimsy, so I usually have to use one on my bottom teeth and another for my top teeth.</li>
            <li> not sure if my flossers are an exception, but it looks like the top part was ripped off and the package was already opened.  </li>
            <li> I prefer these over regular floss - make the habit much easier to adopt!</li>
            <li> In other words, you won&#x27;t be able to floss your entire mouth with just one.  </li>
            <li> One of these generally makes it through my whole flossing routine without a hitch.  </li>
            <li> Also, the mint flavoring is a little strong for me.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the floss of these separates easily from the plastic handle - rather than sliding easily into the gap.  </li>
            <li> My mouth doesn&#x27;t feel as clean with any other brand.</li>
            <li> Our kids (11, 9, 7 years old) love these, and they&#x27;re definitely easier than regular floss for the younger kids to learn to use.</li>
            <li> but I would prefer something with a less smooth flosser.  </li>
            <li> For the one round of cleaning, I use 5-6 of these, they easily slide out of plastic handle.</li>
            <li> Strong firm pick and handle</li>
            <li> but what other people are saying about the floss coming apart is true.</li>
            <li> If you have any tightly spaced teeth the floss will stretch and bow then pull free from where its attached to the bow.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect, but it is the best I&#x27;ve found for my tight teeth.</li>
            <li> but the pick was to large and get between my teeth well enough.</li>
            <li> I bought them for my 3 year old after she swallowed regular dental floss, these have certainly solved that problem.</li>
            <li> They do &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34; between your teeth and don&#x27;t get torn up near as much as the regular ones.</li>
            <li> Even my 6yr old asked if he could start using them.</li>
            <li> (it bends so much that I can&#x27;t get it between the next teeth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, if you are looking for a flosser that is durable and will really slide between your teeth - look no further.</li>
            <li> However the pointed end is too short to be of much use to me.</li>
            <li> : 10 - thin floss, just as desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effectiveness: 10 - as much as regular floss, perhaps moreso since I can fit it better and likely do an improved job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Using these is so much easier than using regular floss.</li>
            <li> Soft on my gums.</li>
            <li> These plackers are far easier than trying to deal with floss.</li>
            <li> Buy the light green ones.</li>
            <li> Overall, pretty good, but quite a few per package that break while using between teeth with small gaps.</li>
            <li> And this breaks far too easily!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My two-year old uses these sometimes too.</li>
            <li> The regular mint one is much better.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> The attach points will also rake against your gums if you get anywhere near your molars which as it turns out is quite painful.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> They are so much easier to use for me then regular floss.</li>
            <li> Yes, I literally used the flosser once, not once for my whole mouth, not once for my upper or lower sets of teeth, I used it once for the space between two</li>
            <li> Pretty durable as long as your not using it like a jackhammer.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, husband uses these every day, several times.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure what Plackers did to their quality, but they are nowhere near as strong as they used to be.</li>
            <li> However the floss comes loose and does not last long, but they are definitely my favorite type of &amp;#34;Flossers&amp;#34; I use them every day.</li>
            <li> :  too small &amp; breaks too easily -- try Flossaid instead</li>
            <li> I like the placement of the pick, find the mint subtle and nice and they are definitely gentler.</li>
            <li> I have very small spaces between my teeth, so many brands of floss shred trying to go in.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know exactly how to explain plastic as feeling powdery, but I imagine it being similar to the feel of plastic that has be been breaking down in the hot sun for a while would feel....</li>
            <li> These slide nicely between teeth and have a very subtle mint flavor.</li>
            <li> My husband has super tight teeth and</li>
            <li> This it much larger than a normal tooth pick.</li>
            <li> these are the only ones that fit between tight teeth, for me.</li>
            <li> so you constantly have to get a new one after each tooth.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for the pokey back end to scrape your teeth, it wont, it will only poke between but it works very well for that.</li>
            <li> The floss string is sturdy but soft enough for sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> Floss breaks too easily and is too thick.</li>
            <li> The result is, when you have tight teeth, &amp;#34;it just flops around&amp;#34; and doesn&#x27;t actually get a &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; on what you&#x27;re trying to clean out of your teeth.  </li>
            <li> They seem to be a little more expensive, but they are better made (different design) and work well.</li>
            <li> Both statements are only half true.</li>
            <li> The gentleslides don&#x27;t work as well as the regular ones for me, the string gets all bent and loose as soon as I do my first molar</li>
            <li> In some spots (particularly in the back), while I&#x27;m trying to properly get the floss in between my teeth, I end up digging into my gums with the plastic part of the flosser.</li>
            <li> Simply put, it&#x27;s due to the fact the floss slipping out so easily.</li>
            <li> Remember to clear off any debris before inserting into the next space so as not to spread the bacteria around while trying to eliminate the bacteria.</li>
            <li> But one will usually last for a completely flossing.</li>
            <li> , wisdom included and these will NOT reach anywhere near the back of your mouth.  </li>
            <li> They are not too expensive, so that is nice.</li>
            <li> a little pricy over what you can get at a local super market, but they work like they&#x27;re supposed to.</li>
            <li> The reason why I do not like this product as much is because the floss stretches out so much that it is difficult to clean the because of how soft and loose it becomes.</li>
            <li> Hard to get excited about a flosser but hope this helps.</li>
            <li> and they are still consistently problematic (and no I don&#x27;t have super tight teeth or anything out of the ordinary).</li>
            <li> Much stronger than other flossers, does not break (even with use around rear molars, etc).</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s funny is that It says it&#x27;s designed for tight teeth, but I can&#x27;t even floss 3 teeth without it breaking.</li>
            <li> Better than your standard thin string variety.</li>
            <li> The string quickly becomes loose in the holder when used on tight teeth.</li>
            <li> They hold up for an entire mouth floss, but just barely.</li>
            <li> This pick is very gentle as advertise as I have never had so little gum bleeding with other picks, so it does live up to its name.</li>
            <li> They slide really well as my teeth are tightly packed.</li>
            <li> the pointer toothpick part is dumb, its too big to fit between your teeth</li>
            <li> I really like these little guys.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Interestingly, I had my dentist polish down this one tooth that was a particular shredding problem</li>
            <li> I have one area of &#x27;tight teeth&#x27; and that area does shred and make thing difficult for most flosses, picks, and plackers, BUT not my whole mouth.</li>
            <li> I also want to point out that the structure of the &amp;#34;harp&amp;#34; that the floss is strung across has large, round tips that protrude into the surrounding gums and cause pain and discomfort that doesn&#x27;t occur with regular Plackers.</li>
            <li> The strings don&#x27;t cut into your gums when they snap down past the tight squeeze between the teeth, which is really nice.</li>
            <li> The floss is not strong and bends too much while flossing.  </li>
            <li> Even other Plackers brand flossers don&#x27;t work nearly as well.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite little flossers, cause I have some really tight teeth, and they slide with little effort.  </li>
            <li> I have very tight interfaces between my molars and these work very well in getting between them.  </li>
            <li> end pick is also shaped differently, but it&#x27;s too small to be of real use and instead gets in the way.  </li>
            <li> At first, it felt like the floss was really thick, but that actually created a smoother feel and is gentler on gums.</li>
            <li> received so fast as usual with amazon.</li>
            <li> They work for the first two teeth, then the floss becomes slack and is not effective.  </li>
            <li> and it comes apart, or drags out of the holder long enough so that you can no longer use in between your teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Floss is very weak, snaps and stretches way too easily.</li>
            <li> the cost actually was actually double what I expected per use.  </li>
            <li> The strips are too wide so can&#x27;t get deep enough around the tooth.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the floss can break/stretch after only a few teeth, but on average I can get away with 1-2 flossers to cover the whole mouth.</li>
            <li> Sometimes comes loose in the back molars.</li>
            <li> In the future I would probably only keep these for travel/emergency purposes only and continue to use standard string floss for everyday use at home.</li>
            <li> With a normal toothpick you can get grossly between the teeth, or at least close to it.</li>
            <li> but i will be careful next time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are about 3.5 inches long (~8.5 cm)</li>
            <li> The string is stretched by the time I get to my molars.</li>
            <li> The floss gets stretched out before you&#x27;re done flossing.</li>
            <li> Each floss stick is 3 1/4 inches long.  </li>
            <li> and so I, for one, will be returning to using regular Plackers even though extra effort is required to get the flossing string between tightly spaced teeth.</li>
            <li> My dentist says it&#x27;s inevitable due to the closeness of the teeth</li>
            <li> I will grant that there was no shredding, which is not exactly the highest achievement considering this is made entirely of plastic.</li>
            <li> However, other \\&quot;models\\&quot; within this brand don&#x27;t seem to have a similar issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Price in local stores is much better, not sure why this is so expensive.</li>
            <li> These are sturdy and the floss does not break off every 3rd tooth like some other brands.</li>
            <li> I often have to use two in a single session to floss between all my teeth.  </li>
            <li> , I have yet to have the handle or floss break on a single one.</li>
            <li> These were so fragile that it took 5 on average to floss one time.</li>
            <li> They get so loose after one use in one spot.</li>
            <li> As reviewed by others these picks become too loose after a couple of flossing.</li>
            <li> The string comes loose from the holder or breaks while flossing.</li>
            <li> A sawing motion typically works to allow the floss to pass through, but occasionally, it just breaks.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say -at least- half of the time it breaks before I finish my whole mouth.</li>
            <li> The floss itself isn&#x27;t bound tight enough.</li>
            <li> Next, the floss fits well between my tight teeth without breaking or getting caught.</li>
            <li> If you scroll over the picture of the back of the package it reads very clearly in the left bottom corner &amp;#34;Made in China.&amp;#34; Needless to say I am removing them from my subscription list.</li>
            <li> They are just a little to big for my mouth.</li>
            <li> You can put one inside of a plastic baggy in your wallet or throw one in your backpocket to take with you to dinner or keep the bag in your glovebox or center car holder.</li>
            <li> I have to be careful or they break</li>
            <li> Floss keeps slipping out of the molded plastic handle.  </li>
            <li> The green Plackers has stronger string, these white Plackers still break between my teeth.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to poke your cheek.  </li>
            <li> and I guess there are some rough edges</li>
            <li> The edges aren&#x27;t held in as tightly as other similar flossers and stops being taught after a few teeth.  </li>
            <li> my daughter is crazy about her teeth and after every meal she has to floss and clean her teeth.</li>
            <li> Same as advertised, it has a faint minty taste, and the floss doesn&#x27;t break easily, nor it is too thin.</li>
            <li> Takes Rough Teeth To Hurt These !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also exposed, unlike the other Plackers varieties, so you&#x27;re getting poked in the palm again.  </li>
            <li> The handle design on these white Plackers pokes me and is annoying, green Placker&#x27;s handle is much better.</li>
            <li> I have not encountered this problem with other brands and recommend going with an alternative rather than this product.</li>
            <li> Where the two ends of the floss are attached to the plastic there are pieces of plastic that are sharp and stick out.</li>
            <li> The welds holding the thread at each end is so sharp it cuts the inside of my lip.  </li>
            <li> I like Glide, but Plackers has changed the flosser&#x27;s handle and now the tip is sharp (for picking I guess)</li>
            <li> then other brands I tried.</li>
            <li> i ordered these because i ran out of my other ones.</li>
            <li> Also, the pick end is really sharp and it hurts.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other flossers and none of them are quite like this one.</li>
            <li> A lot of other ones get stuck, but not these.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands/types and these do not stack up.</li>
            <li> Other well known brands are abrasive and even break at times.</li>
            <li> I find it hard to use these as my mouth is small and dies not open wide enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Plackers that come in the blue bag and those are tough enough to get the job done.</li>
            <li> These are actually *harder* to insert into tight gaps because they stretch</li>
            <li> But, I find that I have to be careful with these or they will break when pushed between tight teeth.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that there always seems to be a sharp spot on the plastic</li>
            <li> The plastic is rigid and feels gross against my teeth and gums - hard, yet sort of brittle and powdery.  </li>
            <li> I chose these due to being advertised for tightly spaced teeth, but unfortunately, the nature of the flat ribbon, unlike the tight string of regular Plackers, caused it to sag and make it harder and harder with each space flossed to maneuver the tape between teeth, as it became quite loose and flimsy and shapeless.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not a fun sensation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been as delicate as possible with these</li>
            <li> Average flossers.</li>
            <li> Most people hate flossing (myself included).</li>
            <li> that the floss didn&#x27;t actually break, but it was so thick that it would push my teeth apart</li>
            <li> This may be due to the fact that I have tight teeth.</li>
            <li> Almost Every time I use these they cut up my checks and mouth by my tounge because they all have little sharp plastic burs from the mold when they were manufactured.  </li>
            <li> The tail of the flosser poked my palm and the edge of floss is very sharp and poked my mouth.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the pic could be a little thinner for us people with crammed teeth.</li>
            <li> i would have to say that after using many different floss products, this is hands down the worst one i&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> and it has the hidden pick.</li>
            <li> I have a few fillings that go down the side of the tooth in the interface</li>
            <li> In-between my tight teeth and never break.</li>
            <li> My husband has tight teeth, so the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; Plackers got stuck often.  </li>
            <li> IF YOU HAVE &#x27;TIGHT&#x27; TEETH</li>
            <li> /&gt;&amp;#34;Gently flosses between tight teeth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&amp;#34;Gently flosses between tight teeth.&amp;#34; Yeah, it would if it could get between them.</li>
            <li> They will break in between tight spots.</li>
            <li> I use the twin-line flossers as a rule, but wanted to try these as some of my teeth have tight gaps.  </li>
            <li> I have tight teeth</li>
            <li> Sometimes I need 2 flossers to get the job done, my teeth are not THAT tight together.</li>
            <li> These do not work if you have really tight teeth.</li>
            <li> Unless you have extremely tight teeth, go with the Plackers Micro Mint...</li>
            <li> As advertised, these slide between my tight teeth as well as any floss I have used.</li>
            <li> I have tight teeth.</li>
            <li> They say they are for tight teeth yet on broke and was stuck in my teeth...</li>
            <li> I have not used a single ONE of these flossers that did not stretch, and at least half of them break.  </li>
            <li> Makes flossing easy for those of us that hate it.</li>
            <li> The floss material is like a slippery ribbon that does not clean the plaque off of the inside of your teeth.</li>
            <li> This is a neat invention that will improve one&#x27;s dental hygiene with little effort.</li>
            <li> My past experience with other styles is the floss breaks, but never slips out of its holder.</li>
            <li> I have little space between my teeth, so it can take a bit of force to get the floss to my gumline.</li>
            <li> Evidently my little princess knows this and even asks for ickies to be removed from her teeth.</li>
            <li> I find these to be no better than other glide floss type flossers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It fits tighter teeth a LITTLE bit easier&lt;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as though you can detach the little waxed string and toss the plastic piece into the recycling bin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a little bit of one break off before too.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately these break so easily, they are almost useless.</li>
            <li> the slipperyness can make it tough to get big pieces of food out of your teeth.</li>
            <li> Flossing isn&#x27;t too bad with these but the pick at the end is too thick to really use properly.</li>
            <li> I always disliked flossing because well, it took time and it made my gums bleed, not to mention...</li>
            <li> I wanted gentleslide but got something else (the green packaging Plackers) instead.</li>
            <li> These are thin enough that they go in with no problems.</li>
            <li> I have been buying these Flossers for a few years now.</li>
            <li> I do however like the Plackers in the green packages (mint).</li>
            <li> These get the job done and work well, however I prefer the green plackers.</li>
            <li> If there was a thin floss version from Plackers, I would definitely buy them.</li>
            <li> I keep a few tucked inside my purse for this reason.  </li>
            <li> Then I tried another kind, and it was awful.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s been less severe as in the past.</li>
            <li> I thought if I buy this, I would become less lazy to floss</li>
            <li> (A typical flossing session goes through 2-3 of these usually.</li>
            <li> They are flimsy, and the floss in each flosser is weak and gets stretched out about 1/3 of the way through flossing my teeth.</li>
            <li> The floss itself is like a thin flat piece of plastic so instead of it providing friction to remove plaque, it seems to just rub it into your teeth.</li>
            <li> I am use the picks having fairly stiff non-stretchable floss.</li>
            <li> Every single flosser out of the bag I purchased have broken within seconds, even between teeth that aren&#x27;t particularly tight.</li>
            <li> Very odd shape at the tip.</li>
            <li> have big fingers that make it nearly impossible for me to manually floss my back teeth.  </li>
            <li> A must have for tight teeth!</li>
            <li> The mint flavor lasts through at least half of the flossing procedure.  </li>
            <li> Unlike all the other Plackers products that my family adores, we were disappointed in this particular variety.  </li>
            <li> so I usually have to use two of these at a time.</li>
            <li> not sure what to do with a used package.</li>
            <li> No need to stop at the store, waste gas and time anymore!</li>
            <li> I carry them in a small container in my purse.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid any benefit provided by this version of Plackers is far outweighed by the disadvantages</li>
            <li> Floss picks make flossing easier and save your skin from the pressure applied by having ordinary dental floss wrapped around your fingers.</li>
            <li> No more lost floss pieces.</li>
            <li> so u usually have to use two each time I floss.</li>
            <li> The floss is very weak and becomes loose after just a few teeth</li>
            <li> Getting between the back teeth can be a little awkward though, but I think that would be the case with any floss stuck on a plastic handle.  </li>
            <li> I hate flossing and am terrible at remembering to do it, so these are great for on the go!</li>
            <li> , you get a small hook, followed by a thick body tool.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why I didn&#x27;t notice the negative reviews before I ordered this bag....</li>
            <li> I have very crooked teeth that are hard to floss these hold up well and work!!!</li>
            <li> but then I have very tight teeth!</li>
            <li> you can hardly use it any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But now, I go through at least two trying to floss all of my teeth.</li>
            <li> It takes me at least three of these to finish flossing</li>
            <li> Some reviewers have complained about breakage, but I have had no problems.</li>
            <li> so I end up using at least 2 per flossing.</li>
            <li> The floss is thick, but not too think to accomplish the job</li>
            <li> so i am forced to use them until i have none</li>
            <li> The floss is thick and won&#x27;t shred like others I have used&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> the field goal sides that hold the floss taut, are very poorly designed and the engineers who designed this product should simultaneously be given a wet willy and a wedgey.</li>
            <li> They went in the garbage - no more spitting blood for me!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the ends of where the floss is connected, they stick out a little bit and are quite annoying.</li>
            <li> However I&#x27;d rather not buy some terrible overpriced wasteful plastic toothpick that wont decompose for the next thousand years when I could use a wooden one.</li>
            <li> Others that I bought in the supermarket or drug store are a bit less expensive</li>
            <li> They are useless and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This is like flossing with plastic threads, not a good product</li>
            <li> and these are the ONLY flossers that don&#x27;t tear on each tooth or get painfully stuck.</li>
            <li> product is worse than useless for tight teeth.</li>
            <li> The floss is weak and often breaks.</li>
            <li> This one is poorly made/designed.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve broken two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not ideal.</li>
            <li> The floss thread is very weak and stretches in no time</li>
            <li> , the floss is very weak and stretchy.</li>
            <li> even with just one floss pass thru, boink..or they stretch and are useless.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this style does not hold up to even genital use, the floss strand does not stay anchored into the plastic.</li>
            <li> It is basically useless.</li>
            <li> I find these to be uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t pay close enough attention to what i was doing when it was time to reorder, and i bought these - and they&#x27;re awful.  </li>
            <li> However, this is the one design that&#x27;s largely failed.</li>
            <li> However, the floss gives out halfway through flossing and is completely useless nearing the end.</li>
            <li> I purchased two packs of these and have to say they are simply the worst flossers I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> and I was skeptical it would work.</li>
            <li> These also have the sharpened end as a toothpick, which can make it uncomfortable to use as it can accidentally poke you.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the plastic strings and it smells weird.</li>
            <li> Sorry bout it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> Also the pointy handle makes it difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> Very frustrating for a flosser.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very poor design...</li>
            <li> worst thing about this product is that if i use it to floss one tooth, the floss just gets loose to the point that i can&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
            <li> Allows you to floss without cutting up your gums.  </li>
            <li> However, the package I received from Amazon today is disappointing.</li>
            <li> and it was very uncomfortable digging into my skin while flossing.</li>
            <li> These are bad news.</li>
            <li> I have  bad gums</li>
            <li> I dont know maybe I just got a bad batch.</li>
            <li> disappointed with this product, will not buy again.  </li>
            <li> I used to hate flossing</li>
            <li> If you hate flossing, these May well change your mind.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I&#x27;d come to realize how much I hate the part at the dentist visit where they compensate for my not flossing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always hated wrapping floss around my finger and this makes it a lot easier.  </li>
            <li> very bad.</li>
            <li> Terrible, these things break and break and break..</li>
            <li> The worst floss I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Worst ever.</li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>
            <li> the floss never holds in the sword, terrible quality</li>
            <li> Horrible quality.  </li>
            <li> These are just terrible.</li>
            <li> This style Plackers is horrible.  </li>
            <li> The Worst.</li>
            <li> This is probably the worst flosser i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> These are terrible.  </li>
            <li> Terrible floss product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> works great on our tight teeth, no snagging or ramming into gums</li>
            <li> Great - don&#x27;t break after one use and if you disinfect after each time it is sturdy enough to reuse and be green!</li>
            <li> Great product and service!</li>
            <li> Terrible, these things break and break and break..even with just one floss pass thru, boink..or they stretch and are useless. I have one area of &#x27;tight teeth&#x27; and that area does shred and make thing difficult for most flosses, picks, and plackers, BUT not my whole mouth. These things give out after swiping my normal teeth areas. break, and break..etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the pointer toothpick part is dumb, its too big to fit between your teeth, you get a small hook, followed by a thick body tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had these on subscription too..whoops. cancelled.</li>
            <li> Excellent and easy to use. You can put one inside of a plastic baggy in your wallet or throw one in your backpocket to take with you to dinner or keep the bag in your glovebox or center car holder. This is a neat invention that will improve one&#x27;s dental hygiene with little effort. I highly recommend plackers gentleslide.</li>
            <li> These are cheap for a reason. They get so loose after one use in one spot.</li>
            <li> I love these things. I always disliked flossing because well, it took time and it made my gums bleed, not to mention...how many times the string broke. Plackers are awesome, they get right In-between my tight teeth and never break. They have a great minty taste too. Even my 6yr old asked if he could start using them.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tasted the mint flavor very well but these things are durable and work great!</li>
            <li> I have to be careful or they break but with some practice I can make them work,  I like GUM brand better but these are a great price.</li>
            <li> Convenient grip.nice reach.good profuct</li>
            <li> Strong firm pick and handle</li>
            <li> Fine personal hygiene product at fair price delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> Works great.  My husband loves these.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been very happy with other Plackers, I thought I would like these also. Unfortunately these break so easily, they are almost useless. Two stars is being very kind.</li>
            <li> The plastic edges around the floss rub against the inside of my mouth when I slide and it hurts. I like the slide but overall I&#x27;ve had better. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> The gentleslides don&#x27;t work as well as the regular ones for me, the string gets all bent and loose as soon as I do my first molar and I end up going through 3-4 of these just to floss my whole mouth (it bends so much that I can&#x27;t get it between the next teeth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said - I do really like the pick and the handle on this model.</li>
            <li> For the one round of cleaning, I use 5-6 of these, they easily slide out of plastic handle. They don&#x27;t tear, the tread free itself from plastic flesh.</li>
            <li> Flossing isn&#x27;t too bad with these but the pick at the end is too thick to really use properly.</li>
            <li> i use other brands i like more</li>
            <li> Not as good as floss but you can clean your teeth with one hand. I use them at work, or at home when I want to clean my teeth while doing something else.</li>
            <li> keep your dentist happy</li>
            <li> Thank you for your fast shipping! Very happy with Seller &amp; very happy with product! Will gladly do business again &amp; again &amp; again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my 3rd order, maybe more...VERY happy with this product and LOVE both sides of the flosser... The side that you floss your teeth with &amp; the side you pick your teeth with. NO other brand has that same kind of hook that gets in &amp; gets out that food particle at is in a hard-to-reach place! I have it saved as my favorite product &amp; will continue to re-order, as long as it is available!!</li>
            <li> These fell apart every time I attempted to use one, especially when flossing my back teeth. I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> While I appreciate the price and free shipping of these flossers on Amazon&#x27;s subscribe and save, the ribbon used on each flosser loosens up between every tooth.  I ended up having to use one for the top half of my teeth, and another for the bottom, so the cost actually was actually double what I expected per use.  They might work great if you have well-spaced out teeth, but mine are pretty normal, and these just wore out way too quickly.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this in our house. We have stashes all over and in each car. These slide nicely between teeth and have a very subtle mint flavor. The pick end hods up nice and doesn&#x27;t bend immediately. The floss does not shred or separate. Even the kids use these.</li>

            <li> they don&#x27;t break and are smooth enough to be gentle on the gums</li>
            <li> good taste, works, I keep a bag in my car, at work and at home...never know when you are going to need one.</li>
            <li> I have very tight teeth, and these flossers used to work perfectly. But now, I go through at least two trying to floss all of my teeth. I am not sure what Plackers did to their quality, but they are nowhere near as strong as they used to be. I am very dissatisfied with this purchase. I will be looking for alternatives next time.</li>
            <li> Pretty good, recently I switched from Oral-B Glide 3d to Plackers and I am pretty happy with the quality of this floss. They are pretty comfortable to use and looks strong.</li>
            <li> These are bad news. I&#x27;d say -at least- half of the time it breaks before I finish my whole mouth. And, as others mentioned, when it breaks you often bang your gum and it&#x27;s not a fun sensation. I&#x27;ve been as delicate as possible with these and they are still consistently problematic (and no I don&#x27;t have super tight teeth or anything out of the ordinary).</li>
            <li> Work great, don&#x27;t shred, but I do feel like they&#x27;re a bit thick.</li>
            <li> floss pulls out of holder.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price and very convenient. Advertised for tight teeth, it is being honest, as I have always had an issue with the bottom row of teeth being too close, but with these I do not. I tend to get tartar/plaque buildup on the bottom row of my teeth but since using these I no longer get that issue as much as I used to. My dentist says it&#x27;s inevitable due to the closeness of the teeth but it&#x27;s been less severe as in the past. With subscribe and save, this becomes one less thing I have to remember to buy every month, and in the end it keeps my teeth healthy.</li>
            <li> floss breaks at once and always.</li>
            <li> not as good quality as the gentle glide tooth pickers....but then I have very tight teeth!</li>
            <li> They do an ok job, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase them again.</li>
            <li> If you care about oral hygiene then you will not regret adding these to your arsenal.</li>
            <li> Breaks before I am even on my lower teeth.</li>
            <li> The worst floss I have ever used. It gets loose easily and scratches my mouth to bleed every time!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve thrown them away. Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> These are good quality and I probably should have gotten this from the name but the flossing material is super smooth so it doesn&#x27;t really seem to floss my teeth.  The pick and structure is great but I would prefer something with a less smooth flosser.  So, if you are looking for a flosser that is durable and will really slide between your teeth - look no further.</li>
            <li> Worst ever. It has one job. The floss doesn&#x27;t stay on the stick. What&#x27;s funny is that It says it&#x27;s designed for tight teeth, but I can&#x27;t even floss 3 teeth without it breaking. I have to use 4 just to floss. Terrible.</li>
            <li> These little fellas are totally awesome for the lazy Americans such as myself who want their dentists to not look at them with a shameful tone when they ask the question that you both already know the answer to: &amp;#34;no, I do not floss daily.&amp;#34; I still don&#x27;t floss daily, because who has time, but these flossers make me much more apt to take assault on my gum line on a more regular basis.</li>
            <li> Very cheap design and construction.  The filaments stretch and/or break during use.  I often have to use two in a single session to floss between all my teeth.  I will be switching brands.</li>
            <li> Unlike all the other Plackers products that my family adores, we were disappointed in this particular variety.  My husband has tight teeth, so the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; Plackers got stuck often.  We tried these, and while the floss is larger (so you&#x27;d think it would give it more strength) its attachment is also flimsier.  The result is, when you have tight teeth, &amp;#34;it just flops around&amp;#34; and doesn&#x27;t actually get a &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; on what you&#x27;re trying to clean out of your teeth.  Very frustrating for a flosser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The end pick is also shaped differently, but it&#x27;s too small to be of real use and instead gets in the way.  It&#x27;s also exposed, unlike the other Plackers varieties, so you&#x27;re getting poked in the palm again.  No fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make both our dentist and my husband happy, he settled on this other Plackers variety: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DVY632/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_39 .  (Plackers gentle fine dental flossers) It&#x27;s stronger than &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; plackers so he&#x27;s able to get it between his tight teeth and it has the hidden pick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many styles of Plackers brand flossers. Unfortunately this style does not hold up to even genital use, the floss strand does not stay anchored into the plastic. The floss consistently slips out of the mount nearest the pick end, sometimes on the first use. I have these on a subscription and though the first package was a fluke, but of the first 3 Plackers used out of the most recent package 2 gave it up after a few teeth. My past experience with other styles is the floss breaks, but never slips out of its holder. This one is poorly made/designed.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying the mint flavor and the floss (which is the most important part) holds up well during use.  However the pointed end is too short to be of much use to me. I keep them in my car since it is important to floss once a day.  Remember to clear off any debris before inserting into the next space so as not to spread the bacteria around while trying to eliminate the bacteria.</li>
            <li> As reviewed by others these picks become too loose after a couple of flossing. My favorite one goes to Oral B complete but it is discontinued.  update: my frustration with this product motivates me to upload tow pictures. It is basically useless.</li>
            <li> good price, have re-purchased many times. would reccomend</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t floss without &#x27;em.</li>
            <li> the floss never holds in the sword, terrible quality</li>
            <li> Love these flossers on the go! Everyone needs to floss</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love these. The floss stretches out and the plastic is flimsy. I like the gum brand better but the subscribe and save price on these was really good.</li>
            <li> These work great &amp; are very sturdy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a numbers person so I&#x27;ll rate key characteristics based on effectiveness/utility, 1-10, with 10 as best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use period: 2+ years&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of note: buy when the price is right - they&#x27;re not always available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Size: 10 - thin floss, just as desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effectiveness: 10 - as much as regular floss, perhaps moreso since I can fit it better and likely do an improved job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strength: 10 - I&#x27;ve used between 5-7 packs and I&#x27;ve broken two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: Excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Longevity: Excellent (no declining product quality noticed over years).</li>
            <li> Most of them broke apart while I was flossing, going to try a different brand.</li>
            <li> Double string, very very strong. Goes between easy and I am very satisfied. Hard to get excited about a flosser but hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Perfect for traveling and at work.  Makes flossing so much easier!</li>
            <li> Same as advertised, it has a faint minty taste, and the floss doesn&#x27;t break easily, nor it is too thin.</li>
            <li> Much easier to close.</li>
            <li> Love em but could not find them locally, They clean well and have a nice &amp;#34;pick&amp;#34; for those hard to get to places. Amazon has everything. However the floss comes loose and does not last long, but they are definitely my favorite type of &amp;#34;Flossers&amp;#34; I use them every day.</li>
            <li> Floss keeps slipping out of the molded plastic handle.  It takes me at least three of these to finish flossing</li>
            <li> Not as good as the green Plackers. The green Plackers has stronger string, these white Plackers still break between my teeth. The handle design on these white Plackers pokes me and is annoying, green Placker&#x27;s handle is much better.</li>
            <li> The price point is great and the product is of good quality. The floss is thick, but not too think to accomplish the job and it does not break easily as I have experienced with other products.</li>
            <li> Much more convenient than &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; floss - helps you get to back teeth more easily.</li>
            <li> I give it 3 stars because we recieved a few packages that were good but this last pack I have to use 3 every time because they break part way through, dissapointing.</li>
            <li> Do not like this flosser... break all the time</li>
            <li> Every single flosser out of the bag I purchased have broken within seconds, even between teeth that aren&#x27;t particularly tight.</li>
            <li> Floss is very weak, snaps and stretches way too easily. Last night I went through ten flossers because they kept on breaking. I&#x27;ve used the Plackers that come in the blue bag and those are tough enough to get the job done. This kind for tight teeth are just junk.</li>
            <li> I think after trying these for some time I still prefer floss or another product such as go betweens by butler.  I find it hard to use these as my mouth is small and dies not open wide enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always hated wrapping floss around my finger and this makes it a lot easier.  Tried another brand and the floss would break very quickly.  This floss is much stronger and holds up as i floss my teeth.  I wish the tooth pick at the back and was bigger but for what it is it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> These are great. I&#x27;ve used Plackers for years but never this variety. I like the placement of the pick, find the mint subtle and nice and they are definitely gentler. Some reviewers have complained about breakage, but I have had no problems. These are different than floss as you have to pull up instead of through, so if you have very tight teeth, they probably aren&#x27;t a good idea. Otherwise they are terrific and convenient. Recommened. Four stars.</li>
            <li> I love these WILL BUY again. If you have tight teeth and hurts to floss...these are amazing!!</li>
            <li> I ordered these once, but won&#x27;t order them a second time. They are flimsy, and the floss in each flosser is weak and gets stretched out about 1/3 of the way through flossing my teeth. I&#x27;ll stick to the traditional type of floss from this point on. These aren&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> The floss frayed easily</li>
            <li> I have used all kinds of these flossers. I find these to be uncomfortable. The flosser tends to scrape my cheek when I am trying to floss. I prefer floss to the tape. Also, the mint flavoring is a little strong for me. I will still use them, but I don&#x27;t believe I will order this variety again.  On the bright side, I love the toothpick at the end of these.</li>
            <li> i like these flossers but it is not what i recieved. kept them anyway because i needed floss but i will be careful next time. I wanted gentleslide but got something else (the green packaging Plackers) instead.</li>
            <li> The floss comes out of the plastic ends halfway through flossing so I usually have to use two of these at a time.</li>
            <li> Everyone...buy these!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of other flossers and in my opinion these are the best out there.  I prefer the thicker ribbon style floss. Allows you to floss without cutting up your gums.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Horrible quality.  The floss breaks easily and when it doesn&#x27;t break, it gets loose on the corners when I pull it out from my teeth so the floss gets saggy.  Once in a while I get a flosser that works as it should, but more often than not it breaks or gets loose.  Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> These are great especially if your teeth are a tight fit like mine. Love them.</li>
            <li> Using these is so much easier than using regular floss. It&#x27;s faster, more convenient, and does a better job of flossing. These are also great since they are for tight teeth. I used to hate flossing but after I got these, I floss every night since it&#x27;s so easy now!</li>
            <li> these are not near as good as glide type, and they both seem to break the same, this one just does not go between teeth as easily as glide</li>
            <li> IF YOU HAVE &#x27;TIGHT&#x27; TEETH THESE FLOSSERS WILL WORK FINE. THEY ARE NICE AND STURDY AND ONE,TWO THE MOST, WILL DO THE TRICK.</li>
            <li> The string quickly becomes loose in the holder when used on tight teeth. I regularly have to use 2-3 Plackers in order to floss all of my teeth because they wear so quickly. I have not encountered this problem with other brands and recommend going with an alternative rather than this product.</li>
            <li> a little pricy over what you can get at a local super market, but they work like they&#x27;re supposed to.</li>
            <li> The tail of the flosser poked my palm and the edge of floss is very sharp and poked my mouth.</li>
            <li> Good flossers. No complaints</li>
            <li> For the many years my hygienist has urged me to floss my teeth, this product is the only one that is easy enough to use to make me floss everyday.  A must have!</li>
            <li> Soft on my gums. Better than your standard thin string variety. Sure, it doesn&#x27;t stay taught, but that hasn&#x27;t impacted my use.</li>
            <li> These are just terrible. I purchased the Plackers Gentle Fine (http://amzn.to/1muHuqT) and they are amazing!  I didn&#x27;t pay close enough attention to what i was doing when it was time to reorder, and i bought these - and they&#x27;re awful.  The packaging says, &amp;#34;engineered not to stretch, shred or break&amp;#34; but I&#x27;m here to tell you that&#x27;s an outright lie.  I have not used a single ONE of these flossers that did not stretch, and at least half of them break.  I have to use two and sometimes three of them to floss my entire mouth.  These are actually *harder* to insert into tight gaps because they stretch so easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot suggest more strongly that you avoid these at all costs and get the Gentle Fine instead.</li>
            <li> Great, and love the subscribe and save!</li>
            <li> Floss breaks too easily and is too thick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using [[ASIN:B001J8UL3I Plackers Right Angle, 75 ea]] for years with great results. I saw that these were a great price &amp; decided to try them out. I was surprised to find that I like these even more. At first, it felt like the floss was really thick, but that actually created a smoother feel and is gentler on gums. The other kind of floss would break once in a great while (maybe two or three in a pack of 75), but since these are thicker, they are much more durable and haven&#x27;t broken once. I also like the pick portion of these better since it&#x27;s slightly thicker and easier to use on my bottom teeth.</li>
            <li> this is your ticket to healthier teeth and one of the more pleasant dentist visits you&#x27;ve ever had. great item to maintain personal hygiene.</li>
            <li> Tl;dr: Just buy normal floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Gently flosses between tight teeth. Slides easily to resist shredding or breaking.&amp;#34; This is what it says right on the bag. Both statements are only half true. Let us break them down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Gently flosses between tight teeth.&amp;#34; Yeah, it would if it could get between them. It can&#x27;t. Instead the floss either stretches into uselessness or pulls off the flosser. If I manage to finagle it between my teeth through a series of precise finesses, it just pulls apart when I extract it. Furthermore, if used between well-spaced teeth it&#x27;s too gentle (i.e. stretchy) to be effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Slides easily to resist shredding or breaking.&amp;#34; While it is true that the floss neither shreds nor breaks, it is not true that the flosser itself doesn&#x27;t break. It does, rather easily. (See above.) I will grant that there was no shredding, which is not exactly the highest achievement considering this is made entirely of plastic.</li>
            <li> Some floss sticks shred into uselessness easily, requiring multiple sticks per session, but these work well.</li>
            <li> Piece of junk don&#x27;t buy. the floss string looses its tension real quick</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like these but what other people are saying about the floss coming apart is true. If you have ANY tight spaces between your teeth, which most normal people do, this floss isn&#x27;t for you. Any sort of pull on the floss and it comes apart, or drags out of the holder long enough so that you can no longer use in between your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Plackers has better floss than this one, save your money.</li>
            <li> Makes flossing a breeze.</li>
            <li> These are great. If you hate flossing, these May well change your mind.</li>
            <li> I have purchased the Plackers floss in other varieties before and have been very happy. However, the package I received from Amazon today is disappointing. Where the two ends of the floss are attached to the plastic there are pieces of plastic that are sharp and stick out. That means when I floss my molars and pull the floss back out that plastic scrapes and cuts the inside of my mouth. They went in the garbage - no more spitting blood for me!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:aaf8200bba875cdd2e8c14691b186a81]]I rarely give something a 1 star. Simply put, it&#x27;s due to the fact the floss slipping out so easily. However, other \\&quot;models\\&quot; within this brand don&#x27;t seem to have a similar issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dental picks are a great way to up your dental care. Most people hate flossing (myself included). Dental picks in general make it more convenient compared to normal floss. It&#x27;s easy to throw one or two in your pocket, purse, etc and use it after you eat. You can keep them at home, in the car and at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are about 3.5 inches long (~8.5 cm) and the floss length is around 3/4 of an inch (2 cm). The floss width is approx that of Oral-B glide floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that the floss slides out of each of the posts thereby ruining the tension on the floss. I use around 10 picks to get through flossing my teeth. In my opinion, that&#x27;s not acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pick tends to be too large to use as a pick. With a normal toothpick you can get grossly between the teeth, or at least close to it. This it much larger than a normal tooth pick. It&#x27;s use is probably at best a tooth scraper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brand is a good brand in general. I&#x27;ve used other types of Plackers before and they&#x27;ve worked great. However, this is the one design that&#x27;s largely failed.</li>
            <li> They slide really well as my teeth are tightly packed. However, the floss gives out halfway through flossing and is completely useless nearing the end.</li>
            <li> these are the only ones that fit between tight teeth, for me. excellent.</li>
            <li> I purchased two packs of these and have to say they are simply the worst flossers I&#x27;ve ever had. On the cover it says they are &amp;#34;engineered not to stretch shred or break.&amp;#34; let me reassure you, this is all they do. They are useless and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Too think and they break easily.</li>
            <li> As advertised. Will reorder.</li>
            <li> These are amazing. My husband has super tight teeth and these get in and out without breaking or stretching. Best ever.</li>
            <li> Best way to floss regularly.</li>
            <li> My Husband would be lost without these flossers.  He uses these daily &amp; gets a clean bill of sale from the dentist:-)</li>
            <li> Never flossed until I got these, now I floss every day! super easy and convenient!</li>
            <li> I have  bad gums so I need to floss daily. These plackers are far easier than trying to deal with floss. One placker is enough for your entire mouth. I have very small spaces between my teeth, so many brands of floss shred trying to go in. These are thin enough that they go in with no problems.</li>
            <li> there are different varieties, but these got me away from dental floss</li>
            <li> These are great, so convenient. I bought them for my 3 year old after she swallowed regular dental floss, these have certainly solved that problem. An added bonus is that my husband and I use them too and we aren&#x27;t flossers. We also have one of those water flossers, which is nice but can be messy, and use these more often.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had this problem with floss. I feel this particular floss has too much give. The floss itself isn&#x27;t bound tight enough. I have little space between my teeth, so it can take a bit of force to get the floss to my gumline. In some spots (particularly in the back), while I&#x27;m trying to properly get the floss in between my teeth, I end up digging into my gums with the plastic part of the flosser. I feel this wouldn&#x27;t be an issue is the floss itself was more tightly bound.</li>
            <li> Pretty good. They will break in between tight spots. But one will usually last for a completely flossing. I have found better single-use flossers, but I can&#x27;t recall the brand (I know, big help!)</li>
            <li> I cant stand Flossing, its a Pain! These make it a bit more bearable. no need to wrap string on your fingers and shove them in your mouth. A bit more civilized and easier to use.</li>
            <li> Nothing as good as the green ones.  The string is stretched by the time I get to my molars. Buy the light green ones.</li>
            <li> This style Plackers is horrible.  Thread pulls out of plastic arms.  The welds holding the thread at each end is so sharp it cuts the inside of my lip.  Who the hell designed this garbage!?</li>
            <li> My most exceptional little Shih Tzu (grin) must be part human. When she gets fuzzies stuck in her front teeth, while playing with her plush toys, she goes to the bathroom and sits there and whines until I go to her. After lifting her up on the counter, I use this product to remove the fuzzies and then floss her front teeth, which are very crowded together. Once this is completed, I set her down and she bounces off, tail wagging happily.    I know most dogs don&#x27;t know how to sit still for dental care but they can be trained to allow you to clean and floss their teeth. Good dental health makes for a healthier dog. Evidently my little princess knows this and even asks for ickies to be removed from her teeth. It&#x27;s obvious who&#x27;s in charge here. LOL!</li>
            <li> These flossers slide easily through all of my teeth, and taste/smell like mint, which I like.  Getting between the back teeth can be a little awkward though, but I think that would be the case with any floss stuck on a plastic handle.  I still prefer these to traditional floss.  Be careful not to poke your cheek.  The pick at the end is handy but sharp.</li>
            <li> These are okay for the price. The floss is a bit flimsy, so I usually have to use one on my bottom teeth and another for my top teeth. I do like that there&#x27;s a pick on the end for on the go.</li>
            <li> I use the twin-line flossers as a rule, but wanted to try these as some of my teeth have tight gaps.  Unfortunately, the floss of these separates easily from the plastic handle - rather than sliding easily into the gap.  I would not recommend them.</li>
            <li> I use them everyday, one of the best</li>
            <li> the floss breaks too easily</li>
            <li> I have tried every kind of flosser and the Plackers brand is definitely the best. And this particular variety is definitely more gentle than the twin-line which is the one I normally use. As with all Plackers, these don&#x27;t break, which was always my frustration with many other brands.</li>
            <li> I have tight teeth and these are the only flose I have ever found that fits in between my teeth! A must have for tight teeth!</li>
            <li> I hate flossing, I&#x27;m sure most people do (and if you don&#x27;t you are some kind of weirdo OCD psychopath, I&#x27;m sure of it). Anyway, I&#x27;d come to realize how much I hate the part at the dentist visit where they compensate for my not flossing. So I&#x27;m on the flossing bandwagon, and these things are super easy to use and very minty (in a good way).</li>
            <li> not sure if my flossers are an exception, but it looks like the top part was ripped off and the package was already opened.  not sure what to do with a used package.</li>
            <li> Pretty good, sometimes they break because of the tight space between teeth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best flosser I&#x27;ve used. The tartar pick is easy to use as well. The price/count also beats everything I&#x27;ve seen in grocery stores.</li>
            <li> Great quite for the price!</li>
            <li> Great flossers. They don&#x27;t break or get all shredded. Easy to hold. Pick can be useful. Reasonable price. I will buy these again.</li>
            <li> Overall, pretty good, but quite a few per package that break while using between teeth with small gaps.</li>
            <li> Very good quality floss picks. Maybe one of the best.</li>
            <li> I prefer these over regular floss - make the habit much easier to adopt!</li>
            <li> super fine and easy to slide in and out</li>
            <li> good deal and they work good, i keep this bag at work in case i eat lunch with parsley in it lol</li>
            <li> Price in local stores is much better, not sure why this is so expensive. I was able to find 120 packs for 99 cents consistently at most local groceries stores. Great product and my favorite flossing solution though.</li>
            <li> Probably some of the best floss picks I have ever used.  The mint flavor lasts through at least half of the flossing procedure.  This outlasts many other products I have tried.  Next, the floss fits well between my tight teeth without breaking or getting caught. And finally the curved tip makes a great toothpick to help complete the flossing process.  Great product.</li>
            <li> My daughters really like these and the four year old can use them herself. The dentist is please with their flossing so I am happy.</li>
            <li> The floss gets stretched out before you&#x27;re done flossing. Too gentle for me</li>
            <li> These are great, have them on auto-delivery because don&#x27;t want to be without them, have them in every car, at work, and in my purse!</li>
            <li> This is like flossing with plastic threads, not a good product</li>
            <li> There are definitely better options.</li>
            <li> I too had difficulty with the floss loosening. Sometimes I need 2 flossers to get the job done, my teeth are not THAT tight together. Finally these are advertised as being made in the US and the &amp;#34;place of origin&amp;#34; says &amp;#34;USA&amp;#34; however, this is NOT the case. If you scroll over the picture of the back of the package it reads very clearly in the left bottom corner &amp;#34;Made in China.&amp;#34; Needless to say I am removing them from my subscription list.</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price. No need to stop at the store, waste gas and time anymore!</li>
            <li> great for someone that hates flossing like me....</li>
            <li> These are so much nicer than the thinner ones. They don&#x27;t cut my gums and are more resistant to fraying.</li>
            <li> The floss thread is very weak and stretches in no time</li>
            <li> Effective and easy to use; especially like the mint flavor. Each floss stick is 3 1/4 inches long.  Please check out the two photos I uploaded to get a sense of what they look like in relation to an actual hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: They pro get in between even the tightest teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:  You need more than one to finish each time you floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review helped. If it did, please click the yes button below.</li>
            <li> These are extremely nice Plackers that I have never seen in the store. They are so gentle on my teeth. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I like these so much better than floss, quick and easy.</li>
            <li> Does the job it&#x27;s intended to do. Recommended</li>
            <li> I have been buying these Flossers for a few years now. They are great, they do not make my gums bleed like some flossers do and the pic part is very handy for picking stuff out of your teeth I love these and I will continue to buy</li>
            <li> Work great.  Easy on gums</li>
            <li> Hands Down - The Best!</li>
            <li> The dual Plackers are way better</li>
            <li> I actually think these are much stronger than the regular kind I used to get at the store (micro mint).  The string doesn&#x27;t shred as much and I haven&#x27;t had one break on me yet.  I love plackers!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got several teeth that are too close together to get the floss in. This ingenious floss can be rubbed back and forth to get it in gently where most other flosses simply break. It&#x27;s not perfect, but it is the best I&#x27;ve found for my tight teeth.</li>
            <li> If you like Glide floss, these are for you. I like Glide, but Plackers has changed the flosser&#x27;s handle and now the tip is sharp (for picking I guess) and it was very uncomfortable digging into my skin while flossing. They have lost a loyal customer. I bought a Waterpik instead and love it.</li>
            <li> nice except floss to thick..</li>
            <li> Break apart easily. You&#x27;ll end up using 3-4 to floss your entire mouth</li>
            <li> The floss isn&#x27;t very strong. It keeps breaking before I am finished.</li>
            <li> Much easier than flossing. These are very strong, so even when they get stuck between your teeth, they don&#x27;t tear, which can sometimes be a issue with regular floss. They deliver great cleaning, and the pick at the other end is a nice addition.</li>
            <li> The floss pulls out of the holder during use too often.</li>
            <li> Love these! Easy to use and even better than using a water flosser.</li>
            <li> Super cheap. Got them as an add-on for $2.99 here. They work well and are slightly more gentle on my gums then other brands I tried. I never had one with a tartar pick and I was skeptical it would work. I thought maybe I would use that as a tooth pick at best. But it really does work. You can see the tartar coming off like a wax film covering an apple. Will buy this again.</li>
            <li> These are awesome and a great bargain. I love the ribbon floss that is used. Very durable and now my go to flossers.</li>
            <li> The Worst. Almost Every time I use these they cut up my checks and mouth by my tounge because they all have little sharp plastic burs from the mold when they were manufactured.  You can tell they are extremely cheaply made and their manufacturering process doesn&#x27;t cut off these left over burs on the outside of where the floss attaches. I&#x27;ve cut my mouth 3-5 times using them, so I threw the rest away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the floss is very weak and stretchy. After only a few teeth its streched out so much you can hardly use it any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed with this product, will not buy again.  I do however like the Plackers in the green packages (mint). They seem to be a little more expensive, but they are better made (different design) and work well.</li>
            <li> We use these every day.  I carry them in a small container in my purse.  Flossing is good!</li>
            <li> Like it very much!!!!</li>
            <li> Much better than toothpicks!!</li>
            <li> I thought if I buy this, I would become less lazy to floss but these kind of suck. The floss itself gets loose so easy so you constantly have to get a new one after each tooth. I rather stick to regular floss, much more efficient.</li>
            <li> This breaks so easily! I&#x27;ve tried a lot of Floss picks from different brands. And this breaks far too easily!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the Plackers Twin Line Whitening Floss ..</li>
            <li> The green ones are the best don&#x27;t buy this one</li>
            <li> My teeth are really, really close together and these are the ONLY flossers that don&#x27;t tear on each tooth or get painfully stuck. The flavor is extremely mild, too. My two-year old uses these sometimes too. My only complaint is that there always seems to be a sharp spot on the plastic but that is easy to remove.</li>
            <li> They are just a little to big for my mouth. The floss part is okay. They are better than nothing.</li>
            <li> I chose these due to being advertised for tightly spaced teeth, but unfortunately, the nature of the flat ribbon, unlike the tight string of regular Plackers, caused it to sag and make it harder and harder with each space flossed to maneuver the tape between teeth, as it became quite loose and flimsy and shapeless. I also want to point out that the structure of the &amp;#34;harp&amp;#34; that the floss is strung across has large, round tips that protrude into the surrounding gums and cause pain and discomfort that doesn&#x27;t occur with regular Plackers. I&#x27;m afraid any benefit provided by this version of Plackers is far outweighed by the disadvantages and so I, for one, will be returning to using regular Plackers even though extra effort is required to get the flossing string between tightly spaced teeth.</li>
            <li> These are sturdy and the floss does not break off every 3rd tooth like some other brands. My only complaint is that the ends of where the floss is connected, they stick out a little bit and are quite annoying.</li>
            <li> These get the job done and work well, however I prefer the green plackers. These are fine and great if you have sensitive gums and tight spaces between your teeth, as they won&#x27;t shred, but I think it&#x27;s too slippery and loose to make me feel like I&#x27;m really getting a good flossing and the slipperyness can make it tough to get big pieces of food out of your teeth. The green ones have a smaller floss which I feel are more effective at scraping between teeth and getting everything out. These also have the sharpened end as a toothpick, which can make it uncomfortable to use as it can accidentally poke you. Overall these are fine flossers if you&#x27;re not too picky and just want something that&#x27;s convenient and easy, but I personally prefer the green plackers and will continue buying those instead.</li>
            <li> The floss isn&#x27;t quite as taught as I would like it to be, they stretch out or snap fairly easily. I find myself going through anywhere between 1-3 of these each time I floss. The pick at the other end of the handle is definitely nice to have though. Overall these get the job done and are easy to pack and bring along with you. I leave some in my car and in my bags. In the future I would probably only keep these for travel/emergency purposes only and continue to use standard string floss for everyday use at home.</li>
            <li> never run out, they are great!</li>
            <li> Best flossers ever. easy to use and does not cut gum line.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate my gums.</li>
            <li> Sooo much more comfortable than the floss picks with a regular string/thread. This uses a band that is much softer and does not cut gums. The band also makes it easier to get the floss between your teeth. The pick works well with the design. Definitely recommend these to anyone looking for floss picks.</li>
            <li> I have very tight interfaces between my molars and these work very well in getting between them.  I had stopped flossing because regular floss was such a struggle.  Now I&#x27;m back on flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note:  On the back of the package it calls out as a feature &amp;#34;Slides easily to resist shredding or breaking&amp;#34;.  I guess the key word is &amp;#34;resists&amp;#34;.  I have a few fillings that go down the side of the tooth in the interface and I guess there are some rough edges so the flossers do shred after I&#x27;ve been over all the teeth a couple of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interestingly, I had my dentist polish down this one tooth that was a particular shredding problem and it no longer shreds.  Talk to your dentist if you have a problem with shredding floss.</li>
            <li> These claim to be engineered for extra durability.  But, I find that I have to be careful with these or they will break when pushed between tight teeth.  A sawing motion typically works to allow the floss to pass through, but occasionally, it just breaks.  I find these to be no better than other glide floss type flossers.</li>
            <li> Average flossers. Definitely not the best choice if you have uneven, floss-destroying teeth like mine (A typical flossing session goes through 2-3 of these usually.</li>
            <li> These are good for touching teeth, but not great for super tight teeth.  I will give it props that the floss didn&#x27;t actually break, but it was so thick that it would push my teeth apart and they would hurt for an hour or two.  After a week of that I gave the rest of the bag away.  If there was a thin floss version from Plackers, I would definitely buy them.</li>
            <li> Good price and does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> i ordered these because i ran out of my other ones. i simply love these. they get in between your teeth very well. my daughter is crazy about her teeth and after every meal she has to floss and clean her teeth. she loves these. thank you. received so fast as usual with amazon.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and convenient!</li>
            <li> Kids use these every night.  It makes it much easier for them to floss and they like the taste and feel of them.  I get them on Subscribe and Save so it&#x27;s nice to not have to worry about running out of them.</li>
            <li> Good floss picks, good deal.</li>
            <li> These are nice and smooth and they don&#x27;t shred very easily. The little stinger on the end is great for poking out chunks of food too. Some flossers grind against my teeth or get stuck and I have to yank it out. Not these. They just glide along between the teeth and that is what I look for. If you are looking for the pokey back end to scrape your teeth, it wont, it will only poke between but it works very well for that.</li>
            <li> These do not work if you have really tight teeth. When you put pressure on the floss part to push it between your teeth, it pulls out and becomes slack, so you can maybe floss a couple teeth before it becomes unusable.</li>
            <li> Very nice and smooth. Makes flossing easy for those of us that hate it.</li>
            <li> Unless you have extremely tight teeth, go with the Plackers Micro Mint... way better</li>
            <li> I have used these for about 3 weeks now, and I am really impressed with the value. As advertised, these slide between my tight teeth as well as any floss I have used. I see some reviewers saying these broke when used, I have yet to have the handle or floss break on a single one. I&#x27;ll keep buying these.</li>
            <li> anything that gets me and my 4 year old to floss easier is fine by me. My teeth are very close together and this did not get stuck or cause pain.</li>
            <li> These were so fragile that it took 5 on average to floss one time.</li>
            <li> This is probably the worst flosser i&#x27;ve tried. The regular mint one is much better.&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;It fits tighter teeth a LITTLE bit easier&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t clean nearly as well as the normal ones. The floss itself is like a thin flat piece of plastic so instead of it providing friction to remove plaque, it seems to just rub it into your teeth.</li>
            <li> These work great and the tips and floss don&#x27;t break as easily as other brands we tried.</li>
            <li> These work great but they do stretch out a bit too easy.  In other words, you won&#x27;t be able to floss your entire mouth with just one.  It makes me wonder if the manufacturer does it on purpose to make you buy more of their product more often.</li>
            <li> These flossers work great if you have some teeth that are tight. They work great and you get a lot for the price!</li>
            <li> The floss isn&#x27;t very strong. Sometimes comes loose in the back molars. I have used many different floss picks and never had one break until using this brand. The pick is useful but it sticks out and pokes you when you are trying to floss. Very poor design... Gave it 3 stars because they get the job done.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the plastic strings and it smells weird. However, it works. So three stars. If you are not picky on smell then purchase it.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and helps me to floss each day. Glides between my teeth that are very close together. I keep a pack at work and one in the car as well.</li>
            <li> Love these things.  I have very crooked teeth that are hard to floss these hold up well and work!!!</li>
            <li> I have tight teeth. These work perfect. No shredding and they are waxed to fit between the smallest of spaces between teeth. Makes flossing a breeze. These are a must have for me.</li>
            <li> Loose string, breaks easily. I only bought them because the most popular brand was no longer offered on the automatic shipping program. Will use these up and never purchase again. Sorry bout it.</li>
            <li> I thought the floss part was great but the pick was to large and get between my teeth well enough. I probably will not purchase them again.</li>
            <li> Not the most durable. Sometimes the floss can break/stretch after only a few teeth, but on average I can get away with 1-2 flossers to cover the whole mouth.</li>
            <li> The floss is great, but it is not a style I am use to. Think about the cheap string floss that your dentist provides you after every visit. This product is a stretchable version of that stuff. I am use the picks having fairly stiff non-stretchable floss. The reason why I do not like this product as much is because the floss stretches out so much that it is difficult to clean the because of how soft and loose it becomes. This may be due to the fact that I have tight teeth. This pick is very gentle as advertise as I have never had so little gum bleeding with other picks, so it does live up to its name. I should also note that I have not had one of these break on me which is a sign of high quality. This product is good, but due to the issue listed above, I will likely be returning to a fine floss pick.</li>
            <li> The edges aren&#x27;t held in as tightly as other similar flossers and stops being taught after a few teeth.  The flosser still works after that but it&#x27;s less pleasant.</li>
            <li> i would have to say that after using many different floss products, this is hands down the worst one i&#x27;ve used. i bought them in bulk so i am forced to use them until i have none left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the worst thing about this product is that if i use it to floss one tooth, the floss just gets loose to the point that i can&#x27;t use it anymore. the field goal sides that hold the floss taut, are very poorly designed and the engineers who designed this product should simultaneously be given a wet willy and a wedgey. i have to use about 5-6 plackers to floss just for one night. whereas, for the previous product i used before this one, and that was identical to this one, only required 1 to floss all my teeth and still remained nicely taut after flossing all my teeth.</li>
            <li> They work for the first two teeth, then the floss becomes slack and is not effective.  Also, the conventional &amp;#34;flat and wide&amp;#34; floss that&#x27;s used isn&#x27;t nearly as effective as the thin, thread-style floss used in many flossers.  Also, the pick end is really sharp and it hurts.  I&#x27;d recommend the Plackers Micro-Mint flossers over these.</li>
            <li> These are handier for manual flossing but not as effective as the Flossaid device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have big fingers that make it nearly impossible for me to manually floss my back teeth.  The Flossaid flosser worked the best for me and soon stopped my bleeding gums.  .  .  .  .  .  dave in austin, texas&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;summary:  too small &amp; breaks too easily -- try Flossaid instead</li>
            <li> I really like this flosser. I have tried other flossers and none of them are quite like this one. I like the fact that these glide into the space between my teeth and they really are gentle. The strings don&#x27;t cut into your gums when they snap down past the tight squeeze between the teeth, which is really nice. But more importantly, it&#x27;s just easier and more enjoyable to floss with these flossers as compared to traditional flossing. It helps me keep my teeth and gums healthier that I am really happy about.</li>
            <li> the kids use these daily- they work great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why I didn&#x27;t notice the negative reviews before I ordered this bag.... These are terrible.  I have all my teeth, wisdom included and these will NOT reach anywhere near the back of your mouth.  If you have any tightly spaced teeth the floss will stretch and bow then pull free from where its attached to the bow.  The attach points will also rake against your gums if you get anywhere near your molars which as it turns out is quite painful.&lt;br /&gt;The one redeeming factor about this Flosser is the toothpick feature.  However I&#x27;d rather not buy some terrible overpriced wasteful plastic toothpick that wont decompose for the next thousand years when I could use a wooden one.</li>
            <li> I love the easy to use flosser&#x27;s in of wax dental string</li>
            <li> The floss is very weak and becomes loose after just a few teeth</li>
            <li> I love these and these and my monthly add on item</li>
            <li> The floss breaks quite easily, resulting in multiple picks being used per flossing session - wasteful! The floss does slide nicely in between tight teeth, but the durability is low. The other downside is that the point at the bottom is not tucked away, so these aren&#x27;t comfortable to use by kids, or anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to accidentally poke themselves in the hand while flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer Plackers twin line floss sticks. Much better! http://www.amazon.com/Plackers-Twin-Whitening-Floss-Picks-75/dp/B004RSXOCW/</li>
            <li> Love these they gently slide between my gums these are my favorite plackers and ive tried them all. Great if you have senstive gums. I can no longer find them in retail locations so i am now purchasing them here</li>
            <li> These fit between my teeth better than the last bag I got from the grocery store and lost during travel. They feel a bit sturdier too. Floss picks make flossing easier and save your skin from the pressure applied by having ordinary dental floss wrapped around your fingers.</li>
            <li> The floss material is like a slippery ribbon that does not clean the plaque off of the inside of your teeth.</li>
            <li> My favorite flossers!  They are sturdy and the floss does not break.  These ones don&#x27;t bend as your using them like some others do and the floss does not break easily.</li>
            <li> I love these, gets the job done.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite little flossers, cause I have some really tight teeth, and they slide with little effort.  A lot of other ones get stuck, but not these.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite flossers. They hold up and don&#x27;t break when you use them. I&#x27;ve tried others that just break while using them. These are fairly cheap and seem to be the best.</li>
            <li> The string comes loose from the holder or breaks while flossing. I have tried other brands/types and these do not stack up.</li>
            <li> Much stronger than other flossers, does not break (even with use around rear molars, etc). Pick is also useful.</li>
            <li> I can finally say I&#x27;m flossing again. I really like these little guys. My only complaint is that the pic could be a little thinner for us people with crammed teeth.</li>
            <li> The floss string is sturdy but soft enough for sensitive gums.Other well known brands are abrasive and even break at times. These leave a fresh flavor and there is a handy pick on the end.</li>
            <li> I have a long history of flossing regularly and these little things make it easy to do so (while on the go) without having to first make sure my hands are perfectly clean.  They&#x27;re especially handy to have at restaurants and movie theaters. (Those over 50 know why.) I keep a few tucked inside my purse for this reason.  Well call me weird, but recently it occurred to me that there must be a better way to conveniently floss without having to wreak havoc on the planet.  Plastic, after all, is forever-- so to speak. It&#x27;s not as though you can detach the little waxed string and toss the plastic piece into the recycling bin.</li>
            <li> The regular ones, which are a bit cheaper are ok but these are so much better. They do &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34; between your teeth and don&#x27;t get torn up near as much as the regular ones. As a flossing nut, I Highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> Very odd shape at the tip. Hurts my gums</li>
            <li> The floss gets loose quick but I like the convenience</li>
            <li> Much better than cheaper brands. The floss is thick and won&#x27;t shred like others I have used&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again</li>
            <li> My family loves this product. I&#x27;m sure it helps keep our gums and teeth healthy.</li>
            <li> These floss picks are the best I have used. Others that I bought in the supermarket or drug store are a bit less expensive but they break, so I was often using two instead of one to floss after brushing. They also are easy to grip.</li>
            <li> very bad. it ends up pushing the food particles back into your mouth! there are better brands.</li>
            <li> better dental checkups. my dentist said keep doing what you are doing.</li>
            <li> Great item to help maintain good oral hygiene. The pieces are easy to hold on to, convent to carry and simple to use. Strong enought not to break yet efficent and well made enough not to damage your gums. These are used daily in our home and much better than pulling off floss. No more lost floss pieces.</li>
            <li> I hate flossing and am terrible at remembering to do it, so these are great for on the go! Especially as I remember on my way out the door! Then just toss when you&#x27;re done and there&#x27;s no nasty feeling on your fingers!</li>
            <li> These do the job quite nicely, at a very low price. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> They say they are for tight teeth yet on broke and was stuck in my teeth... another just broke as soon as I put it in my mouth. I dont know maybe I just got a bad batch.</li>
            <li> I love these flossers.  They are so much easier to use for me then regular floss.</li>
            <li> This picture was taken after I used a brand new flosser between two teeth. Yes, I literally used the flosser once, not once for my whole mouth, not once for my upper or lower sets of teeth, I used it once for the space between two teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is worse than useless for tight teeth.</li>
            <li> I like these floss picks.  The are a strip/ribbon, instead of a piece of nylon.  They clean better and hold up better to my teeth, some of which are tightly spaced.</li>
            <li> Not ideal. The strips are too wide so can&#x27;t get deep enough around the tooth. Also the pointy handle makes it difficult to use.  Otherwise good quality, I got a different one from same company and am very happy.</li>
            <li> We use these after meals and before brushing.  We always have them on hand.</li>
            <li> I had braces so my teeth are very close together these break everytime I use them so u usually have to use two each time I floss. Will not buy this brand again.</li>
            <li> These work just as good as the more expensive packs, and you get more for less. I was hesitant because Im a brand name follower but I was very happy with these when I took a gamble on them.</li>
            <li> These were great when I couldn&#x27;t use both hands to floss after I broke my collar bone. They hold up for an entire mouth floss, but just barely. Doesn&#x27;t beat doing it by hand though.</li>
            <li> the floss wire is flat thin ribbon so great for scraping food off of teeth without a scratchy feeling as with many other brands/ types.</li>
            <li> Our kids (11, 9, 7 years old) love these, and they&#x27;re definitely easier than regular floss for the younger kids to learn to use.</li>
            <li> These picks will last you and most certainly clean your teeth out the best, for a person with a wire in my teeth I could give the floss in between just fine and it left my teeth junk free</li>
            <li> The floss is not strong and bends too much while flossing.  I don&#x27;t feel these do the job thoroughly.  They are not too expensive, so that is nice.</li>
            <li> The floss is weak and often breaks. I often need to use 3-5 per session.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t going to give these a review, because I thought, why? They&#x27;re just flossers. Then I tried another kind, and it was awful. So these are spectacular: I don&#x27;t really notice the mint flavor, which doesn&#x27;t matter too much, but the string is strong and thin. It goes easily and pain free between every single one of my teeth, unlike that other purported close teeth flosser. The pick is good too.</li>
            <li> Very good price, work wee, very satisfied</li>
            <li> Mmmmm.... clean teeth.</li>
            <li> A &amp;#34;MUST-HAVE&amp;#34; item for my home! Even other Plackers brand flossers don&#x27;t work nearly as well. The flat floss works great around my tight teeth, and doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s going to pull my veneers out (like others do). My mouth doesn&#x27;t feel as clean with any other brand. Look, no one product is going to work wonders for *everyone*, but for me? I would give these 6 stars if I could!</li>
            <li> Take it from someone who has used several brands of these kind of flossers -- these are great!  The general problem with flossers is that they break easily, sometimes the instant you attempt to use them.  I won&#x27;t guarantee that that won&#x27;t happen with these, but it has yet to happen for me.  One of these generally makes it through my whole flossing routine without a hitch.  The floss is a fine thickness and works well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t prefer about these sticks over others I&#x27;ve tried is the pick end.  The plastic is rigid and feels gross against my teeth and gums - hard, yet sort of brittle and powdery.  I&#x27;ve had a little bit of one break off before too.  I don&#x27;t know exactly how to explain plastic as feeling powdery, but I imagine it being similar to the feel of plastic that has be been breaking down in the hot sun for a while would feel....if you tried to use that as a gum pick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mostly care about the flossing functionality, but I&#x27;ve docked a star for the tartar pick, since it is mentioned as a feature of the product.  These remain the best flossers I&#x27;ve used and I will repurchase.</li>
            <li> Nice &amp; strong - won&#x27;t break during use.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Great price and theres like a million in the bag. Pretty durable as long as your not using it like a jackhammer. I like the pick at the bottom of it too as a nice added bonus. These are way better than conventional floss.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, husband uses these every day, several times.  Works great instead of trying to maneuver man hands into mouth with regular floss.  This works better.</li>
            <li> These work great. Much easier than the string in the dispenser type, much easier to reach the back and side teeth. Super price. Thanks</li>
            <li> Terrible floss product. My teeth are relatively tighter together and the string always breaks so I end up using at least 2 per flossing. Will never buy again</li>
