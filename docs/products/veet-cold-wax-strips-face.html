    <ol>
            <li>Practice makes perfect!</li>
            <li>These are the best strips I have used.  </li>
            <li>This is a reallllly great idea!</li>
            <li>These strips are great!</li>
            <li>But, for the lip, they are perfect!</li>
            <li>These are the best at home wax product I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>Also perfect for on the go.</li>
            <li>It was painless and smelt great!  </li>
            <li>I consider them a win and a good hair removal product!</li>
            <li>Waxing at home is a great way to save money, but it isn&#x27;t always the easiest thing to do.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried again, with great results (no rash yet).</li>
            <li>Also, I used the wax strips up to three times with great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Veet worked great.  </li>
            <li>However, they are great.</li>
            <li>It was with great excitement that I tried these wax strips.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, my joy was short-lived.  </li>
            <li>When I use something, I want a great majority (if not all) of the hair to be gone.  </li>
            <li>Lol.</li>
            <li>Whoever made this, amazing job to you!  </li>
            <li>Practice makes perfect!it to be successful, so just know what you&#x27;re getting into.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use!  </li>
            <li>If you do that, you&#x27;re good to go (I do suggest reading everything, though).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve found them to work surprisingly well.&lt;br /&gt;Is</li>
            <li>Waxing never feels good.  </li>
            <li>and you are good to go.</li>
            <li>Good product and do its job.</li>
            <li>They are good for travel.  </li>
            <li>The wax comes in a rose scent, so the wax smells pleasant.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a good product, it does what it should and is cost effective.</li>
            <li>Here I am, thinking, wow, what a great product, but then you read the instructions, there are warnings galore, and it says the hair should be 5mm in length to work best.</li>
            <li>The first strip works wonderfully, as you can imagine.</li>
            <li>These strips work great on fine hair.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to do and very effective.  </li>
            <li>This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>But the wax just wasn&#x27;t effective in either place.  </li>
            <li>They are not as effective as a chemical hair remover.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use these for my face, used them to tidy up my bikini line instead.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like going through the process of making my own wax at home.</li>
            <li>Kind of disappointing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>really liked this product and the results.  </li>
            <li>You need to either have the shaped wax strips or be pro on doing your own with the bowl of wax.</li>
            <li>Perfect for travel and actually gentle on the face.</li>
            <li>Just use warm water and a wee bit of soap.&lt;br /&gt;-Wax is so so</li>
            <li>I liked this product.  </li>
            <li>You have to warm the oils, and apply; then you tear in the direction the hair grows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I still haven&#x27;t figured them out, I gave up and just washed my face with warm water.</li>
            <li>these are by far the best wax strips I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>Smooth it over good and then RIPPPPPPPPP..........</li>
            <li>Still, I give this product 2 stars because it does effectively remove most of the hair.</li>
            <li>I reread the directions and tried again with great success</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve recently switched to making my own sugar wax, which has been an awesome adventure and has been working quite well for hair removal..</li>
            <li>Personally, I love these.</li>
            <li>I also personally love the wipes,</li>
            <li>My skin is nice a smooth.     </li>
            <li>When I waxed more pores were bleeding than they would at a Salon.</li>
            <li>So over all it&#x27;s an okay product</li>
            <li>It was so prominent</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s freshly warmed up, good to go, apply, press, and rip off.</li>
            <li>and I was pleased (</li>
            <li>I kept finding more on my face.</li>
            <li>These were just okay.</li>
            <li>I just press the strip onto the skin again- smoothing the strip to my skin to make sure it&#x27;s stuck to the hair on the skin - and repeat the pull up and away process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had better luck with this do it yourself</li>
            <li>Love, love, love them.</li>
            <li>Its more in my head than anything.</li>
            <li>so well, I&#x27;m buying more of them on the subscribe and save plan.</li>
            <li>She said she has some friends she will surely recommend these to.</li>
            <li>These strips work better than most that I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Sure, you can use baby oil, but I don&#x27;t happen to have baby oil on hand and it would be much more convenient if the package contained more wipes.  </li>
            <li>it better than others?</li>
            <li>I prefer the ones from Nads as they are more gentle.&lt;br /&gt;Wipes provided are not going to be sufficient.</li>
            <li>There are many, however, who will benefit from use of this product.</li>
            <li>And no matter how many times I wash my face after using them, I get zits.</li>
            <li>No matter how many times I wash my face and do whatever...</li>
            <li>I have tried them in places I can see the results - my calves - just to be sure.</li>
            <li>that I&#x27;m sure are going to scar.</li>
            <li>works for me, most people just don&#x27;t understand how to use it.</li>
            <li>I was putting chapstick on my top lip for the three months that I used these.</li>
            <li>though this product is for the face, you&#x27;re supposed to be able to wax bikini line.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t write too many reviews</li>
            <li>OK, let&#x27;s put it this way.</li>
            <li>If you are feeling skilled, you could also use these strips for eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Removing all the wax invariably caused even more skin irritation and resulted in zits.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know anyone with hair above the lip growing in a perfect rectangle.  </li>
            <li>I found that the leg wax strips, cut into pieces this size, worked WAY better.</li>
            <li>Sure, they removed the fuzz, but they took a lot of skin, too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not going to lie, it did not feel any better then getting it done at the salon.</li>
            <li>The more you use them the better you get as your technique improves.  </li>
            <li>These were fantastic!</li>
            <li>Okay to try</li>
            <li>I thought there had to be a better way.</li>
            <li>, if you don&#x27;t have time or the money to hit up a salon and want to get the hairs in-between brows and on the nose, I say it&#x27;s a pretty good alternation, but you WILL need to go get them waxed at a Salon or plucked if you want to get the arch areas.</li>
            <li>my pleasant suprise, these did not leave any  really noticable mark.</li>
            <li>Overall great product and definitely the best option available!</li>
            <li>It worked on my upper lip ok, but when I tried it on the top of my foot, I had to go over it three time, and it still didn&#x27;t work that great.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s not as easy as it seems.     </li>
            <li>Easy to heat</li>
            <li>The rest was easily pluckable at that</li>
            <li>The wax is very mild.</li>
            <li>These are so easy to use</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s to easy to screw up something like that with these strips.</li>
            <li>, I refuse to pay for salon prices for something that I can easily take care of myself at home, I use strips about once a month and works</li>
            <li>I think this product is incredibly easy to use.</li>
            <li>to cut if the size/shape isn&#x27;t easy for your eyebrows&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The process is quite easy.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and expectations were reached.</li>
            <li>My skin does feel smooth after using it, but the wax doesn&#x27;t remove easily with the wipes.</li>
            <li>I guess that&#x27;s all fine and well, except I don&#x27;t have people sniffing my eyebrows too often.</li>
            <li>I reused one of the strips and found that it worked just fine</li>
            <li>Half of one strip is perfect for one side of my mouth.</li>
            <li>The smell was great; light and flowery withOUT being too much (only a whiff).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always done all my own waxing elsewhere, but those areas are much easier to hide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to apply some pressure to your skin as you pull the strip up and away from your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>*C.S. Light*</li>
            <li>its job well&lt;br /&gt;-Super smooth skin!&lt;br /&gt;-Easy</li>
            <li>And sometimes it leaves the hair - still standing proud - in the open wound you have created on your body.</li>
            <li>I bought these thinking they would be a great alternative to melting wax in the microwave and glopping it on my upper lip</li>
            <li>Each strip is really two wax strips which makes them cost effective too.</li>
            <li>Having trialed two supermarket purchased products, I find Veet to be far superior.  </li>
            <li>Pretty cool, and handy.    </li>
            <li>Super easy to use and super cheap!</li>
            <li>mess-free, quick clean up  too!</li>
            <li>My wife was not so sure when I handed her this package right after I received it.</li>
            <li>These are super easy to use because they require no heating and are already on the stip.</li>
            <li>But thought it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try something new- always on the look out for a better quality product or price!</li>
            <li>Hurts more than hot wax.</li>
            <li>I found that these gripped and pulled hair out neatly and cleanly.  </li>
            <li>Also, it can be helpful to cut off some of the excess paper on one side so you can be more precise and not get it on your lips or take too much off from your eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One wax strip is really two (this is something I didn&#x27;t realize the first time I used it) - you warm up the wax, then pull the two strips apart.</li>
            <li>The nice thing I liked about these is that because I have dark hairs I could see when the hair was caught in the wax through the strip.    </li>
            <li>I used these for the first time last night and they worked great on the peach fuzz on my face.</li>
            <li>They especially would be good for beginners.</li>
            <li>I used an after bath oil with Vitamin E and saturated a nice soft tissue.</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t really get all the hair and rip off the top layer of skin</li>
            <li>but my face was fine (shouldn&#x27;t the face be more sensitive?).</li>
            <li>The first one worked fine -- I had missed some hairs, but I got a lot off and at the root</li>
            <li>In addition, I had some fairly mild bumps for about 24 hours.</li>
            <li>Be quick just like the girls at the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But the pain went away quickly and I no longer feel like a she-beast</li>
            <li>so for things like the face where they are intended to be used - you don&#x27;t have a drippy stick or a hot poker or a huge patch that you have to manipulate.</li>
            <li>These were super easy to use and very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for fast effective hair removal</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these strips - they are effective, easy to use and really are gentle to my skin.</li>
            <li>It worked pretty good, and as I said, it was simple.  </li>
            <li>For home face waxing, these work very well and quite easily.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to rub the strips and get them warm before putting them on your face and then rub it down in the direction of the hair a lot, don&#x27;t be ginger.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>This product really sounded promising but the actual experience wasn&#x27;t as great as the expectations I had.</li>
            <li>Fresh wax strip or</li>
            <li>and as Amazon was kind enough to send these to me, I decided to chance it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Rub the wax stripes between your hands to warm up the wax, peel the strips apart, set one strip on the area, and rip off in the opposite direction of hair growth.  </li>
            <li>I will purchase Veet in the future from now on and do my own waxing....  </li>
            <li>just seems to me that Veet&#x27;s product testing department should have either done a LOT more tests before releasing this to the market, or they should&#x27;ve just done an overhaul of the product completely before claiming that these will remove any hair.</li>
            <li>Worth a try.</li>
            <li>The directions say to test the wax and the wax removal wipe on your leg to see if you have any reactions before using it on more sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>so it was worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to the beginner because it is easy and painless..</li>
            <li>If it removed more hair, it would definitely be more highly rated, but between lack of hair removal, and the sticky residue they leave behind, it ends up creating more work to clean up and still have to shave!</li>
            <li>When I got it in the mail I stopped what I was doing and used it right away.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t get too close to the nose either because the strip just isn&#x27;t the right shape.  </li>
            <li>If you can&#x27;t manage to get it into just the right shape, you&#x27;re out of luck.  </li>
            <li>It says 5mm is the ideal hair length, but my facial hair doesn&#x27;t get that long.</li>
            <li>I know my cheeks do not like waxing and there is a very large possibility that I might rip off my skin.</li>
            <li>Oh, and if you wax one side, then the other, best make sure you don&#x27;t overlap in the middle because then you&#x27;ve waxed the same place twice</li>
            <li>I now know I either have to be super fast</li>
            <li>Well after a few weeks I am happy to report that she said they really do work.</li>
            <li>second time I used the strips, I had much better success as the hair was longer (the box recommends between 2 and 5mm length).  </li>
            <li>They have both been effective, but lately, I am having to do it more often.  </li>
            <li>The directions are clear and easy to follow.  </li>
            <li>I put one on the section of skin I want to wax, and I massage my finger on the outside of the wax strip, this heats up the wax and strip while it&#x27;s ON your face and also makes sure all hairs are adhered on.</li>
            <li>I should know better than to get my hopes up that there is a product out there for facial hair removal.  </li>
            <li>first thought about the directions:</li>
            <li>For whatever reason, this side just didn&#x27;t work as well as the first side.</li>
            <li>And I was able to use one set of strips over and over, needing only one set for one session.</li>
            <li>--this assumes you are going to use more than just two strips per session, which may or may not be the case (more likely than not, you are, but unless you are using 5 strips each time, you are likely to be without wipes at one point).  </li>
            <li>However, Veet is much better than the Nads wax strips I used--they only provided TWO wipes for 20 wax</li>
            <li>This occurred the first time I used these strips, but I didn&#x27;t correlate the product with the rash.  </li>
            <li>This was the first time I attempted to wax over my lip myself rather than go to a salon.  </li>
            <li>Anyway I bought this veet strips &amp; was glad to see similar packaging.</li>
            <li>I have hirsutism, and these work pretty well for me.</li>
            <li>That helps to somewhat heat it up as it it were hot wax.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a hot wax and after using this I will never get one.</li>
            <li>Please test a bit on your face first to check for allergy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I first used it on my leg.</li>
            <li>Thanks for reading!</li>
            <li>I LOVE these strips - they make removing the hair from my upper lip and eyebrows a cinch!</li>
            <li>I, like many women, wax the peach fuzz on my upper lip.</li>
            <li>but I prefer the hot wax</li>
            <li>I liked Veet&#x27;s other wax for my face (namely my eyebrows)</li>
            <li>first time I tried this product, it was very unsuccessful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m interested to see how fast the hair grows back.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, that&#x27;s pretty much what I have to say.</li>
            <li>It was easy enough to use, but I didn&#x27;t care for it at all.</li>
            <li>Also, re the previous comment about the wax strip cooling: I thought I&#x27;d try keeping a desk lamp on strip #2, to keep it warm.</li>
            <li>Overall, a good solution for small, fine areas.</li>
            <li>it shouldnt even be strong enough to handle hair anyplace else.  </li>
            <li>Other reviewers have stated that the second strip cools off too much to be effective, but I haven&#x27;t had that problem since I let it sit on my skin for a second to warm before pulling it off.</li>
            <li>I was harsher on certain areas of my lip, causing the rash.  </li>
            <li>If you are very accurate with the timing, the cream works but if you wait a few seconds too long, it burns and you look sunburnt, and that can happen very easily.</li>
            <li>I have blonde hair and have fine hair in that area that I wanted to remove.</li>
            <li>I only have fine growth and it bothers me</li>
            <li>yes, it&#x27;s a little greasy, but it makes the skin feel nice after.</li>
            <li>The wax comes in little strips you are supposed to warm with your hands by rubbing.  </li>
            <li>Had high hopes these would be quick and easy; and they are - unfortunbately they leve behind more hair than they remove.  </li>
            <li>I had red skin for a bit, but the next day I was fine and everything feels smooth.</li>
            <li>I have actually been using Nad&#x27;s recently, which is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>Thanks Veet.</li>
            <li>if you choose to use these strips you really need the wipes.  </li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t like this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Someone else mentioned this packaging flaw: you get 20 wax strips (which are really 40</li>
            <li>These wax strips do NOT work very well.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I would use these to do my eyebrows, it wouldn&#x27;t be precise enough.</li>
            <li>My upper lip is completely smooth; the wipes worked wonders at removing excess wax.  </li>
            <li>No, but it&#x27;s not worse either.</li>
            <li>They warmed up really fast, adhered well, and removed every bit of hair.</li>
            <li>Instead it felt like I&#x27;d wiped a light layer of olive oil on my skin, and the wipes never even got rid of any of the sticky wax left over.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really recommend this.</li>
            <li>It only takes one application and my face is smooth for weeks.  </li>
            <li>Free shipping also big plus</li>
            <li>This wax works best if you want to remove a section of hair from your the upper lip or thin out the fuzz on the side of your face or under you</li>
            <li>(i live near the ocean btw, where the weather is always cool, but i was giving it a chance)..</li>
            <li>--there may have been a wee less \\&quot;grip\\&quot;, but it was nice to know that if you made an oopsie, you could just reuse instead of having to get two whole new strips.  </li>
            <li>I like this kit better than other home wax kits I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It can be a bit challenging to make sure that the strip covers the area you want to remove hair from, but these strips can be used multiple times (the Nads strips were single use only) to remove hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The second strip/side of my lip was not so clean.</li>
            <li>once you pull them apart) but only four wipes to clean the dang wax off.</li>
            <li>I always have the problem with the creams that they just burn off the top bit of the hairs, allowing hair to grow back very quickly and it comes back kind of like stubble (which is almost worse than what I started with!).</li>
            <li>I am a woman with a slight mustache (I think this is the case for most woman).</li>
            <li>I use all strips for my face, I actually find that the ones that are meant for underarms/bikini are easier to use on the face as there is more wax and can cover a larger surface</li>
            <li>One decent note though</li>
            <li>Sure, you can apply, rip off fast in hopes the other wax strip doesn&#x27;t cool, but that&#x27;s really not going to happen.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ripping off my skin, slowly but surely!</li>
            <li>The wax is super sticky, and the strip of wax is pretty wide, so</li>
            <li>/&gt;Exfoliate, clean, and dry skin before using product.  </li>
            <li>I normally pay $10 - $25 dollars for waxing at the salon.</li>
            <li>normally these straps are even shape, like rectangular-</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t think they irritate the skin any worse than creams that don&#x27;t do nearly as good of a job.</li>
            <li>I found that these worked, but they&#x27;re probably not the best way to get hairs off your face, mainly because facial hairs are probably too small and this is overkill and a bit harsh for the skin.</li>
            <li>about ten years ago snd ended up with a bright red upper lip for a concert two days later.</li>
            <li>Luckily it was like that first layer of skin, so I don&#x27;t look that odd.</li>
            <li>So I tossed that wax strip and started with a new one.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m gonna have to live with this mistake for quite a while....</li>
            <li>This cold wax is liquidy, supposedly to cover more hair better.</li>
            <li>Cut them to the right size so that it will lay flat on your face.</li>
            <li>If you have never done this at home before the instructions are very clear.  </li>
            <li>They are not messy at all and take only moments of preparation which involves just rubbing them together with your hands to warm them up and soften the wax a little.</li>
            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t love about the wipe is it left my skin very greasy for a very long time afterwards</li>
            <li>:  Does what it says, it&#x27;s near salon quality at home!  </li>
            <li>I like how the result of the first side of my upper lip.</li>
            <li>Prior to pulling the strip apart to place on my skin, I use a hairdrier to blast some hot air on the strip to melt the wax.</li>
            <li>My first experience with upper lip hair removal was a set of Nads wax stripes.  </li>
            <li>first time I used this product, my upper lip hair was not long enough to be effective and left patches where the hair was too short and couldn&#x27;t be removed.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to try something different for me to use at home to get rid of facial hair.  </li>
            <li>A cool thing about these is when you put the wax strip over the area to be waxed, you can see through the wax (even though it&#x27;s pink) and see what hairs will be removed.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 starts is because the package brings 10 packets of wax, but only 4 clean up wipes.</li>
            <li>for the \\&quot;cleaning\\&quot; wipes, the last thing those left me was feeling clean.</li>
            <li>Being as stubborn as I am and wanting high hopes for this product because I REALLY needed it to work, I attempted to use it on my face the next day.</li>
            <li>However, I still like the results better from wax strips than the \\&quot;less invasive\\&quot; methods, such as the Olay product I tried.  </li>
            <li>The Veet Cold Wax Strips get as close as you can to comfortable though; I really like the see-thru quality of the strips so that I can easily see where I am placing them.  </li>
            <li>I recommend the product, but only to those who are okay with a little pain, as this product WILL cause some</li>
            <li>/&gt;Brought to you by:&lt;br /&gt;*C.S. Light*he product, but only to those who are okay with a little pain, as this product WILL cause some pain.  </li>
            <li>When I bought this product I thought \\&quot;Hey a cheaper way to clear up those stubborn eyebrow hairs!\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>but my skin is sensitive</li>
            <li>I tried this product the second time, it was much easier to use.</li>
            <li>Veet - You make me feel like a natural woman</li>
            <li>also notice I break out regardless of whatever brad from the wipes (my skin is horribly sensitive)</li>
            <li>Simple and fast.</li>
            <li>My akin may just be sensitive.</li>
            <li>Thus far, we&#x27;ve tried them three times and each time, the majority of the hair is still there when the strip is removed.</li>
            <li>It costs like 5 bucks and only takes 5 minutes and is much easier on your skin.</li>
            <li>When I got this product, I was hoping to use it on my cheeks (near my ears).</li>
            <li>and I feel like the wax always completely removes with the hair.</li>
            <li>Recommend if you want save some cash and do not go to the store directly.</li>
            <li>when i opened it, i thought i&#x27;m probably in a warm (bath)room the wax on the paper is all melted like thin lotion, and not \\&quot;grasping\\&quot; onto hair at all</li>
            <li>while uncomfortable, I loved the smoothness that waxing resulted.</li>
            <li>The instructions are pretty specific about how long the hair should be, and I have made sure we&#x27;re within those limits each time, so it&#x27;s definitely not hair that&#x27;s too long or too short throwing off the performance.</li>
            <li>The special wipe did remove the extra wax, but now I have 18 strips and only 3 wipes left.</li>
            <li>Now, with these, they aren&#x27;t kidding that you have to remove it quickly after rubbing down the hair.</li>
            <li>took off all the hair I pressed down on with one quick peel.</li>
            <li>I do prefer hard wax in the end but for the price these are not bad at all and not having to wait for heating up is very convenient.</li>
            <li>This might explain why I got a rash on my upper lip in the previous two cases, as I had waxed the same area more than once.  </li>
            <li>However, there are hairs there and due to certain traumatic experiences from high school years ago, I still feel the need to remove all traces of hair there.</li>
            <li>These were also not nearly as messy as other hot wax products that take forever to heat up, drip everywhere, then become brittle and crack all over the place.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t really use these for any other area, as it would take the whole box to do larger parts of the body.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely in the market for a new wax after this change.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t hurt too bad when I pulled it off so that was good, and it also took off a decent amount of hair (some hair still remaining in that area).</li>
            <li>The only hair this product removed was the soft hair on one arm that I used to &#x27;test&#x27; the product out after it didn&#x27;t work on my face.  </li>
            <li>After pulling the strip apart the pink wax was very sticky-looking.  </li>
            <li>I barely got any hair off.</li>
            <li>These have been my alternative to spending the extra money to get a professional wax for years now, would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>After you are completely done use the essential oil wipe</li>
            <li>but I am a person who relies on everyone else&#x27;s experiences to determine if I should try something or not soI felt like noting my experience may be helpful to others, especially with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So far, I have tried waxing, shaving, hair remover cream and epilator for facial hair.</li>
            <li>I read all the directions carefully and took all the necessary precautions when first using this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wary of doing my own face wax ever since I did it once</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even attempt to use this product because the wax strips are SUPER thin and it would just be too much work.</li>
            <li>(I can&#x27;t do my whole upper lip with a single strip I have to cut it in half)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Only this time, it was unsuccessful in removing hair taking only VERY few pieces and doing more bad than good leaving tons of wax.</li>
            <li>few months later I had my face waxed professionally for the first time and</li>
            <li>After that, I just tweezed the many hairs left behind.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have personal experience with the product, but my wife says this is about as good as cold wax strips get.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately with the other products I&#x27;ve tried small areas of skin were taken off along with my hair; that&#x27;s why I kept looking for the perfect product.</li>
            <li>The consistency is sticky, and not as much wax comes in this box as what came with its predecessor: there were 10 large and 10 small strips with the old formula and this new formula comes with 20 small strips.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think any product should get a bad review when it requires the buyer to participate a lot for it to be successful, so just know what you&#x27;re getting into.</li>
            <li>They barely get extra wax off and the wipes feel like sandpaper with lotion on it.   </li>
            <li>A little after that, the bumps mostly dissapeared but stayed a little red even until the next day (today as of this review).</li>
            <li>My facial hair is so blonde it is nearly white and is mostly fine, but thick above my lip.</li>
            <li>The areas I attempted were each side of my upper lip, chin and one small spot on my right cheek.</li>
            <li>With these strips, I am still left with half of the hair still on my very sticky face.  </li>
            <li>Though I followed the directions exactly, many of the thicker hairs were left behind every single time.  </li>
            <li>so it took a little longer for her to see if they really did as they said.</li>
            <li>I also dab a little bit and then refold it back up and it stays very well.</li>

            <li> I consider them a win and a good hair removal product!</li>
            <li> Waxing at home is a great way to save money, but it isn&#x27;t always the easiest thing to do.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried again, with great results (no rash yet).</li>
            <li> Also, I used the wax strips up to three times with great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Veet worked great.  </li>
            <li> However, they are great.</li>
            <li> It was with great excitement that I tried these wax strips.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my joy was short-lived.  </li>
            <li> When I use something, I want a great majority (if not all) of the hair to be gone.  </li>
            <li> Lol.</li>
            <li> Whoever made this, amazing job to you!  </li>
            <li> Practice makes perfect!it to be successful, so just know what you&#x27;re getting into.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use!  </li>
            <li> If you do that, you&#x27;re good to go (I do suggest reading everything, though).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve found them to work surprisingly well.&lt;br /&gt;Is</li>
            <li> Waxing never feels good.  </li>
            <li> and you are good to go.</li>
            <li> Good product and do its job.</li>
            <li> They are good for travel.  </li>
            <li> The wax comes in a rose scent, so the wax smells pleasant.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a good product, it does what it should and is cost effective.</li>
            <li> Here I am, thinking, wow, what a great product, but then you read the instructions, there are warnings galore, and it says the hair should be 5mm in length to work best.</li>
            <li> The first strip works wonderfully, as you can imagine.</li>
            <li> These strips work great on fine hair.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to do and very effective.  </li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> But the wax just wasn&#x27;t effective in either place.  </li>
            <li> They are not as effective as a chemical hair remover.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use these for my face, used them to tidy up my bikini line instead.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like going through the process of making my own wax at home.</li>
            <li> Kind of disappointing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> really liked this product and the results.  </li>
            <li> You need to either have the shaped wax strips or be pro on doing your own with the bowl of wax.</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel and actually gentle on the face.</li>
            <li> Just use warm water and a wee bit of soap.&lt;br /&gt;-Wax is so so</li>
            <li> I liked this product.  </li>
            <li> You have to warm the oils, and apply; then you tear in the direction the hair grows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I still haven&#x27;t figured them out, I gave up and just washed my face with warm water.</li>
            <li> these are by far the best wax strips I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Smooth it over good and then RIPPPPPPPPP..........</li>
            <li> Still, I give this product 2 stars because it does effectively remove most of the hair.</li>
            <li> I reread the directions and tried again with great success</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve recently switched to making my own sugar wax, which has been an awesome adventure and has been working quite well for hair removal..</li>
            <li> Personally, I love these.</li>
            <li> I also personally love the wipes,</li>
            <li> My skin is nice a smooth.     </li>
            <li> When I waxed more pores were bleeding than they would at a Salon.</li>
            <li> So over all it&#x27;s an okay product</li>
            <li> It was so prominent</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s freshly warmed up, good to go, apply, press, and rip off.</li>
            <li> and I was pleased (</li>
            <li> I kept finding more on my face.</li>
            <li> These were just okay.</li>
            <li> I just press the strip onto the skin again- smoothing the strip to my skin to make sure it&#x27;s stuck to the hair on the skin - and repeat the pull up and away process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had better luck with this do it yourself</li>
            <li> Love, love, love them.</li>
            <li> Its more in my head than anything.</li>
            <li> so well, I&#x27;m buying more of them on the subscribe and save plan.</li>
            <li> She said she has some friends she will surely recommend these to.</li>
            <li> These strips work better than most that I have tried.  </li>
            <li> Sure, you can use baby oil, but I don&#x27;t happen to have baby oil on hand and it would be much more convenient if the package contained more wipes.  </li>
            <li> it better than others?</li>
            <li> I prefer the ones from Nads as they are more gentle.&lt;br /&gt;Wipes provided are not going to be sufficient.</li>
            <li> There are many, however, who will benefit from use of this product.</li>
            <li> And no matter how many times I wash my face after using them, I get zits.</li>
            <li> No matter how many times I wash my face and do whatever...</li>
            <li> I have tried them in places I can see the results - my calves - just to be sure.</li>
            <li> that I&#x27;m sure are going to scar.</li>
            <li> works for me, most people just don&#x27;t understand how to use it.</li>
            <li> I was putting chapstick on my top lip for the three months that I used these.</li>
            <li> though this product is for the face, you&#x27;re supposed to be able to wax bikini line.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write too many reviews</li>
            <li> OK, let&#x27;s put it this way.</li>
            <li> If you are feeling skilled, you could also use these strips for eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Removing all the wax invariably caused even more skin irritation and resulted in zits.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know anyone with hair above the lip growing in a perfect rectangle.  </li>
            <li> I found that the leg wax strips, cut into pieces this size, worked WAY better.</li>
            <li> Sure, they removed the fuzz, but they took a lot of skin, too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to lie, it did not feel any better then getting it done at the salon.</li>
            <li> The more you use them the better you get as your technique improves.  </li>
            <li> These were fantastic!</li>
            <li> Okay to try</li>
            <li> I thought there had to be a better way.</li>
            <li> , if you don&#x27;t have time or the money to hit up a salon and want to get the hairs in-between brows and on the nose, I say it&#x27;s a pretty good alternation, but you WILL need to go get them waxed at a Salon or plucked if you want to get the arch areas.</li>
            <li> my pleasant suprise, these did not leave any  really noticable mark.</li>
            <li> Overall great product and definitely the best option available!</li>
            <li> It worked on my upper lip ok, but when I tried it on the top of my foot, I had to go over it three time, and it still didn&#x27;t work that great.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not as easy as it seems.     </li>
            <li> Easy to heat</li>
            <li> The rest was easily pluckable at that</li>
            <li> The wax is very mild.</li>
            <li> These are so easy to use</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s to easy to screw up something like that with these strips.</li>
            <li> , I refuse to pay for salon prices for something that I can easily take care of myself at home, I use strips about once a month and works</li>
            <li> I think this product is incredibly easy to use.</li>
            <li> to cut if the size/shape isn&#x27;t easy for your eyebrows&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The process is quite easy.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and expectations were reached.</li>
            <li> My skin does feel smooth after using it, but the wax doesn&#x27;t remove easily with the wipes.</li>
            <li> I guess that&#x27;s all fine and well, except I don&#x27;t have people sniffing my eyebrows too often.</li>
            <li> I reused one of the strips and found that it worked just fine</li>
            <li> Half of one strip is perfect for one side of my mouth.</li>
            <li> The smell was great; light and flowery withOUT being too much (only a whiff).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always done all my own waxing elsewhere, but those areas are much easier to hide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to apply some pressure to your skin as you pull the strip up and away from your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> *C.S. Light*</li>
            <li> its job well&lt;br /&gt;-Super smooth skin!&lt;br /&gt;-Easy</li>
            <li> And sometimes it leaves the hair - still standing proud - in the open wound you have created on your body.</li>
            <li> I bought these thinking they would be a great alternative to melting wax in the microwave and glopping it on my upper lip</li>
            <li> Each strip is really two wax strips which makes them cost effective too.</li>
            <li> Having trialed two supermarket purchased products, I find Veet to be far superior.  </li>
            <li> Pretty cool, and handy.    </li>
            <li> Super easy to use and super cheap!</li>
            <li> mess-free, quick clean up  too!</li>
            <li> My wife was not so sure when I handed her this package right after I received it.</li>
            <li> These are super easy to use because they require no heating and are already on the stip.</li>
            <li> But thought it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try something new- always on the look out for a better quality product or price!</li>
            <li> Hurts more than hot wax.</li>
            <li> I found that these gripped and pulled hair out neatly and cleanly.  </li>
            <li> Also, it can be helpful to cut off some of the excess paper on one side so you can be more precise and not get it on your lips or take too much off from your eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One wax strip is really two (this is something I didn&#x27;t realize the first time I used it) - you warm up the wax, then pull the two strips apart.</li>
            <li> The nice thing I liked about these is that because I have dark hairs I could see when the hair was caught in the wax through the strip.    </li>
            <li> I used these for the first time last night and they worked great on the peach fuzz on my face.</li>
            <li> They especially would be good for beginners.</li>
            <li> I used an after bath oil with Vitamin E and saturated a nice soft tissue.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t really get all the hair and rip off the top layer of skin</li>
            <li> but my face was fine (shouldn&#x27;t the face be more sensitive?).</li>
            <li> The first one worked fine -- I had missed some hairs, but I got a lot off and at the root</li>
            <li> In addition, I had some fairly mild bumps for about 24 hours.</li>
            <li> Be quick just like the girls at the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But the pain went away quickly and I no longer feel like a she-beast</li>
            <li> so for things like the face where they are intended to be used - you don&#x27;t have a drippy stick or a hot poker or a huge patch that you have to manipulate.</li>
            <li> These were super easy to use and very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for fast effective hair removal</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these strips - they are effective, easy to use and really are gentle to my skin.</li>
            <li> It worked pretty good, and as I said, it was simple.  </li>
            <li> For home face waxing, these work very well and quite easily.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to rub the strips and get them warm before putting them on your face and then rub it down in the direction of the hair a lot, don&#x27;t be ginger.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> This product really sounded promising but the actual experience wasn&#x27;t as great as the expectations I had.</li>
            <li> Fresh wax strip or</li>
            <li> and as Amazon was kind enough to send these to me, I decided to chance it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Rub the wax stripes between your hands to warm up the wax, peel the strips apart, set one strip on the area, and rip off in the opposite direction of hair growth.  </li>
            <li> I will purchase Veet in the future from now on and do my own waxing....  </li>
            <li> just seems to me that Veet&#x27;s product testing department should have either done a LOT more tests before releasing this to the market, or they should&#x27;ve just done an overhaul of the product completely before claiming that these will remove any hair.</li>
            <li> Worth a try.</li>
            <li> The directions say to test the wax and the wax removal wipe on your leg to see if you have any reactions before using it on more sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> so it was worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to the beginner because it is easy and painless..</li>
            <li> If it removed more hair, it would definitely be more highly rated, but between lack of hair removal, and the sticky residue they leave behind, it ends up creating more work to clean up and still have to shave!</li>
            <li> When I got it in the mail I stopped what I was doing and used it right away.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get too close to the nose either because the strip just isn&#x27;t the right shape.  </li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t manage to get it into just the right shape, you&#x27;re out of luck.  </li>
            <li> It says 5mm is the ideal hair length, but my facial hair doesn&#x27;t get that long.</li>
            <li> I know my cheeks do not like waxing and there is a very large possibility that I might rip off my skin.</li>
            <li> Oh, and if you wax one side, then the other, best make sure you don&#x27;t overlap in the middle because then you&#x27;ve waxed the same place twice</li>
            <li> I now know I either have to be super fast</li>
            <li> Well after a few weeks I am happy to report that she said they really do work.</li>
            <li> second time I used the strips, I had much better success as the hair was longer (the box recommends between 2 and 5mm length).  </li>
            <li> They have both been effective, but lately, I am having to do it more often.  </li>
            <li> The directions are clear and easy to follow.  </li>
            <li> I put one on the section of skin I want to wax, and I massage my finger on the outside of the wax strip, this heats up the wax and strip while it&#x27;s ON your face and also makes sure all hairs are adhered on.</li>
            <li> I should know better than to get my hopes up that there is a product out there for facial hair removal.  </li>
            <li> first thought about the directions:</li>
            <li> For whatever reason, this side just didn&#x27;t work as well as the first side.</li>
            <li> And I was able to use one set of strips over and over, needing only one set for one session.</li>
            <li> --this assumes you are going to use more than just two strips per session, which may or may not be the case (more likely than not, you are, but unless you are using 5 strips each time, you are likely to be without wipes at one point).  </li>
            <li> However, Veet is much better than the Nads wax strips I used--they only provided TWO wipes for 20 wax</li>
            <li> This occurred the first time I used these strips, but I didn&#x27;t correlate the product with the rash.  </li>
            <li> This was the first time I attempted to wax over my lip myself rather than go to a salon.  </li>
            <li> Anyway I bought this veet strips &amp; was glad to see similar packaging.</li>
            <li> I have hirsutism, and these work pretty well for me.</li>
            <li> That helps to somewhat heat it up as it it were hot wax.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a hot wax and after using this I will never get one.</li>
            <li> Please test a bit on your face first to check for allergy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I first used it on my leg.</li>
            <li> Thanks for reading!</li>
            <li> I LOVE these strips - they make removing the hair from my upper lip and eyebrows a cinch!</li>
            <li> I, like many women, wax the peach fuzz on my upper lip.</li>
            <li> but I prefer the hot wax</li>
            <li> I liked Veet&#x27;s other wax for my face (namely my eyebrows)</li>
            <li> first time I tried this product, it was very unsuccessful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m interested to see how fast the hair grows back.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, that&#x27;s pretty much what I have to say.</li>
            <li> It was easy enough to use, but I didn&#x27;t care for it at all.</li>
            <li> Also, re the previous comment about the wax strip cooling: I thought I&#x27;d try keeping a desk lamp on strip #2, to keep it warm.</li>
            <li> Overall, a good solution for small, fine areas.</li>
            <li> it shouldnt even be strong enough to handle hair anyplace else.  </li>
            <li> Other reviewers have stated that the second strip cools off too much to be effective, but I haven&#x27;t had that problem since I let it sit on my skin for a second to warm before pulling it off.</li>
            <li> I was harsher on certain areas of my lip, causing the rash.  </li>
            <li> If you are very accurate with the timing, the cream works but if you wait a few seconds too long, it burns and you look sunburnt, and that can happen very easily.</li>
            <li> I have blonde hair and have fine hair in that area that I wanted to remove.</li>
            <li> I only have fine growth and it bothers me</li>
            <li> yes, it&#x27;s a little greasy, but it makes the skin feel nice after.</li>
            <li> The wax comes in little strips you are supposed to warm with your hands by rubbing.  </li>
            <li> Had high hopes these would be quick and easy; and they are - unfortunbately they leve behind more hair than they remove.  </li>
            <li> I had red skin for a bit, but the next day I was fine and everything feels smooth.</li>
            <li> I have actually been using Nad&#x27;s recently, which is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> Thanks Veet.</li>
            <li> if you choose to use these strips you really need the wipes.  </li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Someone else mentioned this packaging flaw: you get 20 wax strips (which are really 40</li>
            <li> These wax strips do NOT work very well.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I would use these to do my eyebrows, it wouldn&#x27;t be precise enough.</li>
            <li> My upper lip is completely smooth; the wipes worked wonders at removing excess wax.  </li>
            <li> No, but it&#x27;s not worse either.</li>
            <li> They warmed up really fast, adhered well, and removed every bit of hair.</li>
            <li> Instead it felt like I&#x27;d wiped a light layer of olive oil on my skin, and the wipes never even got rid of any of the sticky wax left over.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really recommend this.</li>
            <li> It only takes one application and my face is smooth for weeks.  </li>
            <li> Free shipping also big plus</li>
            <li> This wax works best if you want to remove a section of hair from your the upper lip or thin out the fuzz on the side of your face or under you</li>
            <li> (i live near the ocean btw, where the weather is always cool, but i was giving it a chance)..</li>
            <li> --there may have been a wee less \\&quot;grip\\&quot;, but it was nice to know that if you made an oopsie, you could just reuse instead of having to get two whole new strips.  </li>
            <li> I like this kit better than other home wax kits I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It can be a bit challenging to make sure that the strip covers the area you want to remove hair from, but these strips can be used multiple times (the Nads strips were single use only) to remove hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The second strip/side of my lip was not so clean.</li>
            <li> once you pull them apart) but only four wipes to clean the dang wax off.</li>
            <li> I always have the problem with the creams that they just burn off the top bit of the hairs, allowing hair to grow back very quickly and it comes back kind of like stubble (which is almost worse than what I started with!).</li>
            <li> I am a woman with a slight mustache (I think this is the case for most woman).</li>
            <li> I use all strips for my face, I actually find that the ones that are meant for underarms/bikini are easier to use on the face as there is more wax and can cover a larger surface</li>
            <li> One decent note though</li>
            <li> Sure, you can apply, rip off fast in hopes the other wax strip doesn&#x27;t cool, but that&#x27;s really not going to happen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ripping off my skin, slowly but surely!</li>
            <li> The wax is super sticky, and the strip of wax is pretty wide, so</li>
            <li> /&gt;Exfoliate, clean, and dry skin before using product.  </li>
            <li> I normally pay $10 - $25 dollars for waxing at the salon.</li>
            <li> normally these straps are even shape, like rectangular-</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t think they irritate the skin any worse than creams that don&#x27;t do nearly as good of a job.</li>
            <li> I found that these worked, but they&#x27;re probably not the best way to get hairs off your face, mainly because facial hairs are probably too small and this is overkill and a bit harsh for the skin.</li>
            <li> about ten years ago snd ended up with a bright red upper lip for a concert two days later.</li>
            <li> Luckily it was like that first layer of skin, so I don&#x27;t look that odd.</li>
            <li> So I tossed that wax strip and started with a new one.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m gonna have to live with this mistake for quite a while....</li>
            <li> This cold wax is liquidy, supposedly to cover more hair better.</li>
            <li> Cut them to the right size so that it will lay flat on your face.</li>
            <li> If you have never done this at home before the instructions are very clear.  </li>
            <li> They are not messy at all and take only moments of preparation which involves just rubbing them together with your hands to warm them up and soften the wax a little.</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t love about the wipe is it left my skin very greasy for a very long time afterwards</li>
            <li> :  Does what it says, it&#x27;s near salon quality at home!  </li>
            <li> I like how the result of the first side of my upper lip.</li>
            <li> Prior to pulling the strip apart to place on my skin, I use a hairdrier to blast some hot air on the strip to melt the wax.</li>
            <li> My first experience with upper lip hair removal was a set of Nads wax stripes.  </li>
            <li> first time I used this product, my upper lip hair was not long enough to be effective and left patches where the hair was too short and couldn&#x27;t be removed.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to try something different for me to use at home to get rid of facial hair.  </li>
            <li> A cool thing about these is when you put the wax strip over the area to be waxed, you can see through the wax (even though it&#x27;s pink) and see what hairs will be removed.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 starts is because the package brings 10 packets of wax, but only 4 clean up wipes.</li>
            <li> for the \\&quot;cleaning\\&quot; wipes, the last thing those left me was feeling clean.</li>
            <li> Being as stubborn as I am and wanting high hopes for this product because I REALLY needed it to work, I attempted to use it on my face the next day.</li>
            <li> However, I still like the results better from wax strips than the \\&quot;less invasive\\&quot; methods, such as the Olay product I tried.  </li>
            <li> The Veet Cold Wax Strips get as close as you can to comfortable though; I really like the see-thru quality of the strips so that I can easily see where I am placing them.  </li>
            <li> I recommend the product, but only to those who are okay with a little pain, as this product WILL cause some</li>
            <li> /&gt;Brought to you by:&lt;br /&gt;*C.S. Light*he product, but only to those who are okay with a little pain, as this product WILL cause some pain.  </li>
            <li> When I bought this product I thought \\&quot;Hey a cheaper way to clear up those stubborn eyebrow hairs!\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> but my skin is sensitive</li>
            <li> I tried this product the second time, it was much easier to use.</li>
            <li> Veet - You make me feel like a natural woman</li>
            <li> also notice I break out regardless of whatever brad from the wipes (my skin is horribly sensitive)</li>
            <li> Simple and fast.</li>
            <li> My akin may just be sensitive.</li>
            <li> Thus far, we&#x27;ve tried them three times and each time, the majority of the hair is still there when the strip is removed.</li>
            <li> It costs like 5 bucks and only takes 5 minutes and is much easier on your skin.</li>
            <li> When I got this product, I was hoping to use it on my cheeks (near my ears).</li>
            <li> and I feel like the wax always completely removes with the hair.</li>
            <li> Recommend if you want save some cash and do not go to the store directly.</li>
            <li> when i opened it, i thought i&#x27;m probably in a warm (bath)room the wax on the paper is all melted like thin lotion, and not \\&quot;grasping\\&quot; onto hair at all</li>
            <li> while uncomfortable, I loved the smoothness that waxing resulted.</li>
            <li> The instructions are pretty specific about how long the hair should be, and I have made sure we&#x27;re within those limits each time, so it&#x27;s definitely not hair that&#x27;s too long or too short throwing off the performance.</li>
            <li> The special wipe did remove the extra wax, but now I have 18 strips and only 3 wipes left.</li>
            <li> Now, with these, they aren&#x27;t kidding that you have to remove it quickly after rubbing down the hair.</li>
            <li> took off all the hair I pressed down on with one quick peel.</li>
            <li> I do prefer hard wax in the end but for the price these are not bad at all and not having to wait for heating up is very convenient.</li>
            <li> This might explain why I got a rash on my upper lip in the previous two cases, as I had waxed the same area more than once.  </li>
            <li> However, there are hairs there and due to certain traumatic experiences from high school years ago, I still feel the need to remove all traces of hair there.</li>
            <li> These were also not nearly as messy as other hot wax products that take forever to heat up, drip everywhere, then become brittle and crack all over the place.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t really use these for any other area, as it would take the whole box to do larger parts of the body.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely in the market for a new wax after this change.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t hurt too bad when I pulled it off so that was good, and it also took off a decent amount of hair (some hair still remaining in that area).</li>
            <li> The only hair this product removed was the soft hair on one arm that I used to &#x27;test&#x27; the product out after it didn&#x27;t work on my face.  </li>
            <li> After pulling the strip apart the pink wax was very sticky-looking.  </li>
            <li> I barely got any hair off.</li>
            <li> These have been my alternative to spending the extra money to get a professional wax for years now, would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> After you are completely done use the essential oil wipe</li>
            <li> but I am a person who relies on everyone else&#x27;s experiences to determine if I should try something or not soI felt like noting my experience may be helpful to others, especially with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So far, I have tried waxing, shaving, hair remover cream and epilator for facial hair.</li>
            <li> I read all the directions carefully and took all the necessary precautions when first using this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wary of doing my own face wax ever since I did it once</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even attempt to use this product because the wax strips are SUPER thin and it would just be too much work.</li>
            <li> (I can&#x27;t do my whole upper lip with a single strip I have to cut it in half)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only this time, it was unsuccessful in removing hair taking only VERY few pieces and doing more bad than good leaving tons of wax.</li>
            <li> few months later I had my face waxed professionally for the first time and</li>
            <li> After that, I just tweezed the many hairs left behind.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have personal experience with the product, but my wife says this is about as good as cold wax strips get.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately with the other products I&#x27;ve tried small areas of skin were taken off along with my hair; that&#x27;s why I kept looking for the perfect product.</li>
            <li> The consistency is sticky, and not as much wax comes in this box as what came with its predecessor: there were 10 large and 10 small strips with the old formula and this new formula comes with 20 small strips.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think any product should get a bad review when it requires the buyer to participate a lot for it to be successful, so just know what you&#x27;re getting into.</li>
            <li> They barely get extra wax off and the wipes feel like sandpaper with lotion on it.   </li>
            <li> A little after that, the bumps mostly dissapeared but stayed a little red even until the next day (today as of this review).</li>
            <li> My facial hair is so blonde it is nearly white and is mostly fine, but thick above my lip.</li>
            <li> The areas I attempted were each side of my upper lip, chin and one small spot on my right cheek.</li>
            <li> With these strips, I am still left with half of the hair still on my very sticky face.  </li>
            <li> Though I followed the directions exactly, many of the thicker hairs were left behind every single time.  </li>
            <li> so it took a little longer for her to see if they really did as they said.</li>
            <li> I also dab a little bit and then refold it back up and it stays very well.</li>
            <li> The wax layer and composition is different somehow, less waxy, and not thick and gooey.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Not getting enough hair - I have noticed that if I do not rub the strips long enough or my skin is not clean that it doesn&#x27;t removed as much</li>
            <li> I can see this being handy for eyebrows and maybe other random areas, but if you have one or two scraggly hairs that you want to remove, just pluck them or shave them.</li>
            <li> If you are a regular user, you will notice that you have an increasing number of small red spots on your legs where the very short hair got pulled out in a not too gentle manner.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a majorly hairy lip, so maybe the hairs were harder to get with the wax, but the strips got about 75% of the hair.</li>
            <li> She really had very little hair on her face to work with</li>
            <li> But not being able to spend $40 a month on waxing I pulled these cold wax strips back out of the drawer last night.</li>
            <li> Depending on how long the hair on my legs don&#x27;t grow back may decide on whether I try using it on my legs again, also updating this review.</li>
            <li> The paper is semi-translucent but not clear enough to let you see what you are doing.</li>
            <li> There were still a few areas where the hair was just not quite long enough for the strips to be effective, but those areas are small and hardly noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out and you can use one sheet multiple amounts of times.</li>
            <li> The Veet Cold Wax Strips advertise that this product will safely and efficiently remove unwanted facial hair.    </li>
            <li> And your hands never really generate enough &amp;#34;heat&amp;#34; to melt it properly.  </li>
            <li> They were goopy and sticky and despite following the directions to a T, they didn&#x27;t remove ANY hair on my upper lip or between my brows (and I&#x27;m not really all that hairy</li>
            <li> Being a BIG fan of skin that&#x27;s as hairless as possible, I thought I&#x27;d try these Veet strips out to see if they were as effective as, while less painful than, my standard hair-removal choices of either epilation or individual tweezing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, long story short, they&#x27;re not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I once made the mistake of ignoring the warning about waxing the same place twice -- holy cow, that actually ripped off my skin and made me bleed.  </li>
            <li> Well, considering that the only stuff that stuck was the strange, thin layer of \\&quot;wax\\&quot;, and that without it removing any hair at all, leaves me positive that the last thing I&#x27;d do is try to use these again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I think that&#x27;s kind of a given with waxing, and these weren&#x27;t even that bad.</li>
            <li> I guess they assume someone is waxing like crazy and is using many strips at once?</li>
            <li> Strangely, I have to say yes.</li>
            <li> This won&#x27;t take care of long hairs like those on your legs, feet or eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These strips didn&#x27;t do much of anything for me outside of not even adhering properly, and just leaving behind sticky residue while removing no hair whatsoever.</li>
            <li> These strips work on short hair but they are definitely not gentle.</li>
            <li> I have even had my husband try rubbing them between his bigger, warmer hands, and it just seems like the wax never really does anything.</li>
            <li> It seems your hair would have to grow long before this would even catch it.</li>
            <li> The wipes that are contained with the cream will shortly run out, and I am not positive what I am supposed to use once they are gone... soap and water?  </li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t get your under arch of eyebrow due to the long strip and is not flexible enough to curve.   </li>
            <li> They work extremely well - Rub on in the direction of hair growth and pull back/off in the opposite direction..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Being of limited funds these days</li>
            <li> I tried to follow the instructions down to the letter several times, both on my face and under my arms.  </li>
            <li> With this product I had two hairs left to pull out and its where I didn&#x27;t rub down the strip as well.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;The long and short (chin hairs) of this story is that the strips do not work, the wipes are too few (but they don&#x27;t work well</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because the wax removing wipes are pretty much useless.</li>
            <li> I bought these recently, and I was so excited to stop using those stupid chemical hair removal things because they always left my upper lip irritated.</li>
            <li> I am not willing to wait that long.</li>
            <li> I only had to use 1 packet to wax my lip, so not sure what I&#x27;ll do when I run out of the 4 measly clean up wipes included in the box!</li>
            <li> My upper lip did sting a little, but that went away within about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> This wax process is a little rough on facial skin.</li>
            <li> of the most painful waxing products I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The soap and water really do not work so</li>
            <li> I found the wipes worked but they were rough and cumbersome.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just say, the wax is messy and I ended up pulling hairs off from my cheek vs. my upper lip.</li>
            <li> I found that it only took off a few hairs at a time as opposed to all of them.</li>
            <li> I want to say I am not very hairy.</li>
            <li> (there are a few strips left in the box!)</li>
            <li> And when they were still pink, it want as effect either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d just be glad for something that would remove that funky, tacky wax from my skin after such an unpleasant experience!</li>
            <li> The strips are very small, for the upper lip only.  </li>
            <li> I was pleased to receive the VEET Cold Wax Strips and tried two small pieces on my chin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not terribly painful or unpleasant, but it shouldn&#x27;t be considering how little hair is actually being removed.</li>
            <li> I tried with the other side of the strip.  </li>
            <li> But what about the other one?</li>
            <li> or I have to toss the other wax strip side.</li>
            <li> I would stick to other methods of hair removal.</li>
            <li> Ok, this is one of the worst products I have ever used so far!</li>
            <li> If you rub too hard or crooked or whatever, the wax slips out of the paper liner &amp; goops all over your palms.  </li>
            <li> But this is far worse, it cut up my lip really badly, huge ugly cuts,</li>
            <li> I would skip this product; it is not worth the wax it comes with.  </li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is that there are never enough of the wipes for after waxing.</li>
            <li> No hairs gone here back to the plucking least its not sticky</li>
            <li> Rip it up opposite the way your hair grows and don&#x27;t be to slow about it.</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s sitting there, being cooled down.</li>
            <li> Immediately after smoothing it down, rip it off.</li>
            <li> You put in on your body, pat it down...</li>
            <li> So, my advice would be to buy those, cut them down to size, and save money.</li>
            <li> I began to feel slight burning and removed the strip pieces.</li>
            <li> You have to take 1 set and rub in between your hands for 5 seconds or less.</li>
            <li> Not true.  </li>
            <li> In fact, it was a mess.</li>
            <li> These strips eliminate the wax pots, and all of the mess they can create.  </li>
            <li> I bought these having never waxed before and tried to follow the instructions, but I was unsuccessful in removing any hair at all and just made a sticky mess all over my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since this was my first time trying, I didn&#x27;t want to run to my computer and write a bad review of the product because I was certain my inexperience caused it to go so wrong.</li>
            <li> The package also comes with little towelettes that are meant to get any excess wax off</li>
            <li> : A) my skin does not like the formula (unlikely, as the rash is only in a small portion of the area covered by the strips and always just above my lip) or B)</li>
            <li> The wipes do nothing to get any residue off, they are just those little handi-wipes people with kids carry in the glove box.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s hard to get the suckers, and inevitably, I miss something.  </li>
            <li> It was also messy to remove the excess.</li>
            <li> that I&#x27;ve been doing it for a few years.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i have always bought Nad&#x27;s (green box)</li>
            <li> at all just waste of my money will never buy this again</li>
            <li> A few months ago I would have given these a one star review, but now I&#x27;m hooked on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I then reluctantly removed one of the ONLY four (waaaayy too few) wipes to remove the gluey wax, and it was as ineffective at its job as the strips were at theirs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but if you stick with this form of hair removal, it DOES get less painful eventually.. and personally, I have much less hair that grows back in now</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s not made for the legs because it&#x27;s too small, I tried a strip on my legs to see how well it would work, and it didn&#x27;t take off half the hair in the area of the strip.  </li>
            <li> I cut them in half because I think waxing is easier if you work in small parts.</li>
            <li> Overall, it did a decent job and wasn&#x27;t too brutal.</li>
            <li> have always had trouble with facial hair and previously used razors and Nair because I was afraid of the pain of waxing.</li>
            <li> not sure what the instructions on the inside of the box say, I just use them the way that makes sense to me.</li>
            <li> Not sure.</li>
            <li> I used Sally Hansen in the past.  </li>
            <li> I have used Sally Hansen in the past.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It should be said that these strips are for the face, so they are on the small side.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money &amp; I think a health hazard!</li>
            <li> The results in both areas (leg and face) were mixed results that I found weird.</li>
            <li> Then I realized, as the written material told me, that the product is not suitable for diabetics.</li>
            <li> I have used a couple of different cold waxing strips in the past, but thought I would try these.</li>
            <li> I will be keeping them for touch ups in between waxing with hard wax.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of very dark, very thick hair ...</li>
            <li> I have used a different \\&quot;cold</li>
            <li> It says that redness is common</li>
            <li> The wax is so gooey that quite a bit of it stayed behind on my skin and was difficult to remove with the wipes (which had to be reused because there aren&#x27;t enough in the box).  </li>
            <li> You need to practice and learn how to use it, and you need to apply both strips at once so the second one doesn&#x27;t get cold.</li>
            <li> You are also stuck with a wound that takes time to heal - I would have been in real trouble if I had done this on my face, I couldnt have gone to work.</li>
            <li> I hate going to get my eyebrows waxed at the salon, because it is expensive, and most of the time, I am not happy with the result.</li>
            <li> I use soap and water to get the wax off, and that works, but it&#x27;s still unpleasant to use the strips generally, especially when the wax gets caught up in my eyebrow itself.</li>
            <li> It took me two strips and 15 minutes to remove a very small amount of hair.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical when I was ordering this</li>
            <li> Not as painful because the strips are smaller.</li>
            <li> The actual removal process IS painful; you are ripping strips from your face to remove the hair.  </li>
            <li> did not try other parts of my body because I&#x27;m too afraid of how that&#x27;ll</li>
            <li> /&gt;Plucking the nasty, dark hairs on my upper lip is a pain in the butt.  </li>
            <li> They would leave hairs behind.  </li>
            <li> the quality is sooo poor.</li>
            <li> either - if it says &amp;#34;face&amp;#34; on the package it should be gentle &amp; worst case</li>
            <li> This product leaves both wax and hair behind.  </li>
            <li> Do not try leaves sticky mess anywhere it touches and very difficult to remove the STICKY stuff.</li>
            <li> No room to manuver and cutting it would make a real mess.</li>
            <li> I must say these little strips aren&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to remove and after I thought I had it removed</li>
            <li> I accidentally bought the wrong strips but still worked for my bikini line.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> That product is probably the least painful that I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I get an awful rash the next morning!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so so sad</li>
            <li> The was also left me with TERRIBLE acne.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I find them one of the least painful strips to use</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s difficult to get the hairs around the edges.  </li>
            <li> Maybe my hands are too cold, but I can&#x27;t ever seem to get these to pull of hair.</li>
            <li> and it is very difficult to remove,</li>
            <li> but this is just bad.</li>
            <li> I had a bad experience with this.</li>
            <li> The pain was not that bad.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as bad as I thought it was going to be.</li>
            <li> I also wondered why my skin on my leg reacted badly to the strips</li>
            <li> the process painful?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s painful</li>
            <li> If I get too close to my lip, it leaves a painful mark that will be there for a week.  </li>
            <li> I bought these at the store today because I am sick of paying $10 bucks every couple of weeks to have my lip waxed.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not buying this again, i&#x27;d rather wait for Nad&#x27;s if it gets sold out again :(</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product:( you will hurt yourself , it peeled of a piece of my lip -as</li>
            <li> watch out for this product :(</li>
            <li> was disappointed that nothing is mentioned on the box or instructions, yay or neigh, to use on eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> These work well if you plan on waxing that annoying mustache, chin hair, unibrow.</li>
            <li> Or wherever you made the mistake of putting this crap.  </li>
            <li> Painful!  </li>
            <li> The after wipes are TERRIBLE!!!!</li>
            <li> The smell of the wipes was sickening!</li>
            <li> This wax is awful.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re awful, don&#x27;t remove the wax well.</li>
            <li> Awful!  </li>
            <li> this stuff is horrible</li>
            <li> but these strips were HORRIBLE!</li>
            <li> This product is just horrible, it did nothing</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Personally, I love these. I use all strips for my face, I actually find that the ones that are meant for underarms/bikini are easier to use on the face as there is more wax and can cover a larger surface area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what the instructions on the inside of the box say, I just use them the way that makes sense to me. I pull the two strips apart. I put one on the section of skin I want to wax, and I massage my finger on the outside of the wax strip, this heats up the wax and strip while it&#x27;s ON your face and also makes sure all hairs are adhered on. And then... rip!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have coarse hairs too, no problem with these guys, it gets it all. I also personally love the wipes, yes, it&#x27;s a little greasy, but it makes the skin feel nice after. I also dab a little bit and then refold it back up and it stays very well. It doesn&#x27;t dry out and you can use one sheet multiple amounts of times. I&#x27;m only on my 2nd sheet since buying this box.</li>
            <li> I must say these little strips aren&#x27;t bad. They especially would be good for beginners. I do prefer hard wax in the end but for the price these are not bad at all and not having to wait for heating up is very convenient. I will be keeping them for touch ups in between waxing with hard wax.</li>
            <li> When I bought this product I thought \\&quot;Hey a cheaper way to clear up those stubborn eyebrow hairs!\\&quot;  But it&#x27;s not as easy as it seems.     Pros:  Does what it says, it&#x27;s near salon quality at home!  Easy to heat, you just rub and ta-da!  My skin is nice a smooth.     Cons:  Wax is ultra sticky and can pull some hairs you didn&#x27;t plan!  Won&#x27;t get your under arch of eyebrow due to the long strip and is not flexible enough to curve.   The after wipes are TERRIBLE!!!! They barely get extra wax off and the wipes feel like sandpaper with lotion on it.   When I waxed more pores were bleeding than they would at a Salon. Which causes breakouts.     So over all it&#x27;s an okay product, if you don&#x27;t have time or the money to hit up a salon and want to get the hairs in-between brows and on the nose, I say it&#x27;s a pretty good alternation, but you WILL need to go get them waxed at a Salon or plucked if you want to get the arch areas.</li>
            <li> I should know better than to get my hopes up that there is a product out there for facial hair removal.  The Veet Cold Wax Strips advertise that this product will safely and efficiently remove unwanted facial hair.    Not true.  The only hair this product removed was the soft hair on one arm that I used to &#x27;test&#x27; the product out after it didn&#x27;t work on my face.  I would skip this product; it is not worth the wax it comes with.  Natalie S. for Amazon Vine</li>
            <li> Having trialed two supermarket purchased products, I find Veet to be far superior.  The wax layer and composition is different somehow, less waxy, and not thick and gooey.  It captures hair without sticking to my skin.  Unfortunately with the other products I&#x27;ve tried small areas of skin were taken off along with my hair; that&#x27;s why I kept looking for the perfect product. I knew there must be one out there. Thanks Veet.</li>
            <li> The title says it all.  I have used a different \\&quot;cold wax\\&quot; product [[ASIN:B00138Q4OO Surgi-wax Assorted Maple Honey Wax Strips For Face Upper Lip, Chin &amp; Cheek, 16 Strips (Pack of 3)]] and will continue to use it after trying these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  After pulling the strip apart the pink wax was very sticky-looking.  I persevered nevertheless, applied it to my chin ... and the wax stayed on my skin.  So did the wayward hair!&lt;br /&gt;*  I tried with the other side of the strip.  And then a different strip.  Same thing happened.&lt;br /&gt;*  I then reluctantly removed one of the ONLY four (waaaayy too few) wipes to remove the gluey wax, and it was as ineffective at its job as the strips were at theirs.&lt;br /&gt;*  The instructions say not to try to remove excess wax with soap and water.  Yet they give you 20 strips and only 4 wipes.  The soap and water really do not work so if you choose to use these strips you really need the wipes.  A lot of them!&lt;br /&gt;*  There is an \\&quot;allergy\\&quot; warning on the box.  It was so prominent I was actually reluctant to try the strips.  I did however and I did not have any adverse reactions to the wax.  But just be warned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The long and short (chin hairs) of this story is that the strips do not work, the wipes are too few (but they don&#x27;t work well either so it&#x27;s a wash) and I do not recommend this product at all.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like this product. The smell of the wipes was sickening! It was easy enough to use, but I didn&#x27;t care for it at all. My skin does feel smooth after using it, but the wax doesn&#x27;t remove easily with the wipes. I ended up using alcohol to remove it then the wipes again. Won&#x27;t be using it again.</li>
            <li> This wax works best if you want to remove a section of hair from your the upper lip or thin out the fuzz on the side of your face or under you jaw. I can&#x27;t imagine it would work at all on the eyeborws as the sheets are about 1.5 by 2.5 inches and the wax strip itself about 3/4 inch by 2 inches. No room to manuver and cutting it would make a real mess. The paper is semi-translucent but not clear enough to let you see what you are doing. I found the wipes worked but they were rough and cumbersome. The directions say you can remove the wax with baby oil. I used an after bath oil with Vitamin E and saturated a nice soft tissue. I would imagine almost any body oil would work.</li>
            <li> I am a woman with a slight mustache (I think this is the case for most woman). I shave the unwanted hairs but I&#x27;ve wanted to try waxing for the longest time because it pulls hairs from the root. I have tried chemical lotion - that works but my skin is sensitive so I was running about with a red blotch above my lip for a day and I&#x27;d rather have the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I tried this product, it was very unsuccessful. Since this was my first time trying, I didn&#x27;t want to run to my computer and write a bad review of the product because I was certain my inexperience caused it to go so wrong. Let&#x27;s just say, the wax is messy and I ended up pulling hairs off from my cheek vs. my upper lip. I decided to wait and try it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first thought about the directions: Oh my. I almost didn&#x27;t want to try using the product! Here I am, thinking, wow, what a great product, but then you read the instructions, there are warnings galore, and it says the hair should be 5mm in length to work best. That seems short. Or I&#x27;m just not the smartest gal. Either way, I was discouraged. But the second time I read the instructions, I focused only on how to use the strips for the upper lip and ignored all the warnings. If you do that, you&#x27;re good to go (I do suggest reading everything, though).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I tried this product the second time, it was much easier to use. One wax strip is really two (this is something I didn&#x27;t realize the first time I used it) - you warm up the wax, then pull the two strips apart. The first strip works wonderfully, as you can imagine. It&#x27;s freshly warmed up, good to go, apply, press, and rip off. Hairs be gone! But what about the other one? Well, it&#x27;s sitting there, being cooled down. And it&#x27;s not as affective. And well, design flaw, anyone? Sure, you can apply, rip off fast in hopes the other wax strip doesn&#x27;t cool, but that&#x27;s really not going to happen. The first one worked fine -- I had missed some hairs, but I got a lot off and at the root and I was pleased (and this time I didn&#x27;t wax my cheek hairs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second strip/side of my lip was not so clean. In fact, it was a mess. And then I saw a tiny speck of blood and I was like, what am I doing??? I&#x27;m ripping off my skin, slowly but surely! So I tossed that wax strip and started with a new one. For whatever reason, this side just didn&#x27;t work as well as the first side. Fresh wax strip or no, it just was not happening. I reapplied several times (instructions advise of doing so) and ended up pulling off a bit of my cheek. Luckily it was like that first layer of skin, so I don&#x27;t look that odd. I barely got any hair off. So I grabbed my razor and finished off the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone else mentioned this packaging flaw: you get 20 wax strips (which are really 40 once you pull them apart) but only four wipes to clean the dang wax off. Granted the wipes are only baby oil and you can just go buy a bottle for a buck, but still - that doesn&#x27;t make sense to me at all. I guess they assume someone is waxing like crazy and is using many strips at once? Not sure. Just be forewarned that you should have some baby oil on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not try other parts of my body because I&#x27;m too afraid of how that&#x27;ll go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I use this again? Strangely, I have to say yes. I like how the result of the first side of my upper lip. I now know I either have to be super fast or I have to toss the other wax strip side. I know my cheeks do not like waxing and there is a very large possibility that I might rip off my skin. I had red skin for a bit, but the next day I was fine and everything feels smooth. I&#x27;m interested to see how fast the hair grows back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a product you have to learn to use if you&#x27;re inexperience with such things (as I am). I can see this being handy for eyebrows and maybe other random areas, but if you have one or two scraggly hairs that you want to remove, just pluck them or shave them. I don&#x27;t think any product should get a bad review when it requires the buyer to participate a lot for it to be successful, so just know what you&#x27;re getting into. Practice makes perfect!it to be successful, so just know what you&#x27;re getting into. Practice makes perfect!</li>
            <li> This product really sounded promising but the actual experience wasn&#x27;t as great as the expectations I had. I found that it only took off a few hairs at a time as opposed to all of them. I found the sticky stuff to be a challenge. It was difficult to remove and after I thought I had it removed I kept finding more on my face. If you don&#x27;t have access to other products it will do the job with some repetition, but if I had other choices I would probably check them out first.</li>
            <li> This wax is awful. I liked Veet&#x27;s other wax for my face (namely my eyebrows) but this is just bad. It doesn&#x27;t even make any sense: rose-scented wax strips? I guess that&#x27;s all fine and well, except I don&#x27;t have people sniffing my eyebrows too often. The consistency is sticky, and not as much wax comes in this box as what came with its predecessor: there were 10 large and 10 small strips with the old formula and this new formula comes with 20 small strips. The wax almost has a goopy quality, like gum left in the sun. I haven&#x27;t even tried the wipes yet because I didn&#x27;t ever like using those. I use soap and water to get the wax off, and that works, but it&#x27;s still unpleasant to use the strips generally, especially when the wax gets caught up in my eyebrow itself. It also doesn&#x27;t take hair off as well as the formula before it. It still works well, but it&#x27;s not something to write home about anymore. I&#x27;m definitely in the market for a new wax after this change.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wary of doing my own face wax ever since I did it once about ten years ago snd ended up with a bright red upper lip for a concert two days later. I&#x27;ve always done all my own waxing elsewhere, but those areas are much easier to hide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being of limited funds these days and as Amazon was kind enough to send these to me, I decided to chance it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my pleasant suprise, these did not leave any  really noticable mark. My upper lip did sting a little, but that went away within about 20 minutes. In addition, I had some fairly mild bumps for about 24 hours. I don&#x27;t have a majorly hairy lip, so maybe the hairs were harder to get with the wax, but the strips got about 75% of the hair. The rest was easily pluckable at that point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll give it another try as needed though. Overall, it did a decent job and wasn&#x27;t too brutal.</li>
            <li> I tried to follow the instructions down to the letter several times, both on my face and under my arms.  But the wax just wasn&#x27;t effective in either place.  I ended up going back and pulling out my razor.  So, that&#x27;s pretty much what I have to say.</li>
            <li> These were just okay. They are not as effective as a chemical hair remover. It took me two strips and 15 minutes to remove a very small amount of hair. After that, I still had hair left that needed to come off. I ended up going back to the chemical hair remover to finish the job. This cold wax is liquidy, supposedly to cover more hair better. It just doesn&#x27;t work. It was also messy to remove the excess. They only send 4 wipes in a package of 20 strips. The special wipe did remove the extra wax, but now I have 18 strips and only 3 wipes left. I would stick to other methods of hair removal.</li>
            <li> This won&#x27;t take care of long hairs like those on your legs, feet or eyebrows.  It worked on my upper lip ok, but when I tried it on the top of my foot, I had to go over it three time, and it still didn&#x27;t work that great.  The strips are very small, for the upper lip only.  Don&#x27;t expect to use it on your eyebrows because it&#x27;s just an oblonged strip of wax, not contoured for your eyebrow.  Although it&#x27;s not made for the legs because it&#x27;s too small, I tried a strip on my legs to see how well it would work, and it didn&#x27;t take off half the hair in the area of the strip.  The wax is very mild.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use these for my face, used them to tidy up my bikini line instead.  I prefer plucking my brows, etc...    These are the best strips I have used.  I used Sally Hansen in the past.  They would leave hairs behind.  This doesn&#x27;t.  A cool thing about these is when you put the wax strip over the area to be waxed, you can see through the wax (even though it&#x27;s pink) and see what hairs will be removed.  Pretty cool, and handy.    No cons yet.  I will update if I have any.</li>
            <li> These wax strips do NOT work very well.  The wax gets gummy and only sticks to the skin.  It doesn&#x27;t even pull the hairs out.  Definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> These are the only pre-waxed strips I&#x27;ll use. I have a lot of very dark, very thick hair ...these are by far the best wax strips I&#x27;ve found. They work extremely well - Rub on in the direction of hair growth and pull back/off in the opposite direction.. Thats it! The package also comes with little towelettes that are meant to get any excess wax off and I&#x27;ve found them to work surprisingly well.&lt;br /&gt;Is the process painful? Yes, of course it is (you&#x27;re literally ripping your hair out by the roots) but if you stick with this form of hair removal, it DOES get less painful eventually.. and personally, I have much less hair that grows back in now that I&#x27;ve been doing it for a few years.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve recently switched to making my own sugar wax, which has been an awesome adventure and has been working quite well for hair removal.. But I always keep a box of these on hand just in case I don&#x27;t feel like going through the process of making my own wax at home.</li>
            <li> Waxing never feels good.  The Veet Cold Wax Strips get as close as you can to comfortable though; I really like the see-thru quality of the strips so that I can easily see where I am placing them.  Nothing quite like ripping off hair you didn&#x27;t intend to remove, especially on your face!  I found that these gripped and pulled hair out neatly and cleanly.  The fragrance of the after-wipes wasn&#x27;t what I would prefer, but the scent didn&#x27;t linger and the wipes did the job.  I consider them a win and a good hair removal product!</li>
            <li> Prior to pulling the strip apart to place on my skin, I use a hairdrier to blast some hot air on the strip to melt the wax. When I pull the strips open, there is wax on both pieces of the strip and I apply both pieces to my legs. It&#x27;s important to apply some pressure to your skin as you pull the strip up and away from your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For any hair that remains, I repeat the process with the same strip.  I just press the strip onto the skin again- smoothing the strip to my skin to make sure it&#x27;s stuck to the hair on the skin - and repeat the pull up and away process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had better luck with this do it yourself waxing kit than with the others that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This is a reallllly great idea! Whoever made this, amazing job to you!  I use this to wax my legs... Very easy to use!  mess-free, quick clean up  too!</li>
            <li> I bought these at the store today because I am sick of paying $10 bucks every couple of weeks to have my lip waxed. These strips are great! The wax is super sticky, and the strip of wax is pretty wide, so I don&#x27;t think I would use these to do my eyebrows, it wouldn&#x27;t be precise enough. But, for the lip, they are perfect! The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 starts is because the package brings 10 packets of wax, but only 4 clean up wipes. I only had to use 1 packet to wax my lip, so not sure what I&#x27;ll do when I run out of the 4 measly clean up wipes included in the box!</li>
            <li> I have used Sally Hansen in the past. I decided to try these instead. Love, love, love them. With Sally Hansen products I still have to spend 5 minutes plucking with a tweezers. With this product I had two hairs left to pull out and its where I didn&#x27;t rub down the strip as well.    I want to say I am not very hairy. Its more in my head than anything. Its to the point where some salons have refused to wax my upper lip... However, there are hairs there and due to certain traumatic experiences from high school years ago, I still feel the need to remove all traces of hair there. These worked so well.    Now, with these, they aren&#x27;t kidding that you have to remove it quickly after rubbing down the hair. Immediately after smoothing it down, rip it off. The nice thing I liked about these is that because I have dark hairs I could see when the hair was caught in the wax through the strip.    Yes there is a lot of wax left over on your lip. The wipe they provided did the trick for me. But you can also use baby oil if there isn&#x27;t enough on the wipe. The only thing I didn&#x27;t love about the wipe is it left my skin very greasy for a very long time afterwards and I couldn&#x27;t get it all off by washing and wiping away.</li>
            <li> These are so easy to use and they work so well, I&#x27;m buying more of them on the subscribe and save plan. These are the best at home wax product I&#x27;ve ever tried. I normally pay $10 - $25 dollars for waxing at the salon. These are only $8-$10 for a pack of 20! And I was able to use one set of strips over and over, needing only one set for one session. That&#x27;s an enormous savings. Plus they didn&#x27;t burn my skin or leave marks like salon waxing. Super easy to use and super cheap!</li>
            <li> My wife was not so sure when I handed her this package right after I received it. She did, however, promise to give it a try and let me know the results. Well after a few weeks I am happy to report that she said they really do work. She really had very little hair on her face to work with so it took a little longer for her to see if they really did as they said. She said she has some friends she will surely recommend these to.</li>
            <li> I tried the strips on my armpits. Followed all the included instructions. But it didn&#x27;t work at all. The wax didn&#x27;t grab my hairs. When I pulled off the wax, I was left with all my armpit hairs, plus a sticky residue. Kind of disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;I may give them another try, since I only tried once...</li>
            <li> I accidentally bought the wrong strips but still worked for my bikini line. Not as painful because the strips are smaller.</li>
            <li> Waxing at home is a great way to save money, but it isn&#x27;t always the easiest thing to do.  These strips eliminate the wax pots, and all of the mess they can create.  These strips work better than most that I have tried.  You simply heat these up in your hand, and then apply.  The wax comes in a rose scent, so the wax smells pleasant.  I like that they gave some wipes to remove the excess wax left over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should be said that these strips are for the face, so they are on the small side.  You can&#x27;t really use these for any other area, as it would take the whole box to do larger parts of the body.  If you have never done this at home before the instructions are very clear.  So you can wax at home with confidence.</li>
            <li> Veet - You make me feel like a natural woman&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plucking the nasty, dark hairs on my upper lip is a pain in the butt.  It&#x27;s painful, it&#x27;s hard to get the suckers, and inevitably, I miss something.  My first experience with upper lip hair removal was a set of Nads wax stripes.  My second experience was with a Olay Hair Removal Kit.  And now, I decided to see how the wax strips faired after trying the relatively painless Olay method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box comes with 20 wax strips and 4 wipes.  Unlike with Olay packaging, this packaging was efficient, and there was no boxing excess.  I was a bit perturbed that there were only 4 wipes--this assumes you are going to use more than just two strips per session, which may or may not be the case (more likely than not, you are, but unless you are using 5 strips each time, you are likely to be without wipes at one point).  Sure, you can use baby oil, but I don&#x27;t happen to have baby oil on hand and it would be much more convenient if the package contained more wipes.  However, Veet is much better than the Nads wax strips I used--they only provided TWO wipes for 20 wax strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The process is simple.  Rub the wax stripes between your hands to warm up the wax, peel the strips apart, set one strip on the area, and rip off in the opposite direction of hair growth.  It can be a bit challenging to make sure that the strip covers the area you want to remove hair from, but these strips can be used multiple times (the Nads strips were single use only) to remove hair.  The actual removal process IS painful; you are ripping strips from your face to remove the hair.  However, I still like the results better from wax strips than the \\&quot;less invasive\\&quot; methods, such as the Olay product I tried.  I feel I get a closer \\&quot;shave\\&quot; and don&#x27;t have to worry about the \\&quot;stubbly\\&quot; feeling that appears even minutes after using a cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used this product, my upper lip hair was not long enough to be effective and left patches where the hair was too short and couldn&#x27;t be removed.  I used a total of four strips: two on each side of my upper lip(I did not use any of the strips multiple times).  To remove excess wax, I used one of the wipes, which worked wonders.  The smell was great; light and flowery withOUT being too much (only a whiff).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time I used the strips, I had much better success as the hair was longer (the box recommends between 2 and 5mm length).  I reused one of the strips and found that it worked just fine--there may have been a wee less \\&quot;grip\\&quot;, but it was nice to know that if you made an oopsie, you could just reuse instead of having to get two whole new strips.  There were still a few areas where the hair was just not quite long enough for the strips to be effective, but those areas are small and hardly noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 10/05/11: I have noticed a rash of some sort on my upper lip, just above my actual lip.  This occurred the first time I used these strips, but I didn&#x27;t correlate the product with the rash.  I see several reasons why I might have gotten a rash: A) my skin does not like the formula (unlikely, as the rash is only in a small portion of the area covered by the strips and always just above my lip) or B) I was harsher on certain areas of my lip, causing the rash.  The Nads wax strips never produced a rash like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 11/02/11: I reread the package and it recommends using only one wax strip per area.  This might explain why I got a rash on my upper lip in the previous two cases, as I had waxed the same area more than once.  I&#x27;ve tried again, with great results (no rash yet). My upper lip is completely smooth; the wipes worked wonders at removing excess wax.  Also, I used the wax strips up to three times with great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked this product and the results.  About the only things I didn&#x27;t like were the number of wipes included in the package and the rash (I will test to see if it is the product or the way I use the product to see what causes the rash).  I recommend the product, but only to those who are okay with a little pain, as this product WILL cause some pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brought to you by:&lt;br /&gt;*C.S. Light*he product, but only to those who are okay with a little pain, as this product WILL cause some pain.  Brought to you by:  *C.S. Light*</li>
            <li> This was the first time I attempted to wax over my lip myself rather than go to a salon.  Veet worked great.  It was easy to do and very effective.  I will purchase Veet in the future from now on and do my own waxing....  I highly recommend this product to the beginner because it is easy and painless..</li>
            <li> These work well if you plan on waxing that annoying mustache, chin hair, unibrow. These are not made to do salon work like shaping your brows! You need to either have the shaped wax strips or be pro on doing your own with the bowl of wax. It&#x27;s to easy to screw up something like that with these strips. My biggest complaint is that there are never enough of the wipes for after waxing. I only use 1 strip and so on my 4th strip I&#x27;m always out of wipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also notice I break out regardless of whatever brad from the wipes (my skin is horribly sensitive) so I always wash my face after use and it seems to do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not getting enough hair - I have noticed that if I do not rub the strips long enough or my skin is not clean that it doesn&#x27;t removed as much hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been waxing since I can remember, I refuse to pay for salon prices for something that I can easily take care of myself at home, I use strips about once a month and works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it better than others? No, but it&#x27;s not worse either.</li>
            <li> I used these for the first time last night and they worked great on the peach fuzz on my face. They warmed up really fast, adhered well, and removed every bit of hair. Simple and fast. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> These have been my alternative to spending the extra money to get a professional wax for years now, would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Being a BIG fan of skin that&#x27;s as hairless as possible, I thought I&#x27;d try these Veet strips out to see if they were as effective as, while less painful than, my standard hair-removal choices of either epilation or individual tweezing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, long story short, they&#x27;re not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These strips didn&#x27;t do much of anything for me outside of not even adhering properly, and just leaving behind sticky residue while removing no hair whatsoever. And their reusability??? Well, considering that the only stuff that stuck was the strange, thin layer of \\&quot;wax\\&quot;, and that without it removing any hair at all, leaves me positive that the last thing I&#x27;d do is try to use these again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the \\&quot;cleaning\\&quot; wipes, the last thing those left me was feeling clean. Instead it felt like I&#x27;d wiped a light layer of olive oil on my skin, and the wipes never even got rid of any of the sticky wax left over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It just seems to me that Veet&#x27;s product testing department should have either done a LOT more tests before releasing this to the market, or they should&#x27;ve just done an overhaul of the product completely before claiming that these will remove any hair. I&#x27;d just be glad for something that would remove that funky, tacky wax from my skin after such an unpleasant experience! Yuck!</li>
            <li> However, they are great. Perfect for travel and actually gentle on the face. They do the trick, just try to learn which direction to pull them in!</li>
            <li> These strips work on short hair but they are definitely not gentle. If you are a regular user, you will notice that you have an increasing number of small red spots on your legs where the very short hair got pulled out in a not too gentle manner. Hurts more than hot wax. I prefer the ones from Nads as they are more gentle.&lt;br /&gt;Wipes provided are not going to be sufficient.</li>
            <li> I had a bad experience with this. The product actually burned my face and left a scar. My akin may just be sensitive.</li>
            <li> Do not try leaves sticky mess anywhere it touches and very difficult to remove the STICKY stuff. No hairs gone here back to the plucking least its not sticky</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try something different for me to use at home to get rid of facial hair.  I have had a moustache since I was in 6th grade!  The problem with that is... I am a girl!  I&#x27;ve used both bleach and hair removal creams.  They have both been effective, but lately, I am having to do it more often.  I have had both facial waxing and electrolysis done too.  It was with great excitement that I tried these wax strips.  Unfortunately, my joy was short-lived.  The pain was not that bad.  It was definitely bearable.  The issue was hair removal.  When I use something, I want a great majority (if not all) of the hair to be gone.  With these strips, I am still left with half of the hair still on my very sticky face.  The wipes that are contained with the cream will shortly run out, and I am not positive what I am supposed to use once they are gone... soap and water?  So, this product needs to go back to the drawing board.  Unfortunately, it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to receive the VEET Cold Wax Strips and tried two small pieces on my chin. I began to feel slight burning and removed the strip pieces.Then I realized, as the written material told me, that the product is not suitable for diabetics. There are many, however, who will benefit from use of this product.</li>
            <li> I have actually been using Nad&#x27;s recently, which is an amazing product. But thought it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try something new- always on the look out for a better quality product or price! I think this product is incredibly easy to use. It got every hair I wanted it to with one yank. (Ouch.) To simplify this, here are some pros/cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;-Does its job well&lt;br /&gt;-Super smooth skin!&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to cut if the size/shape isn&#x27;t easy for your eyebrows&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Don&#x27;t use the after wipes. They&#x27;re awful, don&#x27;t remove the wax well. And no matter how many times I wash my face after using them, I get zits. Just use warm water and a wee bit of soap.&lt;br /&gt;-Wax is so so so sticky.&lt;br /&gt;-One of the most painful waxing products I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good product, it does what it should and is cost effective. Though if you&#x27;re not one for a lot of pain and would like to wax yourself, I suggest Moom&#x27;s. That product is probably the least painful that I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update* I&#x27;m never using this product again. No matter how many times I wash my face and do whatever... I get an awful rash the next morning! And I have the same reaction after using Nad&#x27;s too. I&#x27;m sticking to Moom&#x27;s!!</li>
            <li> Maybe my hands are too cold, but I can&#x27;t ever seem to get these to pull of hair. I have tried them in places I can see the results - my calves - just to be sure. The instructions are pretty specific about how long the hair should be, and I have made sure we&#x27;re within those limits each time, so it&#x27;s definitely not hair that&#x27;s too long or too short throwing off the performance. I have even had my husband try rubbing them between his bigger, warmer hands, and it just seems like the wax never really does anything. I like that the patches are smaller - so for things like the face where they are intended to be used - you don&#x27;t have a drippy stick or a hot poker or a huge patch that you have to manipulate. Thus far, we&#x27;ve tried them three times and each time, the majority of the hair is still there when the strip is removed. It&#x27;s not terribly painful or unpleasant, but it shouldn&#x27;t be considering how little hair is actually being removed. The one thing I do like is the after-wax wipes. When the skin is left sticky after the wax is pulled, it definitely gets the wax off and doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin. We will give it another go (there are a few strips left in the box!) and if we have different results, I will update, but for now, it&#x27;s a 3-star product. If it removed more hair, it would definitely be more highly rated, but between lack of hair removal, and the sticky residue they leave behind, it ends up creating more work to clean up and still have to shave!</li>
            <li> I bought these recently, and I was so excited to stop using those stupid chemical hair removal things because they always left my upper lip irritated. But this is far worse, it cut up my lip really badly, huge ugly cuts, that I&#x27;m sure are going to scar. I&#x27;m so so sad and I&#x27;m gonna have to live with this mistake for quite a while....</li>
            <li> i have always bought Nad&#x27;s (green box) face wax strips til my local store ran out.. I don&#x27;t want to have a salon treatment because i&#x27;m trying to cut back on money i&#x27;d rather save. Anyway I bought this veet strips &amp; was glad to see similar packaging. when i opened it, i thought i&#x27;m probably in a warm (bath)room the wax on the paper is all melted like thin lotion, and not \\&quot;grasping\\&quot; onto hair at all (i live near the ocean btw, where the weather is always cool, but i was giving it a chance).. tried it a second different time &amp; just gave up. the quality is sooo poor. i&#x27;m not buying this again, i&#x27;d rather wait for Nad&#x27;s if it gets sold out again :( i almost wish i read these reviews before buying &#x27;em..</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product:( you will hurt yourself , it peeled of a piece of my lip -as the strips are not even. Now my upper lip is bleeding ! normally these straps are even shape, like rectangular- so it evenly covers the surface!  watch out for this product :(</li>
            <li> works for me, most people just don&#x27;t understand how to use it. took off all the hair I pressed down on with one quick peel.</li>
            <li> Awful!  Painful!  The wax comes in little strips you are supposed to warm with your hands by rubbing.  If you rub too hard or crooked or whatever, the wax slips out of the paper liner &amp; goops all over your palms.  And your hands never really generate enough &amp;#34;heat&amp;#34; to melt it properly.  You put in on your body, pat it down...and when you rip it off, it takes the flesh with it.  No joke - It takes a layer of skin off &amp; you end up with a shiny, blood-dotted hole in the shape of the strip on your face.  Or inner thigh. Or under arm. Or wherever you made the mistake of putting this crap.  Dont give me &amp;#34;you didnt use it what it was designed for&amp;#34; either - if it says &amp;#34;face&amp;#34; on the package it should be gentle &amp; worst case it shouldnt even be strong enough to handle hair anyplace else.  And sometimes it leaves the hair - still standing proud - in the open wound you have created on your body. You have to go back with tweezers to pluck it &amp; you cant touch around it because it is bleeding - UGH!!! You are also stuck with a wound that takes time to heal - I would have been in real trouble if I had done this on my face, I couldnt have gone to work. The wipes do nothing to get any residue off, they are just those little handi-wipes people with kids carry in the glove box.  DO NOT BUY THIS!  I ended up with a multi-pack of this garbage (it was sold that way) &amp; after strip left a wound, both packages went into trash.  Waste of money &amp; I think a health hazard!</li>
            <li> I have hirsutism, and these work pretty well for me. Worth a try.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical when I was ordering this but I said what the heck and gave it a whirl. When I got it in the mail I stopped what I was doing and used it right away. You have to take 1 set and rub in between your hands for 5 seconds or less. That helps to somewhat heat it up as it it were hot wax. Then you apply it the area of choice. Smooth it over good and then RIPPPPPPPPP.......... Lol. After you are completely done use the essential oil wipe and you are good to go. It&#x27;s not as bad as I thought it was going to be. I&#x27;ve never had a hot wax and after using this I will never get one. No razor bumps no irritation . I really recommend this. Also perfect for on the go.</li>
            <li> I used these for a while on my upper lip. They didn&#x27;t really get all the hair and rip off the top layer of skin so left me feeling constantly chaffed. I was putting chapstick on my top lip for the three months that I used these. The was also left me with TERRIBLE acne. I NEVER get acne. I opted to start getting my lip threaded. It costs like 5 bucks and only takes 5 minutes and is much easier on your skin. It hurts about the same.</li>
            <li> After I opened them they became yellow and didn&#x27;t work so I had to throw them away. And when they were still pink, it want as effect either.</li>
            <li> this stuff is horrible it sticks to your skin and it is very difficult to remove,</li>
            <li> I liked this product.  The process is quite easy.  Be forewarned that the longer hairs need to be cut before this product will work optimally.  Please test a bit on your face first to check for allergy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed that nothing is mentioned on the box or instructions, yay or neigh, to use on eyebrows.  I assumed that since it was for facial hair I could use on eyebrows.  I used it on my forehead, above upper lip, nad chin where I have a mole with hair.  It worked pretty good, and as I said, it was simple.  You have to warm the oils, and apply; then you tear in the direction the hair grows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though this product is for the face, you&#x27;re supposed to be able to wax bikini line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exfoliate, clean, and dry skin before using product.  There is an instruction page in the box.  You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Had high hopes these would be quick and easy; and they are - unfortunbately they leve behind more hair than they remove.  I applied the strips repeatedly to the same place and hair was still visible.  I will not invest in these.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. I used it on my face, and there was no left over wax on me. It was painless and smelt great!  I highly recommend this for fast effective hair removal</li>
            <li> Ok, this is one of the worst products I have ever used so far! I read all the directions carefully and took all the necessary precautions when first using this product. I bought this to use on my face to wax off mustache hair as well as some hair on my cheeks and chin. The directions say to test the wax and the wax removal wipe on your leg to see if you have any reactions before using it on more sensitive areas. I first used it on my leg. It didn&#x27;t hurt too bad when I pulled it off so that was good, and it also took off a decent amount of hair (some hair still remaining in that area). Seconds later it got itchy and red. It says that redness is common so I ignored it then used the wipe to take off the remaining wax. After doing so, the area got EVEN itchier and red bumps started to appear. It was irritated for about 20 minutes or so. A little after that, the bumps mostly dissapeared but stayed a little red even until the next day (today as of this review). Being as stubborn as I am and wanting high hopes for this product because I REALLY needed it to work, I attempted to use it on my face the next day. The areas I attempted were each side of my upper lip, chin and one small spot on my right cheek. Only this time, it was unsuccessful in removing hair taking only VERY few pieces and doing more bad than good leaving tons of wax. You can&#x27;t wax an area twice in the same session which meant I had to pluck ALL the remaining hair from those areas from looking like I had blotched spots on my face. I also wondered why my skin on my leg reacted badly to the strips but my face was fine (shouldn&#x27;t the face be more sensitive?). The results in both areas (leg and face) were mixed results that I found weird. Depending on how long the hair on my legs don&#x27;t grow back may decide on whether I try using it on my legs again, also updating this review. I don&#x27;t write too many reviews but I am a person who relies on everyone else&#x27;s experiences to determine if I should try something or not soI felt like noting my experience may be helpful to others, especially with sensitive skin. Thanks for reading!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and expectations were reached. Use this product between visits to the salon for waxing, would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought these thinking they would be a great alternative to melting wax in the microwave and glopping it on my upper lip but these strips were HORRIBLE! They were goopy and sticky and despite following the directions to a T, they didn&#x27;t remove ANY hair on my upper lip or between my brows (and I&#x27;m not really all that hairy so it all should have been gone.) One decent note though, my upper lip is now softer since the strips seemed to remove some skin instead...ouch!</li>
            <li> OK, let&#x27;s put it this way. The wax strips work; they remove unwanted hair (I tested it on my arm to get an idea of efficiency). That said, the product claims to be designed to remove facial hair. It seems to me, that it is designed specifically (and only) to remove hair above the lip (which is not a problem I have). If you are feeling skilled, you could also use these strips for eyebrows. When I got this product, I was hoping to use it on my cheeks (near my ears). I have blonde hair and have fine hair in that area that I wanted to remove. I didn&#x27;t even attempt to use this product because the wax strips are SUPER thin and it would just be too much work. My suggestion to VEET would be to offer multiple strip sizes for people with different needs.</li>
            <li> I found that these worked, but they&#x27;re probably not the best way to get hairs off your face, mainly because facial hairs are probably too small and this is overkill and a bit harsh for the skin. It says 5mm is the ideal hair length, but my facial hair doesn&#x27;t get that long. Also, re the previous comment about the wax strip cooling: I thought I&#x27;d try keeping a desk lamp on strip #2, to keep it warm. Eh. My results were so-so. So far, I have tried waxing, shaving, hair remover cream and epilator for facial hair. This wax process is a little rough on facial skin. If you are very accurate with the timing, the cream works but if you wait a few seconds too long, it burns and you look sunburnt, and that can happen very easily.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these strips - they make removing the hair from my upper lip and eyebrows a cinch! It only takes one application and my face is smooth for weeks.  I find them one of the least painful strips to use and I feel like the wax always completely removes with the hair. No residue to annoy me! I highly recommend these strips - they are effective, easy to use and really are gentle to my skin. Each strip is really two wax strips which makes them cost effective too. Other reviewers have stated that the second strip cools off too much to be effective, but I haven&#x27;t had that problem since I let it sit on my skin for a second to warm before pulling it off.</li>
            <li> This product leaves both wax and hair behind.  The wax is so gooey that quite a bit of it stayed behind on my skin and was difficult to remove with the wipes (which had to be reused because there aren&#x27;t enough in the box).  Removing all the wax invariably caused even more skin irritation and resulted in zits.  Though I followed the directions exactly, many of the thicker hairs were left behind every single time.  I once made the mistake of ignoring the warning about waxing the same place twice -- holy cow, that actually ripped off my skin and made me bleed.  After that, I just tweezed the many hairs left behind.  I thought I was waxing so I wouldn&#x27;t have to tweeze. . . .  Also, it&#x27;s difficult to get the hairs around the edges.  If I get too close to my lip, it leaves a painful mark that will be there for a week.  So those hairs just have to stay.  Can&#x27;t get too close to the nose either because the strip just isn&#x27;t the right shape.  I don&#x27;t know anyone with hair above the lip growing in a perfect rectangle.  If you can&#x27;t manage to get it into just the right shape, you&#x27;re out of luck.  Remember, no waxing the same place twice, so you can&#x27;t just use it again around the edges.  Oh, and if you wax one side, then the other, best make sure you don&#x27;t overlap in the middle because then you&#x27;ve waxed the same place twice and you&#x27;ll regret it!  Still, I give this product 2 stars because it does effectively remove most of the hair.</li>
            <li> these must have frozen because the wax was not all on one side of the strip.  so they don&#x27;t work and ripped off skin</li>
            <li> I bought this product with the leg wax strips, hoping to use them on a Brazilian wax. I know the product isn&#x27;t designed for that use, but it didn&#x27;t even pull out any hair. At All. I found that the leg wax strips, cut into pieces this size, worked WAY better. So, my advice would be to buy those, cut them down to size, and save money. If you&#x27;re just using them for your eyebrows or over your lip, then why not use a product that will DEFINITELY take off the hair and save you money?</li>
            <li> I, like many women, wax the peach fuzz on my upper lip. I have used a couple of different cold waxing strips in the past, but thought I would try these. BIG MISTAKE! Sure, they removed the fuzz, but they took a lot of skin, too. I am back to using Sally Hansen strips.</li>
            <li> This product is just horrible, it did nothing at all just waste of my money will never buy this again</li>
            <li> I hate going to get my eyebrows waxed at the salon, because it is expensive, and most of the time, I am not happy with the result. These strips work so well! No prep work necessary!</li>
            <li> Good product and do its job. Recommend if you want save some cash and do not go to the store directly. Free shipping also big plus</li>
            <li> A few months ago I would have given these a one star review, but now I&#x27;m hooked on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always had trouble with facial hair and previously used razors and Nair because I was afraid of the pain of waxing. My facial hair is so blonde it is nearly white and is mostly fine, but thick above my lip. I bought these having never waxed before and tried to follow the instructions, but I was unsuccessful in removing any hair at all and just made a sticky mess all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few months later I had my face waxed professionally for the first time and while uncomfortable, I loved the smoothness that waxing resulted. But not being able to spend $40 a month on waxing I pulled these cold wax strips back out of the drawer last night. I reread the directions and tried again with great success and I have already ordered more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips for success.&lt;br /&gt;1. Cut them to the right size so that it will lay flat on your face. (I can&#x27;t do my whole upper lip with a single strip I have to cut it in half)&lt;br /&gt;2. Make sure to rub the strips and get them warm before putting them on your face and then rub it down in the direction of the hair a lot, don&#x27;t be ginger.&lt;br /&gt;3. Rip it up opposite the way your hair grows and don&#x27;t be to slow about it. Be quick just like the girls at the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to lie, it did not feel any better then getting it done at the salon. But the pain went away quickly and I no longer feel like a she-beast so it was worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because the wax removing wipes are pretty much useless. I still haven&#x27;t figured them out, I gave up and just washed my face with warm water.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have personal experience with the product, but my wife says this is about as good as cold wax strips get.  She doesn&#x27;t use this as her preferred method of hair removal, but she does say that it works well for what it is.</li>
            <li> For home face waxing, these work very well and quite easily.  The directions are clear and easy to follow.  They are good for travel.  You can use them on your legs too.  The more you use them the better you get as your technique improves.  They are not messy at all and take only moments of preparation which involves just rubbing them together with your hands to warm them up and soften the wax a little.</li>
            <li> These were fantastic! I always have the problem with the creams that they just burn off the top bit of the hairs, allowing hair to grow back very quickly and it comes back kind of like stubble (which is almost worse than what I started with!). These were super easy to use and very inexpensive. I cut them in half because I think waxing is easier if you work in small parts. Half of one strip is perfect for one side of my mouth. Also, it can be helpful to cut off some of the excess paper on one side so you can be more precise and not get it on your lips or take too much off from your eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People keep reviewing that they hurt and irritate this skin a bit but I think that&#x27;s kind of a given with waxing, and these weren&#x27;t even that bad. I also don&#x27;t think they irritate the skin any worse than creams that don&#x27;t do nearly as good of a job. These were also not nearly as messy as other hot wax products that take forever to heat up, drip everywhere, then become brittle and crack all over the place. These are super easy to use because they require no heating and are already on the stip. Overall great product and definitely the best option available!</li>
            <li> Okay to try but I prefer the hot wax</li>
            <li> Does not work. I had never tried a product like this and read all the reviews.  I only have fine growth and it bothers me so I always tweeze. I thought there had to be a better way. It seems your hair would have to grow long before this would even catch it. I am not willing to wait that long.</li>
            <li> These strips work great on fine hair.  But if you have course hair, they will disappoint you.  Overall, a good solution for small, fine areas.</li>
            <li> I like this kit better than other home wax kits I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s still a home wax kit, though. You need to practice and learn how to use it, and you need to apply both strips at once so the second one doesn&#x27;t get cold.</li>
