            <li> So so with the grand kids</li>
            <li> This bag is a must have and is perfect for a little getaway.  I use it for the beach to pack 4 beach towels, snacks, and extra change of clothes for me and the kidsâ€¦I also have used it for a  4 day hotel stay cation.  It is very spacious and would accommodate a 4 day vacation away from home and would fit all essentials you would need.  Only one Limited edition duffle bag from Victoria Secret comes out once a year and is only available while supplies last and each bag is different in style and design every year.  I also have the 2012 edition but this year&#x27;s edition is by far the best one yet!!  It is Cotton Canvas and 19&amp;#34; L x 7.75&amp;#34; W x 14&amp;#34; H.  I love the fact that you can throw it in the wash if it ever needs washing :)  If you plan on purchasing this item, I am certain that you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  Hell, I can&#x27;t wait to see what victoria secret has in store for their 2015 limited edition bags!</li>

            <li> At first I was hesitant to buying this bag because it was online and I&#x27;ve been scammed before (NOT ON AMAZON). However, I took a chance and bought it. I was very satisfied with the price and with how they sent this bag to me two days before I had to use it. I recommend buying with this vender.</li>

            <li> VS getaway bag is huge with lots of room for enough clothes for 2-3 days.

I also love the fact that the handles are padded and comes with a carry strap. I love the pattern to, it&#x27;s so cool and I have had nothing but compliments on it. Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Big bag! Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> The bag looks very nice and it is very ciye and stylish as an weekend bag. However it did take a while to get here a week and 3 days usps. Takes a long time to deliver and orders should only be shipped through ups. However this is just my personal opinion.</li>
