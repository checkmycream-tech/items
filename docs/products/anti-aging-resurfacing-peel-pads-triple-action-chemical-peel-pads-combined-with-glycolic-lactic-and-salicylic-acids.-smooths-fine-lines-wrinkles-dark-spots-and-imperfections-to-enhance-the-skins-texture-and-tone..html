            <li> I could see a slight difference after each pad used, but you need to give it at least two to three weeks to really get the results you want to see.</li>
            <li> This product is not the same as in the photo,at least ingedients are not the same.</li>
            <li> I use a few different products to maintain the post-laser resurfacing results under my eyes... but won&#x27;t delve into that here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the are not exactly drugstore priced.</li>

            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had dark circles under my eyes for years and they are gone.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> it helped reduce the appearance of my dark spots .</li>
            <li> salicylic acid combats acne and exfoliates, glycolic acid vaporizes dark spots and lactic acid hydrates.  </li>
            <li> I asked my friend, do I wet them before I use??!!</li>
            <li> After a week I&#x27;ve seen no more dullness and dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have also noticed my eyes look less puffy in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Due to pollution and sun we face many skin problems like drying and dullness, but when I used this I was shocked!</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t help but feel like I was being had while looking through all of these fabulous (non-verified) five-star reviews. :(</li>
            <li> Plus helps with those dark spots!</li>
            <li> She informed me that I must of got a dried out container of them.. :</li>
            <li> It worked like a glycolic peel without the harsh dryness and stinging.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I could feel the difference within few days.</li>
            <li> I had wrinkles and bags under my eyes and I started to use these for about a week and a half, and I could already see a difference!</li>
            <li> I use them 2 to 3 times a week, usually at night after I wash my face.</li>
            <li> To keep me looking my delicate age of 28.</li>
            <li> I just felt like giving a warning because I take reviews very seriously</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> A gentle but effective way to clean and nourish your skin. This product is great at smoothing fine lines, wrinkles, and  dark spots. And making the overall texture more even. I feel like my skin is super soft and healthy now.</li>
            <li> I look younger and cuter! I am contented with myself once again.</li>
            <li> This is a great pad for anti-ageing. I recommend this product to anyone suffering from facial problems to do with aging.&lt;br /&gt;It removes wrinkles and it is skin clarifying.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase mine from amazon but they were around the same price and was the exact same product. These have a deep cleanse and leave your face feeling nice smooth and fresh. I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> These peel pads are wonderful for your face and neck.  I have had no irritation and use every day.  The skin on my face and neck is very smooth after just a few days of use.&lt;br /&gt;This brand should make a peel pad that is stronger for your legs.</li>
            <li> I find it very VERY interesting that the vast majority of these glowing five star reviews were 1) written around the same time period and 2) not Amazon verified purchases!!!! I guess it&#x27;s really easy to create Amazon accounts and just fill your own page with glowing reviews (notice: a lot of the language used in these non-verified reviews sounds similar too). I am an acne sufferer and willing to try anything. But beware of products that seem too fantastic to be true. Amongst Amazon verified reviews, the effectiveness of this product seems hit-or-miss. 50/50. I just felt like giving a warning because I take reviews very seriously and I couldn&#x27;t help but feel like I was being had while looking through all of these fabulous (non-verified) five-star reviews. :(</li>
            <li> These are so awesome they actually work great.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had dark circles under my eyes for years and they are gone.&lt;br /&gt;And my wrinkles are going away.&lt;br /&gt;I was given a discount for giving my honest and unbiased opinion.&lt;br /&gt;This is a 5 star product and that&#x27;s my uninfluenced opinion.</li>
            <li> Finally able to look in the mirror with ease again. The product has helped my skin tremendously! Must have!</li>
            <li> after using these for a week i could see an incredible difference in my skin. it was much smoother and tone seemed a lot more even. definately would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over a week now and the first couple times I didn&#x27;t see any difference in my complexion, Nothing. So I stopped using it. After a couple days I&#x27;ve noticed my face started to have a light flake to it especially on my dark spots. I&#x27;ve also been using a drema roller along with it. Im loving the results so far.</li>
            <li> Great product!  See results quickly.</li>
            <li> Very impressed!  These resurfacing pads work just as well as many higher-priced products I&#x27;ve tried.  They&#x27;re quick and easy to use, and my skin is looking bright and fresh.  I could see a slight difference after each pad used, but you need to give it at least two to three weeks to really get the results you want to see.</li>
            <li> I received my order. I was very excited to try these pads out! My friend recommended I try them. I wasn&#x27;t sure why the pads were dry? I never used them before, so I wasn&#x27;t sure how they come.  I asked my friend, do I wet them before I use??!! She informed me that I must of got a dried out container of them.. :(&lt;br /&gt;I then checked out the pads to see if any were moist, at the bottom of the container I found 3 were kinda moist /damp.&lt;br /&gt; I would like to try these pads out.  I hear good things about them. I&#x27;m unfortunately not happy or impressed that I recieved a container that Isn&#x27;t useful to me at all the are not exactly drugstore priced. 👎</li>
            <li> This cream is really good,it has helped me to reduce the dark spots to my face.My skin also feels lighter and smoother different than before.Definitely i love the peel pads its very amazing! Try it out</li>
            <li> Of all the products that I&#x27;ve tried to generally remove all of the oil on my face. To keep me looking my delicate age of 28. I&#x27;ve never ran into a product that does it better than this. I am trying to anti age because I want to look young for as long as possible. Who wouldn&#x27;t? This really works awesome I&#x27;m going to order more. This makes me more confident to go to my tenth anniversary from high school. I&#x27;m not really a shallow type of person, but I like looking good.</li>
            <li> Hi friends I am 45 Years old,I had some wrinkles,I was searching for a solution so I could rid of this wrinkles.Then my elder brother suggested this product.. And now friends say that I look 5-10 years younger thanks to this product !!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best Anti Aging product in the market !!!&lt;br /&gt;It is very effective and i&#x27;m loving it. I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in the first days, but on the other day my skin was beautiful. I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It cleanses the face and clears it away. It leaves your face fresh and is very effective.</li>
            <li> This product is really good it helped reduce the appearance of my dark spots . As well as helping my dry skin . I love this !</li>
            <li> Gosh... This stuff is amazing.  I have combination skin -- oily in places and dry in others.  I also have occasional adult acne and middle-age wrinkles and spots.  These pads have made such a hug difference!  The consistency of my complexion, the clean feeling, and the loss of wrinkles is a WIN WIN!  Thank you for such a great product!</li>
            <li> The pads are okay, I agree that they could use a bit more moisture.  They reminded me of the Salicylic Acid pads you buy at the drugstore (Noxzema, Stridex, ...).  I personally think this product is overpriced.  For almost $40, I was expecting a bit more. I won&#x27;t buy again at that price.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I am happy with this product.  It is extremely pleasant to use. I like the way my skin looks and feels.  It is not irritating at all.  I plan to order again.  I use them 2 to 3 times a week, usually at night after I wash my face.</li>
            <li> This product is not the same as in the photo,at least ingedients are not the same. For those curios, the container I got says active ingredient is Sallcylic Acic 2%.Then it says it also contains 5% Glycolic Acid and 5% Lactic Acid.</li>
            <li> Amazing peel pads. All in one face solution. I don&#x27;t think now about any other beauty product for my face. Furthermore, I feel refreshed and much younger than ever before. It cleanses so perfectly, that face skin no longer require its extra care. I wish I could have found these antiaging resurfacing peel pads a lot earlier. Anyways, Better late than never.</li>
            <li> After using this product I have seen my skin clearing amazing product,Give it a try!</li>
            <li> Well worth the price when you consider the results. My skin feels lighter, tighter, and clearer. I have also noticed my eyes look less puffy in the morning.  It is also not gloppy, and does not break me out. It truly does feel like the hands of time have been turned back a bit!</li>
            <li> I started to worry quite a lot about my skin after the past year as it has visibly  began to deteriorate over the past few years, the anti-aging and anti-acne treatments within this product have been a great benefit for my skin with the exfoliating agent, my skin has finally restored to it&#x27;s former glory. I&#x27;ve purchased a gift set for my mother as I fully believe this product will sort out any skin problems. It&#x27;s great value for money and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I write a skincare blog - http://www.imarriedadoctor.com- and Beauty Facial Extreme Resurfacing Peel Pads is one of my favorite OTC products. Since getting off of birth control, I&#x27;ve struggled with hormonal breakouts.  Since adding these pads to my daily and nightly regimen, I have had ZERO breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daily Regimen:  1. Wash with Cetaphil  2. Tone with Beauty Facial Extreme Peel Pads  3. Apply Natural Niacinamide serum (http://amzn.to/1ITvCjh) 4.  Moisturize with Cetaphil cream  5.  Apply SPF (followed by primer and make up... or mineral powder SPF AFTER make up)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nightly Regimen:  1.  Wash with Clarisonic and cetaphil  2. Tone with Beauty Facial Extreme Peel Pads  3. Apply Natural Niacinamide serum (http://amzn.to/1ITvCjh)  4.  Apply retin-a .1%  5.  Apply Cetaphil Cream  *I use a few different products to maintain the post-laser resurfacing results under my eyes... but won&#x27;t delve into that here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product really works- salicylic acid combats acne and exfoliates, glycolic acid vaporizes dark spots and lactic acid hydrates.  5 star product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those people that when I find a product I love, I tell EVERYBODY. All my friends will tell you that I love trying new products.  So a friend of mine gave me some of these pads to try.  She LOVED them and knew i would too.  We both have sensitive skin and I am always looking for beauty products,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE THESE.  I&#x27;m purchasing some as I type. It worked like a glycolic peel without the harsh dryness and stinging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;plus they are so easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do at home peels, TRY THIS.  It works fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HINT:  they work excellent for cuticle care also.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! It fights fine lines and wrinkles! Plus helps with those dark spots! It is a miracle worker. Definitely worth your money!</li>
            <li> These Anti Aging Resurfacing Peel Pads were one of the best purchases I have ever made on Amazon! I had wrinkles and bags under my eyes and I started to use these for about a week and a half, and I could already see a difference! Now, I have been using them for over a month, and my face is wrinkle free! These should cost more because they are so effective and I would recommend them to anyone :)</li>
            <li> probably the best product is have seen. I think it is one of the best anti aging creams. The ingredients used are of really good quality so there is no bad effect on skin. It makes the skin soft and sensitive. It removes all the scars and pimples from the face. Really a very good quality cream. it also removes the acne from face. One must try it. its really nice</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. At first I thought it wouldn&#x27;t work but when I started using it. I could feel the difference within few days.</li>
            <li> These peel pads work wonder. Due to pollution and sun we face many skin problems like drying and dullness, but when I used this I was shocked! After a week I&#x27;ve seen no more dullness and dry skin. It&#x27;s a cream to keep my skin healthy and fit. Also pads are convenient to use and smells great making me fresh. Overall a great product.</li>
