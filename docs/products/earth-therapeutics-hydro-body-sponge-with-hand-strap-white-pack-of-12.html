    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>but I decided to take a chance figuring that I could work around that if, as one reviewer mentioned, it was close to being the perfect pouf.  </li>
            <li>Very good quality loufa, I feel exfoliated after my showers now!</li>
            <li>I am so happy with my purchase of Earth Therapeutics hydro body sponge</li>
            <li>Great deal for the money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve added a picture showing that it stretches very nicely</li>
            <li>in all, a good price</li>
            <li>The quality of the mesh seems good but the construction is not.</li>
            <li>Good lord...</li>
            <li>This is the first bath pouf I&#x27;ve seen that has a thicker handle made out of the pouf material itself instead of a string -- and it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>and it comes nicely packaged in a sealed package containing four separately wrapped packages of three.</li>
            <li>I never knew how much I liked this brand</li>
            <li>The strap comes in handy for hanging.</li>
            <li>Very easy to hold, has a great hand-feel, and hangs just fine.</li>
            <li>While they are fairly affordable, the quality is less than impressive.</li>
            <li>The structure is intact but it is not a ball shape anymore, more like a snowflake.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I find I prefer its slightly more abrasive texture.  </li>
            <li>I like the ones that I purchase at Wal-Mart better.</li>
            <li>I love to use these in the shower.  </li>
            <li>I find I&#x27;m able to use mine for about 2-3 months</li>
            <li>It really lathers up the shower gel or soap so nicely!  </li>
            <li>I needed a new body sponge and this one had a great price.  </li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t cost much, which is good.</li>
            <li>Mine arrived all in one package and they are a nice, bright white.</li>
            <li>Strong and durable.</li>
            <li>or as I call it a bath pouf :)  I was first drawn to this product because it came in so many colors.  </li>
            <li>This works OK but is unraveling quickly for me.  </li>
            <li>Some reviewers mentioned that it didn&#x27;t fit over knobs, etc.</li>
            <li>loop size in the netting is fine - holds body wash lotions just fine with enough water flow to make for a good \\&quot;suds-ing\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This specially designed body sponge doubles the bubbles for a thorough and luxurious cleansing experience.</li>
            <li>I was happy to find that I really like this strap better than the usual ropes and ribbons on most.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re made out of a substantial amount of material, so they&#x27;re fairly condensed, which is nice because it enables them to be soft and scrubby at the same time.</li>
            <li>I used three of them before I gave up and returned the remaining sponges to Amazon for a full refund.</li>
            <li>(so I spend $1 per month on these - not bad).  </li>
            <li>If you can get two or three weeks out of them, then count yourself lucky.</li>
            <li>Earth Therapeutics uses only the best quality raw materials available.</li>
            <li>Mine is hung on a hook right now, but when I first ordered them I was hanging it on a corner of my shower caddy</li>
            <li>I can get them in large quantities from Amazon to my door!</li>
            <li>They fall apart after one use and are not as good as the ones I previously ordered.</li>
            <li>love that I can get this pouf in a package of 12 of all the same color</li>
            <li>I have had 4-5 of these fall apart within the first 3-4 washes.  </li>
            <li>This is the perfect mid range from not too soft and not too rough!  </li>
            <li>On the whole, I&#x27;m still partial to sponges instead of poufs (these didn&#x27;t make me a total convert), but I&#x27;m quite happy with these</li>
            <li>I bought these because of the large quantity.</li>
            <li>And it is wound nice and tight.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>and they last long enough to make it in practice a great price ($1 per month).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not especially hard on my shower poofs, so I was a bit surprised when the first one unraveled after one week.</li>
            <li>To get 5 stars they would have to very soft.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>These loofah&#x27;s are pretty standard to others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>and so far, it has held up for a week.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These poufs are about medium tautness, and are quite soft.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll definitely use up the whole package.</li>
            <li>They are soft and lather well on the skin.  </li>
            <li>I really like that the strap is made of the same material as the sponge.</li>
            <li>I doubt that the sponge actually doubles the bubbles, but it does work very well for what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>A few more lasted only a couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li>Within the first 5 uses, they just come undone and never tie back the same when I try.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend against purchasing such a low quality product.</li>
            <li>It is not rough or scratchy by any means.  </li>
            <li>far as texture goes, it is such an individual preference.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s better or worse than similar products, but I like it and would buy it again.  </li>
            <li>This pouf is not as loosely made nor as soft as the&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>

            <li> I debated on 5 stars but ended at 4 stars due to these being not as soft as some of the organic ones I have used.</li>
            <li> They were also too soft to scrub off dirt and dead skin.</li>
            <li> I am having a harder time finding these</li>
            <li> The last group is falling apart within a few days.</li>
            <li> The handle is easier to find while your eyes are closed and that makes hanging on a hook a breeze.</li>
            <li> , then they become loose enough that they&#x27;re not as effective at cleaning, and they also start to snag very painfully on body piercings (something that never would have occurred to me until it happened!).</li>
            <li> but any other brand.</li>
            <li> I have also found it cuts down on the quantity of soap used.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, they are not rough, they are just not perfectly soft.  </li>
            <li> but like the slightly exfoliating  feel of using the Earth Therapeutics pouf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They start out tightly wound at about 4\\&quot; in size.  </li>
            <li> These sponges are poor made and unravel after only a few uses (less than 6 showers).  </li>
            <li> After a few weeks they will loosen up and \\&quot;come apart\\&quot; but are still usable.  </li>
            <li> My complaint is that the small piece of rope in the middle that keeps the loofah in a bundle has come untied on about 4 of the 8 of these we have used over the past year.</li>
            <li> The purpose of a bath sponge is to save the amount of body wash used, and to get rid of dead skin.</li>
            <li> it just gets flatter (not sure how to explain it).  </li>
            <li> The sponges were too small for my liking, and when I say small, I mean small (the size of my fists and I have small fists).</li>
            <li> I think that he scrubs really hard which usually results in a frayed and unraveled sponge.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have any hard pieces where the strap is attached, as some poufs do.</li>
            <li> The part that I was afraid of was the the handle, but I actually prefer it over a flimsy string.</li>
            <li> I returned them even though I knew that it would mean I have paid $12 for shipping and handling and the product is $18.99</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the reviews for each color are separate and there are not many for each</li>
            <li> POOR WORKMANSHIP?</li>
            <li> I returned the items because the price posted on the web-site was wrong</li>
            <li> Horrible Quality.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These are not the same as was ordered the last time. The picture does not represent the item. They fall apart after one use and are not as good as the ones I previously ordered. These are from Earth Therapeutics but they are not the same as in the picture. Horrible Quality.</li>
            <li> I debated on 5 stars but ended at 4 stars due to these being not as soft as some of the organic ones I have used. To get 5 stars they would have to very soft. These are plastic.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, they are not rough, they are just not perfectly soft.  Of course based on the price as of the writing of this review ($36.00), these are only $3.00 each so I guess I shouldn&#x27;t be complaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each one will last me about 3 months with daily usage by two people (so I spend $1 per month on these - not bad).  They start out tightly wound at about 4\\&quot; in size.  After a few weeks they will loosen up and \\&quot;come apart\\&quot; but are still usable.  The ball does not come apart it just gets flatter (not sure how to explain it).  The structure is intact but it is not a ball shape anymore, more like a snowflake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hanger on these is made from the same material as the ball and integrated in the ball.  It&#x27;s not a separate string like I have seen on others.  I have never had the hanging part of these come apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The loop size in the netting is fine - holds body wash lotions just fine with enough water flow to make for a good \\&quot;suds-ing\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a good price and they last long enough to make it in practice a great price ($1 per month).</li>
            <li> I am so happy with my purchase of Earth Therapeutics hydro body sponge [[ASIN:B000MX2CRY Earth Therapeutics Hydro Body Sponge, with Hand Strap, White (Pack of 12)]]  or as I call it a bath pouf :)  I was first drawn to this product because it came in so many colors.  Unfortunately, the reviews for each color are separate and there are not many for each so I actually read through each in order to see if I wanted to order a dozen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only concern was the hanging strap.  Some reviewers mentioned that it didn&#x27;t fit over knobs, etc. but I decided to take a chance figuring that I could work around that if, as one reviewer mentioned, it was close to being the perfect pouf.  I was happy to find that I really like this strap better than the usual ropes and ribbons on most.  I&#x27;ve added a picture showing that it stretches very nicely and it fits well both on a shower hook or over a bathtub faucet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as texture goes, it is such an individual preference.  This pouf is not as loosely made nor as soft as the&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001CTQMIC Aquasentials Mesh Pouf Bath Sponge (4 Pack)]] but I find I prefer its slightly more abrasive texture.  It is not rough or scratchy by any means.  I have very sensitive skin but like the slightly exfoliating  feel of using the Earth Therapeutics pouf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that I can get this pouf in a package of 12 of all the same color and it comes nicely packaged in a sealed package containing four separately wrapped packages of three.</li>
            <li> I returned the items because the price posted on the web-site was wrong and I had ordered a large quantity only to receive a small quantity (price on web-site when I ordered was $2.99 for a case of twelve)  After calling to find out why, I was told that they had put the incorrect price on the web-site and the resolution provided was not to my satisfaction.</li>
            <li> These loofah&#x27;s are pretty standard to others I&#x27;ve used. My complaint is that the small piece of rope in the middle that keeps the loofah in a bundle has come untied on about 4 of the 8 of these we have used over the past year. Within the first 5 uses, they just come undone and never tie back the same when I try.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t cost much, which is good. Because they don&#x27;t hold up. If you can get two or three weeks out of them, then count yourself lucky. Save your money and buy another sponge.</li>
            <li> The purpose of a bath sponge is to save the amount of body wash used, and to get rid of dead skin. The sponges were too small for my liking, and when I say small, I mean small (the size of my fists and I have small fists). They were also too soft to scrub off dirt and dead skin. I returned them even though I knew that it would mean I have paid $12 for shipping and handling and the product is $18.99</li>
            <li> I bought these because of the large quantity. For some reason my husband goes through body sponges every two weeks. I think that he scrubs really hard which usually results in a frayed and unraveled sponge. It&#x27;s been two months and he is still using the same sponge. It&#x27;s in the same shape and form as day 1. These are quality sponges. Looks like it&#x27;s going to take me a lot longer to get through all the sponges.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not especially hard on my shower poofs, so I was a bit surprised when the first one unraveled after one week. I&#x27;m on the second poof and so far, it has held up for a week.</li>
            <li> These simply fall apart.  I have had 4-5 of these fall apart within the first 3-4 washes.  A few more lasted only a couple of weeks.  Less than half of them lasted enough to be worth the purchase.  They simply unravel where they were tied together.  I would highly recommend against purchasing such a low quality product.</li>
            <li> While they are fairly affordable, the quality is less than impressive. They are relatively scratchy. I like the ones that I purchase at Wal-Mart better. I do like the fact that the strap is made out of loofa material as opposed to string though. But I will not be purchasing these again.</li>
            <li> Great deal for the money. Each loofa lasts a longf time. I recommend them.</li>
            <li> I never knew how much I liked this brand untill I ran out and had to use another. It turns out- they are not all the same.  This is the perfect mid range from not too soft and not too rough!  And it is wound nice and tight.  It really lathers up the shower gel or soap so nicely!  I am having a harder time finding these so I HOPE they&#x27;re not discontinued. This 12 pack will probably last me about a year though.</li>
            <li> I love to use these in the shower.  I have also found it cuts down on the quantity of soap used.</li>
            <li> This is the first bath pouf I&#x27;ve seen that has a thicker handle made out of the pouf material itself instead of a string -- and it&#x27;s great! Very easy to hold, has a great hand-feel, and hangs just fine. Mine is hung on a hook right now, but when I first ordered them I was hanging it on a corner of my shower caddy and it stayed up without a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These poufs are about medium tautness, and are quite soft. They&#x27;re made out of a substantial amount of material, so they&#x27;re fairly condensed, which is nice because it enables them to be soft and scrubby at the same time. I find I&#x27;m able to use mine for about 2-3 months, then they become loose enough that they&#x27;re not as effective at cleaning, and they also start to snag very painfully on body piercings (something that never would have occurred to me until it happened!). On the whole, I&#x27;m still partial to sponges instead of poufs (these didn&#x27;t make me a total convert), but I&#x27;m quite happy with these and I&#x27;ll definitely use up the whole package.</li>
            <li> I have been getting these for some time now and would not but any other brand. They are soft and lather well on the skin.  I like that I can get them in large quantities from Amazon to my door!</li>
            <li> This works OK but is unraveling quickly for me.  The quality of the mesh seems good but the construction is not. I would not order again.</li>
            <li> Very good quality loufa, I feel exfoliated after my showers now! I would highly recommend it! I grabbed a 12 pack of these!</li>
            <li> These are good-quality bath poufs and not cheap-feeling like some of the Target or drugstore ones can be. I really like that the strap is made of the same material as the sponge. It doesn&#x27;t have any hard pieces where the strap is attached, as some poufs do. Mine arrived all in one package and they are a nice, bright white.</li>
            <li> I get these regularly. The last group is falling apart within a few days. POOR WORKMANSHIP? For the price I will go some where else.</li>
            <li> I doubt that the sponge actually doubles the bubbles, but it does work very well for what it&#x27;s supposed to do. The sponge has held firm throughout my washes and feels very &amp;#34;firm&amp;#34; and not like it&#x27;s about to fall apart. The part that I was afraid of was the the handle, but I actually prefer it over a flimsy string. The handle is easier to find while your eyes are closed and that makes hanging on a hook a breeze.</li>
            <li> These sponges are poor made and unravel after only a few uses (less than 6 showers).  I used three of them before I gave up and returned the remaining sponges to Amazon for a full refund.</li>
            <li> Still back ordered...so we will see.  Good lord...it is a scrubby for the shower and I don&#x27;t have it yet.</li>
            <li> This specially designed body sponge doubles the bubbles for a thorough and luxurious cleansing experience. The convenient hand strap secures the sponge snugly in place during cleansing. Earth Therapeutics uses only the best quality raw materials available. This ensures the smoothest feel as well as the highest safety ratings when coming in contact with skin.  Strong and durable.</li>
            <li> I needed a new body sponge and this one had a great price.  I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s better or worse than similar products, but I like it and would buy it again.  The strap comes in handy for hanging.</li>
