            <li>This is soo amazing!</li>
            <li>Best top coat I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>This top coat is great!</li>
            <li>and we use them at the salon all of the time and most of the time the colors come on pretty matte so this top coat adds the perfect amount of shine for that flawless finished look.</li>
            <li>China Glaze is a great brand, my favorite nail polishes are all China Glaze.</li>
            <li>For my money, this is the best top coat available, period.  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Im sooo glad I bought this!</li>
            <li>Hope it works for you as much as it works for me :D</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS TOP COAT!</li>
            <li>I love this top coat!</li>
            <li>I needed a better top coat nail polish and I bought this on a whim and now I wouldn&#x27;t trade it for anything!</li>
            <li>I know this top coat is amazing because its china glaze.</li>
            <li>Great moment, right?</li>
            <li>I love love love this top coat!  </li>
            <li>I love the colors you can get with china glaze</li>
            <li>its a shame because i love the shine</li>
            <li>It is a really good fast drying top coat, the best one I have tried so far.</li>
            <li>After a week or every 3 days apply another top coat</li>
            <li>Just my China glaze polish and top coat.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I made my purchase.</li>
            <li>I have bought this product many times</li>
            <li>and i love it more and more with every bottle :)</li>
            <li>3-4 strokes seems to be my limit to keep it safe.</li>
            <li>As far as I am concerned, that&#x27;s incredible considering all the layers I put underneath this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>, I always buy a bottle of FF to make sure I never run out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is going to be my go-to top coat from now on.</li>
            <li>I also haven&#x27;t noticed shrinkage, but I always wrap my top coat around the tips of my nails to help avoid chipping.  </li>
            <li>I prefer Nicole top coat</li>
            <li>In my opinion, this brand and NYC colors have the quickest drying top coat.</li>
            <li>I am really enjoying it.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this, and it leave a nice smooth coat on top.</li>
            <li>and it is so much better than I was even expecting.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stop touching and looking at my nails</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure nail polish thinner would fix this, but I don&#x27;t want to risk it.</li>
            <li>thanks to this top coat, it doesn&#x27;t!!</li>
            <li>Pretty good.</li>
            <li>I find it to be the perfect companion for both the China Glaze crackle polishes, and for lower-quality polishes that take forever to dry.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I use acrylic paint for some of my designs and it works fine on them :)</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s as good as new!</li>
            <li>This top coat is great, leaves nails shiny even 10 days or so later, no chipping.  </li>
            <li>Easy to leave dents and also shrinks nail polish&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nail</li>
            <li>It does have a strong chemical smell, but i have gotten used to it</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite top coat!</li>
            <li>For what it&#x27;s worth, I suffer from migraines that can be scent-triggered, and this top coat does not trigger a migraine. . .</li>
            <li>Buy 2 get one free.</li>
            <li>Overall happy with this.</li>
            <li>That moment where you can stop babying it and just enjoy how it looks?</li>
            <li>I love China Glaze Fast Forward Top Coat.</li>
            <li>but i feel like the top coat shrinks both itself and the polish and everything chips away super quickly.</li>
            <li>It does have a rather strong smell to it, but it goes away fairly quickly and is not something that bother me.   </li>
            <li>It dries so quickly, lasts a long time, stays shiny, keeps colors bright, and it smells really good (but maybe that&#x27;s just me, haha).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty excited about this!</li>
            <li>If you can get past the smell than this is a GREAT top coat.</li>
            <li>So I bought 2 colors and this fast forward top coat.</li>
            <li>This top coat came SO fast, I ordered on the 19 of this month and it came today.</li>
            <li>It dries really fast and it protects well :)</li>
            <li>and I can have more than one look in the week without using so much polish remover and spending time doing my nails again.  </li>
            <li>The TRANZITION polish is really cool</li>
            <li>It not only dries quickly the top coat, but any more coats you have underneath.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also super shiny and doesnt chip.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, and whenever I buy more China Glaze colors (also extremely recommended, they are fantastic)</li>
            <li>but now its the only top coat I buy!</li>
            <li>you have to keep the amount of strokes limited or else the top coat will start smearing your design, but unless you like to brush on your top coat with like 10 strokes, you&#x27;re fine haha</li>
            <li>but i honestly cant keep polish on my fingers for longer than two hours with out chips or peels which personally doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>I get a good 5 days of wear out of my manicure if I freshen with this top coat after the 2nd or 3rd day</li>
            <li>I attribute all of my manicure success to this product.</li>
            <li>It dries pretty fast too, and it&#x27;s easy to find with its chic matte bottle</li>
            <li>I have my own long nails and some cheap nail polish chips fast so want to see if this product will prevent chipping.</li>
            <li>My nails are brittle and tend to crack easily, which is not a surprise because I have sensitive, baby-fine hair and skin cells as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Also great for glossing up neon polishes, since they tend to go on dull.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been an obsessive nail biter since the day I first had teeth.  </li>
            <li>only the top-</li>
            <li>First time I bought China glaze polish</li>
            <li>The only con that i have to this top coat is the smell.</li>
            <li>I even like the smell, which is different than most polish.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I put it on over an existing paint job and top coat last night just to test it</li>
            <li>I use a lot of glitter nail polish, however, I don&#x27;t have time to let it dry everytime, This stuff really does seal the top fairly quickly (5-10 minutes).</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my first real experience with China Glaze</li>
            <li>Normal polish peels right off within a day or two.  </li>
            <li>top dry (nail dryer) coat.</li>
            <li>Got this to replace a fast dry top coat I received in a MASH set of mini polishes.  </li>
            <li>I have read that some fast dry top coats will peel if you polish over them</li>
            <li>Shipped extremely fast.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect to like it as much as my Out The Door</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t do my nails as much as i used to</li>
            <li>It dries so fast so that I don&#x27;t have to sit around forever waiting before I can do anything.</li>
            <li>but any top coat or quick dry will yield the same effects.</li>
            <li>I no longer bother to buy any other top</li>
            <li>It dries super fast and shiny, by the time I finish my second hand</li>
            <li>with all polish, you must wait at least a little while between every single coat for best results, and you have to give the top coat a chance to dry enough before handling things and doing some light work (like putting your manicure stuff away!).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve previously had Seche Vite, but I like this one better.</li>
            <li>After a few days China Glaze Fast Forward Top coat shrinks the nail polish color.</li>
            <li>so I needed a top coat that dried fast for clients in a rush.</li>
            <li>The only problem is that as the bottle runs low, it gets a bit thicker, and you&#x27;ll need to apply it more liberally.</li>
            <li>It did dry super fast</li>
            <li>but, when i do decide to do them, i go ALL out with a great but tedious design.</li>
            <li>It works great with the Strong Adhesion Base Coat.</li>
            <li>CG is my new fav polish...</li>
            <li>Very strong, very hard, very shiny...</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m usually done in about 2 hours or more.</li>
            <li>Do Not waste your money!</li>
            <li>It does smell a little strongly as it&#x27;s drying, but differently from most of my other nail polish.  </li>
            <li>Does not dry fast all the way-</li>
            <li>Not only does it dry super fast</li>
            <li>First of all, I got this 2 whole days before the earliest expected delivery date, so that was great!&lt;br</li>
            <li>But the smell fades in an hour or 2, and it&#x27;s really hard, so I love it.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s been a week and there are no signs of peeling to be found as of yet.  </li>
            <li>It chipped off within 2 days, but I always have that problem with nail polish unless I get them professionally</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is the *slightest* amount of shrinkage, but not enough to complain about, and here&#x27;s the thing - you don&#x27;t really notice the shrinkage until 3-4 days out...</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re ready to go for the next time.  </li>
            <li>For the results, I&#x27;m willing to suffer through the smell during application (it does not linger once the polish is dry and you&#x27;ve washed your hands).</li>
            <li>Also, the bottle is big compared to normal sized bottles.</li>
            <li>other top coats, you do notice that FF gets a bit gloppy as you approach the bottle being half used.</li>
            <li>To dry (fast nail dryer)</li>
            <li>It gives a very glossy surface, but I have only used it a couple of times, so I have not gotten enough facts to comment on how well it prevents chipping.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I thought it would better if I used both china glaze for the base and top coat.  </li>
            <li>Although I love the base coat, this is not my favorite.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars, is it causes a little bit of dragging in nail art designs, but if I would&#x27;ve waited a smidge longer to apply and let my nails dry more, it wouldn&#x27;t have been an issue.</li>
            <li>my first one is dry enough to touch.  </li>
            <li>There were a few minor dents and smudges in my nails from the previous top coat and this new one smoothed them out completely.</li>
            <li>I have only my natural nails, I keep them at the &amp;#34;activity&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I love the thin brush, as well.</li>
            <li>A little thinner fixes that right up</li>
            <li>i love it, it drys in little less then a minute and leaves nails with a glossy finish deffinitly recomend it</li>
            <li>It dries much faster than other clear coats and it also lasts long which is a plus.</li>
            <li>Typically, I use 2 coats of NE, then 2-3 coats of color, then one coat of this, CG&#x27;s Fast Forward topcoat.</li>

            <li> /&gt;This is my first real experience with China Glaze</li>
            <li> Normal polish peels right off within a day or two.  </li>
            <li> top dry (nail dryer) coat.</li>
            <li> Got this to replace a fast dry top coat I received in a MASH set of mini polishes.  </li>
            <li> I have read that some fast dry top coats will peel if you polish over them</li>
            <li> Shipped extremely fast.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect to like it as much as my Out The Door</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t do my nails as much as i used to</li>
            <li> It dries so fast so that I don&#x27;t have to sit around forever waiting before I can do anything.</li>
            <li> but any top coat or quick dry will yield the same effects.</li>
            <li> I no longer bother to buy any other top</li>
            <li> It dries super fast and shiny, by the time I finish my second hand</li>
            <li> with all polish, you must wait at least a little while between every single coat for best results, and you have to give the top coat a chance to dry enough before handling things and doing some light work (like putting your manicure stuff away!).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve previously had Seche Vite, but I like this one better.</li>
            <li> After a few days China Glaze Fast Forward Top coat shrinks the nail polish color.</li>
            <li> so I needed a top coat that dried fast for clients in a rush.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that as the bottle runs low, it gets a bit thicker, and you&#x27;ll need to apply it more liberally.</li>
            <li> It did dry super fast</li>
            <li> but, when i do decide to do them, i go ALL out with a great but tedious design.</li>
            <li> It works great with the Strong Adhesion Base Coat.</li>
            <li> CG is my new fav polish...</li>
            <li> Very strong, very hard, very shiny...</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m usually done in about 2 hours or more.</li>
            <li> Do Not waste your money!</li>
            <li> It does smell a little strongly as it&#x27;s drying, but differently from most of my other nail polish.  </li>
            <li> Does not dry fast all the way-</li>
            <li> Not only does it dry super fast</li>
            <li> First of all, I got this 2 whole days before the earliest expected delivery date, so that was great!&lt;br</li>
            <li> But the smell fades in an hour or 2, and it&#x27;s really hard, so I love it.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s been a week and there are no signs of peeling to be found as of yet.  </li>
            <li> It chipped off within 2 days, but I always have that problem with nail polish unless I get them professionally</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is the *slightest* amount of shrinkage, but not enough to complain about, and here&#x27;s the thing - you don&#x27;t really notice the shrinkage until 3-4 days out...</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re ready to go for the next time.  </li>
            <li> For the results, I&#x27;m willing to suffer through the smell during application (it does not linger once the polish is dry and you&#x27;ve washed your hands).</li>
            <li> Also, the bottle is big compared to normal sized bottles.</li>
            <li> other top coats, you do notice that FF gets a bit gloppy as you approach the bottle being half used.</li>
            <li> To dry (fast nail dryer)</li>
            <li> It gives a very glossy surface, but I have only used it a couple of times, so I have not gotten enough facts to comment on how well it prevents chipping.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I thought it would better if I used both china glaze for the base and top coat.  </li>
            <li> Although I love the base coat, this is not my favorite.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars, is it causes a little bit of dragging in nail art designs, but if I would&#x27;ve waited a smidge longer to apply and let my nails dry more, it wouldn&#x27;t have been an issue.</li>
            <li> my first one is dry enough to touch.  </li>
            <li> There were a few minor dents and smudges in my nails from the previous top coat and this new one smoothed them out completely.</li>
            <li> I have only my natural nails, I keep them at the &amp;#34;activity&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I love the thin brush, as well.</li>
            <li> A little thinner fixes that right up</li>
            <li> i love it, it drys in little less then a minute and leaves nails with a glossy finish deffinitly recomend it</li>
            <li> It dries much faster than other clear coats and it also lasts long which is a plus.</li>
            <li> Typically, I use 2 coats of NE, then 2-3 coats of color, then one coat of this, CG&#x27;s Fast Forward topcoat.</li>
            <li> &quot; about an hour later - dry thoroughly enough that I don&#x27;t see sheet marks the next morning.  </li>
            <li> (I am positive that I closed the bottle tightly as I double-checked.)  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to get this one, it&#x27;s worth it to get the China Glaze strong adhesion base coat.  </li>
            <li> This polish dries very hard, and fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> I usually use Seche Vite, this product dries just as fast.</li>
            <li> I did a google search for long lasting polish and China Glaze came up.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, by the time I finish the second hand, the first is dry.</li>
            <li> (don&#x27;t poke at it too much within a half hour as it WILL dent slightly, but it is dry to the touch.)</li>
            <li> It freshens manicures that are a few days old.</li>
            <li> know that moment where you realize your manicure has dried completely</li>
            <li> Will use these for a long, long time</li>
            <li> It does tend to get thick quickly - it is fast drying, after all.  </li>
            <li> it dries to touchable in just a minute and doesn&#x27;t take long to completely dry.</li>
            <li> Both nail dryers have a tiny bit of shrinkage, Seche Vite has less</li>
            <li> I will have chipped polish after only a few hours after i have painted my nails.</li>
            <li> but bottom is wet.  </li>
            <li> It dries quicker and harder; no lines or sheet marks.</li>
            <li> Further, I bought the product 6 months ago and it is all dried out and evaporated.</li>
            <li> As to some of the other comments:  I haven&#x27;t noticed it smelling bad, and I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to odors.  </li>
            <li> I have not had any problems with bubbles or other.</li>
            <li> The other day someone asked if I had gels on my nails</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell too bad, it does dry quickly, and it hardens my nails.</li>
            <li> Having said that, i don&#x27;t like it going to waste by chipping a day later :/</li>
            <li> use mostly China Glaze colors, and I use OPI&#x27;s Nail Envy as my base coat.</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t even use CG colors, just the base and top.  </li>
            <li> Beats Opi and Orly hands down.</li>
            <li> And by a &amp;#34;chance&amp;#34;, I only mean about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> It is a super-shiny base coat that dries very quickly.</li>
            <li> But I also use chima glaze strong adhesion base coat to help nail polish adhere.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t have that trouble with this one.  </li>
            <li> I discovered it after reading a few nail polish blogs that recommended it.</li>
            <li> It is simply not as easy to use at that point, but, 1-2 drops of thinner</li>
            <li> And it lasts - usually so long (5-7 days) that I get tired of the color and take it off to do another.  </li>
            <li> obviously, I give myself a thick, glossy manicure (almost to the point where people accuse me of having fake nails), so I have to have a topcoat that takes care of it.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> And it is SO hard and shiny today.</li>
            <li> I did have problems with peeling, but I think that was due to using a different base coat instead of the CG.</li>
            <li> And seriously people; stop complaining about the smell...</li>
            <li> Leaves a glossy finish, minimizes chipping, and doesn&#x27;t actually smell all that bad.</li>
            <li> Iw ill buy again</li>
            <li> All polish stinks while applying.</li>
            <li> it just smells really bad.  </li>
            <li> I ended up buying this and the base coat.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It does smell VERY bad in the bottle.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> LOVE THIS TOP COAT! It&#x27;s amazing! Best top coat I&#x27;ve ever had. It works great with the Strong Adhesion Base Coat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been an obsessive nail biter since the day I first had teeth.  The only way to stop me from biting is if I wear polish.  Normal polish peels right off within a day or two.  I did a google search for long lasting polish and China Glaze came up.  I ended up buying this and the base coat.  So far it&#x27;s been a week and there are no signs of peeling to be found as of yet.  I&#x27;m pretty excited about this!</li>
            <li> This top coat is great, leaves nails shiny even 10 days or so later, no chipping.  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> It chipped off within 2 days, but I always have that problem with nail polish unless I get them professionally done.&lt;br /&gt;I was HOPING that this would last longer because it&#x27;s the brand that the nail salon uses, but no luck.</li>
            <li> For my money, this is the best top coat available, period.  It turns any polish into a quick-dry polish--I believe it actually dries faster than Sally Hansen Insta-Dri!  I find it to be the perfect companion for both the China Glaze crackle polishes, and for lower-quality polishes that take forever to dry.  Also great for glossing up neon polishes, since they tend to go on dull.  I no longer bother to buy any other top coat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does smell VERY bad in the bottle.  For what it&#x27;s worth, I suffer from migraines that can be scent-triggered, and this top coat does not trigger a migraine. . . it just smells really bad.  For the results, I&#x27;m willing to suffer through the smell during application (it does not linger once the polish is dry and you&#x27;ve washed your hands).</li>
            <li> I love the colors you can get with china glaze and we use them at the salon all of the time and most of the time the colors come on pretty matte so this top coat adds the perfect amount of shine for that flawless finished look. but i feel like the top coat shrinks both itself and the polish and everything chips away super quickly. I will have chipped polish after only a few hours after i have painted my nails. its a shame because i love the shine but i honestly cant keep polish on my fingers for longer than two hours with out chips or peels which personally doesn&#x27;t work for me. Especially when I&#x27;m in the salon and working a lot with my hands and clients see my chipped cracked and peeling paint job.</li>
            <li> im glad i got a top coat, but this smells horrible!!! i cant even describe it and it chips just the same without it dont get it</li>
            <li> I love China Glaze Fast Forward Top Coat. It not only dries quickly the top coat, but any more coats you have underneath. I have not had any problems with bubbles or other. Shipped extremely fast. Iw ill buy again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve previously had Seche Vite, but I like this one better. With CGFF there is no visible shrinkage and the polish dries even faster than with Seche. It gives a very glossy surface, but I have only used it a couple of times, so I have not gotten enough facts to comment on how well it prevents chipping. It does have a rather strong smell to it, but it goes away fairly quickly and is not something that bother me.   It is a really good fast drying top coat, the best one I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> Leaves a glossy finish, minimizes chipping, and doesn&#x27;t actually smell all that bad. It dries pretty fast too, and it&#x27;s easy to find with its chic matte bottle</li>
            <li> i love it, it drys in little less then a minute and leaves nails with a glossy finish deffinitly recomend it</li>
            <li> Does not dry fast all the way- only the top- but bottom is wet.  Easy to leave dents and also shrinks nail polish&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nail polish last for 2 weeks!!! But I also use chima glaze strong adhesion base coat to help nail polish adhere. After a week or every 3 days apply another top coat the keep the polish from chipping and scratches. When I use red colors it does not stain my nails. I do not like the chima glaze top dry (nail dryer) coat. To dry (fast nail dryer) my nails I use Seche Vite . It dries quicker and harder; no lines or sheet marks. Both nail dryers have a tiny bit of shrinkage, Seche Vite has less</li>
            <li> This stuff is simply amazing! Not only does it dry super fast but it smooths out dents, bubbles, etc. on colored polish. First time I bought China glaze polish they had a sale... Buy 2 get one free. So I bought 2 colors and this fast forward top coat. I didn&#x27;t expect to like it as much as my Out The Door but now its the only top coat I buy! It&#x27;s also super shiny and doesnt chip. I also don&#x27;t see the shrinkage others have talked about. It freshens manicures that are a few days old. The other day someone asked if I had gels on my nails but I didn&#x27;t... Just my China glaze polish and top coat. I get a good 5 days of wear out of my manicure if I freshen with this top coat after the 2nd or 3rd day and i get 7-10 days on my pedicures! CG is my new fav polish... Beats Opi and Orly hands down. And seriously people; stop complaining about the smell... All polish stinks while applying.</li>
            <li> This top coat came SO fast, I ordered on the 19 of this month and it came today. I know this top coat is amazing because its china glaze. Also, the bottle is big compared to normal sized bottles. I&#x27;m glad I made my purchase.</li>
            <li> Great product! I usually use Seche Vite, this product dries just as fast. Also, it&#x27;s not a gloppy/thick as Seche Vite and doesn&#x27;t have that &#x27;shrinking effect&#x27; like SV does. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars, is it causes a little bit of dragging in nail art designs, but if I would&#x27;ve waited a smidge longer to apply and let my nails dry more, it wouldn&#x27;t have been an issue.</li>
            <li> I just tried this tip cost and I am very happy with the shine and am looking forward to no chips but we will see. I have my own long nails and some cheap nail polish chips fast so want to see if this product will prevent chipping. Overall happy with this.</li>
            <li> This is a great top coat :D i don&#x27;t do my nails as much as i used to but, when i do decide to do them, i go ALL out with a great but tedious design. i&#x27;m usually done in about 2 hours or more. Having said that, i don&#x27;t like it going to waste by chipping a day later :/ thanks to this top coat, it doesn&#x27;t!! It dries really fast and it protects well :) I have bought this product many times and i love it more and more with every bottle :) Sometimes I use acrylic paint for some of my designs and it works fine on them :) you have to keep the amount of strokes limited or else the top coat will start smearing your design, but unless you like to brush on your top coat with like 10 strokes, you&#x27;re fine haha 3-4 strokes seems to be my limit to keep it safe. The only con that i have to this top coat is the smell. It does have a strong chemical smell, but i have gotten used to it and it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. If you can get past the smell than this is a GREAT top coat. Hope it works for you as much as it works for me :D</li>
            <li> I have only my natural nails, I keep them at the &amp;#34;activity&amp;#34; length, I use glass files only, and I shape them to a square tip. My nails are brittle and tend to crack easily, which is not a surprise because I have sensitive, baby-fine hair and skin cells as well.&lt;br /&gt;I use mostly China Glaze colors, and I use OPI&#x27;s Nail Envy as my base coat. Typically, I use 2 coats of NE, then 2-3 coats of color, then one coat of this, CG&#x27;s Fast Forward topcoat. obviously, I give myself a thick, glossy manicure (almost to the point where people accuse me of having fake nails), so I have to have a topcoat that takes care of it.&lt;br /&gt;As with all polish, you must wait at least a little while between every single coat for best results, and you have to give the top coat a chance to dry enough before handling things and doing some light work (like putting your manicure stuff away!). And by a &amp;#34;chance&amp;#34;, I only mean about 10 minutes. As far as I am concerned, that&#x27;s incredible considering all the layers I put underneath this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;You know that moment where you realize your manicure has dried completely - I&#x27;d say in about a couple of hours? That moment where you can stop babying it and just enjoy how it looks? Great moment, right? Well with FF, it&#x27;s incredible! Very strong, very hard, very shiny... and I don&#x27;t chip for days.&lt;br /&gt;There is the *slightest* amount of shrinkage, but not enough to complain about, and here&#x27;s the thing - you don&#x27;t really notice the shrinkage until 3-4 days out... but by then, I&#x27;m re-doing my manicure anyway. I noticed the shrinkage a lot faster with the SV topcoat.&lt;br /&gt;Like other top coats, you do notice that FF gets a bit gloppy as you approach the bottle being half used. It is simply not as easy to use at that point, but, 1-2 drops of thinner and it&#x27;s as good as new! I love this stuff, and whenever I buy more China Glaze colors (also extremely recommended, they are fantastic), I always buy a bottle of FF to make sure I never run out.</li>
            <li> This top coat is great! it dries to touchable in just a minute and doesn&#x27;t take long to completely dry. I even like the smell, which is different than most polish.</li>
            <li> After a few days China Glaze Fast Forward Top coat shrinks the nail polish color. It creates a cracked looked within a day. Further, I bought the product 6 months ago and it is all dried out and evaporated. (I am positive that I closed the bottle tightly as I double-checked.)  I would definitely not repurchase this product.</li>
            <li> Got this to replace a fast dry top coat I received in a MASH set of mini polishes.  This stuff dries to the touch within minutes of application and is what I call \\&quot;bed ready\\&quot; about an hour later - dry thoroughly enough that I don&#x27;t see sheet marks the next morning.  It does tend to get thick quickly - it is fast drying, after all.  A little thinner fixes that right up and you&#x27;re ready to go for the next time.  I have read that some fast dry top coats will peel if you polish over them but I don&#x27;t have that trouble with this one.  I tend to add to my manicure as the week goes on, which helps it to last and I can have more than one look in the week without using so much polish remover and spending time doing my nails again.  There is a tiny bit of shrinking but wrapping polish over the tips of the nails would probably stop that from happening as well as limit wear and chips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is going to be my go-to top coat from now on.</li>
            <li> I love love love this top coat!  It dries super fast and shiny, by the time I finish my second hand my first one is dry enough to touch.  And it lasts - usually so long (5-7 days) that I get tired of the color and take it off to do another.  As to some of the other comments:  I haven&#x27;t noticed it smelling bad, and I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to odors.  I also haven&#x27;t noticed shrinkage, but I always wrap my top coat around the tips of my nails to help avoid chipping.  I did have problems with peeling, but I think that was due to using a different base coat instead of the CG. If you&#x27;re going to get this one, it&#x27;s worth it to get the China Glaze strong adhesion base coat.  The two together are awesome!  And I don&#x27;t even use CG colors, just the base and top.  Will use these for a long, long time</li>
            <li> I love this top coat! It dries so quickly, lasts a long time, stays shiny, keeps colors bright, and it smells really good (but maybe that&#x27;s just me, haha). I love the thin brush, as well. China Glaze is a great brand, my favorite nail polishes are all China Glaze.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite top coat! I discovered it after reading a few nail polish blogs that recommended it. This is probably my BEST nail polish purchase ever. It is a super-shiny base coat that dries very quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I thought it would better if I used both china glaze for the base and top coat.  Although I love the base coat, this is not my favorite.  My nail polish begins to chip after only a day.  I prefer Nicole top coat (I think its by OPI).</li>
            <li> This is soo amazing! It drys your nail polish in seconds! I was amazed! Im sooo glad I bought this!</li>
            <li> Got this for my mom because she couldn&#x27;t find it locally. She got this product from some party her friend was hosting so i said i would find it for her online.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a nail artist so I needed a top coat that dried fast for clients in a rush. It dries much faster than other clear coats and it also lasts long which is a plus. In my opinion, this brand and NYC colors have the quickest drying top coat. Pretty good.</li>
            <li> This polish dries very hard, and fairly quickly. I am really enjoying it.  It does smell a little strongly as it&#x27;s drying, but differently from most of my other nail polish.  But the smell fades in an hour or 2, and it&#x27;s really hard, so I love it.</li>
            <li> Great! It dries so fast so that I don&#x27;t have to sit around forever waiting before I can do anything. Total time saver!</li>
            <li> I love this product!! I needed a better top coat nail polish and I bought this on a whim and now I wouldn&#x27;t trade it for anything!</li>
            <li> The TRANZITION polish is really cool but any top coat or quick dry will yield the same effects. Do Not waste your money!</li>
            <li> I use a lot of glitter nail polish, however, I don&#x27;t have time to let it dry everytime, This stuff really does seal the top fairly quickly (5-10 minutes). I recommend this, and it leave a nice smooth coat on top.</li>
            <li> First of all, I got this 2 whole days before the earliest expected delivery date, so that was great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on over an existing paint job and top coat last night just to test it and it is so much better than I was even expecting. It did dry super fast (don&#x27;t poke at it too much within a half hour as it WILL dent slightly, but it is dry to the touch.) And it is SO hard and shiny today. There were a few minor dents and smudges in my nails from the previous top coat and this new one smoothed them out completely. I can&#x27;t stop touching and looking at my nails today!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first real experience with China Glaze and I am SO impressed.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell too bad, it does dry quickly, and it hardens my nails. I attribute all of my manicure success to this product. Seriously, by the time I finish the second hand, the first is dry. The only problem is that as the bottle runs low, it gets a bit thicker, and you&#x27;ll need to apply it more liberally. I&#x27;m sure nail polish thinner would fix this, but I don&#x27;t want to risk it.</li>
