            <li>received this product in exchange for sharing my honest opinion of the product.</li>
            <li>Opinion is entirely my own.</li>
            <li>We were given the chance to test and give our honest opinion on this product during a promotion.</li>
            <li>product didn&#x27;t do anything noticeable for my beard, but felt nice on the skin.</li>
            <li>It has a nice woody smell and my boyfriend enjoys it.</li>
            <li>was provided a discount on this product in exchange for testing and providing an honest review.</li>
            <li>It actually cleans, while not the best on grease, it does clean just about everything else wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Good product, reasonable price and works great.</li>
            <li>The ery happy with this shampoo and well worth the price.</li>
            <li>It smells good too and gets my smelly boys clean.  </li>
            <li>However, no matter how cool the name of the product was, if it didn&#x27;t smell good and get the job done they wouldn&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li>My lover had me by him another bottle and will continue to I&#x27;m sure.  </li>
            <li>Enjoyable for both.</li>
            <li>This is my all time favorite soap for him.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>my brother says this is so great his beard is nice and soft</li>
            <li>You could do just as well or better with cheaper products.</li>
            <li>Might be better when combined with beard oil or something.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff because when he comes out of the shower he smells manly and rugged.</li>
            <li>this leaves more room for my stuff.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice but not over powering – kind of like freshly cut firewood.</li>
            <li>He appears very happy with it as he keeps actually using it, which he tends to not do if he doesn’t like something.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to get that in the US, and have gone on a search for a product here</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more</li>
            <li>Love the product</li>
            <li>But I think he&#x27;s more attracted to the name of the product than anything.</li>
            <li>Husband says it&#x27;s good and worth trying.</li>
            <li>which means that sometimes he has to go into attics and on top of roofs...</li>
            <li>and I am glad that I did.</li>
            <li>It was more floral than anything.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s better stuff out there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I was able to get it for him at a promotional price for testing and reviewing purposes.</li>
            <li>Healthy hair is everything.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been using for about a week, and it gets me clean and smells good, has sort of a light vanilla scent.  </li>
            <li>My hair gets very clean using this as well.</li>
            <li>It comes with a pop top easy to squirt out.</li>
            <li>I love the way it leaves his hair and beard smelling, almost a light woodsy fragrance.</li>
            <li>This product reminds me more of the cheap products that I can get at Walmart for $1 than a premium product.</li>
            <li>works great and makes my beard soft</li>
            <li>It was reasonably moisturizing with a good scent that wasn&#x27;t overpowering after my shower.  </li>
            <li>Being honest I bought this as a funny, because of the name.  </li>
            <li>This is a 3 in 1 wash (beard, hair and body) and really lathers nicely.  </li>
            <li>Ladies, if you are looking for a great product for your man, look no further.</li>
            <li>Most definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>I personally love the fragrance because it&#x27;s not overpowering or an &amp;#34; old man&amp;#34; kind of scent.</li>
            <li>Hubby loves the product and the manly packaging, right down to the best on the bottle.</li>
            <li>But to each his own, live and learn.</li>
            <li>It washes clean and leaves no residue.</li>
            <li>it definitely made it softer, and the scent is nice without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li>The scent is not too strong but it is just right.  </li>
            <li>Nothing special at all here.</li>
            <li>cleans great.. but leaves all hair very dry and almost brittle.</li>
            <li>Just one wash to clean his whole body; hair, face, and body without having to switch products in between he sure does approve.</li>
            <li>He wants to keep using it and asked me to make sure I keep him stocked</li>
            <li>My boyfriend finally smells good.</li>
            <li>This made my hair look full, which is what I&#x27;m always looking for in a shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Not bad, says my husband.</li>
            <li>Okay ladies, this Tame the Beast beard, hair and body wash for men smells amazing!</li>
            <li>This products main purpose is to promote healthy hair maintenance.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product, simple ingredients, cleans well, smells great, is clear and doesn&#x27;t dry out the beard.</li>
            <li>He used this for the first time tonight and he agreed it made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>As a typical woman, I love smells that are wonderful and stay with you all day long.</li>
            <li>Smells great but really dried out my beard.</li>
            <li>He really liked the smell and he said it left him feeling clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t reorderd yet, because it is fun to hear the countdown.  </li>
            <li>Several people here liked it, but I get the impression</li>
            <li>That right there is worth buying this!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Tame The Beast is a great product.</li>
            <li>He says that it stays on a washcloth or bath poof without trying to run through it right away.</li>
            <li>and honestly it does nothing wonderful for it and no better benefits than washing your beard with plain soap and water.</li>
            <li>After using this product, he smells amazing all day long even after work!</li>
            <li>Like the scent not too strong and masculine</li>
            <li>to clean like normal body wash</li>
            <li>He says it lathers nicely and he enjoys using it over the multiple &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; smelling products I normally buy.</li>
            <li>My husband is a manily man and comes home gross and stinky!</li>
            <li>He said he enjoyed the smell, and felt like he actually got cleaned.</li>
            <li>I will be reordering, but I am going to make him panic a bit ;)</li>
            <li>and my husband says it  doesn&#x27;t get much simpler!</li>
            <li>My favorite thing about this product is my wife loves the smell of it, which give me extra cuddle time with her.</li>
            <li>12 oz bottle lasts long enough to get a good feel for it.</li>
            <li>While the smell is fine I can see where it wouldn&#x27;t be everyone&#x27;s cup of tea; however it&#x27;s not a lasting smell.</li>
            <li>My skin feels very clean, but not stripped out and dry.</li>
            <li>so he is left with little to no time in the shower so he is enjoying being able to &amp;</li>
            <li>Hard to get it to really lather up and get a good wash.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to a Paul Mitchell / American Crew / Nexxus quality shampoo, though I&#x27;ve also bought many lower end products from the big box shopping store that tends to be a little more gelatinous, white pasty kind of like a wash &amp; conditioner in one.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend for every man in your life!</li>
            <li>Nothing really wowing about this product.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do much else that a store-bought shampoo wasn&#x27;t already doing for me.</li>
            <li>This 3 in 1 beard, hair, and body wash really helps him out.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband, who is very picky.  </li>
            <li>my skin gets clean and not dry.  </li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t like about this beard wash</li>
            <li>This vendor shipped fast.</li>
            <li>Very manly, without being overpowering.</li>
            <li>I like this so much I will order it again.</li>
            <li>My beard actuals feels more rough after washing, however after letting dry and combing it is soft and more manageable.  </li>
            <li>Cry a manly yawp and get ready to fend off all your new admirers.    </li>
            <li>I purchased this mainly for washing my beard</li>
            <li>If your looking for a decent beard and body wash I would look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>The main problem was the bottle, believe it or not.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommendit.  </li>
            <li>The scent is lasting and is fresh.</li>
            <li>After a shower he will tell me how many showers worth of Tame the Beast he has left.  </li>
            <li>The smell is ok but a little less strong than I&#x27;d hoped for.</li>
            <li>I was able to purchase this tame the beast product to review during a promotional period</li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical about this all-in-one cleaner, but it works great, and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>made a definite difference in my beard the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>The scent is not overly mature and does not make him smell like my husband.</li>
            <li>It lathers the hair well, but the body not so much, so he still ends up using his regular body wash.</li>
            <li>You are now covering yourself with denim and flannel all the while letting your beard grow wild.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be moving on right away and keep trying other things.</li>
            <li>Smells like regular sweet smelling shampoo, looks like regular shampoo, shares common ingredients with regular shampoo, so if that&#x27;s what your looking for use this, or just use regular shampoo, or better yet, buy better beard shampoo that doesn&#x27;t leave your beard feeling dry and stiff without oils.</li>
            <li>He says that it conditions his beard really well and also eliminates the dry and itchy skin under it.</li>
            <li>My husband used it the other day for the first time.</li>
            <li>on my hair, i have to use a bit more than my previous shampoo to get the same lather, but that&#x27;s not really an issue.  </li>
            <li>His beard looks much softer and less wild.</li>

            <li> It was more floral than anything.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s better stuff out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I was able to get it for him at a promotional price for testing and reviewing purposes.</li>
            <li> Healthy hair is everything.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using for about a week, and it gets me clean and smells good, has sort of a light vanilla scent.  </li>
            <li> My hair gets very clean using this as well.</li>
            <li> It comes with a pop top easy to squirt out.</li>
            <li> I love the way it leaves his hair and beard smelling, almost a light woodsy fragrance.</li>
            <li> This product reminds me more of the cheap products that I can get at Walmart for $1 than a premium product.</li>
            <li> works great and makes my beard soft</li>
            <li> It was reasonably moisturizing with a good scent that wasn&#x27;t overpowering after my shower.  </li>
            <li> Being honest I bought this as a funny, because of the name.  </li>
            <li> This is a 3 in 1 wash (beard, hair and body) and really lathers nicely.  </li>
            <li> Ladies, if you are looking for a great product for your man, look no further.</li>
            <li> Most definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> I personally love the fragrance because it&#x27;s not overpowering or an &amp;#34; old man&amp;#34; kind of scent.</li>
            <li> Hubby loves the product and the manly packaging, right down to the best on the bottle.</li>
            <li> But to each his own, live and learn.</li>
            <li> It washes clean and leaves no residue.</li>
            <li> it definitely made it softer, and the scent is nice without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li> The scent is not too strong but it is just right.  </li>
            <li> Nothing special at all here.</li>
            <li> cleans great.. but leaves all hair very dry and almost brittle.</li>
            <li> Just one wash to clean his whole body; hair, face, and body without having to switch products in between he sure does approve.</li>
            <li> He wants to keep using it and asked me to make sure I keep him stocked</li>
            <li> My boyfriend finally smells good.</li>
            <li> This made my hair look full, which is what I&#x27;m always looking for in a shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Not bad, says my husband.</li>
            <li> Okay ladies, this Tame the Beast beard, hair and body wash for men smells amazing!</li>
            <li> This products main purpose is to promote healthy hair maintenance.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, simple ingredients, cleans well, smells great, is clear and doesn&#x27;t dry out the beard.</li>
            <li> He used this for the first time tonight and he agreed it made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> As a typical woman, I love smells that are wonderful and stay with you all day long.</li>
            <li> Smells great but really dried out my beard.</li>
            <li> He really liked the smell and he said it left him feeling clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t reorderd yet, because it is fun to hear the countdown.  </li>
            <li> Several people here liked it, but I get the impression</li>
            <li> That right there is worth buying this!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Tame The Beast is a great product.</li>
            <li> He says that it stays on a washcloth or bath poof without trying to run through it right away.</li>
            <li> and honestly it does nothing wonderful for it and no better benefits than washing your beard with plain soap and water.</li>
            <li> After using this product, he smells amazing all day long even after work!</li>
            <li> Like the scent not too strong and masculine</li>
            <li> to clean like normal body wash</li>
            <li> He says it lathers nicely and he enjoys using it over the multiple &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; smelling products I normally buy.</li>
            <li> My husband is a manily man and comes home gross and stinky!</li>
            <li> He said he enjoyed the smell, and felt like he actually got cleaned.</li>
            <li> I will be reordering, but I am going to make him panic a bit ;)</li>
            <li> and my husband says it  doesn&#x27;t get much simpler!</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about this product is my wife loves the smell of it, which give me extra cuddle time with her.</li>
            <li> 12 oz bottle lasts long enough to get a good feel for it.</li>
            <li> While the smell is fine I can see where it wouldn&#x27;t be everyone&#x27;s cup of tea; however it&#x27;s not a lasting smell.</li>
            <li> My skin feels very clean, but not stripped out and dry.</li>
            <li> so he is left with little to no time in the shower so he is enjoying being able to &amp;</li>
            <li> Hard to get it to really lather up and get a good wash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to a Paul Mitchell / American Crew / Nexxus quality shampoo, though I&#x27;ve also bought many lower end products from the big box shopping store that tends to be a little more gelatinous, white pasty kind of like a wash &amp; conditioner in one.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend for every man in your life!</li>
            <li> Nothing really wowing about this product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much else that a store-bought shampoo wasn&#x27;t already doing for me.</li>
            <li> This 3 in 1 beard, hair, and body wash really helps him out.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, who is very picky.  </li>
            <li> my skin gets clean and not dry.  </li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like about this beard wash</li>
            <li> This vendor shipped fast.</li>
            <li> Very manly, without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> I like this so much I will order it again.</li>
            <li> My beard actuals feels more rough after washing, however after letting dry and combing it is soft and more manageable.  </li>
            <li> Cry a manly yawp and get ready to fend off all your new admirers.    </li>
            <li> I purchased this mainly for washing my beard</li>
            <li> If your looking for a decent beard and body wash I would look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> The main problem was the bottle, believe it or not.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommendit.  </li>
            <li> The scent is lasting and is fresh.</li>
            <li> After a shower he will tell me how many showers worth of Tame the Beast he has left.  </li>
            <li> The smell is ok but a little less strong than I&#x27;d hoped for.</li>
            <li> I was able to purchase this tame the beast product to review during a promotional period</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about this all-in-one cleaner, but it works great, and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> made a definite difference in my beard the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> The scent is not overly mature and does not make him smell like my husband.</li>
            <li> It lathers the hair well, but the body not so much, so he still ends up using his regular body wash.</li>
            <li> You are now covering yourself with denim and flannel all the while letting your beard grow wild.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be moving on right away and keep trying other things.</li>
            <li> Smells like regular sweet smelling shampoo, looks like regular shampoo, shares common ingredients with regular shampoo, so if that&#x27;s what your looking for use this, or just use regular shampoo, or better yet, buy better beard shampoo that doesn&#x27;t leave your beard feeling dry and stiff without oils.</li>
            <li> He says that it conditions his beard really well and also eliminates the dry and itchy skin under it.</li>
            <li> My husband used it the other day for the first time.</li>
            <li> on my hair, i have to use a bit more than my previous shampoo to get the same lather, but that&#x27;s not really an issue.  </li>
            <li> His beard looks much softer and less wild.</li>
            <li> If your a sucker for catchy names or wanted to give as a gag gift then this product is right up your alley.</li>
            <li> He uses it on his beard, underarms and down under and its soft.  </li>
            <li> However, when it came to my husband&#x27;s products like old spice, they lasted only a few hours and since he&#x27;s a chef, that just wouldn&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li> Tame the Beast is a must have product for the new you.</li>
            <li> feel pretty stupid now and its just a simple marketing scheme with a cool name.</li>
            <li> Use it on my beard daily - doesn&#x27;t strip it like regular shampoos or other beard washes!</li>
            <li> He has no complaints other than they should have a bigger bottle.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;-it dried my beard out worse than normal Old Spice products and simple shampoo/conditioners&lt;</li>
            <li> I was tired of looking for something he would like and thought the name was a funny pun.  </li>
            <li> Tame the Beast products are free of the nasty stuff which causes him problems, so I felt safe knowing that hubby would be slathering it all over his hair and body.  </li>
            <li> Also left me feeling a little dry.</li>
            <li> He is allergic to everything, so I am careful to check the ingredients list of anything I want to get for him.</li>
            <li> I use a heavy product to keep my Dapper Dan haircut in place, and this does a terrific job of cleaning the product out, but leaving my hair stripped out.</li>
            <li> Received my Tame the Beast today and actually showered twice with it now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;(I use beard oil and this product made my beard so dry the oil stopped having its usual effect</li>
            <li> After a long day at work, the worst thing to come home to is the thought of having to stand in the shower while using multiple products just to get clean.</li>
            <li> Tame</li>
            <li> Wash yourself with Tame the Beast.</li>
            <li> This products claim is that they can tame the beast growing all over your body.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no overwhelming scent.</li>
            <li> Guess I&#x27;ll wait to see if it goes back down, but in the meantime, I&#x27;ll buy another product &amp; hope it works as well. :(</li>
            <li> My husband is a mechanic which means he gets dirty and stinky each and every single day.</li>
            <li> Overall I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> in the end, I don&#x27;t hate it, but I didn&#x27;t like it enough to keep using it.</li>
            <li> Gets expensive</li>
            <li> You wont be disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> That was incredibly annoying.</li>
            <li> annoying!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I used some this morning as a shampoo and body wash. It was reasonably moisturizing with a good scent that wasn&#x27;t overpowering after my shower.  A great all purpose product.</li>
            <li> Works great on my husband beard!</li>
            <li> My lover had me by him another bottle and will continue to I&#x27;m sure.  He uses it on his beard, underarms and down under and its soft.  Enjoyable for both.</li>
            <li> My boys love these products!  I know part of it has to do with the name (brilliant marketing, by the way).  However, no matter how cool the name of the product was, if it didn&#x27;t smell good and get the job done they wouldn&#x27;t use it.  They&#x27;ve boycotted products before that they don&#x27;t like so when they use it and talk about it, I know it&#x27;s a hit.  This is a 3 in 1 wash (beard, hair and body) and really lathers nicely.  It smells good too and gets my smelly boys clean.  The scent is not too strong but it is just right.  I purchased this at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> My husband hates waking up in the morning so he is left with little to no time in the shower so he is enjoying being able to &amp;#34;tame the beast&amp;#34; all at once. Just one wash to clean his whole body; hair, face, and body without having to switch products in between he sure does approve. It has a nice but not overpowering woodsy outdoor scent. He says it lathers nicely and he enjoys using it over the multiple &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; smelling products I normally buy. I purchased this during a promotional pricing period for testing and the views I have expressed are my own.</li>
            <li> Okay ladies, this Tame the Beast beard, hair and body wash for men smells amazing! I purchased this for my husband and when he gets out of the shower after using this stuff I cant help myself, I&#x27;m drawn to him like a moth to a flame! He smells so rugged and manly! This is my all time favorite soap for him. He likes that this product is an all in one, face, body and hair wash, no need for 3 different bottles of product, get in get out, get on with your day. Ladies, if you are looking for a great product for your man, look no further. You wont be disappointed with this product. I purchased this product during a promotion and the views I have expressed are completely my own. I&#x27;m now a customer for life! Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Received my Tame the Beast today and actually showered twice with it now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-seems to clean like normal body wash&lt;br /&gt;-smells good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;-Does not lather well unless you use it on hair first&lt;br /&gt;-it dried my beard out worse than normal Old Spice products and simple shampoo/conditioners&lt;br /&gt;(I use beard oil and this product made my beard so dry the oil stopped having its usual effect&lt;br /&gt;-the scent lasted about an hour after the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just ordered Every Man Jack Cedarwood to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel pretty stupid now and its just a simple marketing scheme with a cool name.</li>
            <li> Nice body wash.  Will reorder.</li>
            <li> Good product, reasonable price and works great. Like the scent not too strong and masculine</li>
            <li> As a typical woman, I love smells that are wonderful and stay with you all day long. However, when it came to my husband&#x27;s products like old spice, they lasted only a few hours and since he&#x27;s a chef, that just wouldn&#x27;t do. After using this product, he smells amazing all day long even after work! I personally love the fragrance because it&#x27;s not overpowering or an &amp;#34; old man&amp;#34; kind of scent. Highly recommend for every man in your life!</li>
            <li> I love it. Smells great, and gets my beard and face feeling gooooood!</li>
            <li> my brother says this is so great his beard is nice and soft</li>
            <li> make me feel good after shampoo</li>
            <li> Nothing really wowing about this product. You could do just as well or better with cheaper products. While the smell is fine I can see where it wouldn&#x27;t be everyone&#x27;s cup of tea; however it&#x27;s not a lasting smell. I purchased this mainly for washing my beard and honestly it does nothing wonderful for it and no better benefits than washing your beard with plain soap and water. If your a sucker for catchy names or wanted to give as a gag gift then this product is right up your alley. If your looking for a decent beard and body wash I would look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much else that a store-bought shampoo wasn&#x27;t already doing for me. Might be better when combined with beard oil or something.</li>
            <li> made a definite difference in my beard the first time I used it. don&#x27;t care for the smell, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to linger after a rinse</li>
            <li> This is perfect for that man in your life, *hint, hint Fathers Day is coming*. It comes with a pop top easy to squirt out. The smell is amazing. It has a nice lather and can be used on head or body (even beards). It washes clean and leaves no residue. The scent is lasting and is fresh. I gave this to my son (teenager)* product received at a disc to facilitate my review* and figured he was the one to test it. 12 oz bottle lasts long enough to get a good feel for it. The scent is not overly mature and does not make him smell like my husband. Definitely a got to try product for teens or adults.</li>
            <li> I got this Hair and Body wash for my husband. He is allergic to everything, so I am careful to check the ingredients list of anything I want to get for him. Tame the Beast products are free of the nasty stuff which causes him problems, so I felt safe knowing that hubby would be slathering it all over his hair and body.  Hubby loves the product and the manly packaging, right down to the best on the bottle. He likes that now he can have his shampoo and body wash all in one bottle. I love this stuff because when he comes out of the shower he smells manly and rugged. I can&#x27;t get enough of the smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for sharing my honest opinion of the product. Opinion is entirely my own.</li>
            <li> Smells great, works great, husband loves it. And, I like that, after he uses it, I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m rubbing my face on a porcupine.</li>
            <li> Nothing special at all here.Kinda funky chemical smell and does nothing off brand shampoo won&#x27;t do.For $10 you can buy 10 times this amount at any store.</li>
            <li> Tame The Beast is a great product. My husband used it the other day for the first time. He really liked the smell and he said it left him feeling clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Tame The Beast you don&#x27;t have to have two to three different bottles in the shower for my husband. My shower is not that big anyway.&lt;br /&gt;Plus this leaves more room for my stuff.I was so happy to receive this product for my unbiased opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a 12 oz. bottle and it smells real good.</li>
            <li> My husband is a mechanic which means he gets dirty and stinky each and every single day. After a long day at work, the worst thing to come home to is the thought of having to stand in the shower while using multiple products just to get clean. This 3 in 1 beard, hair, and body wash really helps him out. The smell is nice but not over powering – kind of like freshly cut firewood. It actually cleans, while not the best on grease, it does clean just about everything else wonderfully. He says that it stays on a washcloth or bath poof without trying to run through it right away. He appears very happy with it as he keeps actually using it, which he tends to not do if he doesn’t like something. We were given the chance to test and give our honest opinion on this product during a promotion.</li>
            <li> Smells great but no suds. Switching back to my alternative. Will not order again.</li>
            <li> My husband is a manily man and comes home gross and stinky! He used this for the first time tonight and he agreed it made a huge difference. He loved that it was great to use for beard, hair, and body wash in one. He said he enjoyed the smell, and felt like he actually got cleaned. HE would recommend this to anyone needing to buy a gift for a man. We received this product in exchange for our unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Works great, love the suds, feels good, LOVE the smell. Get this here shampoo/wash, OK?!</li>
            <li> Smells great seems great!!!</li>
            <li> Definitely does not soften hair at all. Hard to get it to really lather up and get a good wash. Great smell that lasts all day but it does not soften hair, makes it feel like you went swimming in a pool. But to each his own, live and learn. Figured I&#x27;d give it a shot.</li>
            <li> Great smell. Works great for beard and hair. Highly recommend. Fast shipping</li>
            <li> Smells like regular sweet smelling shampoo, looks like regular shampoo, shares common ingredients with regular shampoo, so if that&#x27;s what your looking for use this, or just use regular shampoo, or better yet, buy better beard shampoo that doesn&#x27;t leave your beard feeling dry and stiff without oils.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, who is very picky.  We have been all over with brands and types of soaps.  Being honest I bought this as a funny, because of the name.  I was tired of looking for something he would like and thought the name was a funny pun.  He loves the stuff.  I haven&#x27;t reorderd yet, because it is fun to hear the countdown.  After a shower he will tell me how many showers worth of Tame the Beast he has left.  He has no complaints other than they should have a bigger bottle.  I will be reordering, but I am going to make him panic a bit ;)</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves this product. He was looking for a product that would condition his beard and not have a feminine scent to it. This is definitely it. I love the way it leaves his hair and beard smelling, almost a light woodsy fragrance. He says that it conditions his beard really well and also eliminates the dry and itchy skin under it. There is a noticeable difference in his beard now that he is using this, and it&#x27;s a good difference. His beard looks much softer and less wild. He loves the product and ask which store I picked it up in. He wants to keep using it and asked me to make sure I keep him stocked up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend finally smells good. Thank god.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a week and it does the job well.  I bought this because I have a beard and wanted a &amp;#34;one-stop-product&amp;#34; to wash everything; and this does that with a great manly smell that is not musky but herbally and envigorating.  The ery happy with this shampoo and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Smells good .. Can&#x27;t complain</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Highly recommendit.  Smells great and my husband says it  doesn&#x27;t get much simpler!</li>
            <li> great shampoo/soap!  i&#x27;ve been using for about a week, and it gets me clean and smells good, has sort of a light vanilla scent.  on my hair, i have to use a bit more than my previous shampoo to get the same lather, but that&#x27;s not really an issue.  my skin gets clean and not dry.  i even used as shaving cream a couple of days, which worked.  and i don&#x27;t have to have a bunch of different bottles in my shower, just one that says &amp;#34;TAME THE BEAST&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> Love this product! Use it on my beard daily - doesn&#x27;t strip it like regular shampoos or other beard washes! Have Recommended this to others, and come back to buy a second bottle only to find that the price has doubled (I gave $9.99  for it, its not $18.90). Guess I&#x27;ll wait to see if it goes back down, but in the meantime, I&#x27;ll buy another product &amp; hope it works as well. :(</li>
            <li> This made my hair look full, which is what I&#x27;m always looking for in a shampoo.  My wife likes the way it smells, another plus.  She was complaining about the shampoo I was using before.  Very good product, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Holy snaps! This product is where it&#x27;s at! Been using it for a couple of days and the scent is absolutely amazing. I get out of the shower and have to hide to keep the girls from ringing my doorbell (my wife wouldn&#x27;t approve). I found that the scent is perfect in the morning and lasts all day. Most definitely worth the price. I wish they made an economy sized bottle. I&#x27;d buy 2.</li>
            <li> I started with beard wash over the summer with a wash from Germany called OAK. It&#x27;s a great product, simple ingredients, cleans well, smells great, is clear and doesn&#x27;t dry out the beard. I haven&#x27;t been able to get that in the US, and have gone on a search for a product here that&#x27;s similar enough to please me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one wasn&#x27;t up to the job. Several people here liked it, but I get the impression it&#x27;s more the people who smell it than those who are using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does wash, and while I wasn&#x27;t looking for an &amp;#34;all in one&amp;#34; product, I felt like this one was closest in smell to what I was looking for. The smell is ok but a little less strong than I&#x27;d hoped for. Acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I really didn&#x27;t like about this beard wash was the color and texture of the product. I&#x27;m used to a Paul Mitchell / American Crew / Nexxus quality shampoo, though I&#x27;ve also bought many lower end products from the big box shopping store that tends to be a little more gelatinous, white pasty kind of like a wash &amp; conditioner in one.  This product reminds me more of the cheap products that I can get at Walmart for $1 than a premium product. If I&#x27;m spending extra to find a product that will work for my beard, it already means I&#x27;m not trying to cheapskate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in the end, I don&#x27;t hate it, but I didn&#x27;t like it enough to keep using it. I&#x27;ll be moving on right away and keep trying other things.</li>
            <li> works great and makes my beard soft</li>
            <li> This vendor shipped fast. Love the product</li>
            <li> cleans great.. but leaves all hair very dry and almost brittle.</li>
            <li> Not bad, says my husband. It&#x27;s a one-stop-shop: Hair, beard, face and body. There&#x27;s no overwhelming scent. It lathers the hair well, but the body not so much, so he still ends up using his regular body wash. He says he likes it and it&#x27;s o.k. But I think he&#x27;s more attracted to the name of the product than anything. I purchased this on promo to product test. Husband says it&#x27;s good and worth trying.</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  I use this in my shower, and I also keep a bottle in the guest bathroom - it always generates comments and jokes from guests.  Great stuff.</li>
            <li> In the last year you have let go of all your metro-sexual less-than-manly wardrobe. You are now covering yourself with denim and flannel all the while letting your beard grow wild. You have officially embraced your inner lumberjack. But now you stink. Take a shower. Wash yourself with Tame the Beast. Cry a manly yawp and get ready to fend off all your new admirers.    Tame the Beast is a must have product for the new you.</li>
            <li> My husband installs cable, Internet and TV inside people&#x27;s homes which means that sometimes he has to go into attics and on top of roofs...yuck! When he showers he uses bar soap for his body and my hair products for his hair...annoying! I was able to purchase this tame the beast product to review during a promotional period and I am glad that I did. It&#x27;s an all in one product and it smells really good when he leaves the shower and on his skin! Not to mention he no longer has to use my products intended solely for my use which is a plus!! When I asked him&lt;br /&gt;How he likes the product he said he liked it and that the lather was perfect for him. It&#x27;s a great product for any man in your life!</li>
            <li> Has a good scent. Doesn&#x27;t lather well. As someone who uses dove soap I tried this as a body wash and I had to use quite a bit. Also left me feeling a little dry. As a beard shampoo it was no different then using a dove for men shampoo on my beard</li>
            <li> Overall I was disappointed. The main problem was the bottle, believe it or not. 90% of the letters peeled off in the shower over time. That was incredibly annoying. Second thing was that the fragrance did not smell &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; at all. It was more floral than anything.&lt;br /&gt;The product didn&#x27;t do anything noticeable for my beard, but felt nice on the skin. There&#x27;s better stuff out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this twice now. Wish there was a bigger bottle though. Gets expensive</li>
            <li> Been using for about a week. My beard actuals feels more rough after washing, however after letting dry and combing it is soft and more manageable.  Great product.  Now just need some beard wax.</li>
            <li> I got this all in one wash for my boyfriend. He doesn&#x27;t have a beard, so we cannot tell you anything about that part, but it works great for his hair and body! It has a nice woody smell and my boyfriend enjoys it. It lathers really good and washes off nicely, too. I&#x27;m glad I was able to get it for him at a promotional price for testing and reviewing purposes.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it! I was a little skeptical about this all-in-one cleaner, but it works great, and smells fantastic. Very manly, without being overpowering. My skin feels very clean, but not stripped out and dry. My hair gets very clean using this as well. I use a heavy product to keep my Dapper Dan haircut in place, and this does a terrific job of cleaning the product out, but leaving my hair stripped out. My favorite thing about this product is my wife loves the smell of it, which give me extra cuddle time with her. That right there is worth buying this!&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a discount on this product in exchange for testing and providing an honest review. I like this so much I will order it again. hopefully they add it to Amazon Subscribe and Save!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband&#x27;s unruly beard- it definitely made it softer, and the scent is nice without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Smells great but really dried out my beard.</li>
            <li> Healthy hair is everything. This products main purpose is to promote healthy hair maintenance.  Got frizz or strays? This products claim is that they can tame the beast growing all over your body. The formula is not sticky and goes on like a fluid gel. It also smells rather nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Product sent for purpose of review</li>
