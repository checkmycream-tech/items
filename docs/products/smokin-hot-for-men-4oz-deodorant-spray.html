            <li>I LOVE this scent on my husband.</li>
            <li>Sandalwood notes give it a slightly exotic flair, and my girlfriend looooooves it.</li>
            <li>I own some original colognes like Armani,Calvin Klein etc.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a REALLY STRONG smell</li>

            <li>[[ASIN:B000O1R47M Smokin&#x27; Hot For Men 4oz Deodorant Spray]]  </li>
            <li>Its smokin hot</li>
            <li>I personally think it smells better than the brand name.</li>
            <li>Good fragance- a little sharp at first, but very nice after a short time.    </li>
            <li>It smells clean and masculine.</li>
            <li>Thanks Hummercat69</li>
            <li>Such a great alternative to the real thing!&lt;br /&gt;Smells just like it, and at a small fraction of the price.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>But you can&#x27;t wear those $50-60 colognes everyday unless you are super rich.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that good, if your looking for something by designer impostors, i would go for rule, strike, or game changer or whatever its called.</li>
            <li>Far better smell than Axe,Old spice etc and long lasting too.</li>
            <li>Shipment came quickly and exactly as expected.</li>
            <li>This product was hard to find and at one time most stores had it....</li>
            <li>Being 92 years old, do not have any females knockin at the door.</li>
            <li>Smell not long lasting.</li>

            <li> You just need to spray it on your skin , even on clothes will last long!</li>
            <li> It lasts long just as much as expensive colognes; and the smell is so obvious</li>
            <li> so he could  make his expensive cologne stretch further.</li>
            <li> Wow, I went crazy when I caught whiff of this.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in any stores.</li>

            <li> Such a great alternative to the real thing!&lt;br /&gt;Smells just like it, and at a small fraction of the price.&lt;br /&gt;Will never buy the name brands again.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000O1R47M Smokin&#x27; Hot For Men 4oz Deodorant Spray]]  Its smokin hot and it smells like ArmaniÂ® Code</li>
            <li> Armani? No, but very good scent!!</li>
            <li> This stuff Smells really good! I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of &amp;#34;you smell so good&amp;#34; from a lot of ladies. I would recommend if you want to smell good for cheap. And the ladies think it&#x27;s some sort of expensive cologne you&#x27;re wearing.</li>
            <li> This smells so great! It lasts long just as much as expensive colognes; and the smell is so obvious, I&#x27;ve been told to ladies that I smell so good! You just need to spray it on your skin , even on clothes will last long!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Hubby so he could  make his expensive cologne stretch further. Wow, I went crazy when I caught whiff of this. It smells clean and masculine. To me it was along the lines of Armani Code. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this scent on my husband. I personally think it smells better than the brand name. It is my husband&#x27;s favorite and mine too! Shipment came quickly and exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> Smells incredibly similar to Armani Code - which is why I purchased it! Sandalwood notes give it a slightly exotic flair, and my girlfriend looooooves it. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that good, if your looking for something by designer impostors, i would go for rule, strike, or game changer or whatever its called. those 3 and you will pull biatches for days no joke. don&#x27;t get this one lol</li>
            <li> Being 92 years old, do not have any females knockin at the door. but it sure does smell good and does the job it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> This item is just what it says it is.... Deodorant Spray. It&#x27;s a REALLY STRONG smell so you have been WARNED! It&#x27;s a cheap buy but for cheap quality. Just informing you.</li>
            <li> I own some original colognes like Armani,Calvin Klein etc. But you can&#x27;t wear those $50-60 colognes everyday unless you are super rich. You can&#x27;t compare originals Vs duplicate but this series of deodorants has done a really good job mimicking the originals. Far better smell than Axe,Old spice etc and long lasting too.</li>
            <li> Nice deo,,, cheap price and smells great..... I recommend this product.... received some good comments on this. Pay less and get great smell....</li>
            <li> The bomb!!!does smell like armani code it is good!!!!</li>
