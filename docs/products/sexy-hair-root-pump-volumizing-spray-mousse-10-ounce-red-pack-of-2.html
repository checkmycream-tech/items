            <li>I have really fine hair</li>
            <li>I love this product and got it at a super price.</li>
            <li>Really does give great volume even when using it the night before and going to work the next morning.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>I thought it was a misprint and only expected one (which would have still been a great price)!</li>
            <li>I have naturally thin, curly hair and this stuff works beautifully!</li>
            <li>I use Big Sexy Root Spray all the time.  </li>
            <li>Big Sexy Spray helps my hair style easier.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly what my hairdresser recommend.</li>
            <li>Big Sexy Hair.</li>
            <li>Holding my hair, making hot sexy beach wafes, light, don&#x27;t mess up hair!</li>
            <li>This stuff really works for volume.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than what I have seen in the store</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, priced well</li>
            <li>I have used this big sexy hair root pump mousse for a few years and love it.  </li>
            <li>IF I use the curling iron it really makes my hair look and feel thicker for a days.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, it doesnt leave a crusty feeling and it doesnt make my hair heavy.</li>
            <li>great product, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Luckily I had not thrown my old can away, so I removed the nozzle off the old can and placed it on the new...</li>
            <li>As an older person, this adds lift and volume to my thinning hair.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I can tell a complete difference when I use it vs. when I don&#x27;t use anything!</li>
            <li>I am not very skilled in the hair styling department, but this product is really easy to use.  </li>
            <li>You have to be careful though because some cans Ive gotten have been super sprayers.</li>
            <li>This order seems  like it is old.</li>
            <li>but it lays totally stick straight &amp; flat after washing.</li>
            <li>This product literally made my already thin hair shed even more.  </li>
            <li>I spray this in the roots, add mousse to the rest of my hair and pin it up high to wait for it to dry a bit.</li>
            <li>But when I foam on some Big Sexy Hair and blow dry then &amp;#34;poof&amp;#34; my hair is twice as thick.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy or heavy, and makes my hair big.</li>
            <li> No need to bend over and fluff while drying.</li>
            <li> I just spray in on my wet hair, brush my hair up and away from my scalp while blowdrying, and voila!  </li>
            <li> and it works very well for her very thin hair.</li>
            <li> When I take it down i play with it a little to look less like an 80s movie star</li>
            <li> My hair is thin and this product gives it the extra volume it needs to make it look thick even when I just blow dry it.  </li>
            <li> Does not leave hair heavy.</li>
            <li> When I took the cap off the spray nozzle was missing.  </li>
            <li> That sounds ridiculous.</li>
            <li> This is one hair product that I would hate to do without.</li>

            <li> Great price, great product, fast/reasonable shipping time.</li>
            <li> I use Big Sexy Root Spray all the time.  My hair is thinner and finer as a result of Chemotherapy five years ago and medication that I am currently on.  Big Sexy Spray helps my hair style easier.  Always looking for a good price and this was it.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works for volume. Last a long time too</li>
            <li> Great for fine hair like mine.  No residue either.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mousse spray!</li>
            <li> This product does wonders to boost up your roots and hair. Will be a staple in my beauty regime.</li>
            <li> Nice moose. Holding my hair, making hot sexy beach wafes, light, don&#x27;t mess up hair! I like it! I recommend it to buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d used it for years, but this was best price ever.</li>

            <li> Great product and great price!</li>
            <li> Big Sexy Hair. My hair is baby fine. I have a lot of it but it lays totally stick straight &amp; flat after washing. But when I foam on some Big Sexy Hair and blow dry then &amp;#34;poof&amp;#34; my hair is twice as thick. It has way more body. This is one hair product that I would hate to do without. Also, No animal testing, cruelty free product! Big plus.</li>
            <li> Love the root pump for my hair; gives it additional body and texture and easier styling.  Plus the 2 pack is a steal!!  I thought it was a misprint and only expected one (which would have still been a great price)!</li>
            <li> Daughter loves this product! Good buy, quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Shipment came on time, as promised. I have really fine hair and this is one of my &amp;#34;must-haves&amp;#34; for volume. It&#x27;s not greasy or heavy, and makes my hair big. I use it with the Powder Play and its perfect for my short locks. I&#x27;ve tried lots of volume products and find that Big Sexy is the best!!</li>
            <li> I have used this mousse many times. This order seems  like it is old.It does not foam.It is runny and does not hold my hair.</li>
            <li> This product literally made my already thin hair shed even more.  If you are having a hair challenge do not use.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I am not very skilled in the hair styling department, but this product is really easy to use.  I just spray in on my wet hair, brush my hair up and away from my scalp while blowdrying, and voila!  No helmet head!  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I received this product on time but it does nothing for my hair and because of guidelines I cannot return it. Since I got the 2 pack I gave one can away and it works very well for her very thin hair.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, and this product makes it much more manageable, especially right after I wash it.  It actually has some body with this product.  And, the value for this is great.  Much cheaper than what I have seen in the store</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, priced well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. Great product at a great price. Plenty Cosas provided great service with super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  When I took the cap off the spray nozzle was missing.  Luckily I had not thrown my old can away, so I removed the nozzle off the old can and placed it on the new...it worked.</li>
            <li> I have used this big sexy hair root pump mousse for a few years and love it.  My hair is thin and this product gives it the extra volume it needs to make it look thick even when I just blow dry it.  IF I use the curling iron it really makes my hair look and feel thicker for a days. I love this product and got it at a super price. Thanxs amazon</li>
            <li> 5 Star Seller, 5 Star Product, 5 Star Customer Service! Thank you!</li>
            <li> love this stuff!  great deal!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> I have been using this spray mousse for years.  It gives my hair a lot &amp;#34;body&amp;#34; when I blow dry it. Tried many others and this is the best!</li>
            <li> Great price for a great product</li>
            <li> It works okay, but I won&#x27;t buy again.  Might work better for others though!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several cheaper mousse&#x27;s. This one is really the best for your $$!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought 4 more since trying the 1st. I does tend to gunk up on my flat iron after away but it just washes off with water. I can tell a complete difference when I use it vs. when I don&#x27;t use anything! Really does give great volume even when using it the night before and going to work the next morning. Love it!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product and it was a great price!! My sister in law is a beautician and can&#x27;t get it for this price.. wouldn&#x27;t use anything else</li>
            <li> fast shipping product works great</li>
            <li> Perfect, came just in time too!</li>
            <li> This is a good product for volume. It&#x27;s a lighter texture than most mousses, but works well.</li>
            <li> I have naturally thin, curly hair and this stuff works beautifully! It smells nice, it doesnt leave a crusty feeling and it doesnt make my hair heavy. You have to be careful though because some cans Ive gotten have been super sprayers. That sounds ridiculous. Just be easy with the sprays and you&#x27;ll be golden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I use it: I love it for days that im going curly. My hair is long so the roots tend to get weighed down, especially so with product in them. I spray this in the roots, add mousse to the rest of my hair and pin it up high to wait for it to dry a bit. When I take it down i play with it a little to look less like an 80s movie star but then we are good to go! Lasts all day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If im going straight, i use a little less. I spray it in when its damp, massage it into the roots and then air dry while i do make up. Once i get to blow drying and straightening all the work has been done for me. No need to bend over and fluff while drying.</li>
