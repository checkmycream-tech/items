            <li> The seller emailed me in less than 1 hour after I sent my email offering to ship it over night and offered the phone number for me to contact them directly.</li>
            <li> Interestingly enough, I recently attended a funeral and they had a similar urn, but it only had a small cross</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I previously ordered this urn for my girlfriend who lost her mother years ago and as a present I bought this urn to replace the one she had been using.</li>
            <li> and hopefully it comes from India where that species of Rosewood is not completely logged out as in other places.</li>
            <li> I found one little flaw on the cross.  </li>
            <li> I saw a smaller wood box urn at the funeral home that was 7 times the price of this one and was just a plain wood urn.</li>
            <li> This I love, it was a little difficult to get the lid off, and thought the opening is a bit small.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Urn for less than half what the Funeral home was charging for the same item.</li>
            <li> Not cheap, but not overly extravagant either.</li>
            <li> Very plain compared to this urn.  </li>
            <li> If you buy this, I highly doubt you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I could not find anything wrong with it!.  </li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>

            <li> I bought this Urn for my Dad. The quality is better than the funeral homes $300-$500 urns. Bigger than I thought. Perfect!!!</li>
            <li> Simple, yet beautiful. My sisters and I loved this for our Father.</li>
            <li> It is a beautiful resting place for my mom. Thank you</li>
            <li> Beautiful wood, and hopefully it comes from India where that species of Rosewood is not completely logged out as in other places. The box is glued together with the bottom fixed by six brass Phillips head screws. The wood polished wonderfully with Old English liquid, and I added a Stanley brass name plate holder. It looks really great. Sad to say, Mother-in-law&#x27;s ashes have been kept in crematory box for years - not any more.</li>
            <li> The family was very pleased with the look, feel and quality of the urn.</li>
            <li> Amazing and beautiful. Great urn and looks like it costs hundreds of dollars that the funeral people charge. So glad I bought this beautiful piece</li>

            <li> This is an absolutely beautiful urn. I actually bought this for my Rottweiler who I had cremated after a long, happy life together. I wanted to buy him a nice urn to keep his ashes in, but didn&#x27;t see any reason to spend a considerably large sum of money on an urn. I thought of this as a good in-between. Not cheap, but not overly extravagant either. I was amazed when I opened the box. Not only does this urn look fantastically beautiful, but it is solidly built, and has a good weight to it. The wood, the carved cross, it looks great. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to put a human loved one&#x27;s ashes in here. If you buy this, I highly doubt you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>

            <li> Nice wood urn at a great price. The funeral home would charged about ten times this amount. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Beautiful natural rosewood with hand carved trim and cross.  The size of the cross is very impressive.  Interestingly enough, I recently attended a funeral and they had a similar urn, but it only had a small cross In the upper left hand corner and no other carvings.  Very plain compared to this urn.  Urn&#x27;s don&#x27;t need to be impressive, but along side a similar one, this urn was very impressive..</li>

            <li> This I love, it was a little difficult to get the lid off, and thought the opening is a bit small.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews an being from the Northwest an love wood we wanted something special and we were and are not at all disappointed. It came well packaged, no scratches or any damage. The bottom comes off very easy with 4 scr. the carving or the leaves around the top is perfect an the cross was also well done. does fir a good sized adult. our son was 6&#x27;1&amp;#34; an cremated 12 lbs. he would of fit all the way but I chose to save some out for the brother an sisters to have to scatter .

            <li> It was way better than I imagined.</li>
            <li> Nicely made and very attractive.</li>
            <li> Bought this urn for my fiance to place her father&#x27;s ashes in. Beautiful looking box and for the price cannot be beat. Would Def buy again</li>
            <li> This urn was exactly what my sister was looking for after her husband passed away. Thank you so much for this product and the price was just right.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I previously ordered this urn for my girlfriend who lost her mother years ago and as a present I bought this urn to replace the one she had been using. When I received it I was pleasently surprised by how large it was. I saw a smaller wood box urn at the funeral home that was 7 times the price of this one and was just a plain wood urn. Now, my grandmother passed away 2 days ago and I knew immediatley that I wanted to order this urn for her. I was so scared I would not get it in time seeing how the memorial is in 1 week. I sent an email to the seller stating I couldnt order it if they didnt think I would have it by then. The seller emailed me in less than 1 hour after I sent my email offering to ship it over night and offered the phone number for me to contact them directly. Then, shipped the urn RIGHT AFTER THAT. I was amazed at the fast and GREAT service I received from then. If you are looking for a beautiful and timeless urn that will fit perfectly in your home decor I would recommend this product and this company to anyone!!!! At a time where everything is so hectic this company really made my day.</li>
            <li> I was just at a funeral home and the cheapest urn was $250.  This urn is beautiful and made well--however, one must remember it is a second.  I found one little flaw on the cross.  It had one chisel imperfection on the edge.&lt;br /&gt;So glad for the purchase.</li>
            <li> It was excellent for my first um absolutely a God sent!!  Very well-made for the money thank you very much</li>
            <li> I purchased this Urn for less than half what the Funeral home was charging for the same item. It came on time and the  finish and look exceeded my expectations. Best of all it was perfect to ship my brothers ashes to our home across the country without any problems. It fits a normal persons ashes (5&#x27;8&amp;#34;, 180 lbs.) in the original plastic bag enclosure with no problem.</li>
            <li> We just received the Rosewood urn and we are so pleased with it. Our daughter died 3 weeks ago and we were searching for the right urn. This one is it. It&#x27;s pretty and simple without being overly ornate. It gives off a sense of peace when we look at it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely beautiful!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for may Father.  It is an adult urn and very beautiful!. It is better than I expected, and it shipped quickly.  Simular wood urns at the funeral home and crematorium run about $200-300.00 without any design.  I give it 5 stars, for 2 reasons,  The first is .  Its good to know that the Urn Co.  is not trying to take advantage of those who are mourning their loss by charging an astromical price. The second reason is this - the quality is excellent!!! .  I could not find anything wrong with it!.  The money you save can be used for other funeral costs, and you get a high quality urn.  Thank You Amazon and the Urn Co.  and God bless!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very beautiful, it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> I bought this, for a friend, who&#x27;s mother was cremated. It was a gift in her honor. My friend was very impressed, and loved it. The quality you get is fantastic, just wonderful.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my older sister that passed in 2013. It took me a long time to decided on an urn and the reviews really helped. It is very well made. Shipping was fast. I am overwhelmingly satisfied with the product and would recommend to anyone looking for a quality product.</li>
            <li> Love it I bought it for my final resting place it is made well</li>
