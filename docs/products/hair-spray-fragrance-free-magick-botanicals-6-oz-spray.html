    <ol>
            <li>It has no smell and works great!</li>
            <li>It is perfect.</li>
            <li>Excellent hair spray.</li>
            <li>But this hair spray is great.</li>
            <li>Great stuff</li>
            <li>The product itself works great.</li>
            <li>Magic Botanicals hair spray, shampoo and conditioner are perfect.</li>
            <li>Not so  good for&lt;br /&gt;those</li>
            <li>Good if you can&#x27;t wear scents.</li>
            <li>when&lt;br /&gt;you spray it on, but dries fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;The 6oz size that it comes in can be taken along with you if needed.</li>
            <li>I love that there&#x27;s no smell!</li>
            <li>This is a very good product with no artificial fragrance.</li>
            <li>So happy to find a hair-spray that is fragrance free.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t spray like hair spray, it just kind of spritzes and the spray just drips when you spray.  </li>
            <li>Good product but needs a better spray nozzle.</li>
            <li>and it also holds your hair in place nicely.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used ABBA&#x27;s scent free (used to be zeroscent) and loved it.</li>
            <li>This spray has a firm hold, has the best spray mist I&#x27;ve ever experienced and it&#x27;s vegan.</li>
            <li>I am allergic to the chemical peg-12 Dimethicone which is in most hair spray.  </li>
            <li>I had to wash it out to be able to comb through my hair.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist gave me a list of safe products and this was on it.</li>
            <li>so I have to transfer to another bottle with a better mist sprayer.</li>
            <li>I love this hairspray.  </li>
            <li>I contacted this company to see if they adjusted shipping if I purchased 4 or more bottles since it doesn&#x27;t cost $17.20 to ship 4 bottles.</li>
            <li>I could review this product because it would be a much better deal if they adjusted the shipping.</li>
            <li>I looked for some kind of spray that had no junk ingredients and was fragrant free.</li>
            <li>I love this hairspray.</li>
            <li>I  am sure you will be pleased also.</li>
            <li>Very clean and does the job.</li>
            <li>Shipment arrived very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Anyone with breathing problems that are afected by strong odors should use this for thier hair spray.</li>
            <li>but I needed something that would hold my fine hair in place.</li>
            <li>It is truly fragrance free and holds just fine.</li>
            <li>I still supplement with my cheap brand sometimes when I have to pile it on.</li>
            <li>It also is fragrance free if you need that.  </li>
            <li>I hope this product continues to be available.  </li>
            <li>Product does what it&#x27;s supposed to and is fragrance free if that is what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li>No annoying after smell</li>
            <li>bottles of Magick Botanicals Fragrance Free hair</li>
            <li>I have allergies and searched online for a fragrance free hairspray</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to perfumes, fragrances of any kind, chemical odors and must use a product that is a pump not an aerosol.  </li>
            <li>Got this product because wanted fragrance free product.&lt;br /&gt;Has a strong odor when first spray it on.  </li>
            <li>Works good just like most other hair sprays but has no oder and doesnt cut off my breathing.</li>
            <li>Good if you can&#x27;t find any cheaper in a local store.</li>
            <li>and I am very well pleased with this hairspray.  </li>
            <li>It was far better than the $16</li>
            <li>This is the ONLY hair product my Mother has been able to use after becoming very intolerant of fragrances.  </li>
            <li>However, it is easy to pop off, clean, and put back on.</li>
            <li>It has medium hold, which is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Well, it did hold my hair in place but it has such a strong chemical scent that I have to leave the room after I spray it.</li>
            <li>I will certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li>It is the nature of the spray to have a little leftovers turn gooey on the spray head, so it is not an issue with me as it is easy to clean off.</li>
            <li>I really like this hairspray.  </li>
            <li>This spray holds my style very well.  </li>
            <li>it sometimes has a very light odor but works extremely well and helps my moms hair stay styled a whole week</li>
            <li>It does have a mild scent when first sprayed that quickly disappears--much less than many other &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34; products.  </li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t make  me itchy like most other products.</li>
            <li>A little pricey, but overall good product.</li>
            <li>Highly recomed this hair spray.</li>
            <li>The spray nozzle does not have a nice even spray to it, it comes out in a hard line spray.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to fragrances but need to use a hairspray.  </li>
            <li>, I am satisfied that the spray holds well unless there is a lot of wind.&lt;br /&gt;It sprays quite wet, so you have to be careful what you&#x27;re wearing</li>
            <li>Have to hold it far away for even coverage.</li>
            <li>I bought this hair spray because I am so sensitive to chemicals</li>
            <li>The hold is not very good either for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this hair spray to anyone with sensitive skin/allergies.</li>
            <li>I mixed some regular rubbing alcohol with it and it helped a little with that and sprayed a little better.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve had no allergic reactions and it helps to give my long hair styled.</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be that it might be a bit too firm, in that the overspray really sticks to my sink!</li>
            <li> Made some areas harder and stiffer than others.</li>
            <li> I suffered from severe itching with other hair sprays, but this one doesn&#x27;t cause me any problem at all.  </li>

            <li> This one holds well without being stiff and has absolutely no odor.  </li>
            <li> but it might be a little drying to the hair.</li>
            <li> After using a few 6oz.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am allergic to the chemical peg-12 Dimethicone which is in most hair spray.  I found that I can use this and not have any type of allergic reaction.  It holds my hair in place.  I suffered from severe itching with other hair sprays, but this one doesn&#x27;t cause me any problem at all.  My only complaint is that the shipping is expensive.</li>
            <li> Dries hair out.  It is unscented, but one can purchase unscented hairspray at a local pharmacy that is not so drying.</li>
            <li> I gave this hair spray away because it didn&#x27;t provide a flexible hold.  I had to wash it out to be able to comb through my hair.</li>
            <li> I received the hair spray in a timely manner.  However, the spray pump doesn&#x27;t work.  It doesn&#x27;t spray like hair spray, it just kind of spritzes and the spray just drips when you spray.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, and wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist gave me a list of safe products and this was on it. It was the only company on the list that did not test on animals.  I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year now and will always use it. I&#x27;ve had no allergic reactions and it helps to give my long hair styled.</li>
            <li> I think this doesn&#x27;t offend others in public as much as regular hairspray does.  I&#x27;m so relieved to have bought this!  It works well, too.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY hair product my Mother has been able to use after becoming very intolerant of fragrances.  She has tried everything, but the Magick Botanicals is the only thing that does not cause her to itch or break out.</li>
            <li> Distribution of product was spotty.  Have to hold it far away for even coverage. Made some areas harder and stiffer than others.</li>
            <li> Got this product because wanted fragrance free product.&lt;br /&gt;Has a strong odor when first spray it on.  Not so  good for&lt;br /&gt;those with allergies.</li>
            <li> Good product but needs a better spray nozzle. It sprays then dries in big dots so I have to transfer to another bottle with a better mist sprayer.</li>
            <li> This spray has a firm hold, has the best spray mist I&#x27;ve ever experienced and it&#x27;s vegan. I love that there&#x27;s no smell! I still supplement with my cheap brand sometimes when I have to pile it on. I might be imagining it but it might be a little drying to the hair.</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray.  It has no smell and works great! I would recommend this product for people with sensitivities.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used ABBA&#x27;s scent free (used to be zeroscent) and loved it.

            <li> I tried using this product but the nozzle doesn&#x27;t work properly. I&#x27;m trying out a different brand instead.  Too bad.</li>
            <li> I am severely chemically sensitive and can&#x27;t tolerate regular hair sprays without getting sick. I bought this for my mother and can now tolerate being around her after she&#x27;s gotten her hair done  it sometimes has a very light odor but works extremely well and helps my moms hair stay styled a whole week</li>
            <li> This is a very firm hold, which I really appreciate.  It also is fragrance free if you need that.  It does have a mild scent when first sprayed that quickly disappears--much less than many other &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34; products.  My only complaint would be that it might be a bit too firm, in that the overspray really sticks to my sink!</li>
            <li> So happy to find a hair-spray that is fragrance free. My husband has Multiple Chemical Sensitivity, which limits what products I can use.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair spray because I am so sensitive to chemicals but I needed something that would hold my fine hair in place. Well, it did hold my hair in place but it has such a strong chemical scent that I have to leave the room after I spray it. Also it doesn&#x27;t spray out it spritz&#x27;s out . I mixed some regular rubbing alcohol with it and it helped a little with that and sprayed a little better. Plan to continue my search for a spray that is UNSCENTED.</li>
            <li> Good if you can&#x27;t wear scents.</li>
            <li> It holds well and doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I really like this hairspray.  This is the second time purchasing it.  It was far better than the $16 can I bought from the hair salon.    Shipment arrived very quickly.  I will order from this seller again.</li>
            <li> The spray nozzle does not have a nice even spray to it, it comes out in a hard line spray. The hold is not very good either for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> I seem to be allergic to almost every type of hair product these days.  I finally found a hair spray that does not seem to upset my allergies.  It has medium hold, which is exactly what I was looking for.  I hope this product continues to be available.  I would definitely recommend this hair spray to anyone with sensitive skin/allergies.</li>
            <li> I cant breathe around regular hair spray. It totally cuts off my air supply. But this hair spray is great. Works good just like most other hair sprays but has no oder and doesnt cut off my breathing. Anyone with breathing problems that are afected by strong odors should use this for thier hair spray. Highly recomed this hair spray.</li>
            <li> I am chemically sensitive and can&#x27;t have any odors that make me sick. I was using Jhirmack, but they don&#x27;t sell it anymore.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product with no artificial fragrance. Very clean and does the job. Been using it for years and get it on Amazon because I can&#x27;t often locate it in the stores.</li>
            <li> This is the only hairspray I use. It is truly fragrance free and holds just fine. A little pricey, but overall good product.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to fragrances but need to use a hairspray.  This one holds well without being stiff and has absolutely no odor.  I will certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li> Product as stated. Good if you can&#x27;t find any cheaper in a local store. Product does what it&#x27;s supposed to and is fragrance free if that is what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> Great stuff and it doesn&#x27;t make  me itchy like most other products.</li>
            <li> Magic Botanicals hair spray, shampoo and conditioner are perfect. No annoying after smell and they work as well as any similar products that I hav eever used.</li>
            <li> After using a few 6oz. bottles of Magick Botanicals Fragrance Free hair&lt;br /&gt;spray, I am satisfied that the spray holds well unless there is a lot of wind.&lt;br /&gt;It sprays quite wet, so you have to be careful what you&#x27;re wearing when&lt;br /&gt;you spray it on, but dries fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;The 6oz size that it comes in can be taken along with you if needed.</li>
            <li> I have frizzy hair after I wash it. I looked for some kind of spray that had no junk ingredients and was fragrant free. This seemed to fill the bill. It is perfect. Takes the frizz out and does not have any irritating smells.I have already run out of one bottle and bought another one. My only complaint would be that the nozzle gets clogged after a while and sticks when you push down the plunger. However, it is easy to pop off, clean, and put back on. It is the nature of the spray to have a little leftovers turn gooey on the spray head, so it is not an issue with me as it is easy to clean off. The product itself works great.</li>
            <li> Excellent hair spray. I love this hairspray. It doen&#x27;t have any fragrance and it has a firm hold on my hair. I purchase this all the time</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to perfumes, fragrances of any kind, chemical odors and must use a product that is a pump not an aerosol.  I have asthma.</li>
            <li> This is the only hairspray I use.  I have allergies and searched online for a fragrance free hairspray and I am very well pleased with this hairspray.  No smell and it also holds your hair in place nicely.  If you have allergy and sinus problems and are bothered with smells from products give this hairspray a try.
