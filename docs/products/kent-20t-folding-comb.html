            <li>I use this primarily for my beard, but it&#x27;s a great hair comb as well.  </li>
            <li>It runs smoothly through my hair and feels great against my scalp.</li>
            <li>The 188mm kent is amazing, but this one just doesn&#x27;t make the quality cut.</li>
            <li>Great portable, comfortable comb to keep in your pocket.</li>
            <li>Amazing comb.  </li>
            <li>A amazing product&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Really nice</li>
            <li>My boyfriend really liked this comb</li>
            <li>While it was kind of overpriced, I will never allow myself to lose it as a result of my monetary sacrifice.     </li>
            <li>I find this handy to keep on the inside of a jacket pocket for intermediate dapper touch-ups.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect and it got it here so fast, just in time for my husbands birthday.</li>
            <li>although i dont blame the comb, it was my own fault.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a nice and slim design.</li>
            <li>This is a nice comb.</li>
            <li>Nice comb doesn&#x27;t hurt while combing.</li>
            <li>Nice design.</li>

            <li>This is a really nice quality.</li>

            <li>and it&#x27;s held up nicely.</li>
            <li>Fits in my pocket so nicely.</li>
            <li>It is handy</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very sturdy, perfectly sized pocket comb.</li>
            <li>Like others have said, the rivet does kind of loosen up over time, not to the point where the comb itself is unusable though.</li>
            <li>my beard is loving this</li>
            <li>and I wanted to get him something nice he could take with him out and about.</li>
            <li>Especially useful after the gym</li>
            <li>Great price for cool comb.</li>
            <li>hand)made, which I am very appreciative for, and just the right size!  </li>
            <li>It opens very easily.</li>
            <li>Great pocket comb, nice and sturdy and just the right size.</li>
            <li>Great craftsmanship and great price and great for everyday carry.</li>
            <li>Stylish and convenient which fits nicely in any button up chest pocket.  </li>
            <li>And at the end of the day, this is the best pocket comb on the market circa early 2015.</li>
            <li>easy to carry for mustache and beard grooming!........</li>
            <li>We strongly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>The comb is very smooth and does not scratch my face at all.  </li>
            <li>The clip will eventually fall off, I&#x27;m sure, but it&#x27;s not flimsy.</li>
            <li>I keep mine in my top work shirt pocket.</li>
            <li>It makes you more manly in a way a chainsaw never can.</li>
            <li>I love the pocket clip and the fact that it folds like a pocketknife.</li>
            <li>Its okay.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Using this for my beard, as per advice from many forums, boards, and fellow bearded champs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Length: 3 1/4&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>- 8.2cm&lt;br /&gt;Folded Length: 3 5/8&amp;#34; - 9.2cm</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an ok comb.  </li>
            <li>Works great, very compact.</li>
            <li>Amazon had a better price and shipping time.</li>
            <li>when folded - more sanitar I suppose.  </li>
            <li>I may have to get more of these as gifts.</li>
            <li>if you are going to stay stylish at all times :)</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this mini comb.</li>
            <li>Well made comb, that also looks stylish.</li>
            <li>Love this comb.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>so the picture makes it look better than it is.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>and I love that it folds.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It just works better.</li>
            <li>ABSOLUTELY LOVE HOW IT CAN FOLD</li>
            <li>Thank you :) XOXO</li>
            <li>I have found that my back pocket is the best place for this comb.</li>
            <li>I love the size of the Kent 20T Folding Comb and carry one all the time unless I&#x27;m wearing a shirt without a breast pocket.  </li>
            <li>I love this comb for my beard.</li>
            <li>Sure it wont get knocked off and lost, but it takes some effort to get it to come off</li>
            <li>Still have it, use it daily and is still perfect.</li>
            <li>Person receiving the gift was pleased.</li>
            <li>and there it does provide a bit of static.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Additionally, I would like to see a more premium version of this comb.</li>
            <li>With a better clip and made of stronger materials.</li>
            <li>Just a good simple comb for a great price.</li>
            <li>Good comb and worth the price.</li>
            <li>I use this comb multiple times a day and is the perfect size to keep in your pocket for work/travel.</li>
            <li>am in love with the design and the material it was made with&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>In fact, it might be a better idea to eschew using the pocket clip altogether.  </li>
            <li>They are smooth, do not scratch your scap, and feel nice.  </li>
            <li>and I needed a portable hand made comb to be able to groom my mane on the go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most def.</li>
            <li>The person responsible for this comb being made available for sale should receive an immediate promotion!!!</li>
            <li>A cool folding comb and the comb part is nice.</li>
            <li>Loved it so much I ended up buying a spare!</li>
            <li>It really helps his beard look nice!</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m happy with this purchase and the clip is a nice feature on an even nicer comb.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very cool looking.</li>
            <li>The comb itself has been great so far.</li>
            <li>smooth and stylish</li>
            <li>Very convenient, good construction.</li>
            <li>I loved the 12T so much I had to get it&#x27;s baby brother for my pocket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My husband used it as a beard and mustache comb and he loved it and really misses it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a sweet comb!</li>
            <li>Words faded and clamp moves other than that great pocket comb!</li>
            <li>It was an easy fix, though.</li>
            <li>Also the clip is already rotating too easily.</li>
            <li>The one thing I don&#x27;t like is that the clip easily rotates.</li>
            <li>It easily fits in my pocket and is well made.</li>
            <li>Kent combs are amazing this my second one loved my kent combs OT</li>
            <li>so I can easily carry it when travelling.  </li>
            <li>, that causes it to glide out of your pocket almost as easily as the teeth glide through your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This gets rid of tangles, and folds away for easy storage in my pocket.</li>
            <li>Beard strong. -kb</li>
            <li>Strong and well made comb.</li>
            <li>still use the 20T, and like it very much, but I&#x27;d LOVE it if the darn clip design was better engineered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>well on fine and wavy hair!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Way better feel than those cheap Ace combs (which are also not bad).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used a comb that felt so smooth on my scalp and combed my hair so easily.  </li>
            <li>but it has freed up just fine now.</li>
            <li>It fits in my pants just fine.</li>
            <li>I like how fine the teeth are.</li>
            <li>This comb combs my hair perfectly wet or dry, and feels great while doing it (to be honest the great feeling of this comb doing it&#x27;s job</li>
            <li>Wonderful little pocket comb.</li>
            <li>What a fantastic comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This comb is fantastic.</li>
            <li>and I do enjoy the pocket clip.</li>
            <li>I know thats not too important.</li>
            <li>That makes it feel cheap.</li>
            <li>Also, I like that it combs really smooth.</li>
            <li>They are smooth on the scalp as well.</li>
            <li>Smooth teeth.  </li>
            <li>Suprisingly light, but sturdy,</li>
            <li>- my wife wants one of her own now.  </li>
            <li>Works great but the only downfall is from a distance it looks like a knife.</li>
            <li>Light strokes reduce any entanglement.</li>
            <li>Not only will this pen make you look like a boss when you whip it out of your pocket, but it also makes a great beard comb in a pinch.</li>
            <li>I had a bag of cheap combs I got for a couple of dollars, and I figured that would work just as well as this one.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I recently bought this comb and it was working great.</li>
            <li>The cheap metal clip broke about a week into using it.</li>
            <li>This pocket comb was cheap.</li>
            <li>Important things to note about this comb:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had been using a cheap comb until I got this and let me tell you that the quality of this comb has made a huge difference in the ease of combing my hair.</li>
            <li>It has a nice, classy look to it as well instead of cheap plastic like most combs..</li>
            <li>Great comb, use it on my beard almost daily.</li>
            <li>Great comb but thought would be bigger.</li>
            <li>This comb fits nicely in a breasts pocket and is also made very well.</li>
            <li>If price is no object, get these instead of the cheap stuff you find everywhere.</li>
            <li>Very well made comb -way better than most folding/switchblade combs I have checked out.</li>
            <li>Awesome comb except gold letters rub off fast only after couple uses.</li>
            <li>Other wise a nice product</li>
            <li>This guy only leaves my pocket when I am changing pants... very handy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super handsome, and definitely well built, so I&#x27;m pretty happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>Packaging and comb are original</li>
            <li>The clip is sturdy and pocket friendly.</li>
            <li>Best thing I like is the fact that it folds up small and clips so you can pocket carry.  </li>
            <li>Awesome comb, American made by hand, works great for my thick beard.</li>
            <li>Great little comb, more of an accessory than grooming product when it comes to styling non-facial hair.</li>
            <li>Great comb, well made and very durable, lasted 2 years so far.</li>
            <li>Over the years, I can&#x27;t tell you how many \\&quot;unbreakable\\&quot; combs I&#x27;ve broken by carrying them in my pants pocket, so a folding comb seemed the perfect solution.</li>
            <li>Great comb, you really do start to realize how soft it feels on your head.</li>
            <li>folds up small, fits nicely in pocket and has fine teeth for a good untangling of curly beard</li>
            <li>It also fits perfectly in the little pocket inside your right jeans pocket so it&#x27;s been with me all the time since I bought it.</li>
            <li>Overall a good purchase and very useful.</li>
            <li>and he says it is very smooth and gentle on his face now</li>
            <li>Get this comb to ensure your hair is always looking right!</li>
            <li>he wants the beard oil and other combs and brushes but overall very good quality and great product</li>
            <li>I am super excited to give it to him in Christmas.</li>
            <li>It is very high quality and doesnt budge even with his huge beard!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t grow a true beard and therefore cannot attest to it&#x27;s beard combing capabilities)?</li>
            <li>It has a clip, how cool is that?</li>
            <li>This foldable hair comb is true heirloom.&lt;br /&gt;Works</li>
            <li>The fact that it folds is convenient and really cool.</li>
            <li>What it IS, is an elegant yet modern tool for slappin those whiskers into formation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Everyday carry for me and while the Kent lettering has worn off the comb is still going strong, looks great too.</li>
            <li>Some super glue should fix it though.</li>
            <li>came quick</li>
            <li>It is great construction only problem is it is very compact when you fold it up</li>
            <li>i use it all the time when i need a quick hair fix</li>
            <li>I thought I would use this as a primary comb when I travel or am on vacation, but I think this is good enough really for just touch ups.</li>
            <li>Makes a simple product look very elegant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d live with one taking up a bit more pocket space in exchange for not feeling like I was using a beard &amp; mustache comb on my hair.</li>
            <li>Exactly what we were looking for...excellent quality, durable!</li>
            <li>As expected, good quality, and shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>I dont prefer using it much because its to fine .</li>
            <li>Great little pocket comb.</li>
            <li>Is very well-made it will fit in your pocket.</li>
            <li>recently purchased this comb because it is winter, and in winter I let my hair grow out because it is warm.</li>
            <li>The comb is ok as far as a comb goes.</li>
            <li>Really nice for when I need to get protruding hairs of my beard back into the fold / mustache.</li>
            <li>Worth the price just for that alone.  </li>
            <li>the comb has a nice compact size, but I found the length of the comb&#x27;s teeth to be too short for combing my beard.</li>
            <li>I glued it back into place, but now it&#x27;s not as nice looking.</li>
            <li>The actual horizontal length of the run of teeth shouldn&#x27;t be a surprise after reading the measurements, but the functionality of the teeth height was somewhat surprising in real use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, I love Kent combs, don&#x27;t even considerer cheap options it&#x27;ll only hurt you, your beard and maybe your ego...</li>
            <li>/&gt;The hand made comb will glide into the hair without hurting or pulling and will leave you with a fresh groomed appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>Received item quickly and as described, thanks!</li>
            <li>I have been carrying this comb with me everyday for about 8 months now and it is still a very nice comb.</li>
            <li>This kent folding comb is nice because its small and can fit in your pocket, but its intirely plastic and all together just &amp;#34;feels&amp;#34; cheap.</li>
            <li>Purchased this for my husband, is small enough to fit in his pocket &amp; works great!</li>
            <li>Glides right through the hair without tugging on it.</li>
            <li>so I just keep it in my front right pocket.</li>
            <li>It works well as a comb, is just the right size for a pocket comb and looks elegant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This comb is awesome yet pretty small and stiff in the folding mechanism , but love that it is handmade!</li>
            <li>I also find the spacing of the teeth perfect if I&#x27;m combing my hair down with product, such as Suavecito Pomade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Let me preface this with, I love this comb, so much that after reciving the first one I immediately ordered another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this comb looking for something portable mainly for my beard, and sometimes hair.</li>
            <li>Cool comb ,very compact and seems durable.</li>
            <li>Smart buy!</li>
            <li>The quality is phenomenal and the convenience of the folding action is really a lifesaver for when I need to fix my hair on the go.</li>
            <li>I bough this for my boyfriend and it came super fast.</li>
            <li>Its well constructed, light, and folds to easily fit in a front or back pocket.</li>
            <li>For some unknown reason, my hair always turns out better when I use the Kent comb!</li>
            <li>Little stiff at first but beautiful, effective, and well made.</li>
            <li>So it seems like a pretty stable comb.</li>
            <li>This might be my first; I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li>I bought my first Kent based on reviews.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I have several Kent combs and all are well made and feel lovely in the hand.</li>
            <li>I use it every day and it never fails to get the job done.</li>
            <li>The first day I had this the clip broke off.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really take it with me anywhere, but I imagine when I pack up and going out of town it&#x27;ll take up a negligible amount of space in my dopp kit!</li>
            <li>thanks will be ordering something else!</li>
            <li>I never thought a comb could be awesome, I was so wrong.</li>
            <li>I love the quality and the feel of the comb overall!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t catch and seems pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li>First day I had it, it fell out of my pocket.&lt;br</li>
            <li>No big deal, I still love it.</li>
            <li>The comb does not cause static; this was my only reason for ordering this product.</li>
            <li>It goes beyond simply not causing static though.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>If it&#x27;ll last me a year I&#x27;ll be satisfied.</li>
            <li>This comb is very neat!</li>
            <li>wear my hair longer on top and slicked back or side parted.</li>
            <li>The clip on mine fell off in the first week of owning it.</li>
            <li>Also, if you have thick or longer hair it isn&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s just stylish enough.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, the tips of the comb are what you would expect from Kent (assuming that this is not your first Kent product).  </li>
            <li>Tight joint, good build quality, certainly don&#x27;t anticipate seeing this break any time soon.</li>
            <li>The comb area is a little small but the comb is nicely made and feels great on my scalp and beard.</li>
            <li>Consider buying two, as you&#x27;ll enjoy having an extra comb when you lose the first one (I did!).</li>
            <li>Other then that its a nice comb.</li>
            <li>Very good quality comb, I bought a few different kent models to give as gifts.</li>
            <li>I really like the design and build quality, however the clip popped off the first day I got it.</li>
            <li>I like it better because it is easier to comb, just not nearly as portable because it is massive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good quality, but for the money, I didn&#x27;t anticipate how small it would be.  </li>
            <li>That said, even if it does break I&#x27;ll be getting the same exact thing because the comb itself is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Nice little comb.</li>
            <li>The only problem I had with the comb is the length , I wish it would have been a little longer , but besides that it is great.</li>
            <li>That hip cat at the end of the cul-de-sac buys this...and his yard takes huge dumps on the prior&#x27;s yard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gold writng came off fast, no biggie</li>
            <li>But this comb is really incredible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Very well made.</li>
            <li>Very compact</li>
            <li>I got this for my boyfriend (who loves to comb his beard), and he doesnt really use it (got a wood one instead).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made very well.</li>
            <li>They should really think about fixing the lettering on it.</li>
            <li>It is very compact and I can carry it in my shirt pocket every day.</li>
            <li>Very lightweight too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stop read reviews and just buy it.</li>
            <li>No broken or chipped teeth.</li>
            <li>so much I needed a comb for my truck.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>Very well made by hand in England (not China).</li>
            <li>I really like this comb.</li>
            <li>The teeth glide through your facial hairs so smoothly without any tugging or scratching your skin.</li>
            <li>Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and is very sturdy.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s not saying much).</li>
            <li>the clip is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really care about that.</li>
            <li>Very portable with the belt clip.</li>
            <li>The teeth are very judiciously spaced.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve given this comb as gifts and its is always appreciated.  </li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t really justify buying another one.</li>
            <li>This little folding comb is perfect for keeping my beard tame.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, I love this comb.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get much better than pulling out a folding pocket comb in front of other people.</li>
            <li>The quality is ok, it folds, and it combs hair like all other combs.</li>
            <li>The short length of the teeth (vertically) means that it won&#x27;t run through all of your hair as nicely if you have longer hair (the top of my hair is approximately 3&amp;#34;), but still works decently well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A very well built, beautifuly designed, classic comb.</li>
            <li>I also have a long beard that is what I primarily use this comb in and it alone is better than any other care product I&#x27;ve bought for it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My advice, if you use a heavy pomade (like murrays) I would heat up your hair (with a hairdryer) before combing it first thing in the morning (after the first comb through it&#x27;ll be fine).</li>
            <li>Nice small folding comb.</li>
            <li>Pretty classy comb.</li>
            <li>Pretty durable so far as well.</li>
            <li>this folding pocket come is a bit on the small side,but it does a nice job,it does not hurt my scalp.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be buying another down the road.</li>
            <li>so I can do some quick touch ups to my hair in the bathroom whenever necessary.</li>
            <li>The classic.</li>
            <li>I mainly got this comb for a beard I&#x27;ve been growing for 3 months now.</li>
            <li>This comb is great if you want to have a small pocket comb on you for minor work.</li>
            <li>actually wonder if Kent is not already fully aware of this issue, but does not change the design, since every \\&quot;lost\\&quot; 20T probably will generate a sale of a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Planned obsolescence from a 235 year old British manufacturer - NAW, couldn&#x27;t happen.  :-)  </li>
            <li>The folding action is a bit stiff in the beginning but it will break in nicely.  </li>
            <li>It is what it looks like: a high quality tortoise shell folding comb.</li>
            <li>High quality handmade comb from England.  </li>
            <li>The 20T was a bit stiff at first but after about a week it opened fairly easily.</li>
            <li>The lettering on the comb wore off in the first day, which seemed a little cheap</li>
            <li>Kind of hard to remove from a belt or pocket though</li>
            <li>I do favor the swissco brand, but these are very very nice, however they may be a bit stiff when folding the first few times.</li>
            <li>The build quality is nice and my clip has stayed tight but it rotates easily so that you will usually have to readjust the clip before use.</li>
            <li>I never really had any complaints about the cheap crappy plastic combs you can get all over the place, but I figured I&#x27;d give a nicer comb a shot.</li>
            <li>Finally, it&#x27;s fun to open and</li>
            <li>but after a few minutes of combing it gathers a static charge and starts to curl my hair.</li>
            <li>Lindsay Lohan&#x27;s mom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know those douchebags that can only grow chin hair that looks like someone spread grass seed on their dirt lawn instead of having a lush, yard full of sod?  </li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s stiff.</li>
            <li>I got a larger foldable Kent comb and found that it was too loose to be able to comb my hair with.</li>
            <li>Clip is nice and tight, and sits low in the pocket.  </li>
            <li>Smooth, doesn&#x27;t pull, extremely well-made.</li>
            <li>While this comb is perfect for beard trimming it does come a little loose after just a few weeks of normal wear and tear.</li>
            <li>Was a little tight to open and close at first but a put a drop of oil on the hinge and it works great now.</li>
            <li>and it still folds and extends like new.  </li>
            <li>Good and all, but it&#x27;s hard to pull up to open.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a new, avid convert to Kent combs and brushes, and now simply won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li>in all, I&#x27;m satisfied with this product, but it&#x27;s not an everyday use product for me only when I&#x27;m going to certain places.</li>
            <li>I had to buy a second one, my first one broke,</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bought a 2nd one after losing first one.</li>
            <li>This is the second one I&#x27;ve had after losing the first.  </li>
            <li>The handle is the same exact color as the comb</li>
            <li>Took one star away because the clip is very fragile and the labeling on the comb started fading on the first week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have a few of Kent&#x27;s combs in your arsenal are good or other hand sawn varieties.</li>
            <li>Everything else is fine, but I can&#x27;t imagine that the clip would last long for anyone.</li>
            <li>But due to the addition of fairly unruly, unkempt hair I have developed a need for a comb (which I normally detest) to tame the masses when I have the need of presenting myself with any modicum of class.</li>
            <li>This size is great when you just need to touch-up a spot, but to me seems just a little small when you need to re-groom on the go.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s loose, so it spins around too easily, and I can tell that at some point it will simply break off.</li>
            <li>Can easily be carried in a pocket all day everyday.</li>
            <li>I have less of a problem with static when I use it on my head, possible do to my hair being smoother there</li>
            <li>it in his car or backpack for the occasional refreshing of his beard, which otherwise is a tangled mess.</li>
            <li>Does not rough up skin under beard like other cheap combs.  </li>
            <li>I now have the Large size 188m comb and the MN1B Gentlemen&#x27;s Hairbrush in my bathroom, the slightly smaller 182m comb in my travel kit, and bought this folding comb to carry around with me everywhere.</li>
            <li>Good quality comb, was a little smaller than I expected</li>
            <li>So far, no issues.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the only real design flaw that I can think of.</li>
            <li>It also looks classy as hell.</li>
            <li>Very compact yet has an overall sturdy feel.  </li>
            <li>Anyways, the comb is solid, just a straight chunk of wood that they saw cut with precision to make the teeth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very well made comb and appears as though it&#x27;s going to last awhile.</li>
            <li>really wish I could rate this lower than 3 stars, but technically, the product worked fantastically.</li>
            <li>I got this for my boyfriend as an early Christmas gift for his beard.</li>
            <li>Its sturdy and classy.</li>
            <li>A classy comb for a classy man.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s about the only real downfall to this comb, from now</li>
            <li>My 23 year old bearded nephew LOVES this thing.</li>
            <li>still i recommend it to anyone with long hair that can&#x27;t be tamed by running your fingers through it and need a small but effective comb.</li>
            <li>Shorter than expected but still useful</li>
            <li>Once you get past those first couple of closing/openings you&#x27;ll be right as rain.</li>
            <li>In other words, you are paying for a high-quality comb with a nice set of teeth, great clip, and switchblade home base to rest the actual comb when not in use.</li>
            <li>Altogether I&#x27;d suggest just going for another Kent comb of the same length, because the teeth aren&#x27;t as smooth as other Kent combs I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s small size made it easy to misplace.</li>
            <li>A tiny redesign using a slightly longer clip and TWO rivets would easily solve the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Very well made comb, folds up small enough to fit in a pocket.  </li>
            <li>Originally, I kept it in my front pants pocket but it would ride up after sitting and standing a few times.</li>
            <li>We all know how totally reliable British cars like the Land Rover and the Jaguar are, and how Lucas Electrics never fail.  </li>
            <li>I would buy another comb from the same company but not this particular model.</li>
            <li>smaller that I expected which is not bad.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected after reading lots of reviews.</li>
            <li>Stiff to open but stays put while in use, convenient and easy to access when clipped into place.</li>
            <li>In large part it has been as having it closed in my pocket clearly protects the teeth and reduces the bulk.</li>
            <li>Been using this for at least a weak, gotta say its by far the best comb I&#x27;ve ever purchased (the most expensive too</li>
            <li>Whether cleaning up for night on the town or for getting ready for a hard day at the saw mill, this comb will keep your mustache or beard out of your mouth and keep you looking fresh.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t pop open in your pocket either, it takes a reasonable amount of force to get it to open.</li>
            <li>comb itself is very small and its kinda hard to comb with such a small comb, but it depends on the person and the application (myself I use it for my bushy beard), but its just because of the size - I&#x27;m pretty happy with it!</li>
            <li>No sharp edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have own this type of comb for least  25to30 years always have been satisfy with it specifically for is compactness and long  lasting</li>
            <li>The teeth aren&#x27;t sharp, which is EXACTLY what you want when you&#x27;re running through your beard.</li>
            <li>A little stiff at first but nonetheless definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>Even though its small the teeth seem sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;Looks classy, but the letters tend to rub off after not too long, specifically the ones that go in while folding.&lt;br /&gt;Teeth are too fine for me, takes my grease out while combing, so i cannot comb to my heart&#x27;s content.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>Very small, though, and easy to lose.</li>
            <li>This is comb is very small and easily fits in any pocket.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>The quality is high, so I&#x27;ll probably buy a larger comb from the same company, but skip on this one.</li>
            <li>Overall good comb, but the clip was very weak and snapped off after several weeks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very aware of the possibility of the clip rotating, and I&#x27;m on my third 20T because I lost the two previous ones because of the clip rotating, and letting the comb fall.</li>
            <li>It also has a clip on the side, which is handy because who wants a comb to be in the same pocket as dirty change/money?</li>
            <li>/&gt;The only real (and minor) gripe I have about this comb is the clip and the rivet, as others have noted as the swivel motion of the comb becomes</li>
            <li>But I cannot complain about the price as it is obvious that the quality and construction is far beyond what I&#x27;d always used before.</li>
            <li>Kind of expensive though.</li>
            <li>Similar to other reviews, I show that the clip becomes loose VERY quickly, and almost lost the comb several times.</li>
            <li>Decent comb, however it is very stiff when you first receive it.</li>
            <li>Good looking comb, but mine is very stiff could hardly get it open when its fold, and the clip feels almost going to break.</li>
            <li>For anyone with more than an inch or two of hair, or thick hair, it&#x27;s not very useful.  </li>
            <li>or if it happened within the first few uses.</li>
            <li>Only issue I had was that the pocket clip would constantly spin and eventually broke off at the rivet (so no sharp pieces).  </li>
            <li>clips onto your back pocket that raises your style level to \\&quot;alpha\\&quot; and is a little stubborn to get out of the folding position at first...</li>
            <li>What that means for you is it is extremely sturdy and there are no cheap microscopic plastic molds like the cheap 99 cents store stuff that will actually rip at the micro-follicles of your hair, leaving you with split ends and whatnot.</li>
            <li>Less hair falls out with this comb than my last cheap black one.</li>
            <li>It was a smaller than I expected but this is not a negative.</li>
            <li>I have pretty thick hair and this functions just as intended and without scratching my skin, all while looking classy.</li>
            <li>I can certainly see how the clip would/will loosen, and have apprehensively tested out the status of the clip by pushing on it a little bit.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the glaring oversight of it being so silky smooth and the clip being so weak</li>
            <li>biggest problem is you really have to work out the motion to get it to open even slightly.</li>
            <li>, which is both good and bad.</li>

            <li> The 188mm kent is amazing, but this one just doesn&#x27;t make the quality cut.</li>

            <li> Amazing comb.  </li>
            <li> A amazing product&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Really nice</li>
            <li> My boyfriend really liked this comb</li>
            <li> While it was kind of overpriced, I will never allow myself to lose it as a result of my monetary sacrifice.     </li>
            <li> I find this handy to keep on the inside of a jacket pocket for intermediate dapper touch-ups.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect and it got it here so fast, just in time for my husbands birthday.</li>
            <li> although i dont blame the comb, it was my own fault.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a nice and slim design.</li>
            <li> This is a nice comb.</li>
            <li> Nice comb doesn&#x27;t hurt while combing.</li>

            <li> It is handy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very sturdy, perfectly sized pocket comb.</li>
            <li> Like others have said, the rivet does kind of loosen up over time, not to the point where the comb itself is unusable though.</li>
            <li> my beard is loving this</li>
            <li> and I wanted to get him something nice he could take with him out and about.</li>
            <li> Especially useful after the gym</li>

            <li> Great pocket comb, nice and sturdy and just the right size.</li>
            <li> Great craftsmanship and great price and great for everyday carry.</li>
            <li> Stylish and convenient which fits nicely in any button up chest pocket.  </li>
            <li> And at the end of the day, this is the best pocket comb on the market circa early 2015.</li>
            <li> easy to carry for mustache and beard grooming!........</li>
            <li> We strongly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> The comb is very smooth and does not scratch my face at all.  </li>
            <li> The clip will eventually fall off, I&#x27;m sure, but it&#x27;s not flimsy.</li>
            <li> I keep mine in my top work shirt pocket.</li>
            <li> It makes you more manly in a way a chainsaw never can.</li>
            <li> I love the pocket clip and the fact that it folds like a pocketknife.</li>
            <li> Its okay.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Using this for my beard, as per advice from many forums, boards, and fellow bearded champs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Length: 3 1/4&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> - 8.2cm&lt;br /&gt;Folded Length: 3 5/8&amp;#34; - 9.2cm</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok comb.  </li>
            <li> Works great, very compact.</li>
            <li> Amazon had a better price and shipping time.</li>
            <li> when folded - more sanitar I suppose.  </li>
            <li> I may have to get more of these as gifts.</li>
            <li> if you are going to stay stylish at all times :)</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this mini comb.</li>

            <li> Thank you :) XOXO</li>
            <li> I have found that my back pocket is the best place for this comb.</li>
            <li> I love the size of the Kent 20T Folding Comb and carry one all the time unless I&#x27;m wearing a shirt without a breast pocket.  </li>
            <li> I love this comb for my beard.</li>
            <li> Sure it wont get knocked off and lost, but it takes some effort to get it to come off</li>
            <li> Still have it, use it daily and is still perfect.</li>
            <li> Person receiving the gift was pleased.</li>
            <li> and there it does provide a bit of static.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Additionally, I would like to see a more premium version of this comb.</li>
            <li> With a better clip and made of stronger materials.</li>
            <li> Just a good simple comb for a great price.</li>
            <li> Good comb and worth the price.</li>
            <li> I use this comb multiple times a day and is the perfect size to keep in your pocket for work/travel.</li>
            <li> am in love with the design and the material it was made with&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> In fact, it might be a better idea to eschew using the pocket clip altogether.  </li>
            <li> They are smooth, do not scratch your scap, and feel nice.  </li>
            <li> and I needed a portable hand made comb to be able to groom my mane on the go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most def.</li>
            <li> The person responsible for this comb being made available for sale should receive an immediate promotion!!!</li>
            <li> A cool folding comb and the comb part is nice.</li>
            <li> Loved it so much I ended up buying a spare!</li>
            <li> It really helps his beard look nice!</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m happy with this purchase and the clip is a nice feature on an even nicer comb.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very cool looking.</li>
            <li> The comb itself has been great so far.</li>
            <li> smooth and stylish</li>
            <li> Very convenient, good construction.</li>
            <li> I loved the 12T so much I had to get it&#x27;s baby brother for my pocket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband used it as a beard and mustache comb and he loved it and really misses it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a sweet comb!</li>
            <li> Words faded and clamp moves other than that great pocket comb!</li>
            <li> It was an easy fix, though.</li>
            <li> Also the clip is already rotating too easily.</li>
            <li> The one thing I don&#x27;t like is that the clip easily rotates.</li>
            <li> It easily fits in my pocket and is well made.</li>
            <li> Kent combs are amazing this my second one loved my kent combs OT</li>
            <li> so I can easily carry it when travelling.  </li>
            <li> , that causes it to glide out of your pocket almost as easily as the teeth glide through your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This gets rid of tangles, and folds away for easy storage in my pocket.</li>
            <li> Beard strong. -kb</li>
            <li> Strong and well made comb.</li>
            <li> still use the 20T, and like it very much, but I&#x27;d LOVE it if the darn clip design was better engineered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> well on fine and wavy hair!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Way better feel than those cheap Ace combs (which are also not bad).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a comb that felt so smooth on my scalp and combed my hair so easily.  </li>
            <li> but it has freed up just fine now.</li>
            <li> It fits in my pants just fine.</li>
            <li> I like how fine the teeth are.</li>
            <li> This comb combs my hair perfectly wet or dry, and feels great while doing it (to be honest the great feeling of this comb doing it&#x27;s job</li>
            <li> Wonderful little pocket comb.</li>
            <li> What a fantastic comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This comb is fantastic.</li>
            <li> and I do enjoy the pocket clip.</li>
            <li> I know thats not too important.</li>
            <li> That makes it feel cheap.</li>
            <li> Also, I like that it combs really smooth.</li>
            <li> They are smooth on the scalp as well.</li>
            <li> Smooth teeth.  </li>
            <li> Suprisingly light, but sturdy,</li>
            <li> - my wife wants one of her own now.  </li>
            <li> Works great but the only downfall is from a distance it looks like a knife.</li>
            <li> Light strokes reduce any entanglement.</li>
            <li> Not only will this pen make you look like a boss when you whip it out of your pocket, but it also makes a great beard comb in a pinch.</li>
            <li> I had a bag of cheap combs I got for a couple of dollars, and I figured that would work just as well as this one.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this comb and it was working great.</li>
            <li> The cheap metal clip broke about a week into using it.</li>
            <li> This pocket comb was cheap.</li>
            <li> Important things to note about this comb:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had been using a cheap comb until I got this and let me tell you that the quality of this comb has made a huge difference in the ease of combing my hair.</li>
            <li> It has a nice, classy look to it as well instead of cheap plastic like most combs..</li>
            <li> Great comb, use it on my beard almost daily.</li>
            <li> Great comb but thought would be bigger.</li>
            <li> This comb fits nicely in a breasts pocket and is also made very well.</li>
            <li> If price is no object, get these instead of the cheap stuff you find everywhere.</li>
            <li> Very well made comb -way better than most folding/switchblade combs I have checked out.</li>
            <li> Awesome comb except gold letters rub off fast only after couple uses.</li>
            <li> Other wise a nice product</li>
            <li> This guy only leaves my pocket when I am changing pants... very handy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super handsome, and definitely well built, so I&#x27;m pretty happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Packaging and comb are original</li>
            <li> The clip is sturdy and pocket friendly.</li>
            <li> Best thing I like is the fact that it folds up small and clips so you can pocket carry.  </li>
            <li> Awesome comb, American made by hand, works great for my thick beard.</li>
            <li> Great little comb, more of an accessory than grooming product when it comes to styling non-facial hair.</li>
            <li> Great comb, well made and very durable, lasted 2 years so far.</li>
            <li> Over the years, I can&#x27;t tell you how many \\&quot;unbreakable\\&quot; combs I&#x27;ve broken by carrying them in my pants pocket, so a folding comb seemed the perfect solution.</li>
            <li> Great comb, you really do start to realize how soft it feels on your head.</li>
            <li> folds up small, fits nicely in pocket and has fine teeth for a good untangling of curly beard</li>
            <li> It also fits perfectly in the little pocket inside your right jeans pocket so it&#x27;s been with me all the time since I bought it.</li>
            <li> Overall a good purchase and very useful.</li>
            <li> and he says it is very smooth and gentle on his face now</li>
            <li> Get this comb to ensure your hair is always looking right!</li>
            <li> he wants the beard oil and other combs and brushes but overall very good quality and great product</li>
            <li> I am super excited to give it to him in Christmas.</li>
            <li> It is very high quality and doesnt budge even with his huge beard!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t grow a true beard and therefore cannot attest to it&#x27;s beard combing capabilities)?</li>
            <li> It has a clip, how cool is that?</li>
            <li> This foldable hair comb is true heirloom.&lt;br /&gt;Works</li>
            <li> The fact that it folds is convenient and really cool.</li>
            <li> What it IS, is an elegant yet modern tool for slappin those whiskers into formation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Everyday carry for me and while the Kent lettering has worn off the comb is still going strong, looks great too.</li>
            <li> Some super glue should fix it though.</li>
            <li> came quick</li>
            <li> It is great construction only problem is it is very compact when you fold it up</li>
            <li> i use it all the time when i need a quick hair fix</li>
            <li> I thought I would use this as a primary comb when I travel or am on vacation, but I think this is good enough really for just touch ups.</li>
            <li> Makes a simple product look very elegant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d live with one taking up a bit more pocket space in exchange for not feeling like I was using a beard &amp; mustache comb on my hair.</li>
            <li> Exactly what we were looking for...excellent quality, durable!</li>
            <li> As expected, good quality, and shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li> I dont prefer using it much because its to fine .</li>
            <li> Great little pocket comb.</li>
            <li> Is very well-made it will fit in your pocket.</li>
            <li> recently purchased this comb because it is winter, and in winter I let my hair grow out because it is warm.</li>
            <li> The comb is ok as far as a comb goes.</li>
            <li> Really nice for when I need to get protruding hairs of my beard back into the fold / mustache.</li>
            <li> Worth the price just for that alone.  </li>
            <li> the comb has a nice compact size, but I found the length of the comb&#x27;s teeth to be too short for combing my beard.</li>
            <li> I glued it back into place, but now it&#x27;s not as nice looking.</li>
            <li> The actual horizontal length of the run of teeth shouldn&#x27;t be a surprise after reading the measurements, but the functionality of the teeth height was somewhat surprising in real use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, I love Kent combs, don&#x27;t even considerer cheap options it&#x27;ll only hurt you, your beard and maybe your ego...</li>
            <li> /&gt;The hand made comb will glide into the hair without hurting or pulling and will leave you with a fresh groomed appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Received item quickly and as described, thanks!</li>
            <li> I have been carrying this comb with me everyday for about 8 months now and it is still a very nice comb.</li>
            <li> This kent folding comb is nice because its small and can fit in your pocket, but its intirely plastic and all together just &amp;#34;feels&amp;#34; cheap.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my husband, is small enough to fit in his pocket &amp; works great!</li>
            <li> Glides right through the hair without tugging on it.</li>
            <li> so I just keep it in my front right pocket.</li>
            <li> It works well as a comb, is just the right size for a pocket comb and looks elegant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This comb is awesome yet pretty small and stiff in the folding mechanism , but love that it is handmade!</li>
            <li> I also find the spacing of the teeth perfect if I&#x27;m combing my hair down with product, such as Suavecito Pomade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Let me preface this with, I love this comb, so much that after reciving the first one I immediately ordered another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this comb looking for something portable mainly for my beard, and sometimes hair.</li>
            <li> Cool comb ,very compact and seems durable.</li>
            <li> Smart buy!</li>
            <li> The quality is phenomenal and the convenience of the folding action is really a lifesaver for when I need to fix my hair on the go.</li>
            <li> I bough this for my boyfriend and it came super fast.</li>
            <li> Its well constructed, light, and folds to easily fit in a front or back pocket.</li>
            <li> For some unknown reason, my hair always turns out better when I use the Kent comb!</li>
            <li> Little stiff at first but beautiful, effective, and well made.</li>
            <li> So it seems like a pretty stable comb.</li>
            <li> This might be my first; I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> I bought my first Kent based on reviews.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have several Kent combs and all are well made and feel lovely in the hand.</li>
            <li> I use it every day and it never fails to get the job done.</li>
            <li> The first day I had this the clip broke off.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really take it with me anywhere, but I imagine when I pack up and going out of town it&#x27;ll take up a negligible amount of space in my dopp kit!</li>
            <li> thanks will be ordering something else!</li>
            <li> I never thought a comb could be awesome, I was so wrong.</li>
            <li> I love the quality and the feel of the comb overall!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t catch and seems pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li> First day I had it, it fell out of my pocket.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No big deal, I still love it.</li>
            <li> The comb does not cause static; this was my only reason for ordering this product.</li>
            <li> It goes beyond simply not causing static though.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> If it&#x27;ll last me a year I&#x27;ll be satisfied.</li>
            <li> This comb is very neat!</li>
            <li> wear my hair longer on top and slicked back or side parted.</li>
            <li> The clip on mine fell off in the first week of owning it.</li>
            <li> Also, if you have thick or longer hair it isn&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s just stylish enough.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, the tips of the comb are what you would expect from Kent (assuming that this is not your first Kent product).  </li>
            <li> Tight joint, good build quality, certainly don&#x27;t anticipate seeing this break any time soon.</li>
            <li> The comb area is a little small but the comb is nicely made and feels great on my scalp and beard.</li>
            <li> Consider buying two, as you&#x27;ll enjoy having an extra comb when you lose the first one (I did!).</li>
            <li> Other then that its a nice comb.</li>
            <li> Very good quality comb, I bought a few different kent models to give as gifts.</li>
            <li> I really like the design and build quality, however the clip popped off the first day I got it.</li>
            <li> I like it better because it is easier to comb, just not nearly as portable because it is massive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good quality, but for the money, I didn&#x27;t anticipate how small it would be.  </li>
            <li> That said, even if it does break I&#x27;ll be getting the same exact thing because the comb itself is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Nice little comb.</li>
            <li> The only problem I had with the comb is the length , I wish it would have been a little longer , but besides that it is great.</li>
            <li> That hip cat at the end of the cul-de-sac buys this...and his yard takes huge dumps on the prior&#x27;s yard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gold writng came off fast, no biggie</li>
            <li> But this comb is really incredible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Very well made.</li>
            <li> Very compact</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend (who loves to comb his beard), and he doesnt really use it (got a wood one instead).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made very well.</li>
            <li> They should really think about fixing the lettering on it.</li>
            <li> It is very compact and I can carry it in my shirt pocket every day.</li>
            <li> Very lightweight too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stop read reviews and just buy it.</li>
            <li> No broken or chipped teeth.</li>
            <li> so much I needed a comb for my truck.</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> Very well made by hand in England (not China).</li>
            <li> I really like this comb.</li>
            <li> The teeth glide through your facial hairs so smoothly without any tugging or scratching your skin.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and is very sturdy.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s not saying much).</li>
            <li> the clip is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really care about that.</li>
            <li> Very portable with the belt clip.</li>
            <li> The teeth are very judiciously spaced.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given this comb as gifts and its is always appreciated.  </li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t really justify buying another one.</li>
            <li> This little folding comb is perfect for keeping my beard tame.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, I love this comb.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get much better than pulling out a folding pocket comb in front of other people.</li>
            <li> The quality is ok, it folds, and it combs hair like all other combs.</li>
            <li> The short length of the teeth (vertically) means that it won&#x27;t run through all of your hair as nicely if you have longer hair (the top of my hair is approximately 3&amp;#34;), but still works decently well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A very well built, beautifuly designed, classic comb.</li>
            <li> I also have a long beard that is what I primarily use this comb in and it alone is better than any other care product I&#x27;ve bought for it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My advice, if you use a heavy pomade (like murrays) I would heat up your hair (with a hairdryer) before combing it first thing in the morning (after the first comb through it&#x27;ll be fine).</li>
            <li> Nice small folding comb.</li>
            <li> Pretty classy comb.</li>
            <li> Pretty durable so far as well.</li>
            <li> this folding pocket come is a bit on the small side,but it does a nice job,it does not hurt my scalp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be buying another down the road.</li>
            <li> so I can do some quick touch ups to my hair in the bathroom whenever necessary.</li>
            <li> The classic.</li>
            <li> I mainly got this comb for a beard I&#x27;ve been growing for 3 months now.</li>
            <li> This comb is great if you want to have a small pocket comb on you for minor work.</li>
            <li> actually wonder if Kent is not already fully aware of this issue, but does not change the design, since every \\&quot;lost\\&quot; 20T probably will generate a sale of a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Planned obsolescence from a 235 year old British manufacturer - NAW, couldn&#x27;t happen.  :-)  </li>
            <li> The folding action is a bit stiff in the beginning but it will break in nicely.  </li>
            <li> It is what it looks like: a high quality tortoise shell folding comb.</li>
            <li> High quality handmade comb from England.  </li>
            <li> The 20T was a bit stiff at first but after about a week it opened fairly easily.</li>
            <li> The lettering on the comb wore off in the first day, which seemed a little cheap</li>
            <li> Kind of hard to remove from a belt or pocket though</li>
            <li> I do favor the swissco brand, but these are very very nice, however they may be a bit stiff when folding the first few times.</li>
            <li> The build quality is nice and my clip has stayed tight but it rotates easily so that you will usually have to readjust the clip before use.</li>
            <li> I never really had any complaints about the cheap crappy plastic combs you can get all over the place, but I figured I&#x27;d give a nicer comb a shot.</li>
            <li> Finally, it&#x27;s fun to open and</li>
            <li> but after a few minutes of combing it gathers a static charge and starts to curl my hair.</li>
            <li> Lindsay Lohan&#x27;s mom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know those douchebags that can only grow chin hair that looks like someone spread grass seed on their dirt lawn instead of having a lush, yard full of sod?  </li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s stiff.</li>
            <li> I got a larger foldable Kent comb and found that it was too loose to be able to comb my hair with.</li>
            <li> Clip is nice and tight, and sits low in the pocket.  </li>
            <li> Smooth, doesn&#x27;t pull, extremely well-made.</li>
            <li> While this comb is perfect for beard trimming it does come a little loose after just a few weeks of normal wear and tear.</li>
            <li> Was a little tight to open and close at first but a put a drop of oil on the hinge and it works great now.</li>
            <li> and it still folds and extends like new.  </li>
            <li> Good and all, but it&#x27;s hard to pull up to open.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a new, avid convert to Kent combs and brushes, and now simply won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> in all, I&#x27;m satisfied with this product, but it&#x27;s not an everyday use product for me only when I&#x27;m going to certain places.</li>
            <li> I had to buy a second one, my first one broke,</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bought a 2nd one after losing first one.</li>
            <li> This is the second one I&#x27;ve had after losing the first.  </li>
            <li> The handle is the same exact color as the comb</li>
            <li> Took one star away because the clip is very fragile and the labeling on the comb started fading on the first week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have a few of Kent&#x27;s combs in your arsenal are good or other hand sawn varieties.</li>
            <li> Everything else is fine, but I can&#x27;t imagine that the clip would last long for anyone.</li>
            <li> But due to the addition of fairly unruly, unkempt hair I have developed a need for a comb (which I normally detest) to tame the masses when I have the need of presenting myself with any modicum of class.</li>
            <li> This size is great when you just need to touch-up a spot, but to me seems just a little small when you need to re-groom on the go.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s loose, so it spins around too easily, and I can tell that at some point it will simply break off.</li>
            <li> Can easily be carried in a pocket all day everyday.</li>
            <li> I have less of a problem with static when I use it on my head, possible do to my hair being smoother there</li>
            <li> it in his car or backpack for the occasional refreshing of his beard, which otherwise is a tangled mess.</li>
            <li> Does not rough up skin under beard like other cheap combs.  </li>
            <li> I now have the Large size 188m comb and the MN1B Gentlemen&#x27;s Hairbrush in my bathroom, the slightly smaller 182m comb in my travel kit, and bought this folding comb to carry around with me everywhere.</li>
            <li> Good quality comb, was a little smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> So far, no issues.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the only real design flaw that I can think of.</li>
            <li> It also looks classy as hell.</li>
            <li> Very compact yet has an overall sturdy feel.  </li>
            <li> Anyways, the comb is solid, just a straight chunk of wood that they saw cut with precision to make the teeth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very well made comb and appears as though it&#x27;s going to last awhile.</li>
            <li> really wish I could rate this lower than 3 stars, but technically, the product worked fantastically.</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend as an early Christmas gift for his beard.</li>
            <li> Its sturdy and classy.</li>
            <li> A classy comb for a classy man.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s about the only real downfall to this comb, from now</li>
            <li> My 23 year old bearded nephew LOVES this thing.</li>
            <li> still i recommend it to anyone with long hair that can&#x27;t be tamed by running your fingers through it and need a small but effective comb.</li>
            <li> Shorter than expected but still useful</li>
            <li> Once you get past those first couple of closing/openings you&#x27;ll be right as rain.</li>
            <li> In other words, you are paying for a high-quality comb with a nice set of teeth, great clip, and switchblade home base to rest the actual comb when not in use.</li>
            <li> Altogether I&#x27;d suggest just going for another Kent comb of the same length, because the teeth aren&#x27;t as smooth as other Kent combs I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s small size made it easy to misplace.</li>
            <li> A tiny redesign using a slightly longer clip and TWO rivets would easily solve the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Very well made comb, folds up small enough to fit in a pocket.  </li>
            <li> Originally, I kept it in my front pants pocket but it would ride up after sitting and standing a few times.</li>
            <li> We all know how totally reliable British cars like the Land Rover and the Jaguar are, and how Lucas Electrics never fail.  </li>
            <li> I would buy another comb from the same company but not this particular model.</li>
            <li> smaller that I expected which is not bad.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected after reading lots of reviews.</li>
            <li> Stiff to open but stays put while in use, convenient and easy to access when clipped into place.</li>
            <li> In large part it has been as having it closed in my pocket clearly protects the teeth and reduces the bulk.</li>
            <li> Been using this for at least a weak, gotta say its by far the best comb I&#x27;ve ever purchased (the most expensive too</li>
            <li> Whether cleaning up for night on the town or for getting ready for a hard day at the saw mill, this comb will keep your mustache or beard out of your mouth and keep you looking fresh.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t pop open in your pocket either, it takes a reasonable amount of force to get it to open.</li>
            <li> comb itself is very small and its kinda hard to comb with such a small comb, but it depends on the person and the application (myself I use it for my bushy beard), but its just because of the size - I&#x27;m pretty happy with it!</li>
            <li> No sharp edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have own this type of comb for least  25to30 years always have been satisfy with it specifically for is compactness and long  lasting</li>
            <li> The teeth aren&#x27;t sharp, which is EXACTLY what you want when you&#x27;re running through your beard.</li>
            <li> A little stiff at first but nonetheless definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> Even though its small the teeth seem sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;Looks classy, but the letters tend to rub off after not too long, specifically the ones that go in while folding.&lt;br /&gt;Teeth are too fine for me, takes my grease out while combing, so i cannot comb to my heart&#x27;s content.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> Very small, though, and easy to lose.</li>
            <li> This is comb is very small and easily fits in any pocket.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> The quality is high, so I&#x27;ll probably buy a larger comb from the same company, but skip on this one.</li>
            <li> Overall good comb, but the clip was very weak and snapped off after several weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very aware of the possibility of the clip rotating, and I&#x27;m on my third 20T because I lost the two previous ones because of the clip rotating, and letting the comb fall.</li>
            <li> It also has a clip on the side, which is handy because who wants a comb to be in the same pocket as dirty change/money?</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only real (and minor) gripe I have about this comb is the clip and the rivet, as others have noted as the swivel motion of the comb becomes</li>
            <li> But I cannot complain about the price as it is obvious that the quality and construction is far beyond what I&#x27;d always used before.</li>
            <li> Kind of expensive though.</li>
            <li> Similar to other reviews, I show that the clip becomes loose VERY quickly, and almost lost the comb several times.</li>
            <li> Decent comb, however it is very stiff when you first receive it.</li>
            <li> Good looking comb, but mine is very stiff could hardly get it open when its fold, and the clip feels almost going to break.</li>
            <li> For anyone with more than an inch or two of hair, or thick hair, it&#x27;s not very useful.  </li>
            <li> or if it happened within the first few uses.</li>
            <li> Only issue I had was that the pocket clip would constantly spin and eventually broke off at the rivet (so no sharp pieces).  </li>
            <li> clips onto your back pocket that raises your style level to \\&quot;alpha\\&quot; and is a little stubborn to get out of the folding position at first...</li>
            <li> What that means for you is it is extremely sturdy and there are no cheap microscopic plastic molds like the cheap 99 cents store stuff that will actually rip at the micro-follicles of your hair, leaving you with split ends and whatnot.</li>
            <li> Less hair falls out with this comb than my last cheap black one.</li>
            <li> It was a smaller than I expected but this is not a negative.</li>
            <li> I have pretty thick hair and this functions just as intended and without scratching my skin, all while looking classy.</li>
            <li> I can certainly see how the clip would/will loosen, and have apprehensively tested out the status of the clip by pushing on it a little bit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the glaring oversight of it being so silky smooth and the clip being so weak</li>
            <li> biggest problem is you really have to work out the motion to get it to open even slightly.</li>
            <li> , which is both good and bad.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it is a little stiff to open up, when it gets loose it feels cheaply made in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Is it also the  most expensive comb I have purchased, yes by a long shot.  </li>
            <li> He has short hair, full but thin.</li>
            <li> Also this is a small tooth not intended for longer large beards.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted &amp; I reommend it to anyone who wants to carry a small comb in his shirt pocket.</li>
            <li> be surprise, it is SMALL, but that&#x27;s the whole point.&lt;br /&gt;Clip</li>
            <li> When extended, the toothed portion is long enough to do as you need it to.</li>
            <li> A lot smaller than some people might think though, not for long hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned three 20T combs, and with each one, after a few months of normal use, the pocket clip rivet will loosen to the point that it lets the clip rotate.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a lot smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> only issue with the 20T is the use of a single rivet to attach the pocket clip.  </li>
            <li> My only gripe is that the brass clip came loose and was rotating.</li>
            <li> Decent small comb for a beard.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product if you need a small comb for work or travel.</li>
            <li> Made to what seems to be the usual Kent high standards.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t substitute other combs for your beard that are in your arsenal that should be used before you step out of the house for work or social events.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Never really thought about the difference in such a &amp;#34;low tech&amp;#34</li>
            <li> People looks at you strange stroking the beard,</li>
            <li> i purchased this come because my hair is quite long and does get tangled when im out and about.</li>
            <li> The section of the teeth is 3 inches long.</li>
            <li> smaller than we expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s decent, but I did note it is very stiff..</li>
            <li> The folding action was a bit stiff when I got it</li>
            <li> A little pomade and this bad boy keeps me looking good all day long!</li>
            <li> Little clip is flimsy and swivels around, pretty pointless.  </li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t comb it very long.</li>
            <li> Per usual, I turn to Amazon, and per usual, the reviews led me right.</li>
            <li> I usually wear shirts with chest pockets and clip it in this pocket without a problem so far.  </li>
            <li> I will buy another one when I loose this one.</li>
            <li> Just big enough for a small to medium sized beard.</li>
            <li> Small but big enough to do the job for me.</li>
            <li> It was extremely difficult to unfold the first several times until it loosened up.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it was extremely tight when closing and opening it the first few times.</li>
            <li> Smaller comb, not full size</li>
            <li> We both like that the comb folds up, and isn&#x27;t hard to swing open or closed (it&#x27;s also not loose, either.)</li>
            <li> It could of been a little bigger</li>
            <li> want something a little different here</li>
            <li> After working it back and forth for a couple of minutes it loosened right up and is now snug instead of nearly impossible to open.</li>
            <li> I received this comb on the 19th which was a little earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> it was a little bit smaller than he expected</li>
            <li> Hope I don&#x27;t loose it!</li>
            <li> Construction quality was cheaper than i expected.</li>
            <li> I partly expected the designer to sacrifice functionality for compactness, but it is just right.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li> Keeps my big Beard neat without destroying it</li>
            <li> The teeth are also narrower than I expected.</li>
            <li> only complaint that I have with this comb (and really is not that big of a deal for me) is that the clip, which I don&#x27;t use anyway, over time will start to rotate.</li>
            <li> This comb has held up so far against murrays in my thick rope strength hair.</li>
            <li> Its not too big and its not too small.</li>
            <li> When folded, it is small enough to forget about.</li>
            <li> other reviewers noted that the clip loosens over time.</li>
            <li> Every other comb wishes it was this comb.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also small enough</li>
            <li> /&gt;The teeth are still all intact due to the protective folding too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m away from a bathroom or my other combs.</li>
            <li> Other than that I have no complaints.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that I would have given it a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to bring my other Kent comb with me all the time.</li>
            <li> The price is a small amount to pay for such a product.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s hard to get open if your hands are wet or damp.</li>
            <li> The clip is a little loose</li>
            <li> It gets the job done, but is a little stiff to open and close.</li>
            <li> After a few uses the clip became loose</li>
            <li> My very particular and not easily impressed</li>
            <li> The individual combs are a bit thick, so take that into consideration before you buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just some superglue down the spine.</li>
            <li> IT DOES NOT HURT HIS SCALP LIKE THE OTHER COMBS DO!</li>
            <li> My other problem is when I use it I usually have just wet my hair and therefore hands</li>
            <li> The clip is not very strong.</li>
            <li> Other&#x27;s have complained that the clip is prone to getting loose</li>
            <li> I mean who wants little pointy points sticking into ones hands unnecessarily?</li>
            <li> , order this little guy and always feel like a manly Rockstar.</li>
            <li> Very stiff could hardly get it open...</li>
            <li> less stiff the rivet moves around more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> only reason i did not give 5 stars is because folding and unfolding it is a little tough.</li>
            <li> But when I do it comes in hand and is fitted to the comb firmly.</li>
            <li> Will be carrying this with me everyday.</li>
            <li> However the clip broke off within a few weeks of use (keeping it in my pocket).</li>
            <li> However the gold writing did wear off after a few days of use.</li>
            <li> I attribute this to the rugged and firm build of the Kent 20T...better than the rest of the products nowadays that are made cheaper than</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few months now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m half bald and this comb is a little too small.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t pay any attention to the reviewed that say the clip falls off or the comb opens too stiffly.</li>
            <li> a little small than I think</li>
            <li> I usually carry it with me everyday and forget its there until I reach into my pocket.</li>
            <li> Folds to about 3 1/2&amp;#34; and is less than 1/2&amp;#34; thick.</li>
            <li> As others have said, the comb is initially very tight and difficult to open.  </li>
            <li> Also very tightly connected and difficult to open.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend, I have also used it a few times on myself and I have shoulder length (thick) hair.</li>
            <li> My only complain is the clip...to difficult</li>
            <li> You need a comb if your trying to or just lazy and growing a beard of any length.</li>
            <li> Small and compact, I carry it in my coat pocket for my beard.</li>
            <li> This comb is slick.</li>
            <li> Small.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I lost this comb recently and miss it quite a bit.</li>
            <li> All small teeth&lt;</li>
            <li> No more broke or lost combs.</li>
            <li> 5 stars for its sturdy construction 1 star for its small size.</li>
            <li> But not made for thick beard hair.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed, but went out and bought the full sized comb.</li>
            <li> but seriously what else do you want in a pocket comb?</li>
            <li> Seriously, I whip this thing out and all the ladies start to swoon.</li>
            <li> and then it is nearly impossible to open because it is</li>
            <li> dont have to worry about coins and keys damaging the pins because of the holster,its made from tough plastic and is really hard to damage.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not a bad comb, but some practical issues should be worked on, like a nonstick grip or switch to open it.</li>
            <li> Purchased two, one became very sloppy after opening and closing a half dozen times.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the clip often and it has loosened a bit over time but it hasn&#x27;t failed in the past six months or so.  </li>
            <li> The pocket clip is a bit weak and feels like it might break off if not treated with care.  </li>
            <li> I have not experienced this yet, but I fully expect to.</li>
            <li> Never before has a comb made me feel like such a bad a&amp;$!</li>
            <li> This comb has yet to fail me after sitting in my work pocket after 3 months!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the clip, but it&#x27;s annoying when I pull it out of my bag</li>
            <li> Now I can&#x27;t even use the junky plastic crap anymore.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Exactly what we were looking for...excellent quality, durable!</li>
            <li> This is the comb I have been looking for. Buy value instead of price and you can stop going to the drug store for combs</li>
            <li> I use it for my medium length beard. Works great. So far, no issues. Hope I don&#x27;t loose it!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t pay any attention to the reviewed that say the clip falls off or the comb opens too stiffly. It opens very easily. and stays open until you close it. The clip will eventually fall off, I&#x27;m sure, but it&#x27;s not flimsy. Consider buying two, as you&#x27;ll enjoy having an extra comb when you lose the first one (I did!).</li>
            <li> Solid. Great for on the go. Less hair falls out with this comb than my last cheap black one. Gold writng came off fast, no biggie</li>
            <li> I did like the comb, very nice, worked well, and the clip was very handy.The only problem I had with the comb is the length , I wish it would have been a little longer , but besides that it is great.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend and he loved it. Only problem is the case cracked. I don&#x27;t know if it came that way or if it happened within the first few uses. It was an easy fix, though. Just some superglue down the spine.</li>
            <li> Like the comb but was hoping the comb would feel stronger then this. Felt like it would brake if you leaned on it while in your pocket.</li>
            <li> Good quality comb, was a little smaller than I expected and that&#x27;s the only reason it gets 4 instead of 5 stars, but yeah I always keep it with me at work so I can do some quick touch ups to my hair in the bathroom whenever necessary. I recommend</li>
            <li> Little stiff at first but beautiful, effective, and well made.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect take along comb. I keep mine in my top work shirt pocket.</li>
            <li> Great craftsmanship and great price and great for everyday carry.</li>
            <li> Smooth, doesn&#x27;t pull, extremely well-made.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband who LOVES it! The clip holds it in his pocket so he always knows where his comb is. (And now he stops stealing all of my combs!)</li>
            <li> Well made, works perfect, and looks good too!</li>
            <li> So it seems like a pretty stable comb. Even though its small the teeth seem sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;Looks classy, but the letters tend to rub off after not too long, specifically the ones that go in while folding.&lt;br /&gt;Teeth are too fine for me, takes my grease out while combing, so i cannot comb to my heart&#x27;s content.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m satisfied with this product, but it&#x27;s not an everyday use product for me only when I&#x27;m going to certain places. And if I were to lose it, I would not buy another one.&lt;br /&gt;Clip also seems fragile, getting looser.&lt;br /&gt;If it only had wider teeth and stronger clip.</li>
            <li> Construction quality was cheaper than i expected. With that said, it&#x27;s lived in my pocket for the last 2 months without breaking. Decent small comb for a beard.</li>
            <li> Is very well-made it will fit in your pocket. Really nice I would order another one and it&#x27;s handmade.</li>
            <li> What a fantastic comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, let&#x27;s start with the fact that I never write reviews. This might be my first; I don&#x27;t know. But this comb is really incredible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently purchased this comb because it is winter, and in winter I let my hair grow out because it is warm. But due to the addition of fairly unruly, unkempt hair I have developed a need for a comb (which I normally detest) to tame the masses when I have the need of presenting myself with any modicum of class. Per usual, I turn to Amazon, and per usual, the reviews led me right. This comb combs my hair perfectly wet or dry, and feels great while doing it (to be honest the great feeling of this comb doing it&#x27;s job is what led me to write this review).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may ask, why did he get a folding comb when he doesn&#x27;t seem to carry it with him every day?&lt;br /&gt;Because I only have room for one folding tool to carry every day, and that&#x27;s a knife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, who needs a comb without a handle when the teeth on this one are perfectly spaced for all one&#x27;s combing needs (to be fair I can&#x27;t grow a true beard and therefore cannot attest to it&#x27;s beard combing capabilities)? I mean who wants little pointy points sticking into ones hands unnecessarily? Ergonomics are clutch. Additionally, I like the convenience the folding handle affords affords while traveling. Finally, it&#x27;s fun to open and close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this comb! It makes you more manly in a way a chainsaw never can.</li>
            <li> As expected, good quality, and shipped quickly.  This guy only leaves my pocket when I am changing pants... very handy.</li>
            <li> After a few uses the clip became loose</li>
            <li> This si a gift so I&#x27;ll have to see if it&#x27;s the one wanted, but the ordering and delivering all went well.&lt;br /&gt;J. Truelsen</li>
            <li> I wish the teeth were finer.  It is a solid comb though.</li>
            <li> Husband loves these. Very small, though, and easy to lose. We call them his &amp;#34;Gentlemen Combs&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I like to buy things once and for all. I hope it will serve me for a while.</li>
            <li> This comb is awesome yet pretty small and stiff in the folding mechanism , but love that it is handmade!</li>
            <li> Very stiff could hardly get it open...</li>
            <li> I bought my first Kent based on reviews.  Never really thought about the difference in such a &amp;#34;low tech&amp;#34; item.  Here&#x27;s the news:  There&#x27;s a difference.  Forget your Ace, buy a Kent.  I have 3 of the folding ones.</li>
            <li> best travel comb to throw in your pocket, bar none!</li>
            <li> Love this thing! And so do a lot of people I&#x27;ve shown it too. I lost one and immediately bought another. Had several friends but one aswell. Very well made.</li>
            <li> Great comb for keeping my mustache and beard in check. I love the pocket clip and the fact that it folds like a pocketknife. Very compact and I can&#x27;t even tell that it is in my pocket.</li>
            <li> This comb is very nice. It folds into the holder and it also has a clip for convenience. Great gift for dad</li>
            <li> My boyfriend really liked this comb</li>
            <li> Great and convienient find for the price!</li>
            <li> Its okay. I got this for my boyfriend (who loves to comb his beard), and he doesnt really use it (got a wood one instead).  This kent folding comb is nice because its small and can fit in your pocket, but its intirely plastic and all together just &amp;#34;feels&amp;#34; cheap. Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> This comb is fantastic. While it was kind of overpriced, I will never allow myself to lose it as a result of my monetary sacrifice.     It has a clip, how cool is that? I find this handy to keep on the inside of a jacket pocket for intermediate dapper touch-ups. The Kent 20T Folding Comb is sturdily built, and does not swing open without human intervention. Worry not about inter-tooth debris with this item!</li>
            <li> This foldable hair comb is true heirloom.&lt;br /&gt;Works well on fine and wavy hair!&lt;br /&gt;If you desire daily luxury, this is the one!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it. It&#x27;s made very well. My only complaint is that it was extremely tight when closing and opening it the first few times. After working it back and forth for a couple of minutes it loosened right up and is now snug instead of nearly impossible to open. Once you get past those first couple of closing/openings you&#x27;ll be right as rain. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Wonderful little pocket comb. Using this for my beard, as per advice from many forums, boards, and fellow bearded champs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s convenient and I do enjoy the pocket clip. Glides right through the hair without tugging on it. No sharp edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only reason, I take off 1 star is because the writing wore off in 10 or so uses. Also the clip is already rotating too easily.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected after reading lots of reviews. It&#x27;s perfect and it got it here so fast, just in time for my husbands birthday. Thanks!</li>
            <li> The classic. Its simple. A very well built, beautifuly designed, classic comb. You can carry it with you, use it when you need it. I had to buy a second one, my first one broke, although i dont blame the comb, it was my own fault. My advice, if you use a heavy pomade (like murrays) I would heat up your hair (with a hairdryer) before combing it first thing in the morning (after the first comb through it&#x27;ll be fine). But this is a great comb, you&#x27;ll never regret buying it.</li>
            <li> Similar to other reviews, I show that the clip becomes loose VERY quickly, and almost lost the comb several times. Other than that, I love this comb.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend, I have also used it a few times on myself and I have shoulder length (thick) hair. He has short hair, full but thin. The comb size is good, if you have tangles it might snag though. We both like that the comb folds up, and isn&#x27;t hard to swing open or closed (it&#x27;s also not loose, either.) The clip on the comb handle might crease your shirt if you decide to put it in a pocket and clip it so it doesn&#x27;t fall out. The individual combs are a bit thick, so take that into consideration before you buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrived on time, and was packaged well.</li>
            <li> Let me preface this with, I love this comb, so much that after reciving the first one I immediately ordered another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this comb looking for something portable mainly for my beard, and sometimes hair. After reading about the smoothness of the teeth and durability I was sold on it. I have pretty thick hair and this functions just as intended and without scratching my skin, all while looking classy. I also find the spacing of the teeth perfect if I&#x27;m combing my hair down with product, such as Suavecito Pomade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only real (and minor) gripe I have about this comb is the clip and the rivet, as others have noted as the swivel motion of the comb becomes less stiff the rivet moves around more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dimensions:&lt;br /&gt;Total Unfolded Length: 6 1/2&amp;#34; - 16.5cm&lt;br /&gt;Comb Length: 3 1/4&amp;#34;  - 8.2cm&lt;br /&gt;Folded Length: 3 5/8&amp;#34; - 9.2cm</li>
            <li> Its a good comb. Gets the job done my face is combed now. They should really think about fixing the lettering on it. Ive had it for literally a day and a 3rd of  the writing is gone. I know thats not too important. You can run a fingernail over it and it scratches away. That makes it feel cheap. They should do same design but in a metal give some weight id buy that. Ilike that it folds.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he LOVES it! I find him using it ALL the time! He loves the clip on the comb cause he doesn&#x27;t lose it that way. He also said that the comb doesn&#x27;t pull his hair. We strongly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok comb.  Little clip is flimsy and swivels around, pretty pointless.  The comb is ok as far as a comb goes.</li>
            <li> This comb is just what I wanted. It is very compact and I can carry it in my shirt pocket every day.</li>
            <li> This comb is the end all be all...but seriously what else do you want in a pocket comb? I use it for my beard and it&#x27;s perfect. Really good quality and it&#x27;s a nice and slim design. Very lightweight too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stop read reviews and just buy it.</li>
            <li> Works great, very compact. The one thing I don&#x27;t like is that the clip easily rotates. I don&#x27;t use the clip, but it&#x27;s annoying when I pull it out of my bag and it&#x27;s sticking out sideways. So you have to adjust clip before you can use the comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it&#x27;s a comb.</li>
            <li> Nice small folding comb. It easily fits in my pocket and is well made. I usually carry it with me everyday and forget its there until I reach into my pocket. I don&#x27;t always use the clip it depends on what type of pants I&#x27;m wearing and what&#x27;s in my pockets. But when I do it comes in hand and is fitted to the comb firmly. I mainly got this comb for a beard I&#x27;ve been growing for 3 months now. The comb is very smooth and does not scratch my face at all.  It does a good job at keeping it neat but after a few minutes of combing it gathers a static charge and starts to curl my hair. So I don&#x27;t comb it very long. When I use it to comb the hair on my head it does a great job of smoothing it out. I have less of a problem with static when I use it on my head, possible do to my hair being smoother there then it is on my face. Overall I&#x27;m happy with this purchase and the clip is a nice feature on an even nicer comb.</li>
            <li> This comb is perfect. It doesn&#x27;t break when its in my pocket, it folds, and it impresses the ladies. Seriously, I whip this thing out and all the ladies start to swoon. Also, I like that it combs really smooth. Way better feel than those cheap Ace combs (which are also not bad).</li>
            <li> Perfect beard comb.  folds up small, fits nicely in pocket and has fine teeth for a good untangling of curly beard hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought a 2nd one after losing first one.</li>
            <li> I received this comb on the 19th which was a little earlier than expected. It is a very nice quality comb. I knew the dimensions before ordering it but it seems smaller in my hand. I have several Kent combs and all are well made and feel lovely in the hand. They are smooth on the scalp as well. This is a great pocket comb and I plan to give it to my son.</li>
            <li> I bought it for a friend and he uses it 24/7. Great product. I would definitely buy this again for someone who has a beard</li>
            <li> Great comb, super convenient! I love it!</li>
            <li> Best comb I own, perfect for combing in beard oil into my beard after using a coarse comb to detangle.</li>
            <li> Very well made comb, folds up small enough to fit in a pocket.  Teeth are rounded so they don&#x27;t poke your scalp.  Only issue I had was that the pocket clip would constantly spin and eventually broke off at the rivet (so no sharp pieces).  I never used the clip so never bothered me.  If lost would buy another!</li>
            <li> Works great and is more durable than I thought it&#x27;d be.</li>
            <li> Worked great! Only drawback is that the clip loosened after a day or two. Some super glue should fix it though.</li>
            <li> I use this for my beard. I now take this with me everywhere I go. Its not too big and its not too small.</li>
            <li> This is great collapsible comb for my moustache. This is the second one I&#x27;ve had after losing the first.  Great quality.</li>
            <li> I have own this type of comb for least  25to30 years always have been satisfy with it specifically for is compactness and long  lasting thank you</li>
            <li> This is a nice comb. I like it a lot. When folded, it is small enough to forget about. When extended, the toothed portion is long enough to do as you need it to. I partly expected the designer to sacrifice functionality for compactness, but it is just right.&lt;br /&gt;Some other reviewers noted that the clip loosens over time. I have not experienced this yet, but I fully expect to. I can certainly see how the clip would/will loosen, and have apprehensively tested out the status of the clip by pushing on it a little bit. Once that part does go, I&#x27;ll probably just buy another one. That&#x27;s the only real design flaw that I can think of.</li>
            <li> As described and delivered on time.</li>
            <li> Just big enough for a small to medium sized beard. Fits in your poccket and it feels to be good quality.</li>
            <li> I purchased this comb for the hubby a bit over a year ago, and it is still in perfect condition! No broken or chipped teeth. This is definitely a quality product and I would not hesitate to purchase further combs from this company.</li>
            <li> My very particular and not easily impressed husband loves this comb I gave him.  I&#x27;ve actually heard him telling people about how sturdy it is when all of his others would break in his pocket.</li>
            <li> Kent combs are amazing this my second one loved my kent combs OT so much I needed a comb for my truck. Keeps my big Beard neat without destroying it</li>
            <li> Great product! I use it every day and it never fails to get the job done.</li>
            <li> Always good with Kent</li>
            <li> my husband loved the craftsmanship and quality of this Comb!</li>
            <li> smaller that I expected which is not bad.  Smooth teeth.  Great hinge.  My only complain is the clip...to difficult so I just keep it in my front right pocket.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my beard when I was growing it out. Great handy comb, sturdy and I like how it folds so you can put it in your pocket.</li>
            <li> Quality comb but I recommend the larger one. Your hair gets caught in the folding joint and tears out... Ouch! Other wise a nice product</li>
            <li> I look like a villain in a movie. It doesn&#x27;t get much better than pulling out a folding pocket comb in front of other people.</li>
            <li> The first day I had this the clip broke off. I didn&#x27;t feel like returning it so I still use it daily. Everything else is fine, but I can&#x27;t imagine that the clip would last long for anyone.</li>
            <li> It could of been a little bigger</li>
            <li> Perfect beard comb. I saw it advertised in several websites specializing in beard grooming products in the UK. Amazon had a better price and shipping time. Packaging and comb are original (I purchased it before while in England). Love it!</li>
            <li> This folding comb is perfect for my pocket. Its sturdy and looks neat. I have been asked by several people where to get on</li>
            <li> This comb is unlike any other--it is well (hand)made, which I am very appreciative for, and just the right size!  It is actually made of tortoise.  It is the perfect size to carry with you anywhere.  Get this comb to ensure your hair is always looking right!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a comb that felt so smooth on my scalp and combed my hair so easily.  Is it also the  most expensive comb I have purchased, yes by a long shot.  But I cannot complain about the price as it is obvious that the quality and construction is far beyond what I&#x27;d always used before.</li>
            <li> Folds to about 3 1/2&amp;#34; and is less than 1/2&amp;#34; thick. Clip is nice and tight, and sits low in the pocket.  I appreciate not having the rest of the riff-raff in my pocket rub up against the comb&#x27;s teeth when folded - more sanitar I suppose.  Suprisingly light, but sturdy, and it leaves hair feeling great - my wife wants one of her own now.  Will be carrying this with me everyday.</li>
            <li> It folds, it&#x27;s well built, and great for the hair on your head and the hair on your face. I&#x27;ll comb product through my hair and comb beard balm into my beard with this, and it&#x27;s awesome. I don&#x27;t really take it with me anywhere, but I imagine when I pack up and going out of town it&#x27;ll take up a negligible amount of space in my dopp kit!</li>
            <li> Nice comb doesn&#x27;t hurt while combing. Nice design.</li>
            <li> I order it for my boyfriend and he loves it he him nor I ever write reviews but he made me haha but he said product is great came quick it was a little bit smaller than he expected but he really likes the size of it perfect for a shirt pocket though, he uses for his beard and he says it is very smooth and gentle on his face now he wants the beard oil and other combs and brushes but overall very good quality and great product thanks will be ordering something else!</li>
            <li> Every other comb wishes it was this comb. This comb PERFECTLY tames my beard in a matter of seconds. The person responsible for this comb being made available for sale should receive an immediate promotion!!!</li>
            <li> Can easily be carried in a pocket all day everyday. I carry it for my beard maintenance. It&#x27;s nice and sturdy, well made. It also looks classy as hell.</li>
            <li> I never thought a comb could be awesome, I was so wrong. This is a really nice quality. I can tell it will last a lifetime. I bought it for my beard and mustache.</li>
            <li> Bought this comb to keep my beard tamed at work. Works great but the only downfall is from a distance it looks like a knife. Been getting a lot of looks when I have been playing with it  lol</li>
            <li> The quality is phenomenal and the convenience of the folding action is really a lifesaver for when I need to fix my hair on the go. I highly recommend this product if you need a small comb for work or travel.</li>
            <li> Cool comb ,very compact and seems durable. I dont prefer using it much because its to fine .</li>
            <li> My bf loves this face comb</li>
            <li> Stylish and convenient which fits nicely in any button up chest pocket.  A gentleman&#x27;s comb.  I use it on my beard as well.  Light strokes reduce any entanglement.</li>
            <li> Overall good comb, but the clip was very weak and snapped off after several weeks. I never used the clip tho so it did not affect me.</li>
            <li> I love the quality and the feel of the comb overall! Would definitely recommend this! BTW I use it for my beard and it is awesome</li>
            <li> I really like the design and build quality, however the clip popped off the first day I got it. Not a big deal though.</li>
            <li> This is a great comb that is well made.  It has withstood countless openings and folding, and the clip is durable.</li>
            <li> Clip broke off within a week of having it and now it swings open in my pocket all the time. Other then that its a nice comb.</li>
            <li> works well, looks nice, convenient for on the go.  Got it for my husband and he likes it a lot.  Sturdy, good quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m half bald and this comb is a little too small.  As others have said, the comb is initially very tight and difficult to open.  I will be going with the Ace combs from CVS in the future.</li>
            <li> I may have to get more of these as gifts. My husband loves it -keeps it in his car or backpack for the occasional refreshing of his beard, which otherwise is a tangled mess. Doesn&#x27;t catch and seems pretty sturdy. Very well made comb -way better than most folding/switchblade combs I have checked out.</li>
            <li> Pretty classy comb. Sometimes it&#x27;s hard to get open if your hands are wet or damp.</li>
            <li> really nice comb. i use it purley for my beard. only reason i did not give 5 stars is because folding and unfolding it is a little tough. overall though. great compact comb.</li>
            <li> My husbands favorite go to comb!</li>
            <li> Great product.  I use this primarily for my beard, but it&#x27;s a great hair comb as well.  I don&#x27;t use the clip often and it has loosened a bit over time but it hasn&#x27;t failed in the past six months or so.  Very compact yet has an overall sturdy feel.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be buying another down the road.</li>
            <li> It was bought as a gift. It is absolutely wonderful. He loved it and so did the guy who stole it. I recommend buying this comb, but keep it safe!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for about 1 month now and it&#x27;s held up nicely. Fits perfectly in my front pant pocket and combs my hair, what else can I say? It&#x27;s a sweet comb!</li>
            <li> Not only will this pen make you look like a boss when you whip it out of your pocket, but it also makes a great beard comb in a pinch. The clip is sturdy and pocket friendly. Other&#x27;s have complained that the clip is prone to getting loose but I&#x27;ve had no problems with that since I take care of my things. Anyways, the comb is solid, just a straight chunk of wood that they saw cut with precision to make the teeth. What that means for you is it is extremely sturdy and there are no cheap microscopic plastic molds like the cheap 99 cents store stuff that will actually rip at the micro-follicles of your hair, leaving you with split ends and whatnot. In other words, you are paying for a high-quality comb with a nice set of teeth, great clip, and switchblade home base to rest the actual comb when not in use. Comes packaged neatly.</li>
            <li> I had a bag of cheap combs I got for a couple of dollars, and I figured that would work just as well as this one. For some unknown reason, my hair always turns out better when I use the Kent comb! It&#x27;s super handsome, and definitely well built, so I&#x27;m pretty happy with the purchase. Go on, spoil yourself with a $10 comb -- you won&#x27;t regret it</li>
            <li> Solid and compact for every day carry.  I&#x27;ve purchased several of these because I keep losing them, but it&#x27;s a must if you are going to stay stylish at all times :)</li>
            <li> I love it. I&#x27;m using it as a beard comb with beard balm. Works great.</li>
            <li> Now this is a great comb. It&#x27;s almost addicting to just sit there idly combing your beard. You need a comb if your trying to or just lazy and growing a beard of any length.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my husband, is small enough to fit in his pocket &amp; works great!</li>
            <li> Love this mini comb. Fits in my pocket so nicely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s decent, but I did note it is very stiff.. almost a struggle to open it. Works great on my mustache, but if you were hoping to use it on your beard and you have a kinky beard I&#x27;d skip it.</li>
            <li> In need of a comb? want something a little different here you go. i use it for a money clip and it keeps my hair and beard in line!</li>
            <li> Well made comb, that also looks stylish. It&#x27;s also small enough so I can easily carry it when travelling.  Overall, I am happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> i got this comb for styling my hair and as an exsessorie but it is the best comb so fine and dosent hurt my heat best comb ever.</li>
            <li> Love this comb. Bought for travelling/upgrading my grooming kit and it&#x27;s awesome. Small but big enough to do the job for me. Recommended!</li>
            <li> Use it all the time. Sturdy and reliable. A lot smaller than some people might think though, not for long hair.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this comb!!  Kent brand is the best for your hair.  I personally use this comb as a traveler and a daily carry comb.  I usually wear shirts with chest pockets and clip it in this pocket without a problem so far.  I also have a long beard that is what I primarily use this comb in and it alone is better than any other care product I&#x27;ve bought for it.&lt;br /&gt;I was iffy about the size of this comb and if it was big enough to work for my beard but I figured I&#x27;d try it anyway.  It is perfect!&lt;br /&gt;Folded: ~4 inches&lt;br /&gt;Open: ~7 inches&lt;br /&gt;Width: ~0.75 inches&lt;br /&gt;Tooth Depth: ~0.5 inches</li>
            <li> Good and all, but it&#x27;s hard to pull up to open.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a comb. It works as a comb should. It can fold. Hooray.</li>
            <li> Never before has a comb made me feel like such a bad a&amp;$! Flipping this baby open instantly increases my testosterone level. It&#x27;s a very well made comb and appears as though it&#x27;s going to last awhile. I was a bit worried that it would break at the hinge but it shows no signs of wear to this point ( after a couple months).</li>
            <li> Already Lost it, there is no way to keep it from falling the clip isn&#x27;t as convenient as you want it so i already dropped it somewhere</li>
            <li> Great product. Was a little tight to open and close at first but a put a drop of oil on the hinge and it works great now. Small and compact, I carry it in my coat pocket for my beard. Very well made by hand in England (not China).</li>
            <li> It is what it looks like: a high quality tortoise shell folding comb. The folding action was a bit stiff when I got it but it has freed up just fine now.</li>
            <li> Great comb, well made and very durable, lasted 2 years so far.</li>
            <li> This comb has yet to fail me after sitting in my work pocket after 3 months!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s kinda blemished now--understandably so with my being an industrial athlete--but otherwise works quite well. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The teeth are still all intact due to the protective folding too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m planning on replacing the rivet with a screw/post arrangement after it breaks, as the rivet has already loosened to where I don&#x27;t see it lasting two years under this abuse.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this comb and it was working great. The comb area is a little small but the comb is nicely made and feels great on my scalp and beard. The hinge part seems very solid, unlike some reviews I read on here. It is great construction only problem is it is very compact when you fold it up and I already lost it. I had it for about 2 days and immediately lost it. I was very disappointed, but went out and bought the full sized comb. I like it better because it is easier to comb, just not nearly as portable because it is massive.&lt;br /&gt;tl:dr the folding comb is great on the go ; the full sized kent is great at home and is easier to comb your hair and beard. If you are thinking about getting this comb go out and do it!</li>
            <li> I bough this for my boyfriend and it came super fast. I am super excited to give it to him in Christmas. I know he will love it !</li>
            <li> This is comb is very small and easily fits in any pocket.&lt;br /&gt;You dont have to worry about coins and keys damaging the pins because of the holster,its made from tough plastic and is really hard to damage.&lt;br /&gt;The comb itself is very small and its kinda hard to comb with such a small comb, but it depends on the person and the application (myself I use it for my bushy beard), but its just because of the size - I&#x27;m pretty happy with it!</li>
            <li> A cool folding comb and the comb part is nice. However the clip broke off within a few weeks of use (keeping it in my pocket). The clip is not very strong.</li>
            <li> Comb works great, even though you&#x27;re not told it&#x27;s designed with thinning hair in mind on Amazon until after you read the packaging once it gets to your house. No problem, though, it works well enough as a fine-tooth beard pocket comb. Wait, where did it go? First day I had it, it fell out of my pocket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked great while I had it, but I don&#x27;t plan on buying another. Reading through the reviews, it seems I&#x27;m not the only person who has had this happen to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product; but stick with the non-portable versions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wish I could rate this lower than 3 stars, but technically, the product worked fantastically. It&#x27;s the glaring oversight of it being so silky smooth and the clip being so weak, that causes it to glide out of your pocket almost as easily as the teeth glide through your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not buy this incredible product again.</li>
            <li> The comb itself has been great so far. It&#x27;s compact and has a great look and feel. The cheap metal clip broke about a week into using it. So now the comb falls to the bottom of my pocket.</li>
            <li> The manufacturing is spot on. But not made for thick beard hair.</li>
            <li> This is the best comb I&#x27;ve ever owned. It runs smoothly through my hair and feels great against my scalp. I&#x27;ll never buy Ace again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a lot smaller than I expected. The teeth are also narrower than I expected. I thought I would use this as a primary comb when I travel or am on vacation, but I think this is good enough really for just touch ups.</li>
            <li> it fits great in your pocket! i use it all the time when i need a quick hair fix and I&#x27;m away from a bathroom or my other combs.</li>
            <li> Loved it so much I ended up buying a spare!</li>
            <li> The handle is the same exact color as the comb so the picture makes it look better than it is. Altogether I&#x27;d suggest just going for another Kent comb of the same length, because the teeth aren&#x27;t as smooth as other Kent combs I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good quality, but for the money, I didn&#x27;t anticipate how small it would be.  For anyone with more than an inch or two of hair, or thick hair, it&#x27;s not very useful.  Also very tightly connected and difficult to open.  The quality is high, so I&#x27;ll probably buy a larger comb from the same company, but skip on this one.</li>
            <li> Good size! Comes in handy! Perfect for on the go</li>
            <li> My husbands favorite beard comb! He just recently got into growing out his beard &amp; he loves this comb! It really helps his beard look nice! He carries the comb in his pocket all the time!</li>
            <li> This is in my pocket at all times! Kent makes the best combs ever!</li>
            <li> I bought this comb a couple weeks ago and I love it. The fact that it folds is convenient and really cool. My only &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; if you can call it that, is the logo and print on the combing part itself wears off after a while. No big deal, I still love it.</li>
            <li> I really like this comb. It was a smaller than I expected but this is not a negative. It fits in my pants just fine. I love that it&#x27;s stiff. I got a larger foldable Kent comb and found that it was too loose to be able to comb my hair with. I use pomade in my hair and need the comb to go through my hair in one sweep. The larger kent comb got stuck and folded a bit. This comb is slick. Small. And feels really solid.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I lost this comb recently and miss it quite a bit. It is handy and I love that it folds.</li>
            <li> The 20T was a bit stiff at first but after about a week it opened fairly easily. The comb does not cause static; this was my only reason for ordering this product. It goes beyond simply not causing static though. The teeth glide through your facial hairs so smoothly without any tugging or scratching your skin. The clip is a little loose but I imagine when it inevitable falls off I will put a tiny nut and bolt through with some loctite so it can stay clipped in my front pocket.</li>
            <li> I feel like James Bond when I whip out my comb to groom my beard.. If James Bond where man enough to grow a beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sturdy, good product and plan on having it around for awhile. A good buy!</li>
            <li> Nice little comb. Fits in my back pocket and doesn&#x27;t bother me or get in the way. Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and is very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Love it. Bought one as a gift and one for myself.</li>
            <li> Stiff to open but stays put while in use, convenient and easy to access when clipped into place.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  The clip keeps me from losing it.  The gold lettering has begun to wear off but that&#x27;s not a concern to me.</li>
            <li> This pocket comb was cheap. The 188mm kent is amazing, but this one just doesn&#x27;t make the quality cut.</li>
            <li> I never really had any complaints about the cheap crappy plastic combs you can get all over the place, but I figured I&#x27;d give a nicer comb a shot. Now I can&#x27;t even use the junky plastic crap anymore. It works great on my hair, beard, and moustache, doesn&#x27;t pull on the hair at all, and lays each hair out perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason this is getting 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the clip. It&#x27;s loose, so it spins around too easily, and I can tell that at some point it will simply break off. My hope is that the rivet that holds the clip on as well as holds the comb together won&#x27;t break with it. That said, even if it does break I&#x27;ll be getting the same exact thing because the comb itself is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Important things to note about this comb:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Smaller comb, not full size&lt;br /&gt;2. All small teeth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great foldable comb, and it is perfect for mustaches and beards. I like the fact that it is a little stiff to open up, when it gets loose it feels cheaply made in my opinion. I never plan on buying another comb.</li>
            <li> I had been using a cheap comb until I got this and let me tell you that the quality of this comb has made a huge difference in the ease of combing my hair. It just works better. It&#x27;s also very cool looking. I&#x27;ll be buying a second one for my son.</li>
            <li> Product was awesome! A little stiff at first but nonetheless definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> Been using this for at least a weak, gotta say its by far the best comb I&#x27;ve ever purchased (the most expensive too but that&#x27;s not saying much). It&#x27;s quite durable and aesthetic. Being tender headed I&#x27;d recommend this over those cheapos scraping across your scalp. If it&#x27;ll last me a year I&#x27;ll be satisfied. Smart buy! Keep it in your back pocket!</li>
            <li> Very convenient, good construction. Wish the clip was removable so it was flatter in my pocket, but can&#x27;t complain!</li>
            <li> Great pocket comb, nice and sturdy and just the right size.</li>
            <li> i use this awesome comb on my majestic awe inspiring beard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very sturdy, perfectly sized pocket comb.</li>
            <li> This comb is very neat! I love to use it on my toddlers hair! IT DOES NOT HURT HIS SCALP LIKE THE OTHER COMBS DO! I think I&#x27;m going to buy another one for my boyfriend... and my dad... and my uncle... and my grandpa!!! ABSOLUTELY LOVE HOW IT CAN FOLD AND THEREFORE IT&#x27;S A POCKET COMB!!!! Thank you for hand making this! Thank you :) XOXO</li>
            <li> Great portable, comfortable comb to keep in your pocket. Like others have said, the rivet does kind of loosen up over time, not to the point where the comb itself is unusable though.</li>
            <li> I have been carrying this comb with me everyday for about 8 months now and it is still a very nice comb. Originally, I kept it in my front pants pocket but it would ride up after sitting and standing a few times. I have found that my back pocket is the best place for this comb. I don&#x27;t even know it&#x27;s there until I need it. This comb even smells good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint that I have with this comb (and really is not that big of a deal for me) is that the clip, which I don&#x27;t use anyway, over time will start to rotate. Other than that I have no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great comb. I use it for my head and beard.</li>
            <li> my beard is loving this</li>
            <li> I love the size of the Kent 20T Folding Comb and carry one all the time unless I&#x27;m wearing a shirt without a breast pocket.  It works well as a comb, is just the right size for a pocket comb and looks elegant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue with the 20T is the use of a single rivet to attach the pocket clip.  I&#x27;ve owned three 20T combs, and with each one, after a few months of normal use, the pocket clip rivet will loosen to the point that it lets the clip rotate.  If this happens, and you don&#x27;t notice it, it is possible for the comb to fall out of your shirt pocket and possible be lost.  I&#x27;m very aware of the possibility of the clip rotating, and I&#x27;m on my third 20T because I lost the two previous ones because of the clip rotating, and letting the comb fall. A tiny redesign using a slightly longer clip and TWO rivets would easily solve the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still use the 20T, and like it very much, but I&#x27;d LOVE it if the darn clip design was better engineered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually wonder if Kent is not already fully aware of this issue, but does not change the design, since every \\&quot;lost\\&quot; 20T probably will generate a sale of a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Planned obsolescence from a 235 year old British manufacturer - NAW, couldn&#x27;t happen.  :-)  We all know how totally reliable British cars like the Land Rover and the Jaguar are, and how Lucas Electrics never fail.  Oops! - NEVER MIND.</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend as an early Christmas gift for his beard. He loves it. He legit uses it every day and smiles every time. He keeps it in the car. It is very high quality and doesnt budge even with his huge beard!</li>
            <li> Great price for cool comb. Def get one, dont get caught using it all the time like me. People looks at you strange stroking the beard, oh well. Beard strong. -kb</li>
            <li> I love this comb for my beard. Its sturdy and classy. I will buy another one when I loose this one.</li>
            <li> It is a very nice comb, I like using it and the clip is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest problem is you really have to work out the motion to get it to open even slightly. My other problem is when I use it I usually have just wet my hair and therefore hands and then it is nearly impossible to open because it is so slippery!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a bad comb, but some practical issues should be worked on, like a nonstick grip or switch to open it.</li>
            <li> A classy comb for a classy man. Whether cleaning up for night on the town or for getting ready for a hard day at the saw mill, this comb will keep your mustache or beard out of your mouth and keep you looking fresh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve kept combs in my pocket for ages and they always get gunked up with fuzz and whatever happens to be in my pocket at the time. Now I can keep it in my pocket without worrying about fuzz and what not getting stuck in the bristles of the brush. It won&#x27;t pop open in your pocket either, it takes a reasonable amount of force to get it to open. It also has a clip on the side, which is handy because who wants a comb to be in the same pocket as dirty change/money? Clip it on your belt or pocket and you&#x27;re good to go. Kind of hard to remove from a belt or pocket though, which is both good and bad. Sure it wont get knocked off and lost, but it takes some effort to get it to come off and I worry that i may break it. That&#x27;s about the only real downfall to this comb, from now on I&#x27;ll stick with these rather than cheap-o dollar store combs. It has a nice, classy look to it as well instead of cheap plastic like most combs..</li>
            <li> Works great! Really nice for when I need to get protruding hairs of my beard back into the fold / mustache. Won&#x27;t substitute other combs for your beard that are in your arsenal that should be used before you step out of the house for work or social events.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You wanna get hand sawn combs because they dont cause split ends in your hair and your beard. Have a few of Kent&#x27;s combs in your arsenal are good or other hand sawn varieties. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Awesome comb except gold letters rub off fast only after couple uses. Also this is a small tooth not intended for longer large beards. Maybe just mustache.</li>
            <li> bought this for my bf on the go and for his beard.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this comb!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a new, avid convert to Kent combs and brushes, and now simply won&#x27;t use anything else. I now have the Large size 188m comb and the MN1B Gentlemen&#x27;s Hairbrush in my bathroom, the slightly smaller 182m comb in my travel kit, and bought this folding comb to carry around with me everywhere. Over the years, I can&#x27;t tell you how many \\&quot;unbreakable\\&quot; combs I&#x27;ve broken by carrying them in my pants pocket, so a folding comb seemed the perfect solution. In large part it has been as having it closed in my pocket clearly protects the teeth and reduces the bulk. And of course its a Kent, so it feels great in my hair. My only issue is that I wish the comb itself was just a bit larger. I&#x27;d live with one taking up a bit more pocket space in exchange for not feeling like I was using a beard &amp; mustache comb on my hair. This size is great when you just need to touch-up a spot, but to me seems just a little small when you need to re-groom on the go. That said, I&#x27;m still not giving this one up, unless/until Kent makes a larger folding comb!</li>
            <li> Update: It&#x27;s been 2 1/2 years since I bought this comb. Still have it, use it daily and is still perfect.</li>
            <li> Perfect! My husband loved it!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing comb.  High quality handmade comb from England.  Best thing I like is the fact that it folds up small and clips so you can pocket carry.  No more broke or lost combs.</li>
            <li> This is my backup in case I forget the Swissco comb. Both are good a value and do the job.</li>
            <li> the Kent 20T Folding Comb is a comb that folds.  The quality is ok, it folds, and it combs hair like all other combs.</li>
            <li> Nice comb when on the GO love it!!!!</li>
            <li> a little small than I think</li>
            <li> Does not rough up skin under beard like other cheap combs.  Worth the price just for that alone.  Feels like it&#x27;s easier on the hair as well.  Clip may move out of place, but will go back.  Pretty durable so far as well.</li>
            <li> Words faded and clamp moves other than that great pocket comb!</li>
            <li> Person receiving the gift was pleased.</li>
            <li> i purchased this come because my hair is quite long and does get tangled when im out and about. this folding pocket come is a bit on the small side,but it does a nice job,it does not hurt my scalp. 5 stars for its sturdy construction 1 star for its small size. still i recommend it to anyone with long hair that can&#x27;t be tamed by running your fingers through it and need a small but effective comb. could be a bit bigger?</li>
            <li> Nice quality comb, great for the handlebar mustache I am growing out. I used it in the beard and there it does provide a bit of static. Other than that I would have given it a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> This little folding comb is perfect for keeping my beard tame.  The hinge has held up well.  The letters wore off after a day of use but I don&#x27;t really care about that.</li>
            <li> the comb has a nice compact size, but I found the length of the comb&#x27;s teeth to be too short for combing my beard.</li>
            <li> Great comb, use it on my beard almost daily. Took one star away because the clip is very fragile and the labeling on the comb started fading on the first week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, I would like to see a more premium version of this comb. With a better clip and made of stronger materials.</li>
            <li> Good looking comb, but mine is very stiff could hardly get it open when its fold, and the clip feels almost going to break.</li>
            <li> Great little comb, more of an accessory than grooming product when it comes to styling non-facial hair.</li>
            <li> Tight joint, good build quality, certainly don&#x27;t anticipate seeing this break any time soon. Just a good simple comb for a great price.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect pocket comb. It is sturdy and well made. I wouldn&#x27;t have any problem spending $15-$20 on this if I had too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be carrying this everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear my hair longer on top and slicked back or side parted. This comb works perfectly for this style.</li>
            <li> Very fragile. Designed for shirt pocket, on pant pockets. The clip on mine fell off in the first week of owning it.</li>
            <li> Good comb for the money. I like how fine the teeth are. Very portable with the belt clip.</li>
            <li> Compact (fits in any pocket without me realizing it). Strong and well made comb. However the gold writing did wear off after a few days of use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a switchblade...everyone asks me that - well it&#x27;s not.  What it IS, is an elegant yet modern tool for slappin those whiskers into formation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comb clips onto your back pocket that raises your style level to \\&quot;alpha\\&quot; and is a little stubborn to get out of the folding position at first...I attribute this to the rugged and firm build of the Kent 20T...better than the rest of the products nowadays that are made cheaper than Lindsay Lohan&#x27;s mom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know those douchebags that can only grow chin hair that looks like someone spread grass seed on their dirt lawn instead of having a lush, yard full of sod?  They don&#x27;t buy these.  That hip cat at the end of the cul-de-sac buys this...and his yard takes huge dumps on the prior&#x27;s yard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go with the Kent T20 and yard-dump m&#x27;man...go ahead and yard dump.  rawr.</li>
            <li> Best comb I&#x27;ve ever owned, I use it to keep my burly beard in check. The lettering on the comb wore off in the first day, which seemed a little cheap but the comb itself is solid and sturdy and I expect will last for years. It also fits perfectly in the little pocket inside your right jeans pocket so it&#x27;s been with me all the time since I bought it.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice, and well made comb. Good for use on Mustaches and Beards. Would diffently recommend this.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done, but is a little stiff to open and close. It might loosen up with use and time though.</li>
            <li> This comb folds. And its color is tortoise-shell. That makes it a man&#x27;s comb. I bet the guy from the Dos Equis commercials strokes his head with a Kent 20T. The teeth are very judiciously spaced. Its well constructed, light, and folds to easily fit in a front or back pocket. And its damn good at combing my hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband. He decided to grow his beard out and I wanted to get him something nice he could take with him out and about. He loves it! I&#x27;m glad I got this for him!</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s got a buzz cut these days. I prefer some class. A little pomade and this bad boy keeps me looking good all day long! Especially useful after the gym so I don&#x27;t have to bring my other Kent comb with me all the time.</li>
            <li> Good comb and worth the price.</li>
            <li> Wonderful idea and great quality!</li>
            <li> Received item quickly and as described, thanks!</li>
            <li> Great little pocket comb. Use it for my beard.</li>
            <li> I loved the 12T so much I had to get it&#x27;s baby brother for my pocket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No problems with the rivet, but will update if I do.</li>
            <li> While this comb is perfect for beard trimming it does come a little loose after just a few weeks of normal wear and tear. Overall a good purchase and very useful. Would recommend and purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great quality folding comb except it&#x27;s small size made it easy to misplace. My husband used it as a beard and mustache comb and he loved it and really misses it.</li>
            <li> This comb is great if you want to have a small pocket comb on you for minor work. The section of the teeth is 3 inches long. Also, if you have thick or longer hair it isn&#x27;t that great. It will squeeze the pomade out of your hair. The build quality is nice and my clip has stayed tight but it rotates easily so that you will usually have to readjust the clip before use. I would buy another comb from the same company but not this particular model.</li>
            <li> Great comb but thought would be bigger.</li>
            <li> Decent comb, however it is very stiff when you first receive it. It was extremely difficult to unfold the first several times until it loosened up.</li>
            <li> This comb is great and is easy on the beard.  I have been using it for a few months now and it still folds and extends like new.  I use this comb multiple times a day and is the perfect size to keep in your pocket for work/travel.</li>
            <li> Awesome comb, American made by hand, works great for my thick beard.</li>
            <li> Every time I go thru a checkpoint, They want to inspect this.</li>
            <li> Great quality comb, perfect for my mustache.</li>
            <li> A amazing product&lt;br /&gt;I am in love with the design and the material it was made with&lt;br /&gt;Very smooth and stylish</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given this comb as gifts and its is always appreciated.  They say it is great!</li>
            <li> Great product, came when stated.</li>
            <li> This comb fits nicely in a breasts pocket and is also made very well. I take it with me everywhere.</li>
            <li> Purchased two, one became very sloppy after opening and closing a half dozen times.</li>
            <li> The teeth aren&#x27;t sharp, which is EXACTLY what you want when you&#x27;re running through your beard. This gets rid of tangles, and folds away for easy storage in my pocket. Plus it&#x27;s just stylish enough. My only gripe is that the brass clip came loose and was rotating. I glued it back into place, but now it&#x27;s not as nice looking.</li>
            <li> easy to carry for mustache and beard grooming!........</li>
            <li> My 23 year old bearded nephew LOVES this thing. It carries it with him to comb his beard and mustache.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted &amp; I reommend it to anyone who wants to carry a small comb in his shirt pocket.</li>
            <li> Very good quality comb, I bought a few different kent models to give as gifts. I do favor the swissco brand, but these are very very nice, however they may be a bit stiff when folding the first few times. I think it will losen up over time. They make very nice gifts. Did I already say that? If price is no object, get these instead of the cheap stuff you find everywhere.</li>
            <li> The folding action is a bit stiff in the beginning but it will break in nicely.  The pocket clip is a bit weak and feels like it might break off if not treated with care.  In fact, it might be a better idea to eschew using the pocket clip altogether.  The actual horizontal length of the run of teeth shouldn&#x27;t be a surprise after reading the measurements, but the functionality of the teeth height was somewhat surprising in real use.  The short length of the teeth (vertically) means that it won&#x27;t run through all of your hair as nicely if you have longer hair (the top of my hair is approximately 3&amp;#34;), but still works decently well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, the tips of the comb are what you would expect from Kent (assuming that this is not your first Kent product).  They are smooth, do not scratch your scap, and feel nice.  And at the end of the day, this is the best pocket comb on the market circa early 2015.</li>
            <li> smaller than we expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m growing a Yeard and I needed a portable hand made comb to be able to groom my mane on the go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I love Kent combs, don&#x27;t even considerer cheap options it&#x27;ll only hurt you, your beard and maybe your ego...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received this, I immediately felt like a rockstar. This little comb is awesome, looks awesome and feels awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be surprise, it is SMALL, but that&#x27;s the whole point.&lt;br /&gt;Clip it to your favorite shirt or your pair of jeans and be ready to proudly groom your awesome beard or stach everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hand made comb will glide into the hair without hurting or pulling and will leave you with a fresh groomed appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t feel like Tom Hanks in Cast Away, order this little guy and always feel like a manly Rockstar.</li>
            <li> Everyday carry for me and while the Kent lettering has worn off the comb is still going strong, looks great too.</li>
            <li> Great comb, you really do start to realize how soft it feels on your head. Kind of expensive though. I lost mine by accident and I can&#x27;t really justify buying another one.</li>
            <li> This comb has held up so far against murrays in my thick rope strength hair. So I guess it is practically indestructible.</li>
            <li> Not the greatest quality but a novel idea.</li>
            <li> Shorter than expected but still useful</li>
            <li> Beautifully designed. Makes a simple product look very elegant. Most def. worth the purchase. The price is a small amount to pay for such a product.</li>
            <li> Made to what seems to be the usual Kent high standards. Don&#x27;t care for the pocket clip, but this is just an aesthetic observation.</li>
    </ol>
