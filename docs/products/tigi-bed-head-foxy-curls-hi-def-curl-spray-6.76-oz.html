            <li>Love this product!!!</li>
            <li>I ordered this online because it was a great bargain compared to the salons in town.  </li>
            <li>All of the Foxy Curls products are great and now that I&#x27;ve tried them, I&#x27;ll never use anything else.</li>
            <li>This stuff makes my curls look great and stay that way.</li>
            <li>The hair spray work great</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Great service and price.  </li>
            <li>My curly hair is very, very, VERY fine, and this spray creates the perfect level of definition, hold, and volume.  </li>
            <li>However, I just tried Foxy Curls Hi-Def Curl Spray after a shower and it is amazing!</li>
            <li>Smells good though.</li>
            <li>This product has been one of my favorites to use and it smells really good</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice that it did anything to help or to hurt my curly hair - it&#x27;s a good spray to spray on after shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Considering the price of this product, you would expect it to work exceptionally well.</li>
            <li>I was very appreciative of the care the seller took to make sure the bottle didn&#x27;t leak in transit.</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>Good results most of the time</li>
            <li>The whole line of Foxy Curls products is the best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used!!</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>It does not leave my hair sticky. :)</li>
            <li>Then, as luck would have it, I&#x27;ve never been able to find it in any store since...figures.</li>
            <li>Through the years, I&#x27;ve tried countless products and this line works wonderfully for me!!!</li>
            <li>My hair has pretty, nicely defined \\&quot;waves\\&quot; and it&#x27;s not frizzy at all!</li>
            <li>It works on my finer hair to make it look like I have better hair.</li>
            <li>This was just okay.</li>
            <li>Love this product - encourages wavy and curly hair to do more.</li>
            <li>I take out many, MANY strands of hair.</li>
            <li>The product has a fruity smell, but it&#x27;s more like lemongrass to me</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I tried it again after some mishaps with the line--</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I have never found a better product.</li>
            <li>They look pretty good until you touch them...</li>
            <li>Kinda pricey but worth it to have a happy wife with pretty hair :)</li>
            <li>let it sit under my bathroom sink because I don&#x27;t like to throw a full bottle away--blame it on my Scottish heritage--and after a sufficient amount of time based on NOTHING, throw it away!</li>
            <li>Received very quickly.</li>
            <li>when there is overspray, which is easy to have happen.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately I was able to find all the Foxy Curls products for a price much lower than even the clearence price at the store!!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!!</li>
            <li>I love that we can get this so much cheaper on Amazon.com!</li>
            <li>and then it&#x27;s absolutely perfect, but that&#x27;s probably due to how much hair I have.  </li>
            <li>It smelled sweet, but did nothing for my curls.</li>
            <li>On my fine, very curly hair this is a light holding, curl-encouraging spray.  </li>
            <li>I love the brand, but they don&#x27;t seem to be dishing out the same good old products.</li>
            <li>My hair is straight and fine.  </li>
            <li>Anyone with natural curl will know exactly where I&#x27;m coming from!!!</li>
            <li>, it looks great, then 10 minutes later it&#x27;s barely a wave.  </li>
            <li>Seems to keep the frizz down fairly well</li>
            <li>I use this with Tigi&#x27;s curl cream (have a review on here) and the two together are perfect for my thick, naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>This is the hair product I&#x27;ve been searching for my whole life!  </li>
            <li>Personally, I do not brush my hair before scrunching, so I can&#x27;t expect to be able to run my fingers through my hair, with or without this product.</li>
            <li>Great smell and can even be used on dry hair to rev it back up!</li>
            <li>I give it two stars because, unlike other reviewers, I kind of like the smell</li>
            <li>I will say that after I dry my hair, I have to throw in more curl cream and spray it again</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li>The bottle doesnt spray very well...</li>
            <li>She said it really helped to hold her curls.</li>
            <li>I have really curly hair but</li>
            <li>both hands push up on both sides of hair &amp; in back &amp; lightly scrunch or squeeze hair all over or where you need it.</li>
            <li>Made my hair very frizzy and straight.  </li>
            <li>I really like how this holds and makes my hair feel as well.  </li>
            <li>Gives some hold, but not too much.  </li>
            <li>Really helps pump up and fix the curls</li>
            <li>I love this stuff so much I&#x27;m looking into purchasing some of the other products in that line.</li>
            <li>I have extremely curly hair and love this product.</li>
            <li>In my case I spray , not to close &amp; minimally but all over with a little more at top.</li>
            <li>I discovered it for the first time this summer and was so surprised at how well my curls held.</li>
            <li>I live in TX and the humidity is very high here.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually mostly \\&quot;bend\\&quot; on the top and sides, and the  back is curls, but not super curly, just middle of the road, and it needs a boost to wear it curly.  </li>
            <li>certain products don&#x27;t look right or hold well enough.</li>
            <li>It was just like I bought it at a salon, as far as condition goes, but much cheaper.</li>
            <li>I use this product on my very thin, long hair and it works great!</li>
            <li>and it goes right back.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s good about the fragrances they use in their products is that the ones I tried, at least, don&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li>Tigi was great in the &#x27;90s for my crazy hair</li>
            <li>I cannot wear my hair natural curly without it.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy hair</li>
            <li>I have never been able to sleep on my curls and then have my hair down the next day, but with this product I can actually do that!</li>
            <li>Like a previous reviewer mentioned, I have good in between hair - not straight but not really curly.</li>
            <li>You have to be careful how much you use.  </li>
            <li>Wish I had not spent my $$.  </li>
            <li>To give my hair some extra volume, I flip my hair upside down and blow dry the top (since it doesn&#x27;t get very dry when diffusing).</li>
            <li>It comes out like a very thin spray gel and you will get crunchy curls with major hold, but my heavy hair goes flat on top without a spray and is sort of a hot mess, so I&#x27;d rather have perfectly separated ringlets that shine like crazy and are crunchy than flat, puffy hair.  </li>

            <li> Like a previous reviewer mentioned, I have good in between hair - not straight but not really curly.</li>
            <li> You have to be careful how much you use.  </li>
            <li> Wish I had not spent my $$.  </li>
            <li> To give my hair some extra volume, I flip my hair upside down and blow dry the top (since it doesn&#x27;t get very dry when diffusing).</li>
            <li> It comes out like a very thin spray gel and you will get crunchy curls with major hold, but my heavy hair goes flat on top without a spray and is sort of a hot mess, so I&#x27;d rather have perfectly separated ringlets that shine like crazy and are crunchy than flat, puffy hair.  </li>
            <li> And while it does control frizz, it&#x27;s like a volume vacuum.</li>
            <li> And as stated in my other Tigi review, I have major allergies to products--especially sprays--and no issues at all.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m stuck with DRY, straw-like hair until I shampoo my hair next.</li>
            <li> As much as I love the other Bed Head products, the tiniest amount left my hair crunchy and dirty looking.</li>
            <li> Much more expensive in stores, so this is the way to purchase!</li>
            <li> I have also used it when my hair is dry for a touch-up and that has worked well also.</li>
            <li> I spray it on my wet hair, scrunch with my hands, and then use my diffuser until completely dry.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle, hard to find in smaller cities, Amazon to the rescue!!</li>
            <li> I use it when my hair is wet, but not soaked.  </li>
            <li> I got this for my mom, who has naturally wavy thick hair.</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s dry, I fluff it a bit with my fingers or a pick at the roots and finish with a little Manipulator.  </li>
            <li> Like the other reviewer mentioned - waxy, sticky and I can&#x27;t run my fingers through my hair.  </li>
            <li> This does curl my hair, however if I need to touch up my hair later in the day and run a small brush or comb thru those curls.</li>
            <li> I use it when my hair is wet before diffusing it, and I also will use it when it&#x27;s dry to redefine or tame the curls/</li>
            <li> Usually, to avoid the stink I flat iron my hair every day to get a frizz-free look.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to find something that works for your hair, and not all products work the same for everyone.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about trying it but disappointed with how sticky it is - and it makes my hair look really dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to find in stores, so this is very convenient.</li>
            <li> No thanks!!</li>
            <li> Unlike other spray gels, this does make your hair crunchy!</li>
            <li> It makes your hair less frizzy and defines your curls without making your hair look greasy.</li>
            <li> It makes my curls a little curlier and helps to define them.  </li>
            <li> This spray makes my hair crunchy and stiff.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Product makes my hair stiff and frizzy</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t like the feel of stiff hairspray-ed hair.  </li>
            <li> Works well, but your hair gets stiff and sticky feeling, and I don&#x27;t like the feel of the spray on my skin (shoulders, face, etc.)</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t hold curl hardly at all.</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t bought this for years, I bought it because it was less expensive than in the stores.</li>
            <li> Plus, it adds volume for thin hair.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to keep messing with it, which just makes it frizzy and worse.  </li>
            <li> I use it almost every day and may be addicted!</li>
            <li> Basically, the title says it all---too gooey AND difficult to work with, and yes, I used the Contour Cream with it.  </li>
            <li> I hate to buy something, use it a few times,</li>
            <li> This product smells bad.</li>
            <li> Awful product.</li>
            <li> Horrible product!  </li>
            <li> It also smells terrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> works well but i dont like the smell</li>
            <li> I got this for my mom, who has naturally wavy thick hair. This made her wavy hair CURLY with the cutest ringlets you&#x27;d ever see. I HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Considering the price of this product, you would expect it to work exceptionally well. Unfortunately, it definitely doesn&#x27;t. I give it two stars because, unlike other reviewers, I kind of like the smell (I think it smells like Skittles,) and because it does define my curls and control frizz. They look pretty good until you touch them... This spray makes my hair crunchy and stiff. And while it does control frizz, it&#x27;s like a volume vacuum. I&#x27;ll probably finish the bottle just so I&#x27;m not wasting it, but I definitely won&#x27;t be buying another one.</li>
            <li> I ordered this online because it was a great bargain compared to the salons in town.  I was very appreciative of the care the seller took to make sure the bottle didn&#x27;t leak in transit. I will be buying this product again</li>
            <li> Love this product. Received very quickly.</li>
            <li> Good results most of the time</li>
            <li> I live in TX and the humidity is very high here. I have extremely curly hair and love this product. It does not leave my hair sticky. :)</li>
            <li> This product smells bad. It does not work. IT did not define my curls at all, hi def. or not. It&#x27;s JUST LIKE hairspray, which you can get anywhere with any brand. Now I&#x27;m stuck with DRY, straw-like hair until I shampoo my hair next. Awful product.</li>
            <li> It was just like I bought it at a salon, as far as condition goes, but much cheaper. I&#x27;ll definitely continue to order it.</li>
            <li> The bottle doesnt spray very well...&lt;br /&gt;Product makes my hair stiff and frizzy</li>
            <li> As much as I love the other Bed Head products, the tiniest amount left my hair crunchy and dirty looking. NEVER again!</li>
            <li> Just bought this for my wife. It smells like skittles. She said it really helped to hold her curls. She doesn&#x27;t wash her hair every day and this seems to do the trick. She will just touch up her curls in the morning with this and they last all day for several days. Kinda pricey but worth it to have a happy wife with pretty hair :)</li>
            <li> The whole line of Foxy Curls products is the best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used!! I bought some last year at the local Wal*Mart to try it out. All the Foxy Curls products were on clearence. I couldn&#x27;t believe how great it made my hair look and feel!! Plus, it smells wonderful!! Then, as luck would have it, I&#x27;ve never been able to find it in any store since...figures. Fortunately I was able to find all the Foxy Curls products for a price much lower than even the clearence price at the store!! It&#x27;s so hard to find something that works for your hair, and not all products work the same for everyone. Anyone with natural curl will know exactly where I&#x27;m coming from!!! Through the years, I&#x27;ve tried countless products and this line works wonderfully for me!!! All of the Foxy Curls products are great and now that I&#x27;ve tried them, I&#x27;ll never use anything else. Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> I have really curly hair but certain products don&#x27;t look right or hold well enough. This stuff makes my curls look great and stay that way. Smells great too!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! Like a previous reviewer mentioned, I have good in between hair - not straight but not really curly. And, definitely frizzy! Usually, to avoid the stink I flat iron my hair every day to get a frizz-free look. However, I just tried Foxy Curls Hi-Def Curl Spray after a shower and it is amazing! My hair has pretty, nicely defined \\&quot;waves\\&quot; and it&#x27;s not frizzy at all! I personally like the smell of the product too. I love this stuff so much I&#x27;m looking into purchasing some of the other products in that line.</li>
            <li> Will keep buying it from Amazon!!!! Price and shipping was wonderful! Thank you</li>
            <li> Love this product!!! It makes your hair less frizzy and defines your curls without making your hair look greasy. Plus, it adds volume for thin hair.</li>
            <li> It works on my finer hair to make it look like I have better hair. In my case I spray , not to close &amp; minimally but all over with a little more at top. Immediatelytake both hands push up on both sides of hair &amp; in back &amp; lightly scrunch or squeeze hair all over or where you need it. Thats it.  This is my second bottle, hard to find in smaller cities, Amazon to the rescue!!</li>
            <li> This was just okay. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again. I was really excited about trying it but disappointed with how sticky it is - and it makes my hair look really dry. Seems to keep the frizz down fairly well but my hair felt and looked like straw. No thanks!!</li>
            <li> Love this product - encourages wavy and curly hair to do more. Great smell and can even be used on dry hair to rev it back up!</li>
            <li> Horrible product!  I bought this at Target for $15 and wish I could get my money back.  Made my hair very frizzy and straight.  Like the other reviewer mentioned - waxy, sticky and I can&#x27;t run my fingers through my hair.  It also smells terrible.</li>
            <li> The hair spray work great</li>
            <li> My hair is middle of the road curly.  It&#x27;s actually mostly \\&quot;bend\\&quot; on the top and sides, and the  back is curls, but not super curly, just middle of the road, and it needs a boost to wear it curly.  I don&#x27;t know why it doesn&#x27;t work for some people, but it does work for me.  I cannot wear my hair natural curly without it.  It makes my curls a little curlier and helps to define them.  I don&#x27;t think it is at all like hairspray.  You have to be careful how much you use.  I use it when my hair is wet, but not soaked.  When it&#x27;s dry, I fluff it a bit with my fingers or a pick at the roots and finish with a little Manipulator.  Voila!  I have also used it when my hair is dry for a touch-up and that has worked well also.</li>
            <li> On my fine, very curly hair this is a light holding, curl-encouraging spray.  I use it almost every day and may be addicted!</li>
            <li> My hair is straight and fine.  I curl it, it looks great, then 10 minutes later it&#x27;s barely a wave.  I could spray a ton of hairspray but I don&#x27;t like the feel of stiff hairspray-ed hair.  This stuff is awesome for holding the curl in my hair while still leaving it manageable.</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t hold curl hardly at all. But this helps hold my hair. And if I ever feel like it&#x27;s falling, I just spritz it again and then scrunch it back up with my hand and it goes right back.</li>
            <li> All it did was make my hair stick together. Didn&#x27;t do anything for my curls. I won&#x27;t purchase it again</li>
            <li> Works well, but your hair gets stiff and sticky feeling, and I don&#x27;t like the feel of the spray on my skin (shoulders, face, etc.) when there is overspray, which is easy to have happen.  I don&#x27;t think I will buy this again.  Smells good though.</li>
            <li> It smelled sweet, but did nothing for my curls. At. All. Would not purchase ever again. I love the brand, but they don&#x27;t seem to be dishing out the same good old products.</li>
            <li> I really like how this holds and makes my hair feel as well.  Will buy again and again!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I discovered it for the first time this summer and was so surprised at how well my curls held. I have naturally wavy hair and sometimes I like to do my hair curly for laziness reasons. This product has been one of my favorites to use and it smells really good which is a bonus!</li>
            <li> This does curl my hair, however if I need to touch up my hair later in the day and run a small brush or comb thru those curls. I take out many, MANY strands of hair. Hurts too. I would stick with the Rusk mousse for curls.</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t bought this for years, I bought it because it was less expensive than in the stores. it was okay\</li>
            <li> I use this with Tigi&#x27;s curl cream (have a review on here) and the two together are perfect for my thick, naturally curly hair.  It comes out like a very thin spray gel and you will get crunchy curls with major hold, but my heavy hair goes flat on top without a spray and is sort of a hot mess, so I&#x27;d rather have perfectly separated ringlets that shine like crazy and are crunchy than flat, puffy hair.  The product has a fruity smell, but it&#x27;s more like lemongrass to me so I don&#x27;t mind it.  I&#x27;m just using these two products and diffusing my hair, so I&#x27;m saving some time (and money) and I don&#x27;t have to keep messing with it, which just makes it frizzy and worse.  I will say that after I dry my hair, I have to throw in more curl cream and spray it again and then it&#x27;s absolutely perfect, but that&#x27;s probably due to how much hair I have.  And as stated in my other Tigi review, I have major allergies to products--especially sprays--and no issues at all.  Tigi was great in the &#x27;90s for my crazy hair and I&#x27;m glad I tried it again after some mishaps with the line--I think I got my foxy back.</li>
            <li> This is the hair product I&#x27;ve been searching for my whole life!  My curly hair is very, very, VERY fine, and this spray creates the perfect level of definition, hold, and volume.  And is smells like Air Heads.</li>
            <li> Basically, the title says it all---too gooey AND difficult to work with, and yes, I used the Contour Cream with it.  Wish I had not spent my $$.  I hate to buy something, use it a few times, let it sit under my bathroom sink because I don&#x27;t like to throw a full bottle away--blame it on my Scottish heritage--and after a sufficient amount of time based on NOTHING, throw it away!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice that it did anything to help or to hurt my curly hair - it&#x27;s a good spray to spray on after shampoo.  Gives some hold, but not too much.  Also, has fragrance, but all Bed Head products do.  What&#x27;s good about the fragrances they use in their products is that the ones I tried, at least, don&#x27;t last.  So in the shower when your washing your hair and if you use this spray when you&#x27;re drying it, there will be fragrance.  But I don&#x27;t notice it afterward, it doesn&#x27;t follow me around all day, the way some brands do...I&#x27;m not a perfume-y fragrance person, it aggravates my allergies - but I can use this without a problem.</li>
            <li> Really helps pump up and fix the curls so they last for days.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I use it all the time.  You don&#x27;t need to use a lot, but it does the trick.  Great service and price.  It&#x27;s difficult to find in stores, so this is very convenient.</li>
            <li> I use this product on my very thin, long hair and it works great! I spray it on my wet hair, scrunch with my hands, and then use my diffuser until completely dry. To give my hair some extra volume, I flip my hair upside down and blow dry the top (since it doesn&#x27;t get very dry when diffusing). Personally, I do not brush my hair before scrunching, so I can&#x27;t expect to be able to run my fingers through my hair, with or without this product. Unlike other spray gels, this does make your hair crunchy! I love that we can get this so much cheaper on Amazon.com! I would still pay $20 a bottle if I had to though. I have never found a better product.</li>
            <li> Best hair procuct to promote curls in my hair, even in humjdity.</li>
            <li> Nothing works quite like this for keeping curls defined after styling.  Much more expensive in stores, so this is the way to purchase!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I use it when my hair is wet before diffusing it, and I also will use it when it&#x27;s dry to redefine or tame the curls/frizzies the next day.  I have never been able to sleep on my curls and then have my hair down the next day, but with this product I can actually do that!</li>
