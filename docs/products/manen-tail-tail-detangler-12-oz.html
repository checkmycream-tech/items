            <li>Thank you, kind stranger!  </li>
            <li>It also takes longer for my hair to tangle up again afterwards, and gives it a pleasantly silky feeling.</li>
            <li>This detangels really good.</li>
            <li>However I used this on my dog and it worked really good.</li>
            <li>This is really a good detangler.  </li>
            <li>I loved the Mane N Tail shampoo and conditioner, but this just didn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
            <li>I have used this item before and it is still as good as ever</li>
            <li>good buy here</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s good for my horses mane and tail.</li>
            <li>and I have looked for years for a good replacement.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still searching for a good spray leave in detangler.</li>
            <li>It does good.  </li>
            <li>On top of this, it&#x27;s a great price.</li>
            <li>Since using this product my hair feels so silky and tangles come out real easy</li>
            <li>I got this for helping me keep my son&#x27;s hair looking nice, neat, and smelling good.</li>
            <li>give it 5 wonderful awesome tangle free stars for a quality product that really works and does it job quite nicely.</li>
            <li>but this detangler does magic!</li>
            <li>, I couldn&#x27;t stop touching it!</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found it!</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>This stuff is like magic!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Even better than the Johnson &amp; Johnson we have used for decades!</li>
            <li>LOVE this!</li>
            <li>Im very happy with this purchase ;-)</li>
            <li>This product is truly amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a 10 leave in treatment, but Mane and Tail is amazing.</li>
            <li>, this stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I cannot believe how amazing this product is.</li>
            <li>The smell of this product smells like apples witch is amazing</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>It sure made my bathroom floor slippery, but did NOTHING FOR MY HAIR except make it smell good.</li>
            <li>the product itself is probably good, ive used mane  and tail products before and was satisfied</li>
            <li>A good creme rinse would have done a better job.  </li>
            <li>Smell nice and doesn&#x27;t seem to bother his skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed it leaves my hair with a nice silky feeling throughout the day as well.</li>
            <li>but I am wondering if it has some kind of drying product in it like alcohol, etc??</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe this winter I&#x27;ll let my own hair grow out again</li>
            <li>and it has a tendency to tangle and frizz up a bit on its own.</li>
            <li>and they have healthy, shiny, gorgeous coats.</li>
            <li>It makes it so much easier to style the wigs and gives a very nice smell too!</li>
            <li>and it tangles very easily</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even started using this in my daughter&#x27;s hair, which gets tangled very easily.</li>
            <li>I spray this on after washing my hair and run my hands through my hair very easily.</li>
            <li>I also heard that many women use this on their own hair and now I know why.  </li>
            <li>So far, not overly impressed with this product.</li>
            <li>Eeverything about this detangler is great , the smell isn&#x27;t so great , but ok .. the packaging isn&#x27;t so attractive too but if you compare it to what it does you wouldn&#x27;t care less.</li>
            <li>works in my daughters hair that tangles easily!</li>
            <li>The scent isn&#x27;t strong and it smells nice.</li>
            <li>The bottle is large and the detangling effect is great to.</li>
            <li>I am relieved and satisfied.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and there is no build up</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I ran across it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re sobbing over your once-beautiful wig that&#x27;s now so tangled that it resembles a rat&#x27;s nest more than it does something you&#x27;d wear on your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Spray more.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>So many make hair greasy</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love silicone</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS STUFF.</li>
            <li>If you need to, spray even more [</li>
            <li>B000143JSK Mane &#x27;n Tail Detangler]] on the spots until you&#x27;ve managed to work out most of the kinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product does not irritate my dog&#x27;s skin, which is the problem with many of the canine hair care products on the market</li>
            <li>I found that this detangler worked okay with those knots.</li>
            <li>and i will defiently continue to purchase it cuz its a better detangler than the rest</li>
            <li>I will try it again on my hair and hopefully have better results</li>
            <li>you have cranky hair, you need this for sure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this for awhile and love it and will probably buy it again.</li>
            <li>I have no idea why people love this company</li>
            <li>It was for sure thicker and longer.  </li>
            <li>Part was getting more dense and it was growing longer.</li>
            <li>I have found better luck</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m okay with spritzing my daughter with it since all of the ingredients are edible/food quality.</li>
            <li>I love it, with a wire comb or brush</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s magic, I used it on one of my longer wigs(spray</li>
            <li>, she said it doesn&#x27;t hurt to comb now, buy 2 more bottles of that spray.  </li>
            <li>and I was pleased as always.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li>We love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Better than most Detanglers.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>It works OK.  </li>
            <li>This detangler works like magic - it saves me time and stops a lot of the breakage I used to get.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.  </li>
            <li>I would love to get my hands on some, wholesale.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I tore out/broke off more hairs using this product than if I had used nothing at all.</li>
            <li>but anyways I love this and will be repurchasing</li>
            <li>Works but wish it created a bit more &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I sure am glad I did.</li>
            <li>Mane &#x27;n Tail made the wig much more manageable.</li>
            <li>It also softened some of the waves resulting in a better length.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this stuff</li>
            <li>Let me say that many of my friends and family are salon professionals with mega-years of experience.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m going to get one more when i&#x27;m finish with this bottle</li>
            <li>I did have to spray a healthy amount of it into my hair</li>
            <li>I love using this spray to detangle wigs.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to expect.</li>
            <li>My hair dose not look any better with this staff</li>
            <li>I will always keep a bottle of this magic potion at home close by.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s mid-back length, and we&#x27;ve had many a crappy morning brushing it out.</li>
            <li>I love this product and will not be without it for now on.</li>
            <li>I love all of the Mane &#x27;n Tail products.  </li>
            <li>so there&#x27;s more breakage.</li>
            <li>better off using a serum.</li>
            <li>love garnier fructis sleek and shine anti frizz serum</li>
            <li>As a leave-in, this product is OK.</li>
            <li>After some research, the best explanation for this I can give is that these products are more focused on instant gratification than long-term sustainability.</li>
            <li>to be more mosturizing</li>
            <li>This is the best detangler out there I find that it works on dry hair also great product removes tangles fast</li>
            <li>It even smells pretty good</li>
            <li>This product fixed the tangles and made her coat beautiful again.</li>
            <li>The best detangler for long hair!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably best to bathe your dog before you use this product, but once the dog has had a chance to dry a bit, just spray</li>
            <li>I dampen my hair with it, then use a wide tooth comb to get all the knots out, and of course- all the knots come out perfectly  each and every time!</li>
            <li>Smells light and refreshing.  </li>
            <li>I use this with The Wet Brush Detangling Shower Brush and together both work wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>so I was curious to see how it work on my own hair, and I was pleased to find it works great.</li>
            <li>Actually works incredibly well.  </li>
            <li>BUT OTHER THAN THAT, ITS PERFECT !</li>
            <li>And both heads of hair are officially detangled to the point that they will be able to wear it out for their upcoming performance, and I am not afraid of it!  </li>
            <li>It makes it so easy to brush through my hair.</li>
            <li>Makes our poms hair easy to manage and  detangle after a bath.</li>
            <li>When I use it, I can brush my hair easily and painlessly.</li>
            <li>This product is great at detangling my very fine long hair, and leaves no residue on my hair either.</li>
            <li>As for the detangling part of it it is okay its not anything special though.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s amazing for both straight haired wigs and curly wigs!</li>
            <li>We bought our daughter her OWN bottle ;)</li>
            <li>works with my hair just fine.</li>
            <li>used this on my wiry JRT during brushing with a fine comb</li>
            <li>Its a fine mist and does detangle well.</li>
            <li>I have fine, straight caucasian hair that is very easy to break but tangles easily.</li>
            <li>I am Filipino and I bought this because I&#x27;ve had this huge knot on my hair for weeks</li>
            <li>when i bought it there was this REALLY HUGE TANGLE in my hair, i bought if just to see if it works</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cried genuine tears of relief over this product.</li>
            <li>My hair actually ended up being longer than anticipated; since I was able to comb out most of it without any breakage, the barber was able to trim it while retaining most of my length.    </li>
            <li>Have tried all sorts of conditioners, leave-in conditioners, hair breakage products, untangling products, smooth and silky products, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This keeps you tangle free and looking great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fortunately I was able to pick up some Miracle 7 leave in conditioner that worked a whole lot better than this stuff, which is going in the trash.</li>
            <li>Plus, it is cheap.</li>
            <li>But it did smooth out that section of hair that was so matted that I thought I would have to cut it out.  </li>
            <li>That area is now smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>not stained).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never raved about a hair product before, but this one is too fantastic to ignore.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy the smell and use it injunction with the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>This is the same problem I experienced with the Giovanni &#x27;Organic&#x27; leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li>My natural grade is not what I would consider \\&quot;good hair\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>There hair looks super healthy and full</li>
            <li>(light fragrance that smells clean).  </li>
            <li>it detangles super easy.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for my long straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t make her hair look greasy and it made it super easy to braid.</li>
            <li>It took a cheap wig that looked really too good out of the package to a state that looks much more natural.</li>
            <li>This product was originally made for horses.  </li>
            <li>neither of which changes my original 4 star rating.&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li>this product is great on both my daughters hair and plus mine with long hair.  </li>
            <li>Its great on the hair and smells decent, although it makes counters and ESPECIALLY floors super slippery!!</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy hair…there is no possible way I could comb or brush my hair after a shower without a detangler and this one works awesome</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel great!, worth the few dollars to get those tangles out.</li>
            <li>It was super cheap</li>
            <li>Which makes me wonder (seeing so many positive reviews)</li>
            <li>Easily the best detangler/leave-in conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used, especially because one of my local shops sells it for $3 a bottle.</li>
            <li>Both work great and each has a nice yet subtle smell.</li>
            <li>This product has a great scent, and makes it very easy to detangle thick knotted hair.</li>
            <li>I was super excited to try this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ladies (and brothers) before you cut all your natural hair off in frustration because the detangling takes forever, give this inexpensive amazing product a try.</li>
            <li>Brush gently from bottom to top.</li>
            <li>all I do is spray all around (its like a mist) and gently massage her hair to make sure its in, then I start to run my fingers through it to detangle.</li>
            <li>but this works like magic in my daughters very curly and unruly hair.  </li>
            <li>but I can use this on my daughter as much as I want and her hair is shiny and smooth!</li>
            <li>I tend to put this on my damp hair and gently rake with a tooth comb for better results.  </li>
            <li>After i use it my hair is nice and silky and it leaves my hair feeling soft&amp; silky.</li>
            <li>Young lady thrilled with combo.  </li>
            <li>This is a better product for much much much cheaper.</li>
            <li>I love this brand so much.</li>
            <li>true fix:</li>
            <li>true fix:</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li>Not a bad smell but not something you want want to have in your face all day.</li>
            <li>Great product and actually works as promised, I highly recommend this product to anyone who&#x27;s hair breaks easily or has a tender head.</li>
            <li>I sprayed this Main N Tail Detangler in my hair and my hair layed straight and the comb was able to go thru like I had got a magical perm.</li>
            <li>I got this recommended to me by other cosplayers for their wigs and this is great for untangling wigs with ease.</li>
            <li>Seriously, this is the best detangler on the market!!!</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t pay more for other products any more!</li>
            <li>I have tile floor in my bathroom and the residue from the spray makes the floor super slippery.</li>
            <li>pleased with the results definitely buying more of this when I run out</li>
            <li>But luckily I found it at my Rite-Aid.  </li>
            <li>During the winter it always gets super matted underneath where it rubs against her coat hood (despite her saying that she brushes it every day).</li>
            <li>I have tried special brushes and other sprays, and this is by far the best thing I have found, so I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars</li>
            <li>Mane n&#x27; Tail since my hair used to tangle so easily, now I use it on my own children who have long hair and they don&#x27;t put up a fuss when I go to brush their hair.</li>
            <li>A huge weight lifted off my shoulders that first day.</li>
            <li>We normally end up having to take him to a groomer and the groomer ends up shaving off most of the hair on his legs to get through the mats.  </li>
            <li>This product is so unbelievable, no matter if its designed for horses, they have created a formula that is truly incredible.</li>
            <li>IF IT WORKED AS GOOD ON DRY HAIR.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s good enough for horses that make their coats and tails pretty</li>
            <li>It works fast and easy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had complete strangers walk up to me in public places and tell me that I have beautiful hair.</li>
            <li>I got a very soft plastic brush that does not pull her hair but is able to work in the matts....</li>
            <li>You can tell the difference it makes with your hair with the first use!</li>
            <li>I was able to INSTANTLY comb through my hair soo easily.</li>
            <li>Where I really notice this product&#x27;s great effect is when my hair is dry.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s a nice big bottle, not like the \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10\\&quot; that costs more than 2x as much for a 1/3 of the product, but works half as good as this.</li>
            <li>My straight hair is incredibly smooth and shiny:</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel incredibly silky to the touch and not in the least bit oily or greasy.</li>
            <li>Our \\&quot;hair day\\&quot; is approached with anxiety and sadness because it&#x27;s a HUGE, very time consuming process and</li>
            <li>I have found that it WORKS BEST ON WET HAIR and it seems to keep it from getting knotted back up for quite a while.</li>
            <li>Works magically hair is soft detangled and shiny</li>
            <li>This works great on my own hair, and it was almost able to detangle an awful synthetic wig that I own (which is quite a feat).</li>
            <li>Slippery floors or not this detangler is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I rarely think to write a review on Amazon</li>
            <li>Totally worth every penny.</li>
            <li>&quot; wins is in fragrance.</li>
            <li>It does what it is supposed to do, and the fact that it is made to be gentle enough for even horses, with no obnoxious perfume smell, makes it simply the best, in my book.</li>
            <li>This detangler makes it a lot easier to keep my dry hair smooth and also makes it very easy to brush.</li>
            <li>works well enough, decent on wigs too, not the miracle product some espoused it to be, but definitely worth i when price is good.</li>
            <li>Then once I got this I used it right away after my shower, shake it up, then spray away.</li>
            <li>Right now this is my go too</li>
            <li>&quot; (yes, you read that right)</li>
            <li>Serves me right for not reading the label before using it, ha.</li>
            <li>so i put this detangler to the test right away</li>
            <li>Works great on my 10 year old&#x27;s long hair.</li>
            <li>Makes my daughters hair very soft and easy to brush.</li>
            <li>not because it&#x27;s necessarily perfect but because it definitely trumps the other products out there!</li>
            <li>Keeps my human hair wig free of tangles and easy to brush and mantain.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time two days ago after washing and deep conditioning, and I noticed a huge difference in how easy it was to detangle my hair.  </li>
            <li>This right here??!!!  First off, African Anerican 4c hair.  </li>
            <li>Once my hair is dry it looks and feels amazing.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve found that it works amazing if I let the hair dry before combing out the tangles.</li>
            <li>Without this detangler it would easily take over an hour to completely detangle my hair.</li>
            <li>Honestly it made it feel dry and brittle.</li>
            <li>I wound up giving it to my daughter for her 6 year old fine hair.</li>
            <li>This detangler works great for my thick curly hair.</li>
            <li>She cried a lot more back then.</li>
            <li>I know this sounds funny</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with how manageable my hair became with the product.</li>
            <li>First of all, I&#x27;m a man who used this product.</li>
            <li>I used it today for the first time</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be making sure to never run out of this because it has definitely saved my hair.    </li>
            <li>For the price of this product, which is almost nothing, it does a fabulous job of detangling and making your hair feel soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>I bought it to get the tangles out, not to make my hair smell pretty...</li>
            <li>This helps to takes them out pretty well.</li>
            <li>( ;-)  )... it does wonders with her tail and her legs...</li>
            <li>She was so funny</li>
            <li>Needless to say I will be stocking up on this wonderful product.</li>
            <li>Thanks Mane &#x27;n Tail!</li>
            <li>Go figure it was first made for horses (hence the 2 on the product).</li>
            <li>Pantene has one in a blue bottle that i think works better and quicker.</li>
            <li>Used twice, the first time</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li>and this is the first one i believe in.</li>
            <li>I wish there was a nicer smell to it (there really isn&#x27;t a scent at all to this product, which is probably preferable to some people)!</li>
            <li>The first time I used this detangler</li>
            <li>When this happened to me the first thing I thought was, &amp;#34;They need to put this information on the label!&amp;#34; Then I picked up the bottle and read the label where it said exactly that.</li>
            <li>So much better than generic detangler</li>
            <li>The first time I used this on my daughter&#x27;s hair was the first time she did not scream, kick, cry, or fight to get away from me.</li>
            <li>and this is my first time using this product.</li>
            <li>AND IT WAS FULL OF NEW GROWTH.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Mane n&#x27; Tale as a whole is a decent product line, but now that I&#x27;m an adult and have more knowledge and awareness about chemicals and alcohol use in products, I no longer feel their line is for</li>
            <li>My hair tangles very easily and is very dry.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, a friend suggested this to me after explaining how much easier it made brushing the hair of her small daughter, who never remembers to brush her own hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it on both wet and dry hair and gotten excellent results as far as the detangling goes.  </li>
            <li>As a matter of fact, the barber that I went to had undergone a similar process, and he said that he wished he had used this product since he wasn&#x27;t able to save as much of his hair.  </li>
            <li>neither my dog, I wish they had a more natural scent, maybe a soft herbal one....</li>
            <li>ok, the second time it absolutely did not detangle my hair.</li>
            <li>Last month Sally&#x27;s beauty supply had a \\&quot;buy one get one free\\&quot; sale, I bought 4, even though I still had a full bottle in the house!</li>
            <li>thoroughly, comb through from bottom to top and blow dry after)</li>
            <li>Two days later and my hair is still easy to comb.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has super curly hair that frequently tangles.  </li>
            <li>He is a mixture of pure chaos.</li>
            <li>, at least the little fellow looks pretty good and smells nice.</li>
            <li>sure enough it&#x27;s the little things that can cause the most damage.&lt;br</li>
            <li>sure enough it&#x27;s the little things that can cause the most damage.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After washing and conditioning, it used to be as smooth and slippery as could be, but now it snarls and tangles, especially at the nape of my neck.  </li>
            <li>this really helps get a brush through it</li>
            <li>This really works.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast and</li>
            <li>and I could not believe how much time I saved.</li>
            <li>Very well priced.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>However i would still need to really get in there to get the knot out.</li>
            <li>and it didnt really detangle my hair.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say enough fabulous things about this product without going on for pages and pages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much, otherwise hair feels greasy.</li>
            <li>And even when I use a lot, I have found it not to do much.</li>
            <li>Grooming is much easier now, Mane &#x27;n Tail detangler does the job.</li>
            <li>However, as I like for my hair to look sleek and straight, I didn&#x27;t like that</li>
            <li>She actually seems to enjoy it..</li>
            <li>straight ends).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really a leave-in</li>
            <li>I sprayed this and combed her hair, and it was totally tangle free.  </li>
            <li>Performs it&#x27;s job really well, just spray and brush.</li>
            <li>I just started using this on my Havanese and it seems to make his grooming so much easier.</li>
            <li>that stuff was not helpful really.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have to use that much on my hair before the tangles just start sliding apart.</li>
            <li>I love this product as it does detangle as expected - if I shake the bottle before applying.</li>
            <li>It left him silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>This detangler works very well for my hair.</li>
            <li>This product works really well to manage the tangle.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>One person told me my hair looked like it should be in a TV commercial, it was so shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>and I go at it for 45 minutes straight.</li>
            <li>Her hair was so smooth and silky and it left no sticky residue or smell (</li>
            <li>which I was really worried about).</li>
            <li>thanks amazon.  </li>
            <li>Also i need a perm and its been 3mo and dis stuff really works.</li>
            <li>&#x27;n Tail Detangler really works.  </li>
            <li>Products like this are great at first, then after a year or so of use, suddenly your hair is falling out, or its a lot dryer than usual</li>
            <li>&#x27;n Tail Detangler is the only product that we have ever found that even comes close to our old favorite Clairol product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since I had a lot of individual locks, I had to do it over the course of two days, but I just sprayed them with conditioner each time I was uncombing them to ensure that they weren&#x27;t dry, waited a few minutes for it to soak in and was able to comb them out successfully.</li>
            <li>Wow!!!</li>
            <li>would recommend to anyone who has hair that is long and easily tangles.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves my daughters hair untangled while nothing else helped this much , i tried so many other detanglers</li>
            <li>Perfect for difficult tangles that I have to deal with, fixes them in no time at all!</li>
            <li>This works great to condition and detangle my little girls long hair</li>
            <li>It works better than any other product I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>I was a tad worried about the curly one(very long) but the curls stayed, I used a wire wig brush because I&#x27;ve noticed that curls tend to come out faster if you use a broad brush, the spray also makes the wigs very soft and smell rather nice</li>
            <li>I have long fine hair that will get all&lt;br /&gt;Frizzed</li>
            <li>I think this would be great for african american women who are natural and don&#x27;t mind the extra thickness that *</li>
            <li>The good thing is we could tell in about a week and a half to two weeks, not a month or two months like things you use to actually help hair grow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was looking for something that i could use to detangle my natural hair easily and with the same as a QP elasta h20 before they changed the formula and messed it up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that a true fix to dry hair is first and foremost to take care of yourself from the inside out...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that a true fix to dry hair is first and foremost to take care of yourself from the inside out...</li>
            <li>I really like it, but it does need to be more moisturizing, especially for coarse hair.</li>
            <li>When I wash my hair and airdry it, the underprocessed parts tend to be very dry and tangle easily</li>
            <li>The only downside is that this stuff goes quick.  </li>
            <li>Its a must buy, this will be a main staple for my 4C texlaxed hair.</li>
            <li>In addition, I might add that I live in a desert, so high moisture/ intense hydration products are a must.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use a little more than the normal amount as per the directions, but I have to use a little more because I have much longer hair than normal.&lt;br</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommended...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>&#x27;n Tail Detangler a little better.</li>
            <li>the bottle I purchased appeared to be little more than lightly-fragranced water.</li>
            <li>and I do wish it felt a little more moisturizing, but since I follow up with a leave-in conditioner, that makes up for it.  </li>
            <li>It gets tangled easily and seems as though it&#x27;s already begun getting tangled on one side as soon as I&#x27;ve finished brushing the other.</li>
            <li>I have spent hundreds of dollars trying to get my hair smooth again and nothing worked.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t get over how soft my hair feels.</li>
            <li>Overall the product is definently worth the money</li>
            <li>Spraying it all over and combing it through with my fingers like I normally would did nothing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I follow-up with my normal products</li>
            <li>This works great in my hair, and my hair is extremely long and thick.</li>
            <li>(Green juices, more iron in your diet, and lost and LOTS of water).</li>
            <li>(Green juices, more iron in your diet, and lost and LOTS of water).</li>
            <li>I sprayed this on dry hair and was able to brush through even tough knots pretty easily.  </li>
            <li>oh my when I saw the new look of this bottle not only did it make me smile</li>
            <li>This has a mild scent, disperses well, detangles wet just washed hair very well.</li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical that this would work on my daughter&#x27;s easily tangled fine hair, but it detangled her hair so easily!  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, my hair was very easy to comb through after using Mane &#x27;n Tail Detangler, but certain hairstyles (for example, a wrap) just wouldn&#x27;t be options after use because the style wouldn&#x27;t look right.  </li>
            <li>and I have ton of new growth.</li>
            <li>now it looks like new again</li>
            <li>I use this product every day to spray on my new growth to comb it out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an Italian female and my hair is on the \\&quot;fine\\&quot; side (although I have alot of it) but its VERY prone to getting knotty quick.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s coarse because it has rarely ever been managed in it&#x27;s natural form.</li>
            <li>Balancing your hair and keeping it alcohol free is essential to hair health, and acidifying your hair is necessary for maintenance, shine and moisture</li>
            <li>Balancing your hair and keeping it alcohol free is essential to hair health, and acidifying your hair is necessary for maintenance, shine and moisture</li>
            <li>Oh and  after blow drying my hair is super soft and  shiny not hard and dry like it would of been .</li>
            <li>It does detangle somewhat, but I had to part my hair and spray directly onto each tangle, wait, and then comb it out for it to work (which took forever!).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to use it on my other wigs.</li>
            <li>By the way we shampoo our dog first with this shampoo/conditioner from the same company.</li>
            <li>No scent whatsoever (which is important to me due to my allergies)!</li>
            <li>I read a lot of articles stating that you cannot comb out dreadlocks; you supposedly have to cut your hair completely off and regrow it to a new style.</li>
            <li>I spray it on my freshly washed, towel-dried hair, comb through and then let my hair air dry.</li>
            <li>I began using this product about 2 weeks ago and have been able to get a cold through on the first try after spraying this on (literally the first run through with a comb!).</li>
            <li>wow...whether for humans or animals it works great on my long thick coarse hair.</li>
            <li>also if you are growing out your hair get the instant protien by mane and tail and just spray it on the ends of your hair and you will see less split ends and more growth.  </li>
            <li>I have really long hair that loves getting tangled and knotted and this is the first product that completely helped!</li>
            <li>In the case of some of these leave-ins, they usually carry a blend of ingredients that promotes a sort of illusory moisture, meaning it feels okay at first, but once the chemicals dry you may experience an adverse effect.</li>
            <li>The tangles come apart easily with little manipulation and, as a bonus, my hair is left feeling very soft!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any detangling effect and the bottle is heavy and huge.</li>
            <li>I have tried nearly every detangler product without much luck; however, this actually works.  </li>
            <li>I used this product while going through my transition from relaxed to natural hair.  </li>
            <li>I truly recommend this product for anyone who has natural or texlax hair.</li>
            <li>B000143JSK Mane &#x27;n Tail Detangler]], that problem is nearly non-existent.  </li>
            <li>It has worked perfectly so far and I have no complaints.</li>
            <li>His fur is wiry, sticking out in wild directions.</li>
            <li>I tried this &amp;#34;human&amp;#34; formulation but was quite ready to buy the veterinarian/equine strength if necessary.</li>
            <li>Using it does &amp;#34;manage&amp;#34; her natural wave somewhat but</li>
            <li>Im going to try to put a couple of natural essence lavender oil on it... to see if that helps the odor part..</li>
            <li>Leaves hair feeling really soft but never oily.</li>
            <li>Make my hair soft to the touch and shiny.</li>
            <li>I would not waste your time on this.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that it goes fast.  </li>
            <li>trying to transition from relaxed to natural.</li>
            <li>Without it, my hair snaps at the meeting point of the natural and relaxed hair.</li>
            <li>The texture of my relaxed hair after using this product doesnt feel soft and silky.</li>
            <li>this product is a necessity to my daily ritual as much as brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li>I keep it near the door and if we are going somewhere</li>
            <li>I have friends of color with natural hair who swear by this stuff</li>
            <li>I have natural kinky hair.</li>
            <li>Well, this weekend for the first time in a LONG time....</li>
            <li>&quot; sounds were made, but no crying.  </li>
            <li>This leaves my hair feeling SO soft.</li>
            <li>She has this long feathery tail and the first time I used it</li>
            <li>much as I respect American business, so long as these over-the-counter leave-ins try to combine herbal ingredients with chemicals, they will never grant true health or repair to human hair.</li>
            <li>much as I respect American business, so long as these over-the-counter leave-ins try to combine herbal ingredients with chemicals, they will never grant true health or repair to human hair.</li>
            <li>I start from the ends, sprizting and brushing, then slowly work my way up with more spraying and brushing.</li>
            <li>and it is miraculous that I can slip my fingers and then a wide tooth comb instantly right through without a struggle.</li>
            <li>for my own personal experience, my very curly and wavy hair is down to the middle of my back, and every inch of it has been dyed red for years.</li>
            <li>I am Caucasian with semi coarse wavy dark hair that is also fine and prone to breakage.</li>
            <li>Hair is an organic extension of the human body, so the products we use should be minimal, clean, and their richness should depend on the texture of your hair and the humidity in your environment.</li>

            <li>I don&#x27;t really use this on my hair, I use this to detangle my long cosplay wigs.</li>
            <li>My daughter has very long hair which gets very knotty.</li>
            <li>My hair does tangle easily, but it&#x27;s not overly thick or curly or anything.</li>
            <li>IT DEFINITELY MADE MY HAIR SOFT AND DETANGLED!</li>
            <li>My little girls have a lot of long, fine hair that tangles.</li>
            <li>so I can brush her hair without the usual screaming fit and keeps it easier to manage until the next wash!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have nearly mid-back length relaxed, but naturally coarse, hair.</li>
            <li>If you have intractable \\&quot;knots\\&quot; in your hair, use this spray liberally, let it sit for a while, and then use a wide tooth comb (gently).  </li>
            <li>I recently decided to go all natural and stop getting perms.</li>
            <li>This stuff makes my mixed terrier dogs&#x27;s coat so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>but I was tired of combing out knots and am concerned with damaging my hair even more.</li>
            <li>Old school products will never let you down really..</li>
            <li>I had to use A LOT of sprays our first use, but now we don&#x27;t have to use but 10 or less sprays each bath.</li>
            <li>Personally, my hair is pretty short, and never really tangles.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Remember to shake the bottle before you spray, and be very careful about residue on surfaces like the floor (it will make it very slippery, although</li>

            <li>/&gt;it does not dry out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I originally tried it on wet hair and it helped a little.  </li>
            <li>Not sure it&#x27;s worth ordering this.</li>
            <li>Actually works... and my hair is very damaged thick and very curly....</li>
            <li>If you put too much in, it can weigh it down.  </li>
            <li>The spray cap mists onto hair and provides a wide area of coverage, and the spray itself has a decent smell, but overall, this product (like many others) merely provides the illusion of moisture.</li>
            <li>My hair is typically dry after I washit if I don&#x27;t use these products, but since I&#x27;ve been using them, it stays soft, curly and with proper moisture at all times.</li>

            <li> It also takes longer for my hair to tangle up again afterwards, and gives it a pleasantly silky feeling.</li>
            <li> This detangels really good.</li>
            <li> However I used this on my dog and it worked really good.</li>
            <li> This is really a good detangler.  </li>
            <li> I loved the Mane N Tail shampoo and conditioner, but this just didn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
            <li> I have used this item before and it is still as good as ever</li>
            <li> good buy here</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s good for my horses mane and tail.</li>
            <li> and I have looked for years for a good replacement.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still searching for a good spray leave in detangler.</li>
            <li> It does good.  </li>
            <li> On top of this, it&#x27;s a great price.</li>
            <li> Since using this product my hair feels so silky and tangles come out real easy</li>

            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> This stuff is like magic!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Even better than the Johnson &amp; Johnson we have used for decades!</li>
            <li> LOVE this!</li>
            <li> Im very happy with this purchase ;-)</li>
            <li> This product is truly amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 10 leave in treatment, but Mane and Tail is amazing.</li>
            <li> , this stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> I cannot believe how amazing this product is.</li>
            <li> The smell of this product smells like apples witch is amazing</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> It sure made my bathroom floor slippery, but did NOTHING FOR MY HAIR except make it smell good.</li>
            <li> the product itself is probably good, ive used mane  and tail products before and was satisfied</li>
            <li> A good creme rinse would have done a better job.  </li>
            <li> Smell nice and doesn&#x27;t seem to bother his skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed it leaves my hair with a nice silky feeling throughout the day as well.</li>
            <li> but I am wondering if it has some kind of drying product in it like alcohol, etc??</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe this winter I&#x27;ll let my own hair grow out again</li>
            <li> and it has a tendency to tangle and frizz up a bit on its own.</li>
            <li> and they have healthy, shiny, gorgeous coats.</li>
            <li> It makes it so much easier to style the wigs and gives a very nice smell too!</li>
            <li> and it tangles very easily</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even started using this in my daughter&#x27;s hair, which gets tangled very easily.</li>
            <li> I spray this on after washing my hair and run my hands through my hair very easily.</li>
            <li> I also heard that many women use this on their own hair and now I know why.  </li>
            <li> So far, not overly impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> Eeverything about this detangler is great , the smell isn&#x27;t so great , but ok .. the packaging isn&#x27;t so attractive too but if you compare it to what it does you wouldn&#x27;t care less.</li>
            <li> works in my daughters hair that tangles easily!</li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t strong and it smells nice.</li>
            <li> The bottle is large and the detangling effect is great to.</li>
            <li> I am relieved and satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and there is no build up</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I ran across it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re sobbing over your once-beautiful wig that&#x27;s now so tangled that it resembles a rat&#x27;s nest more than it does something you&#x27;d wear on your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Spray more.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> So many make hair greasy</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love silicone</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF.</li>
            <li> If you need to, spray even more [</li>
            <li> B000143JSK Mane &#x27;n Tail Detangler]] on the spots until you&#x27;ve managed to work out most of the kinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product does not irritate my dog&#x27;s skin, which is the problem with many of the canine hair care products on the market</li>
            <li> I found that this detangler worked okay with those knots.</li>
            <li> and i will defiently continue to purchase it cuz its a better detangler than the rest</li>
            <li> I will try it again on my hair and hopefully have better results</li>
            <li> you have cranky hair, you need this for sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for awhile and love it and will probably buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have no idea why people love this company</li>
            <li> It was for sure thicker and longer.  </li>
            <li> Part was getting more dense and it was growing longer.</li>
            <li> I have found better luck</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m okay with spritzing my daughter with it since all of the ingredients are edible/food quality.</li>
            <li> I love it, with a wire comb or brush</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s magic, I used it on one of my longer wigs(spray</li>
            <li> , she said it doesn&#x27;t hurt to comb now, buy 2 more bottles of that spray.  </li>
            <li> and I was pleased as always.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li> We love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Better than most Detanglers.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love the product.</li>
            <li> It works OK.  </li>
            <li> This detangler works like magic - it saves me time and stops a lot of the breakage I used to get.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  </li>
            <li> I would love to get my hands on some, wholesale.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I tore out/broke off more hairs using this product than if I had used nothing at all.</li>
            <li> but anyways I love this and will be repurchasing</li>
            <li> Works but wish it created a bit more &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I sure am glad I did.</li>
            <li> Mane &#x27;n Tail made the wig much more manageable.</li>
            <li> It also softened some of the waves resulting in a better length.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this stuff</li>
            <li> Let me say that many of my friends and family are salon professionals with mega-years of experience.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m going to get one more when i&#x27;m finish with this bottle</li>
            <li> I did have to spray a healthy amount of it into my hair</li>
            <li> I love using this spray to detangle wigs.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to expect.</li>
            <li> My hair dose not look any better with this staff</li>
            <li> I will always keep a bottle of this magic potion at home close by.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s mid-back length, and we&#x27;ve had many a crappy morning brushing it out.</li>
            <li> I love this product and will not be without it for now on.</li>
            <li> I love all of the Mane &#x27;n Tail products.  </li>
            <li> so there&#x27;s more breakage.</li>
            <li> better off using a serum.</li>
            <li> love garnier fructis sleek and shine anti frizz serum</li>
            <li> As a leave-in, this product is OK.</li>
            <li> After some research, the best explanation for this I can give is that these products are more focused on instant gratification than long-term sustainability.</li>
            <li> to be more mosturizing</li>
            <li> This is the best detangler out there I find that it works on dry hair also great product removes tangles fast</li>
            <li> It even smells pretty good</li>
            <li> This product fixed the tangles and made her coat beautiful again.</li>
            <li> The best detangler for long hair!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably best to bathe your dog before you use this product, but once the dog has had a chance to dry a bit, just spray</li>
            <li> I dampen my hair with it, then use a wide tooth comb to get all the knots out, and of course- all the knots come out perfectly  each and every time!</li>
            <li> Smells light and refreshing.  </li>
            <li> I use this with The Wet Brush Detangling Shower Brush and together both work wonderfully.  </li>
            <li> so I was curious to see how it work on my own hair, and I was pleased to find it works great.</li>
            <li> Actually works incredibly well.  </li>
            <li> BUT OTHER THAN THAT, ITS PERFECT !</li>
            <li> And both heads of hair are officially detangled to the point that they will be able to wear it out for their upcoming performance, and I am not afraid of it!  </li>
            <li> It makes it so easy to brush through my hair.</li>
            <li> Makes our poms hair easy to manage and  detangle after a bath.</li>
            <li> When I use it, I can brush my hair easily and painlessly.</li>
            <li> This product is great at detangling my very fine long hair, and leaves no residue on my hair either.</li>
            <li> As for the detangling part of it it is okay its not anything special though.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s amazing for both straight haired wigs and curly wigs!</li>
            <li> We bought our daughter her OWN bottle ;)</li>
            <li> works with my hair just fine.</li>
            <li> used this on my wiry JRT during brushing with a fine comb</li>
            <li> Its a fine mist and does detangle well.</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight caucasian hair that is very easy to break but tangles easily.</li>
            <li> I am Filipino and I bought this because I&#x27;ve had this huge knot on my hair for weeks</li>
            <li> when i bought it there was this REALLY HUGE TANGLE in my hair, i bought if just to see if it works</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cried genuine tears of relief over this product.</li>
            <li> My hair actually ended up being longer than anticipated; since I was able to comb out most of it without any breakage, the barber was able to trim it while retaining most of my length.    </li>
            <li> Have tried all sorts of conditioners, leave-in conditioners, hair breakage products, untangling products, smooth and silky products, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This keeps you tangle free and looking great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fortunately I was able to pick up some Miracle 7 leave in conditioner that worked a whole lot better than this stuff, which is going in the trash.</li>
            <li> Plus, it is cheap.</li>
            <li> But it did smooth out that section of hair that was so matted that I thought I would have to cut it out.  </li>
            <li> That area is now smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li> not stained).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never raved about a hair product before, but this one is too fantastic to ignore.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy the smell and use it injunction with the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> This is the same problem I experienced with the Giovanni &#x27;Organic&#x27; leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> My natural grade is not what I would consider \\&quot;good hair\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> There hair looks super healthy and full</li>
            <li> (light fragrance that smells clean).  </li>
            <li> it detangles super easy.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for my long straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make her hair look greasy and it made it super easy to braid.</li>
            <li> It took a cheap wig that looked really too good out of the package to a state that looks much more natural.</li>
            <li> This product was originally made for horses.  </li>
            <li> neither of which changes my original 4 star rating.&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li> this product is great on both my daughters hair and plus mine with long hair.  </li>
            <li> Its great on the hair and smells decent, although it makes counters and ESPECIALLY floors super slippery!!</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair…there is no possible way I could comb or brush my hair after a shower without a detangler and this one works awesome</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel great!, worth the few dollars to get those tangles out.</li>
            <li> It was super cheap</li>
            <li> Which makes me wonder (seeing so many positive reviews)</li>
            <li> Easily the best detangler/leave-in conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used, especially because one of my local shops sells it for $3 a bottle.</li>
            <li> Both work great and each has a nice yet subtle smell.</li>
            <li> This product has a great scent, and makes it very easy to detangle thick knotted hair.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to try this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ladies (and brothers) before you cut all your natural hair off in frustration because the detangling takes forever, give this inexpensive amazing product a try.</li>
            <li> Brush gently from bottom to top.</li>
            <li> all I do is spray all around (its like a mist) and gently massage her hair to make sure its in, then I start to run my fingers through it to detangle.</li>
            <li> but this works like magic in my daughters very curly and unruly hair.  </li>
            <li> but I can use this on my daughter as much as I want and her hair is shiny and smooth!</li>
            <li> I tend to put this on my damp hair and gently rake with a tooth comb for better results.  </li>
            <li> After i use it my hair is nice and silky and it leaves my hair feeling soft&amp; silky.</li>
            <li> Young lady thrilled with combo.  </li>
            <li> This is a better product for much much much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I love this brand so much.</li>
            <li> true fix:</li>
            <li> true fix:</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li> Not a bad smell but not something you want want to have in your face all day.</li>
            <li> Great product and actually works as promised, I highly recommend this product to anyone who&#x27;s hair breaks easily or has a tender head.</li>
            <li> I sprayed this Main N Tail Detangler in my hair and my hair layed straight and the comb was able to go thru like I had got a magical perm.</li>
            <li> I got this recommended to me by other cosplayers for their wigs and this is great for untangling wigs with ease.</li>
            <li> Seriously, this is the best detangler on the market!!!</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t pay more for other products any more!</li>
            <li> I have tile floor in my bathroom and the residue from the spray makes the floor super slippery.</li>
            <li> pleased with the results definitely buying more of this when I run out</li>
            <li> But luckily I found it at my Rite-Aid.  </li>
            <li> During the winter it always gets super matted underneath where it rubs against her coat hood (despite her saying that she brushes it every day).</li>
            <li> I have tried special brushes and other sprays, and this is by far the best thing I have found, so I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars</li>
            <li> Mane n&#x27; Tail since my hair used to tangle so easily, now I use it on my own children who have long hair and they don&#x27;t put up a fuss when I go to brush their hair.</li>
            <li> A huge weight lifted off my shoulders that first day.</li>
            <li> We normally end up having to take him to a groomer and the groomer ends up shaving off most of the hair on his legs to get through the mats.  </li>
            <li> This product is so unbelievable, no matter if its designed for horses, they have created a formula that is truly incredible.</li>
            <li> IF IT WORKED AS GOOD ON DRY HAIR.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s good enough for horses that make their coats and tails pretty</li>
            <li> It works fast and easy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had complete strangers walk up to me in public places and tell me that I have beautiful hair.</li>
            <li> I got a very soft plastic brush that does not pull her hair but is able to work in the matts....</li>
            <li> You can tell the difference it makes with your hair with the first use!</li>
            <li> I was able to INSTANTLY comb through my hair soo easily.</li>
            <li> Where I really notice this product&#x27;s great effect is when my hair is dry.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s a nice big bottle, not like the \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10\\&quot; that costs more than 2x as much for a 1/3 of the product, but works half as good as this.</li>
            <li> My straight hair is incredibly smooth and shiny:</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel incredibly silky to the touch and not in the least bit oily or greasy.</li>
            <li> Our \\&quot;hair day\\&quot; is approached with anxiety and sadness because it&#x27;s a HUGE, very time consuming process and</li>
            <li> I have found that it WORKS BEST ON WET HAIR and it seems to keep it from getting knotted back up for quite a while.</li>
            <li> Works magically hair is soft detangled and shiny</li>
            <li> This works great on my own hair, and it was almost able to detangle an awful synthetic wig that I own (which is quite a feat).</li>
            <li> Slippery floors or not this detangler is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I rarely think to write a review on Amazon</li>
            <li> Totally worth every penny.</li>
            <li> &quot; wins is in fragrance.</li>
            <li> It does what it is supposed to do, and the fact that it is made to be gentle enough for even horses, with no obnoxious perfume smell, makes it simply the best, in my book.</li>
            <li> This detangler makes it a lot easier to keep my dry hair smooth and also makes it very easy to brush.</li>
            <li> works well enough, decent on wigs too, not the miracle product some espoused it to be, but definitely worth i when price is good.</li>
            <li> Then once I got this I used it right away after my shower, shake it up, then spray away.</li>
            <li> Right now this is my go too</li>
            <li> &quot; (yes, you read that right)</li>
            <li> Serves me right for not reading the label before using it, ha.</li>
            <li> so i put this detangler to the test right away</li>
            <li> Works great on my 10 year old&#x27;s long hair.</li>
            <li> Makes my daughters hair very soft and easy to brush.</li>
            <li> not because it&#x27;s necessarily perfect but because it definitely trumps the other products out there!</li>
            <li> Keeps my human hair wig free of tangles and easy to brush and mantain.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time two days ago after washing and deep conditioning, and I noticed a huge difference in how easy it was to detangle my hair.  </li>
            <li> This right here??!!!  First off, African Anerican 4c hair.  </li>
            <li> Once my hair is dry it looks and feels amazing.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve found that it works amazing if I let the hair dry before combing out the tangles.</li>
            <li> Without this detangler it would easily take over an hour to completely detangle my hair.</li>
            <li> Honestly it made it feel dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> I wound up giving it to my daughter for her 6 year old fine hair.</li>
            <li> This detangler works great for my thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> She cried a lot more back then.</li>
            <li> I know this sounds funny</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with how manageable my hair became with the product.</li>
            <li> First of all, I&#x27;m a man who used this product.</li>
            <li> I used it today for the first time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be making sure to never run out of this because it has definitely saved my hair.    </li>
            <li> For the price of this product, which is almost nothing, it does a fabulous job of detangling and making your hair feel soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> I bought it to get the tangles out, not to make my hair smell pretty...</li>
            <li> This helps to takes them out pretty well.</li>
            <li> ( ;-)  )... it does wonders with her tail and her legs...</li>
            <li> She was so funny</li>
            <li> Needless to say I will be stocking up on this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Thanks Mane &#x27;n Tail!</li>
            <li> Go figure it was first made for horses (hence the 2 on the product).</li>
            <li> Pantene has one in a blue bottle that i think works better and quicker.</li>
            <li> Used twice, the first time</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li> and this is the first one i believe in.</li>
            <li> I wish there was a nicer smell to it (there really isn&#x27;t a scent at all to this product, which is probably preferable to some people)!</li>
            <li> The first time I used this detangler</li>
            <li> When this happened to me the first thing I thought was, &amp;#34;They need to put this information on the label!&amp;#34; Then I picked up the bottle and read the label where it said exactly that.</li>
            <li> So much better than generic detangler</li>
            <li> The first time I used this on my daughter&#x27;s hair was the first time she did not scream, kick, cry, or fight to get away from me.</li>
            <li> and this is my first time using this product.</li>
            <li> AND IT WAS FULL OF NEW GROWTH.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Mane n&#x27; Tale as a whole is a decent product line, but now that I&#x27;m an adult and have more knowledge and awareness about chemicals and alcohol use in products, I no longer feel their line is for</li>
            <li> My hair tangles very easily and is very dry.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, a friend suggested this to me after explaining how much easier it made brushing the hair of her small daughter, who never remembers to brush her own hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on both wet and dry hair and gotten excellent results as far as the detangling goes.  </li>
            <li> As a matter of fact, the barber that I went to had undergone a similar process, and he said that he wished he had used this product since he wasn&#x27;t able to save as much of his hair.  </li>
            <li> neither my dog, I wish they had a more natural scent, maybe a soft herbal one....</li>
            <li> ok, the second time it absolutely did not detangle my hair.</li>
            <li> Last month Sally&#x27;s beauty supply had a \\&quot;buy one get one free\\&quot; sale, I bought 4, even though I still had a full bottle in the house!</li>
            <li> thoroughly, comb through from bottom to top and blow dry after)</li>
            <li> Two days later and my hair is still easy to comb.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has super curly hair that frequently tangles.  </li>
            <li> He is a mixture of pure chaos.</li>
            <li> , at least the little fellow looks pretty good and smells nice.</li>
            <li> sure enough it&#x27;s the little things that can cause the most damage.&lt;br</li>
            <li> sure enough it&#x27;s the little things that can cause the most damage.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After washing and conditioning, it used to be as smooth and slippery as could be, but now it snarls and tangles, especially at the nape of my neck.  </li>
            <li> this really helps get a brush through it</li>
            <li> This really works.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast and</li>
            <li> and I could not believe how much time I saved.</li>
            <li> Very well priced.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> However i would still need to really get in there to get the knot out.</li>
            <li> and it didnt really detangle my hair.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say enough fabulous things about this product without going on for pages and pages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use too much, otherwise hair feels greasy.</li>
            <li> And even when I use a lot, I have found it not to do much.</li>
            <li> Grooming is much easier now, Mane &#x27;n Tail detangler does the job.</li>
            <li> However, as I like for my hair to look sleek and straight, I didn&#x27;t like that</li>
            <li> She actually seems to enjoy it..</li>
            <li> straight ends).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a leave-in</li>
            <li> I sprayed this and combed her hair, and it was totally tangle free.  </li>
            <li> Performs it&#x27;s job really well, just spray and brush.</li>
            <li> I just started using this on my Havanese and it seems to make his grooming so much easier.</li>
            <li> that stuff was not helpful really.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have to use that much on my hair before the tangles just start sliding apart.</li>
            <li> I love this product as it does detangle as expected - if I shake the bottle before applying.</li>
            <li> It left him silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> This detangler works very well for my hair.</li>
            <li> This product works really well to manage the tangle.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> One person told me my hair looked like it should be in a TV commercial, it was so shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> and I go at it for 45 minutes straight.</li>
            <li> Her hair was so smooth and silky and it left no sticky residue or smell (</li>
            <li> which I was really worried about).</li>
            <li> thanks amazon.  </li>
            <li> Also i need a perm and its been 3mo and dis stuff really works.</li>
            <li> &#x27;n Tail Detangler really works.  </li>
            <li> Products like this are great at first, then after a year or so of use, suddenly your hair is falling out, or its a lot dryer than usual</li>
            <li> &#x27;n Tail Detangler is the only product that we have ever found that even comes close to our old favorite Clairol product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since I had a lot of individual locks, I had to do it over the course of two days, but I just sprayed them with conditioner each time I was uncombing them to ensure that they weren&#x27;t dry, waited a few minutes for it to soak in and was able to comb them out successfully.</li>
            <li> Wow!!!</li>
            <li> would recommend to anyone who has hair that is long and easily tangles.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves my daughters hair untangled while nothing else helped this much , i tried so many other detanglers</li>
            <li> Perfect for difficult tangles that I have to deal with, fixes them in no time at all!</li>
            <li> This works great to condition and detangle my little girls long hair</li>
            <li> It works better than any other product I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> I was a tad worried about the curly one(very long) but the curls stayed, I used a wire wig brush because I&#x27;ve noticed that curls tend to come out faster if you use a broad brush, the spray also makes the wigs very soft and smell rather nice</li>
            <li> I have long fine hair that will get all&lt;br /&gt;Frizzed</li>
            <li> I think this would be great for african american women who are natural and don&#x27;t mind the extra thickness that *</li>
            <li> The good thing is we could tell in about a week and a half to two weeks, not a month or two months like things you use to actually help hair grow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that i could use to detangle my natural hair easily and with the same as a QP elasta h20 before they changed the formula and messed it up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that a true fix to dry hair is first and foremost to take care of yourself from the inside out...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that a true fix to dry hair is first and foremost to take care of yourself from the inside out...</li>
            <li> I really like it, but it does need to be more moisturizing, especially for coarse hair.</li>
            <li> When I wash my hair and airdry it, the underprocessed parts tend to be very dry and tangle easily</li>
            <li> The only downside is that this stuff goes quick.  </li>
            <li> Its a must buy, this will be a main staple for my 4C texlaxed hair.</li>
            <li> In addition, I might add that I live in a desert, so high moisture/ intense hydration products are a must.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use a little more than the normal amount as per the directions, but I have to use a little more because I have much longer hair than normal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommended...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> &#x27;n Tail Detangler a little better.</li>
            <li> the bottle I purchased appeared to be little more than lightly-fragranced water.</li>
            <li> and I do wish it felt a little more moisturizing, but since I follow up with a leave-in conditioner, that makes up for it.  </li>
            <li> It gets tangled easily and seems as though it&#x27;s already begun getting tangled on one side as soon as I&#x27;ve finished brushing the other.</li>
            <li> I have spent hundreds of dollars trying to get my hair smooth again and nothing worked.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t get over how soft my hair feels.</li>
            <li> Overall the product is definently worth the money</li>
            <li> Spraying it all over and combing it through with my fingers like I normally would did nothing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I follow-up with my normal products</li>
            <li> This works great in my hair, and my hair is extremely long and thick.</li>
            <li> (Green juices, more iron in your diet, and lost and LOTS of water).</li>
            <li> (Green juices, more iron in your diet, and lost and LOTS of water).</li>
            <li> I sprayed this on dry hair and was able to brush through even tough knots pretty easily.  </li>
            <li> oh my when I saw the new look of this bottle not only did it make me smile</li>
            <li> This has a mild scent, disperses well, detangles wet just washed hair very well.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical that this would work on my daughter&#x27;s easily tangled fine hair, but it detangled her hair so easily!  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, my hair was very easy to comb through after using Mane &#x27;n Tail Detangler, but certain hairstyles (for example, a wrap) just wouldn&#x27;t be options after use because the style wouldn&#x27;t look right.  </li>
            <li> and I have ton of new growth.</li>
            <li> now it looks like new again</li>
            <li> I use this product every day to spray on my new growth to comb it out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an Italian female and my hair is on the \\&quot;fine\\&quot; side (although I have alot of it) but its VERY prone to getting knotty quick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s coarse because it has rarely ever been managed in it&#x27;s natural form.</li>
            <li> Balancing your hair and keeping it alcohol free is essential to hair health, and acidifying your hair is necessary for maintenance, shine and moisture</li>
            <li> Balancing your hair and keeping it alcohol free is essential to hair health, and acidifying your hair is necessary for maintenance, shine and moisture</li>
            <li> Oh and  after blow drying my hair is super soft and  shiny not hard and dry like it would of been .</li>
            <li> It does detangle somewhat, but I had to part my hair and spray directly onto each tangle, wait, and then comb it out for it to work (which took forever!).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to use it on my other wigs.</li>
            <li> By the way we shampoo our dog first with this shampoo/conditioner from the same company.</li>
            <li> No scent whatsoever (which is important to me due to my allergies)!</li>
            <li> I read a lot of articles stating that you cannot comb out dreadlocks; you supposedly have to cut your hair completely off and regrow it to a new style.</li>
            <li> I spray it on my freshly washed, towel-dried hair, comb through and then let my hair air dry.</li>
            <li> I began using this product about 2 weeks ago and have been able to get a cold through on the first try after spraying this on (literally the first run through with a comb!).</li>
            <li> wow...whether for humans or animals it works great on my long thick coarse hair.</li>
            <li> also if you are growing out your hair get the instant protien by mane and tail and just spray it on the ends of your hair and you will see less split ends and more growth.  </li>
            <li> I have really long hair that loves getting tangled and knotted and this is the first product that completely helped!</li>
            <li> In the case of some of these leave-ins, they usually carry a blend of ingredients that promotes a sort of illusory moisture, meaning it feels okay at first, but once the chemicals dry you may experience an adverse effect.</li>
            <li> The tangles come apart easily with little manipulation and, as a bonus, my hair is left feeling very soft!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any detangling effect and the bottle is heavy and huge.</li>
            <li> I have tried nearly every detangler product without much luck; however, this actually works.  </li>
            <li> I used this product while going through my transition from relaxed to natural hair.  </li>
            <li> I truly recommend this product for anyone who has natural or texlax hair.</li>
            <li> B000143JSK Mane &#x27;n Tail Detangler]], that problem is nearly non-existent.  </li>
            <li> It has worked perfectly so far and I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> His fur is wiry, sticking out in wild directions.</li>
            <li> I tried this &amp;#34;human&amp;#34; formulation but was quite ready to buy the veterinarian/equine strength if necessary.</li>
            <li> Using it does &amp;#34;manage&amp;#34; her natural wave somewhat but</li>
            <li> Im going to try to put a couple of natural essence lavender oil on it... to see if that helps the odor part..</li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling really soft but never oily.</li>
            <li> Make my hair soft to the touch and shiny.</li>
            <li> I would not waste your time on this.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it goes fast.  </li>
            <li> trying to transition from relaxed to natural.</li>
            <li> Without it, my hair snaps at the meeting point of the natural and relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> The texture of my relaxed hair after using this product doesnt feel soft and silky.</li>
            <li> this product is a necessity to my daily ritual as much as brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> I keep it near the door and if we are going somewhere</li>
            <li> I have friends of color with natural hair who swear by this stuff</li>
            <li> I have natural kinky hair.</li>
            <li> Well, this weekend for the first time in a LONG time....</li>
            <li> &quot; sounds were made, but no crying.  </li>
            <li> This leaves my hair feeling SO soft.</li>
            <li> She has this long feathery tail and the first time I used it</li>
            <li> much as I respect American business, so long as these over-the-counter leave-ins try to combine herbal ingredients with chemicals, they will never grant true health or repair to human hair.</li>

            <li> I start from the ends, sprizting and brushing, then slowly work my way up with more spraying and brushing.</li>
            <li> and it is miraculous that I can slip my fingers and then a wide tooth comb instantly right through without a struggle.</li>
            <li> for my own personal experience, my very curly and wavy hair is down to the middle of my back, and every inch of it has been dyed red for years.</li>
            <li> I am Caucasian with semi coarse wavy dark hair that is also fine and prone to breakage.</li>
            <li> Hair is an organic extension of the human body, so the products we use should be minimal, clean, and their richness should depend on the texture of your hair and the humidity in your environment.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t really use this on my hair, I use this to detangle my long cosplay wigs.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very long hair which gets very knotty.</li>
            <li> My hair does tangle easily, but it&#x27;s not overly thick or curly or anything.</li>
            <li> IT DEFINITELY MADE MY HAIR SOFT AND DETANGLED!</li>
            <li> My little girls have a lot of long, fine hair that tangles.</li>
            <li> so I can brush her hair without the usual screaming fit and keeps it easier to manage until the next wash!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have nearly mid-back length relaxed, but naturally coarse, hair.</li>
            <li> If you have intractable \\&quot;knots\\&quot; in your hair, use this spray liberally, let it sit for a while, and then use a wide tooth comb (gently).  </li>
            <li> I recently decided to go all natural and stop getting perms.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my mixed terrier dogs&#x27;s coat so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> but I was tired of combing out knots and am concerned with damaging my hair even more.</li>
            <li> Old school products will never let you down really..</li>
            <li> I had to use A LOT of sprays our first use, but now we don&#x27;t have to use but 10 or less sprays each bath.</li>
            <li> Personally, my hair is pretty short, and never really tangles.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Remember to shake the bottle before you spray, and be very careful about residue on surfaces like the floor (it will make it very slippery, although</li>
            <li> I am an African American with natural, texlaxed and relaxed hair which sometimes can cause a problem.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;it does not dry out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I originally tried it on wet hair and it helped a little.  </li>
            <li> Not sure it&#x27;s worth ordering this.</li>
            <li> Actually works... and my hair is very damaged thick and very curly....</li>
            <li> If you put too much in, it can weigh it down.  </li>
            <li> The spray cap mists onto hair and provides a wide area of coverage, and the spray itself has a decent smell, but overall, this product (like many others) merely provides the illusion of moisture.</li>
            <li> My hair is typically dry after I washit if I don&#x27;t use these products, but since I&#x27;ve been using them, it stays soft, curly and with proper moisture at all times.</li>
            <li> Since I have a big head, the puff of my new growth would make my head even bigger if I didnt comb it and lay it down damp.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive, almost 4 year old daughter whose hair gets so unbelievably matted and severely tangled on the daily.</li>
            <li> the foot long mess was just too much to detangle by that point without hurting her massively.  </li>
            <li> I come from a line of \\&quot;mixed\\&quot; type hair (half black half white), and tho my hair is not too coarse, it is very curly and dried easily.</li>
            <li> As for the detangling aspect of the product I don&#x27;t notice that it helps me detangle my hair very much when it&#x27;s wet; maybe it&#x27;s a little easier to comb through after I spray it on my hair.</li>
            <li> Also if you are trying to grow your hair long then you know that frequent washing is bad for it, better to let is grow out with the natural oils.</li>
            <li> * Then I would use other leave in conditioner like frizz ease or aussie, but I didn&#x27;t have soft hair after using it.</li>
            <li> No smell and works seamlessly with other products.</li>
            <li> Her hair is about 2 and a half feet long from her crown, it&#x27;s thick and pretty bone straight.</li>
            <li> I simply sprayed onto an old weighed down twistout and the tangles just fell.  </li>
            <li> Both our girls have natural hair that is extremely long and extremely curly as they are \\&quot;mixed kids\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> This product was the ONLY spray that I have ever used that completely detangled my long hair, wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> This is probably common-knowledge for women with long hair, but for a guy who tends to keep his hair short, things like this just don&#x27;t come up.</li>
            <li> In the bunch of us, we have mixed-chick hair, double processed hair, body waved, extremely long hair, etc.</li>
            <li> I can spray it on my flat ironed hair and brush it flat.</li>
            <li> Fed ex just droped this off along with my fusion flat irons</li>
            <li> Over the past couple of years my long, dry, coarse, color-treated hair, which literally never tangled before, has suddenly become very tangle-prone.  </li>
            <li> Usually apply this after shower and it makes my curls super managable, less frizzy.</li>
            <li> It really works, my granddaughter is 7yrs old Black and has very long, curly, thick hair, its to the middle of her back.  </li>
            <li> I just recently tried this on dry hair and it was amaaaazing how it got rid of the matted section.  </li>
            <li> Snarls that would have taken 10 minutes to work out are gone in 30 seconds now, and with far less hair loss.</li>
            <li> I have long, dense, wavy hair that is usually difficult to comb or brush through because it tends to tangle easily.</li>
            <li> I have a 2 year old with tight curly hair</li>
            <li> I have been natural my ENTIRE life and have used all sorts of products in my lifetime in the past 30+ years to detangle my hair after washing.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use a riducules amount to get the job done either so this size bottle goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Just a note, it only seems to work while it&#x27;s wet, if her hair gets matted I have to re-apply before brushing.</li>
            <li> Shoulder length when stretched.  </li>
            <li> However, I use it to detangle prior to washing my hair, so no real issues.</li>
            <li> I cut to about four inches long and then untangled from there -</li>
            <li> Would recommend for children who have issues with long hair and knots.</li>
            <li> It has a strange smell.</li>
            <li> This is a little watery and doesn&#x27;t have as much conditioning power as our previous spray.</li>
            <li> long, thick, very wavy and quite dry.  </li>
            <li> When I came back into the bathroom about an hour later I slipped and nearly fell down because the floor was so slick.</li>
            <li> The cost is next to nothing compared to other products that claim to grow hair.  </li>
            <li> It worked bout the same as the other stuff I have got before.</li>
            <li> this is making it more difficult to comb through!</li>
            <li> I have long, wavy and colored hair and it dose not detangle my hair!</li>
            <li> Nothing else has ever worked as I have been using it for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair.</li>
            <li> I did it once on dry hair</li>
            <li> Its kinked and dry.</li>
            <li> I wash, condition, towel dry and spray on the detangler.</li>
            <li> I let their coat air DRY (even if it takes all day or use a blow dryer to speed it up)</li>
            <li> If I find a knot before it&#x27;s time for a wash I saturate it with detangler, let it dry and then comb it out.</li>
            <li> I found it only by accident by reading other reviews on Amazon, so thank you other ladies for saving my long hair (and my sanity.)</li>
            <li> I brush my 10 year old daughters hair when I think of it, usually because it is so matted</li>
            <li> I have struggled for a long time with thick, coarse, frizzy and generally unruly hair.</li>
            <li> I can recommend this product for people such as myself, mixed race with my hair type: thin strands (not as thick as sewing thread), s pattern (definite waves), cottony texture (quite frizzy and takes awhile to get completely wet when washing), thick (circumference of ponytail greater than 4 inches).</li>
            <li> my hair is very thick and super tight curls.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve still got about half the bottle left.  </li>
            <li> I like to use it out of the shower when my hair is still wet and then blow dry it.</li>
            <li> This works well on wet and dry hair.  </li>
            <li> On wet or dry hair, we spray it liberally and then wait 5 minutes</li>
            <li> Works really well in my thick curly tangle pron hair!</li>
            <li> Bought this to use on my five year old daughter&#x27;s very thick very long hair which often becomes quite tangled (especially after a day at the pool).</li>
            <li> Fine hair tangles like crazy.</li>
            <li> It left little sheen after use, in some instances left wig a little sticky.  </li>
            <li> bottle lasts a long time too because a little goes a long ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I last relaxed my hair a few months ago I ended up underprocessed.</li>
            <li> If i left it for a few mintues the knot would definently loosen up for me.</li>
            <li> I brush my hair out when it&#x27;s wet</li>
            <li> I never would have expected this</li>
            <li> My girls don&#x27;t like the scent, so I add a few drops of various oils to change the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I never really considered using them</li>
            <li> Nooo give  it a sec or 2  .</li>
            <li> have a 5 year old Cocker Spaniel, named Dirk, who constantly gets matted hair behind his front legs.  </li>
            <li> but if you do it slow and gently, not only you dont hurt your dog, but it makes the brushing not such a traumatic experience for both of you...</li>
            <li> Then I saw it in my local supermarket for less money!  </li>
            <li> It worked, plain and simple.  </li>
            <li> I would never go back to plain water again.</li>
            <li> I have VERY thick, long naturally curly hair that tends to knot.</li>
            <li> I decided to cut it approximately 5-6 inches long prior to beginning the process to allow room for breakage, hoping to save at least 3-4 inches for a barber to cut it into my new curly style.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to go natural but combing through my hair was arduous.</li>
            <li> My hair would tangle after washing/condintioning as the two textures of hair tried to kill each other.  </li>
            <li> It usually takes me about 30-45 just to untangle my entire hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is over processed due to dye that I use to cover gray.</li>
            <li> I sprayed into my roots every other day and.......good news for all you people out there.....</li>
            <li> In the past it sometimes seemed necessary to cut out the snarls.  </li>
            <li> Of course, this probably just due to my hair texture.  </li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t as unruly as other people that I know use this product</li>
            <li> I paired this with a knot genie hair brush and we had only two &amp;#34;Ows!!&amp;#34; instead of the usual scream-a-thon.  </li>
            <li> A LITTLE DRY.</li>
            <li> (you can also try a slicker brush if it does not hurt the dog) and the hairs clumped together just enough to not fly in all different directions when coming out (the undercoat).  </li>
            <li> A few minutes after application, both my hair and my daughters felt dry yet gooey to the touch.</li>
            <li> about to buy a few bottles because I&#x27;m down to my last few drops and cant find the stuff in the stores.</li>
            <li> With prolonged conditioning, it can produce \\&quot;extremely\\&quot; tight spring coils when wet.</li>
            <li> Base on the information available about the Detangler, I bought two bottle with hope of it detangling any type of hair as describle unfortunate, that was not the case, direction said you could spray it on dry or wet hair with the same results, NOT TRUE, depending on your texture (Natural) it did not work for me at all.  </li>
            <li> Regardless, it&#x27;s just not right for me.</li>
            <li> I also wet my hair a little each morning, and although the [[ASIN:B003JN4URY Mane N Tail Conditioner 32 oz]] doesn&#x27;t state that it&#x27;s leave-in conditioner, I do that anyway.  </li>
            <li> have somewhat hard to manage coarse hair.</li>
            <li> other than that, its a puffy mess dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse hair</li>
            <li> this stuff helps keep that down.</li>
            <li> weighed down at all</li>
            <li> Does not weigh the hair down.  </li>
            <li> Or maybe the company is watering it down to maximize profits (?).</li>
            <li> This product also doesn&#x27;t build up in my hair and weigh it down.</li>
            <li> Or weigh it down which is a must.  </li>
            <li> before I brush them because wet tangles are hard to get out and the hair is weaker when it&#x27;s wet</li>
            <li> I used it with a detangling hairbrush called the Tangle Teezer, which I also got on Amazon, and it took less than 7 minutes.</li>
            <li> This arrived to me half empty....will just buy in store rather than online.</li>
            <li> and you regularly get seriously matted, tangled hair or if your child does.</li>
            <li> Heaven help me if I go a day without brushing when even sleeping on it can make it a gnarled mess.</li>
            <li> thing untangled my daughters long thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have really long, thick, CURLY hair.</li>
            <li> I have two Poms that have extremely thick, long coats</li>
            <li> I have very long thick wavy hair</li>
            <li> I have very long, thick hair.  </li>
            <li> And yes, I have tried EVERY SINGLE detangler, conditioner, product, you name it (at least to what I thought) until I found this miracle, almighty detangler GOD.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t even have to worry about the tangles that are there because I just spray this detangler on my hair and I can comb through them with little difficulty.</li>
            <li> and it made my hair a little sticky.  </li>
            <li> and my little doggy.</li>
            <li> It did little for tangles.  </li>
            <li> I have tried all the other no more tears and tangles stuff..</li>
            <li> Just a little bit and the tangles are gone.</li>
            <li> I CANNOT BELIEVE MY DEAR LITTLE EYES.</li>
            <li> This detangler calms his fur down long enough for me to give him a spit and a polish before he shakes his little body like crazy</li>
            <li> After a few minutes the hair should be a lot softer and easier to manipulate.  </li>
            <li> See a few pictures I have</li>
            <li> I feel that I wasted my money on this product.</li>
            <li> All you do is spray it on the hair and wait a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> A few sprays and it gets the tangles out.</li>
            <li> The water is HEAVY with chlorine for disinfecting purposes, so even with detangling shampoos/conditioners, my hair was stubborn...</li>
            <li> I sprayed the knots, let product sit for a few minutes, then attacked knots with a rat-tail</li>
            <li> I use this almost everyday.</li>
            <li> A few \\&quot;owww\\&quot; and \\&quot;ouchie\\</li>
            <li> I use it everyday on my relaxed/natural hair (6 months post).</li>
            <li> They have very tangled, curly hair and hate having it brushed.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;You still need to go slow and careful not too pull to harshly...</li>
            <li> It is going to be hard for anyone to convince me to use any other brand of detangler</li>
            <li> I have dozens of other leftover useless products as described above if I want my hair to smell</li>
            <li> It turns out that the detangler can make floors and other hard surfaces slippery.</li>
            <li> To quote another reviewer, \\&quot;It worked, plain and simple.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> Prior to undertaking this process, I had already cut off approximately 8 inches of hair, but my hair was still well past my shoulders.</li>
            <li> I used it on a friends dog to help detangle two pretty bad mats</li>
            <li> /&gt;Best experiences with this product:&lt;br /&gt;- Deployed to the dry &amp; dusty country of Afghanistan.</li>
            <li> Comb a tangle from the bottom up, not top down, for least breakage and quickest results.</li>
            <li> wanted to point out that it usually takes me 45 min.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually rave about a product</li>
            <li> Usually my detangling process takes around 45 mins</li>
            <li> Threw it away, what a waste of money!</li>
            <li> We bought this and Johnson and Johnson&#x27;s No More Tangles.</li>
            <li> I also have lived on the beach for the past 8 months</li>
            <li> My hair is just past my shoulders with very few layers.</li>
            <li> I used this on my daughter&#x27;s hair, she has thick and very tight curly hair (A.K.A. \\&quot;nappy\\&quot;).</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair (down to my waist and all one length).  </li>
            <li> My daughter has very thick, slightly wavy hair</li>
            <li> I have very long hair that is difficult to manage.</li>
            <li> I had tried all sorts of expensive detanglers and nothing worked until I tried this on DRY hair.  </li>
            <li> Then I switched to this, and now its a lot better--she hardly ever cries.</li>
            <li> its hard to find a product that i like</li>
            <li> If you are afraid of cones you may not want to get this since the second ingredient involved is dimethicone</li>
            <li> I wanted to keep some length with my remaining hair to wear it curly instead of cutting it off and starting from scratch.</li>
            <li> After washing my hair, I was unable to get a wide tooth comb thru and it was stuck at the root.</li>
            <li> it made my hair, well, \\&quot;poofy\\&quot;, as in extremely thick.  </li>
            <li> I do have naturally thick hair and get a relaxer every 4 months, so</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick, course hair with lots of tangling.  </li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair</li>
            <li> I mean this is a product that will allow me to use the finger</li>
            <li> You have to be very careful about getting it on the floor, though, because it&#x27;s slippery and difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> I actually had to CUT out a tangle, it was so impossibly snarled.  </li>
            <li> This product has seriously been a life saver for me.</li>
            <li> With that being said, after i take my extensions, i have massive nearly impossible knots that just dont want to come out without a fight.</li>
            <li> and I believe its not good for your hair</li>
            <li> Seriously you will be kicking yourself in the behind if you don&#x27;t buy this product</li>
            <li> I have a hatune miku wig and it is very hard to untangle.</li>
            <li> The detangler has literally cut my grooming time in half and my Poms aren&#x27;t miserable because I&#x27;m constantly yanking their hair out when I try to brush them.</li>
            <li> So, I have wavy/curly, thin, freezy hair.</li>
            <li> and I was so tired of ripping my hair out every morning trying to detangle it.</li>
            <li> hair is approximately 48\\</li>
            <li> This is just beating up my hair and it has been getting worse and worse.  </li>
            <li> My hair tangles like crazy and takes even hair dressers at least 15 minutes to detangle.</li>
            <li> My old detangler was discontinued (hate when that happens!)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make hair quite as slippery as the expensive</li>
            <li> you are skeptical, just try it yourself for a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> Sorry, I bought two bottles.</li>
            <li> both kiddos are tender-headed, unfortunately.  </li>
            <li> Also if my daughters hair is getting frizzy (she has crazy curls)</li>
            <li> but I just got too desperate.</li>
            <li> she does nt like to be groomed, yet her undercoat get quite bad, and so does her tail and legs....</li>
            <li> It had a really bad section that was matted.  </li>
            <li> too bad because her muzzle could use it.</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to untangle (even with moisturizer) and there have been times when I almost needed to break out the scissors!</li>
            <li> Blow-drying it and combing or brushing had become painful!  </li>
            <li> She hated getting her hair done.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> After every shower it would be horrible.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell as terrible to me as it seemed to to some people.</li>
            <li> Tangles my AA hair horribly!</li>
            <li> and it snarls real bad</li>
            <li> but the seller is horrible, i recommend the product but buy it anywhere else.</li>
            <li> this product still came through best.&lt;br /&gt;- Terrible micro braid removal experience with KNOTS.</li>

            <li> Over the past couple of years my long, dry, coarse, color-treated hair, which literally never tangled before, has suddenly become very tangle-prone.  After washing and conditioning, it used to be as smooth and slippery as could be, but now it snarls and tangles, especially at the nape of my neck.  No idea why, though it&#x27;s possible the change may be thyroid-related.  Blow-drying it and combing or brushing had become painful!  I actually had to CUT out a tangle, it was so impossibly snarled.  Anyway, I got some of this stuff, and it has definitely helped.  I no longer have to wince while gingerly brushing my hair; the brush sails through like it used to.  I am relieved and satisfied.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm. I needed something to help brush out my synthetic wigs. This is wonderful.</li>
            <li> This detangler works great for my thick curly hair. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> thing untangled my daughters long thick hair. I love this stuff and there is no build up</li>
            <li> Perfect for difficult tangles that I have to deal with, fixes them in no time at all!</li>
            <li> This detangels really good. I&#x27;m glad I ran across it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Cosplayers - we&#x27;ve all been there. You get home after a convention. You&#x27;re sobbing over your once-beautiful wig that&#x27;s now so tangled that it resembles a rat&#x27;s nest more than it does something you&#x27;d wear on your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cue Mane &#x27;n Tail. Apply liberally to wig, starting at the bottom. Brush gently from bottom to top. Spray more. Brush more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Voila. Wig saved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cried genuine tears of relief over this product. It does wonders for your wigs. I can&#x27;t imagine styling one without this anymore.</li>
            <li> This is a little watery and doesn&#x27;t have as much conditioning power as our previous spray.</li>
            <li> Makes my daughters hair very soft and easy to brush.</li>
            <li> This is the best detangler out there I find that it works on dry hair also great product removes tangles fast I have long fine hair that will get all&lt;br /&gt;Frizzed up after washing it this really helps get a brush through it</li>
            <li> I used this product while going through my transition from relaxed to natural hair.  My hair would tangle after washing/condintioning as the two textures of hair tried to kill each other.  It worked, plain and simple.  You don&#x27;t have to use a riducules amount to get the job done either so this size bottle goes a long way. The only thing I would change is the smell. It&#x27;s not the nicest in the world for me and the smell tends to linger for a while after it&#x27;s been used.  That would be the only Con I would have about it.</li>
            <li> This really works.  Tip: put water and castor oil in it and it will be the best detangler ever!!</li>
            <li> This product has seriously been a life saver for me. I have really long, thick, CURLY hair. After every shower it would be horrible. I used to comb it before/in the shower and again after my shower. Now I don&#x27;t even have to worry about the tangles that are there because I just spray this detangler on my hair and I can comb through them with little difficulty. I am probably going to have to get the shampoo and conditioner too!!</li>
            <li> um. YES. yes yes and yes. this thing is heaven sent. I have a 2 year old with tight curly hair (shes biracial) and I used to use water to detangle her hair and put leave in conditioner after. She cried a lot more back then. She hated getting her hair done. I tried not to pull on it, but it was tangled. Then I switched to this, and now its a lot better--she hardly ever cries. all I do is spray all around (its like a mist) and gently massage her hair to make sure its in, then I start to run my fingers through it to detangle. it detangles super easy. I would never go back to plain water again. I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I know this sounds funny but this works like magic in my daughters very curly and unruly hair.  It makes it so I can brush her hair without the usual screaming fit and keeps it easier to manage until the next wash!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY suggest you try it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also use it on horses and King Charles Cavaliers (dogs).  We bought our daughter her OWN bottle ;)</li>
            <li> BEST detangler! So many make hair greasy but I can use this on my daughter as much as I want and her hair is shiny and smooth! I will never buy anything else!</li>
            <li> Best detangler on the market</li>
            <li> Worked great at detangling manes and tails!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love silicone but this is the best detangler I&#x27;ve found. My hair is too longt o been without it now.</li>
            <li> I used this on my daughter&#x27;s hair, she has thick and very tight curly hair (A.K.A. \\&quot;nappy\\&quot;). I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast and well it worked. It is going to be hard for anyone to convince me to use any other brand of detangler</li>
            <li> I adore this detangler!  I tend to put this on my damp hair and gently rake with a tooth comb for better results.  I did it once on dry hair and it made my hair a little sticky.  If you are afraid of cones you may not want to get this since the second ingredient involved is dimethicone it&#x27;s something to keep in mind.  Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with how manageable my hair became with the product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my two miniature schnauzer dogs.  They have very tangled, curly hair and hate having it brushed.  I sprayed this on dry hair and was able to brush through even tough knots pretty easily.  It even smells pretty good (light fragrance that smells clean).  A total winner!</li>
            <li> First of all, I&#x27;m a man who used this product. I read a lot of articles stating that you cannot comb out dreadlocks; you supposedly have to cut your hair completely off and regrow it to a new style. I didn&#x27;t want to do that, so I kept researching the issue until I came across an article claiming that this product could be used to save some of your hair.    Once I found out where I could buy it, I purchased it as well as their conditioner from a local beauty supply store. Prior to undertaking this process, I had already cut off approximately 8 inches of hair, but my hair was still well past my shoulders. I wanted to keep some length with my remaining hair to wear it curly instead of cutting it off and starting from scratch. I decided to cut it approximately 5-6 inches long prior to beginning the process to allow room for breakage, hoping to save at least 3-4 inches for a barber to cut it into my new curly style.    I followed the instructions on the bottle, and as promised, it enabled me to comb out my locks and save a lot of my hair. Since I had a lot of individual locks, I had to do it over the course of two days, but I just sprayed them with conditioner each time I was uncombing them to ensure that they weren&#x27;t dry, waited a few minutes for it to soak in and was able to comb them out successfully. As a matter of fact, the barber that I went to had undergone a similar process, and he said that he wished he had used this product since he wasn&#x27;t able to save as much of his hair.  My hair actually ended up being longer than anticipated; since I was able to comb out most of it without any breakage, the barber was able to trim it while retaining most of my length.    With the remainder, I use it to spray and comb out my hair prior to washing and conditioning it. I also wet my hair a little each morning, and although the [[ASIN:B003JN4URY Mane N Tail Conditioner 32 oz]] doesn&#x27;t state that it&#x27;s leave-in conditioner, I do that anyway.  My hair is typically dry after I washit if I don&#x27;t use these products, but since I&#x27;ve been using them, it stays soft, curly and with proper moisture at all times.</li>
            <li> This product is truly amazing. I am African American. I have not relaxed my hair for about 6 months and I have ton of new growth. I could not comb my hair at all prior to using this product when preparing to style my hair after washing. I used it today for the first time and I could not believe how much time I saved. It usually takes me about 30-45 just to untangle my entire hair. I truly recommend this product for anyone who has natural or texlax hair. AMAZING!!!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell as terrible to me as it seemed to to some people. It would not stop me from buying it again. Works great.</li>
            <li> works with my hair just fine.</li>
            <li> Great for hair extensions</li>
            <li> Tangles my AA hair horribly!</li>
            <li> I cannot be without this stuff! I have nearly mid-back length relaxed, but naturally coarse, hair. When I last relaxed my hair a few months ago I ended up underprocessed. When I wash my hair and airdry it, the underprocessed parts tend to be very dry and tangle easily (they actually tend to lock up!) It is very difficult to untangle (even with moisturizer) and there have been times when I almost needed to break out the scissors! Without this detangler it would easily take over an hour to completely detangle my hair. However, a couple of sprays of this detangler on the tangled sections of my hair and my problems are solved. The tangles come apart easily with little manipulation and, as a bonus, my hair is left feeling very soft! I&#x27;ll be making sure to never run out of this because it has definitely saved my hair.

            <li> For the price of this product, which is almost nothing, it does a fabulous job of detangling and making your hair feel soft and silky.  I figured if my Mom could use it on her horse&#x27;s tail, why not my hair?  I also heard that many women use this on their own hair and now I know why.  I won&#x27;t pay more for other products any more!</li>
            <li> I was super excited to try this product. My hair tangles like crazy and takes even hair dressers at least 15 minutes to detangle. So after researching, I decided to go to Sally&#x27;s and give this a try. It sure made my bathroom floor slippery, but did NOTHING FOR MY HAIR except make it smell good. Honestly it made it feel dry and brittle. I tried putting it in, letting it sit awhile then detangling. Then I tried just doing it as I styled my hair. No. I used probably 75 sprays of the stuff and it made 0 difference. The second star is only for the smell. I will continue to try and find something that actually works on my mane.</li>
            <li> I WAS 32 WEEKS POST WHEN I WAS ABOUT TO GIVE UP AND RELAX MY HAIR! I HAVE THIIIIICK AFRICAN AMERICAN HAIR AND IT WAS FULL OF NEW GROWTH. I HEARD RANTS AND RAVES ABOUT THIS ALL OVER THE YT AND DECIDED TO TRY IT. BOY AM I HAPPY I DID. IT DEFINITELY MADE MY HAIR SOFT AND DETANGLED! LOL I LOVE THIS STUFF. I WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT 5 STARS IF IT WORKED AS GOOD ON DRY HAIR. IT DE-TANGLES YES, BUT HAVE TO FOLLOW UP WITH MOISTURIZER BECAUSE IT MAKES MY HAIR A LITTLE DRY. BUT OTHER THAN THAT, ITS PERFECT !</li>
            <li> I purchased [[ASIN:B000143JSK Mane &#x27;n Tail Detangler]] to use on my dog.  Just wanted to get that out there up front.  Personally, my hair is pretty short, and never really tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I digress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a 5 year old Cocker Spaniel, named Dirk, who constantly gets matted hair behind his front legs.  We normally end up having to take him to a groomer and the groomer ends up shaving off most of the hair on his legs to get through the mats.  We try our best to brush him, but he likes to bite the brush, and that isn&#x27;t the easiest thing to try and negotiate when trying to brush out your dog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With [[ASIN:B000143JSK Mane &#x27;n Tail Detangler]], that problem is nearly non-existent.  It&#x27;s probably best to bathe your dog before you use this product, but once the dog has had a chance to dry a bit, just spray [[ASIN:B000143JSK Mane &#x27;n Tail Detangler]], liberally, into the matted hair and allow it to sit for awhile.  After a few minutes the hair should be a lot softer and easier to manipulate.  If you need to, spray even more [[ASIN:B000143JSK Mane &#x27;n Tail Detangler]] on the spots until you&#x27;ve managed to work out most of the kinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- This product has a very nice smell to it.  A lot of hair care products, especially for dogs, seem to smell overly-perfumed&lt;br /&gt;- This product does not irritate my dog&#x27;s skin, which is the problem with many of the canine hair care products on the market&lt;br /&gt;- This product works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- With this being a spray bottle, you&#x27;re probably going to get some on you, so you&#x27;ll want to wash your hands after you&#x27;re finished&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Decision: Buy this product if you have trouble keeping your dog&#x27;s hair straight and untangled.  I suppose it would probably work just as well on human hair, but I haven&#x27;t tried it yet.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make hair quite as slippery as the expensive It&#x27;s a 10 leave in treatment, but Mane and Tail is amazing. I am Caucasian with semi coarse wavy dark hair that is also fine and prone to breakage. My hair is over processed due to dye that I use to cover gray. This has a mild scent, disperses well, detangles wet just washed hair very well. My hair is just past my shoulders with very few layers. Very well priced.  I think there is an herbal extract in this that makes it work so well. Makes my hair shinier and healthier looking. I also have M an T deep conditioner. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair…there is no possible way I could comb or brush my hair after a shower without a detangler and this one works awesome…trust me…i&#x27;d be complaining if it wasn&#x27;t…if you require a detangler….this will work…I guarantee it….go for it!!</li>
            <li> I wear my hair in microbraids for an extended amount of time. With that being said, after i take my extensions, i have massive nearly impossible knots that just dont want to come out without a fight. I found that this detangler worked okay with those knots. If i left it for a few mintues the knot would definently loosen up for me. However i would still need to really get in there to get the knot out. Overall the product is definently worth the money and i will defiently continue to purchase it cuz its a better detangler than the rest lol</li>
            <li> Have gone through numerous products searching for something that would untangle my waist-length hair.  I ride a motorcycle and even with braiding both sides of my hair and tying off every 3-4 inches, I still end up with tangled hair at the end of the day.  Have tried all sorts of conditioners, leave-in conditioners, hair breakage products, untangling products, smooth and silky products, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was the only one that would help me get the tangles out.  To quote another reviewer, \\&quot;It worked, plain and simple.\\&quot;  I use a little more than the normal amount as per the directions, but I have to use a little more because I have much longer hair than normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer mentioned something about the smell.  This product was originally made for horses.  I bought it to get the tangles out, not to make my hair smell pretty...I have dozens of other leftover useless products as described above if I want my hair to smell nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;********  07/19/2012  Update  **********&lt;br /&gt;2 things I&#x27;ve noticed since I bought this 4 months ago...neither of which changes my original 4 star rating.&lt;br /&gt;1) this bottle will last a while.  I use about 8 sprays a day and I&#x27;ve still got about half the bottle left.  2) I have tile floor in my bathroom and the residue from the spray makes the floor super slippery.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use on one of my wigs. It has worked perfectly so far and I have no complaints. I also like the way it smells.</li>
            <li> I tried this on my hair after I washed it and it didnt really detangle my hair. However I used this on my dog and it worked really good. I will try it again on my hair and hopefully have better results</li>
            <li> This is perfect for my long straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wake up with dread locks but this detangler does magic! I start from the ends, sprizting and brushing, then slowly work my way up with more spraying and brushing. My hair look beautiful in no time at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bottle lasts a long time too because a little goes a long ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have cranky hair, you need this for sure. Also if you are trying to grow your hair long then you know that frequent washing is bad for it, better to let is grow out with the natural oils. This keeps you tangle free and looking great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough fabulous things about this product without going on for pages and pages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and my little doggy. He is a mixture of pure chaos. His fur is wiry, sticking out in wild directions. This detangler calms his fur down long enough for me to give him a spit and a polish before he shakes his little body like crazy so his fur is sticking out in all angle again, at least the little fellow looks pretty good and smells nice. See a few pictures I have shared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it 5 wonderful awesome tangle free stars for a quality product that really works and does it job quite nicely.</li>
            <li> This gets the tangles out.  I am an African American with natural, texlaxed and relaxed hair which sometimes can cause a problem.  One time I gave myself a protein treatment which I found out that my hair did not like.  The Mane N Tail Detangler was a miracle worker!</li>
            <li> The bottle is large and the detangling effect is great to. I brush my hair out when it&#x27;s wet and it snarls real bad and I end up ripping my hair out but I haven&#x27;t when I use this. Also if my daughters hair is getting frizzy (she has crazy curls) this stuff helps keep that down. It&#x27;s not for the frizzy stuff but considering her detangle stuff doesn&#x27;t do that I just use this sometimes on her. The scent isn&#x27;t strong and it smells nice. I&#x27;ve had this for awhile and love it and will probably buy it again.</li>
            <li> Great price, but you get what you pay for. For 3$ I got a bottle of water. Fortunately I was able to pick up some Miracle 7 leave in conditioner that worked a whole lot better than this stuff, which is going in the trash. I have no idea why people love this company, I&#x27;m guessing for the cheap-o prices, but it doesn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li> This is a great detangler. My little girls have a lot of long, fine hair that tangles. This helps to takes them out pretty well. If you put too much in, it can weigh it down.  Also, this totally grows hair too! I noticed about 2 weeks after use, that my girl&#x27;s hair felt thicker and was longer. After about a month, there was no question about it. It was for sure thicker and longer.  My husband, mother in law, friends all noticed. So, I decided to try it. I sprayed into my roots every other day and.......good news for all you people out there.....IT WORKED!  Part was getting more dense and it was growing longer. I never would have expected this but what a wonderful discovery! Plus, it is cheap. I have not used the shampoo and conditioner.  The good thing is we could tell in about a week and a half to two weeks, not a month or two months like things you use to actually help hair grow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are skeptical, just try it yourself for a couple of weeks. The cost is next to nothing compared to other products that claim to grow hair.  As for the tangles, it works for us. My girls don&#x27;t like the scent, so I add a few drops of various oils to change the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel great!, worth the few dollars to get those tangles out. Don&#x27;t use too much, otherwise hair feels greasy.</li>
            <li> So far, not overly impressed with this product. Unless I use a lot of it, there&#x27;s no improvement in my tangled hair. And even when I use a lot, I have found it not to do much. My hair does tangle easily, but it&#x27;s not overly thick or curly or anything. I have found better luck with It&#x27;s a Miracle detangler. But it is more expensive.</li>
            <li> It makes it so easy to brush through my hair. After i use it my hair is nice and silky and it leaves my hair feeling soft&amp; silky. YOU MUST BUY IT!!!!</li>
            <li> While it is no \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; detangler, it is definitely the closest thing I have found! This actually does make the task easier. My daughter has very long hair which gets very knotty. I have found that it WORKS BEST ON WET HAIR and it seems to keep it from getting knotted back up for quite a while. I have tried special brushes and other sprays, and this is by far the best thing I have found, so I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars not because it&#x27;s necessarily perfect but because it definitely trumps the other products out there!</li>
            <li> the product itself is probably good, ive used mane  and tail products before and was satisfied but the seller is horrible, i recommend the product but buy it anywhere else.</li>
            <li> I have very long thick wavy hair and it tangles very easily so I bought this hoping it would help. It helped me, But It worked bout the same as the other stuff I have got before.</li>
            <li> It left little sheen after use, in some instances left wig a little sticky.  It did little for tangles.  A good creme rinse would have done a better job.  I feel that I wasted my money on this product.</li>
            <li> I used this on a cat I couldn&#x27;t get the hairballs off of.  It worked ok, still best on horses!</li>
            <li> We sometimes have to cut the hairbands out of my daughter&#x27;s hair, and she hates to get brushed out after. In the past it sometimes seemed necessary to cut out the snarls.  Yikes! Grooming is much easier now, Mane &#x27;n Tail detangler does the job. I tried this &amp;#34;human&amp;#34; formulation but was quite ready to buy the veterinarian/equine strength if necessary. I&#x27;m okay with spritzing my daughter with it since all of the ingredients are edible/food quality. Using it does &amp;#34;manage&amp;#34; her natural wave somewhat but the big advantage is the brushing. Just a note, it only seems to work while it&#x27;s wet, if her hair gets matted I have to re-apply before brushing.</li>
            <li> This is really a good detangler.  All you do is spray it on the hair and wait a few minutes.  It makes combing through hair that&#x27;s tangled a breeze.  I&#x27;ve used it on both wet and dry hair and gotten excellent results as far as the detangling goes.  However, as I like for my hair to look sleek and straight, I didn&#x27;t like that it made my hair, well, \\&quot;poofy\\&quot;, as in extremely thick.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, my hair was very easy to comb through after using Mane &#x27;n Tail Detangler, but certain hairstyles (for example, a wrap) just wouldn&#x27;t be options after use because the style wouldn&#x27;t look right.  Of course, this probably just due to my hair texture.  I do have naturally thick hair and get a relaxer every 4 months, so I&#x27;m not saying this to dissuade anyone from purchasing, I&#x27;m just trying to give someone a heads up that it could happen.  I think this would be great for african american women who are natural and don&#x27;t mind the extra thickness that *may* occur to their hair or for adults/children of any race with virgin hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my toy poodles that get tangles.  I can brush them and they have no discomfort, it&#x27;s a groomers dream.  If you have a dog that has hair that tangles, this is for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an Italian female and my hair is on the \\&quot;fine\\&quot; side (although I have alot of it) but its VERY prone to getting knotty quick. This product is a must have. Nothing else has ever worked as I have been using it for a very long time. I dampen my hair with it, then use a wide tooth comb to get all the knots out, and of course- all the knots come out perfectly  each and every time! Like my post says, I always have extra bottles in the house. Last month Sally&#x27;s beauty supply had a \\&quot;buy one get one free\\&quot; sale, I bought 4, even though I still had a full bottle in the house!</li>
            <li> Wow!!! I can&#x27;t believe what it does to my hair, before I got this, I was doing my oil treatments with refined and unrefined olive oil *now I have unrefined* for my roots and virgin coconut oil for the ends of my hair, leave it in for a hour or so, then shampoo with mane and tail shampoo and body conditioner *both are proteins* Then I would use other leave in conditioner like frizz ease or aussie, but I didn&#x27;t have soft hair after using it. Then once I got this I used it right away after my shower, shake it up, then spray away. When my hair dried, wow was it so soft and not feeling heavy/weighed down at all, I couldn&#x27;t stop touching it! I will always buy this and I hope the formula never changes!!!</li>
            <li> I dont like the smell neither my dog, I wish they had a more natural scent, maybe a soft herbal one....&lt;br /&gt;But it does the job.  I have a toy schnauzer that I recently rescued... she does nt like to be groomed, yet her undercoat get quite bad, and so does her tail and legs.... and this wrks great... I got a very soft plastic brush that does not pull her hair but is able to work in the matts.... she fusses a bet when I spray it, but once that I start brushing her, and she sees that it does nt hurt, she cooperates and enjoys the brushing of her undercarriage ( ;-)  )... it does wonders with her tail and her legs... I plan to order an extra bottle... only RECOMMENDATION TO MAKERS... CHANGE THE SCENT.... smells sort of like hair spray, and Im not fan of those odors... but it makes brushing her a pleasure...&lt;br /&gt;You still need to go slow and careful not too pull to harshly... but if you do it slow and gently, not only you dont hurt your dog, but it makes the brushing not such a traumatic experience for both of you... She actually seems to enjoy it.. Im going to try to put a couple of natural essence lavender oil on it... to see if that helps the odor part.. I dont care for my dog going around smelling like a beauty parlor...... but that is a personal preference</li>
            <li> I love it, with a wire comb or brush it&#x27;s magic, I used it on one of my longer wigs(spray thoroughly, comb through from bottom to top and blow dry after) and it&#x27;s amazing for both straight haired wigs and curly wigs! I was a tad worried about the curly one(very long) but the curls stayed, I used a wire wig brush because I&#x27;ve noticed that curls tend to come out faster if you use a broad brush, the spray also makes the wigs very soft and smell rather nice&lt;br /&gt;very pleased with the results definitely buying more of this when I run out</li>
            <li> I loved the Mane N Tail shampoo and conditioner, but this just didn&#x27;t do it for me. It does detangle somewhat, but I had to part my hair and spray directly onto each tangle, wait, and then comb it out for it to work (which took forever!). Spraying it all over and combing it through with my fingers like I normally would did nothing.&lt;br /&gt;I have African American transitioning hair (thick/curly/kinky roots and relaxed/straight ends). It might work for you, but it did not for me.</li>
            <li> This right here??!!!  First off, African Anerican 4c hair.  Shoulder length when stretched.  Medium density.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, this stuff is amazing.  Liquid consistency.  Comes out as a descent mist (not a squirt.). Smells light and refreshing.  Does not weigh the hair down.  I simply sprayed onto an old weighed down twistout and the tangles just fell.  I mean this is a product that will allow me to use the finger detangle only method.  It&#x27;s really a leave-in but I used it as a prepoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also wanted to point out that it usually takes me 45 min. to detangle.  With this product it literally took me about 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies (and brothers) before you cut all your natural hair off in frustration because the detangling takes forever, give this inexpensive amazing product a try.</li>
            <li> This detangler is great for all hair types. It worked well for my relaxed hair as well as my extensions.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found it! So, I have wavy/curly, thin, freezy hair. Usually apply this after shower and it makes my curls super managable, less frizzy. No greasy effect even when I spray a lot! No scent whatsoever (which is important to me due to my allergies)! But still I try not to use it every day because it contains  dimethicone and I believe its not good for your hair</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this! You can tell the difference it makes with your hair with the first use! It made my hair easier to manage and added shine. Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I tried to order this from a company online and did not receive it.  But luckily I found it at my Rite-Aid.  This is the best detangling spray I have ever used.  It really works, my granddaughter is 7yrs old Black and has very long, curly, thick hair, its to the middle of her back.  And it gets tangled and knotted up a lot.  I sprayed this and combed her hair, and it was totally tangle free.  She was so funny, she said it doesn&#x27;t hurt to comb now, buy 2 more bottles of that spray.  Needless to say I will be stocking up on this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I have used this item before and it is still as good as ever and I was pleased as always.</li>
            <li> Performs it&#x27;s job really well, just spray and brush. Leaves hair feeling really soft but never oily. I like to use it out of the shower when my hair is still wet and then blow dry it. I feel like it gives my hair volume.</li>
            <li> This product has a great scent, and makes it very easy to detangle thick knotted hair. On top of this, it&#x27;s a great price. Thanks Mane &#x27;n Tail!</li>
            <li> wow...whether for humans or animals it works great on my long thick coarse hair. I&#x27;ve always noticed the horses on the product but never paid any attention because Mane n&#x27; Tail has been around for over 15 years. Go figure it was first made for horses (hence the 2 on the product). I like this stuff. I use the shampoo for color and the detangler. Next it&#x27;s going to deep shampoo and conditioner. If it&#x27;s good enough for horses that make their coats and tails pretty and it&#x27;s harmless, why not, besides it makes my hair AWESOME!!!</li>
            <li> This is good stuff! Keeps my human hair wig free of tangles and easy to brush and mantain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not a fan of the feel and scent. However, I use it to detangle prior to washing my hair, so no real issues.</li>
            <li> This item bought as gift and part of shampoo/conditioner.  Young lady thrilled with combo.  I&#x27;m happy with buying experience and prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> This product is truly miraculous!  I have very long, thick hair.  It had a really bad section that was matted.  I had tried all sorts of expensive detanglers and nothing worked until I tried this on DRY hair.  I originally tried it on wet hair and it helped a little.  I just recently tried this on dry hair and it was amaaaazing how it got rid of the matted section.  Yes, it did take a while of working the area over a couple of times.  But it did smooth out that section of hair that was so matted that I thought I would have to cut it out.  That area is now smooth and silky.  Love it!  I&#x27;ll never be without this detangler again.</li>
            <li> Seems to work about as well as conditioner and water mixed together in a spray bottle.  Not sure it&#x27;s worth ordering this.</li>
            <li> Works really well in my thick curly tangle pron hair! Make my hair soft to the touch and shiny.</li>
            <li> This definitely didn&#x27;t detangle my hair. I have African American 4b type of hair and I decided to go back to my mizani products. I would not waste your time on this.</li>
            <li> Makes our poms hair easy to manage and  detangle after a bath. Smell nice and doesn&#x27;t seem to bother his skin.</li>
            <li> Works magically hair is soft detangled and shiny</li>
            <li> I just started using this on my Havanese and it seems to make his grooming so much easier.</li>
            <li> I got this recommended to me by other cosplayers for their wigs and this is great for untangling wigs with ease.</li>
            <li> Actually works... and my hair is very damaged thick and very curly.... I also purchased Detangling Brush By Crave Naturals  and with these two items I no longer have issues with getting knots having to pull on my hair to brush it out... I&#x27;m glad cause I was just gonna cut my hair but with this I am instead just going to trim off split ends and let it grow out... but I digress... HIGHLY recommended...actually works and I have tried all the other no more tears and tangles stuff.. that stuff was not helpful really.</li>
            <li> This stuff is like magic! Just a little bit and the tangles are gone. It is great for my daughter who sometimes forgets to us conditioner in the shower. We love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Better than most Detanglers.&lt;br /&gt;I like how you can leave it in and&lt;br /&gt;it does not dry out.&lt;br /&gt;Thank YOu.</li>
            <li> I have a hatune miku wig and it is very hard to untangle. But this helped me untangle it im sooooo happy now it looks like new again</li>
            <li> This works great on my own hair, and it was almost able to detangle an awful synthetic wig that I own (which is quite a feat). I&#x27;m excited to use it on my other wigs.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that i could use to detangle my natural hair easily and with the same as a QP elasta h20 before they changed the formula and messed it up. Right now this is my go too it gets the job done..also if you are growing out your hair get the instant protien by mane and tail and just spray it on the ends of your hair and you will see less split ends and more growth.  good buy here</li>
            <li> This works well on wet and dry hair.  I love the product.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick, course hair with lots of tangling.  It works OK.  I&#x27;ve used better products that don&#x27;t seem to be on the market aymore, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Works wonders! I don&#x27;t really use this on my hair, I use this to detangle my long cosplay wigs. Works great! Recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and I was hoping this product would help with my frizzy hair but it didn&#x27;t as a matter of fact it made it feel sort of greasy and it didn&#x27;t help at all with my curls......</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African with 4c hair, this product is a God send!!!, my fingers are screaming out as I type this. Detangling my hair has always been a chore, headache and at one point I thought my hair and I have to part ways until I found this product. I use this daily. I don&#x27;t usually rave about a product but Gosh it&#x27;s great. Usually my detangling process takes around 45 mins now it&#x27;s 10-15 mins tops. Oh the shedding reduced dramatically.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s the hype all about? I have thick, coarse hair and this didn&#x27;t detangle my hair at all. Threw it away, what a waste of money!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t do my hair without this detangler.  A few sprays and it gets the tangles out. I use it all the time.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any detangling effect and the bottle is heavy and huge.</li>
            <li> One of the best detanglers I have used.  I have very curly hair.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t begin to tell you how awesome this product is!! I have very long hair that is difficult to manage. I get knots every night from tossing around in the bed and I was so tired of ripping my hair out every morning trying to detangle it. Mane N Tail works wonders. I don&#x27;t even have to use that much on my hair before the tangles just start sliding apart. I&#x27;ve noticed it leaves my hair with a nice silky feeling throughout the day as well. Seriously, this is the best detangler on the market!!!</li>
            <li> Works as advertised! I&#x27;m trying to go natural but combing through my hair was arduous. I needed something that loosened it and this has done the trick!</li>
            <li> The best detangler for long hair! My hair isn&#x27;t as unruly as other people that I know use this product but I was tired of combing out knots and am concerned with damaging my hair even more. This detangler works like magic - it saves me time and stops a lot of the breakage I used to get.</li>
            <li> Bought this to use on my five year old daughter&#x27;s very thick very long hair which often becomes quite tangled (especially after a day at the pool). We bought this and Johnson and Johnson&#x27;s No More Tangles. Both work great and each has a nice yet subtle smell. Although it was a bit of a toss up as both products are great we both tended to like the Mane &#x27;n Tail Detangler a little better. It&#x27;s extremely effective and has become our go to this summer!</li>
            <li> I love this product as it does detangle as expected - if I shake the bottle before applying. I realized this through trial and and error. Someone else mentioned to shake the contents also and it does make a big difference.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to use on your Dog if you are Grooming him.&lt;br /&gt;I used this on my wiry JRT during brushing with a fine comb (you can also try a slicker brush if it does not hurt the dog) and the hairs clumped together just enough to not fly in all different directions when coming out (the undercoat).  But not enough to tangle.  It left him silky smooth.  The only downside is that this stuff goes quick.  I used it on a friends dog to help detangle two pretty bad mats and it&#x27;s wonderful.  I let it set for about ten minutes.  The longer tangle from her tail I cut to about four inches long and then untangled from there - the foot long mess was just too much to detangle by that point without hurting her massively.  I really love this product.  The only downside is that it goes fast.  I estimate that one 12 oz bottle holds about 6-8 uses for Dog Grooming.  I would love to get my hands on some, wholesale.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair. This stuff WORKED! I have bought every product out there. I can&#x27;t believe how big of a difference this made! I have spent hundreds of dollars trying to get my hair smooth again and nothing worked. I hope they never go out of business! It was super cheap and I love it. Will buy a dozen on payday</li>
            <li> oh my when I saw the new look of this bottle not only did it make me smile but I was happy with the product as well.</li>
            <li> Eeverything about this detangler is great , the smell isn&#x27;t so great , but ok .. the packaging isn&#x27;t so attractive too but if you compare it to what it does you wouldn&#x27;t care less. It leaves my daughters hair untangled while nothing else helped this much , i tried so many other detanglers this is value for money period.</li>
            <li> I have struggled for a long time with thick, coarse, frizzy and generally unruly hair. It gets tangled easily and seems as though it&#x27;s already begun getting tangled on one side as soon as I&#x27;ve finished brushing the other. Heaven help me if I go a day without brushing when even sleeping on it can make it a gnarled mess. Fortunately, a friend suggested this to me after explaining how much easier it made brushing the hair of her small daughter, who never remembers to brush her own hair. I gave it a try and the difference is unreal. Snarls that would have taken 10 minutes to work out are gone in 30 seconds now, and with far less hair loss. It also takes longer for my hair to tangle up again afterwards, and gives it a pleasantly silky feeling. I can&#x27;t imagine not using the stuff after a shower or in the morning anymore. Easily the best detangler/leave-in conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used, especially because one of my local shops sells it for $3 a bottle. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to anyone who feels that they have problem hair!</li>
            <li> Perhaps the hair of MY mane and tail are too baby-fine, but this stuff made a tangled rat&#x27;s nest of it! I tore out/broke off more hairs using this product than if I had used nothing at all. Which makes me wonder (seeing so many positive reviews) the bottle I purchased appeared to be little more than lightly-fragranced water. So possibly I received an &amp;#34;imposter&amp;#34; version. Or maybe the company is watering it down to maximize profits (?). Regardless, it&#x27;s just not right for me.</li>
            <li> detangles great but I am wondering if it has some kind of drying product in it like alcohol, etc?? Seems like my ends look brittle. I will probably not order it again but for now, I will use it.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product</li>
            <li> I have tried every detangler you could name, and they are all \\&quot;kid stuff\\&quot; compared to this spray!&lt;br /&gt;My hair is approximately 48\\&quot; (yes, you read that right) long, thick, very wavy and quite dry.  This product was the ONLY spray that I have ever used that completely detangled my long hair, wet or dry.  If you have intractable \\&quot;knots\\&quot; in your hair, use this spray liberally, let it sit for a while, and then use a wide tooth comb (gently).  Remember to shake the bottle before you spray, and be very careful about residue on surfaces like the floor (it will make it very slippery, although not stained).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never raved about a hair product before, but this one is too fantastic to ignore.  I found it only by accident by reading other reviews on Amazon, so thank you other ladies for saving my long hair (and my sanity.)</li>
            <li> Base on the information available about the Detangler, I bought two bottle with hope of it detangling any type of hair as describle unfortunate, that was not the case, direction said you could spray it on dry or wet hair with the same results, NOT TRUE, depending on your texture (Natural) it did not work for me at all.  Sorry, I bought two bottles.</li>
            <li> My hair type:&lt;br /&gt;I have somewhat hard to manage coarse hair. It&#x27;s coarse because it has rarely ever been managed in it&#x27;s natural form. My natural grade is not what I would consider \\&quot;good hair\\&quot;. Its kinked and dry. With prolonged conditioning, it can produce \\&quot;extremely\\&quot; tight spring coils when wet. other than that, its a puffy mess dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My purpose:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m trying to transition from relaxed to natural. I use this product every day to spray on my new growth to comb it out. Without it, my hair snaps at the meeting point of the natural and relaxed hair. I wear my hair pulled back in a bun. Since I have a big head, the puff of my new growth would make my head even bigger if I didnt comb it and lay it down damp. This may not be the \\&quot;approved\\&quot; way of transitioning, but it&#x27;s working for me! the product reduces my breakage at the time of combing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My uses:&lt;br /&gt;Dry-combing&lt;br /&gt;After shampooing detangling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product:&lt;br /&gt;I didnt give this product 5 stars because if you are looking for a moisturizing leave-in conditioner.... thats not what this is. it does what it says... DETANGLES. The texture of my relaxed hair after using this product doesnt feel soft and silky. It actually feels squeaky and stringy, but my point is to detangle. I follow-up with my normal products after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best experiences with this product:&lt;br /&gt;- Deployed to the dry &amp; dusty country of Afghanistan. The water is HEAVY with chlorine for disinfecting purposes, so even with detangling shampoos/conditioners, my hair was stubborn... this product still came through best.&lt;br /&gt;- Terrible micro braid removal experience with KNOTS. I sprayed the knots, let product sit for a few minutes, then attacked knots with a rat-tail comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im about to buy a few bottles because I&#x27;m down to my last few drops and cant find the stuff in the stores. this product is a necessity to my daily ritual as much as brushing my teeth. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> This works great in my hair, and my hair is extremely long and thick. I use this almost everyday. I&#x27;ve even started using this in my daughter&#x27;s hair, which gets tangled very easily.</li>
            <li> Since using this product my hair feels so silky and tangles come out real easy but the only thing is the smell, it&#x27;s not bad but it&#x27;s not the greatest thing I&#x27;ve ever smelled but anyways I love this and will be repurchasing</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and works well for wigs</li>
            <li> Works but wish it created a bit more &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34;. I may try to mix it w/ something oil based to create this.</li>
            <li> Has anyone tried this on poodles?  I assume it works since their fur is like human hair.  Wondered how they used it. I know it&#x27;s good for my horses mane and tail.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how amazing this product is. I recently decided to go all natural and stop getting perms. I was having some problems with my hair getting tangled, so i decided to buy this product. I spray it on all of my problem areas, worked it in with my hands and WALA! I was able to INSTANTLY comb through my hair soo easily. This is what i needed!! Highly recommended. Like magic in a bottle!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Mane &#x27;n Tail was mentioned in a review for a [[ASIN:B005KO7NK6 costume wig]] I was ordering so I thought I&#x27;d give the product a shot. I sure am glad I did. This is probably common-knowledge for women with long hair, but for a guy who tends to keep his hair short, things like this just don&#x27;t come up. Mane &#x27;n Tail worked great on the wig. It took a cheap wig that looked really too good out of the package to a state that looks much more natural. Mane &#x27;n Tail made the wig much more manageable. It also softened some of the waves resulting in a better length. I love the smell of this stuff too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe this winter I&#x27;ll let my own hair grow out again just so I can use Mane &#x27;n Tail regularly!</li>
            <li> Years ago Clairol made a product called Hair-So-New. It had to be the very best leave-in detangler ever. Well, what a bummer... Clairol discontinued that miracle product years ago, and we have been on a constant search to find a replacement. Let me say that many of my friends and family are salon professionals with mega-years of experience. In the bunch of us, we have mixed-chick hair, double processed hair, body waved, extremely long hair, etc. Mane &#x27;n Tail Detangler is the only product that we have ever found that even comes close to our old favorite Clairol product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for my own personal experience, my very curly and wavy hair is down to the middle of my back, and every inch of it has been dyed red for years. I spray Mane &#x27;n Tail Detangler (especially on the bottom several inches) and it is miraculous that I can slip my fingers and then a wide tooth comb instantly right through without a struggle. Gone is the snap-crackle-and-pop after it dries, and it does not have an over-conditioned feel to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any price, it is amazing!</li>
            <li> The product is meh. I didn&#x27;t find it to be a great detangler. Pantene has one in a blue bottle that i think works better and quicker. Alberto VO5 had a great one but can&#x27;t find it anymore. Gonna stick with the Pantene for now.</li>
            <li> Used twice, the first time ok, the second time it absolutely did not detangle my hair.</li>
            <li> I am Filipino and I bought this because I&#x27;ve had this huge knot on my hair for weeks and I could not comb it out. I was about to just cut it off but this product totally untangled it!!!</li>
            <li> I love it! I don&#x27;t know what would do without it! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says.  I use this with The Wet Brush Detangling Shower Brush and together both work wonderfully.  Would recommend for children who have issues with long hair and knots.</li>
            <li> I got this for helping me keep my son&#x27;s hair looking nice, neat, and smelling good. Also helps scalp. Doesn&#x27;t look oily. I keep it near the door and if we are going somewhere I just spray it through his hair and we brush it. Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I have grown up with Mane n&#x27; Tail since my hair used to tangle so easily, now I use it on my own children who have long hair and they don&#x27;t put up a fuss when I go to brush their hair. Not to mention, but this product adds a lot of luster and shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to anyone who has hair that is long and easily tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;~ SkyLee</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my yorkie who had lots of tangles.  This product fixed the tangles and made her coat beautiful again.</li>
            <li> This works great to condition and detangle my little girls long hair</li>
            <li> Works great on my 10 year old&#x27;s long hair.</li>
            <li> i bought this not a while ago, when i bought it there was this REALLY HUGE TANGLE in my hair, i bought if just to see if it works and i was so happy that my tangle was gone and i&#x27;m going to get one more when i&#x27;m finish with this bottle</li>
            <li> Great product and actually works as promised, I highly recommend this product to anyone who&#x27;s hair breaks easily or has a tender head.</li>
            <li> Works sooo well for cosplay synthetic wigs to get tangles out! It makes it so much easier to style the wigs and gives a very nice smell too!</li>
            <li> This detangler works very well for my hair. I have long, dense, wavy hair that is usually difficult to comb or brush through because it tends to tangle easily. I spray this on after washing my hair and run my hands through my hair very easily. I can recommend this product for people such as myself, mixed race with my hair type: thin strands (not as thick as sewing thread), s pattern (definite waves), cottony texture (quite frizzy and takes awhile to get completely wet when washing), thick (circumference of ponytail greater than 4 inches).</li>
            <li> my hair is very thick and super tight curls. its hard to find a product that i like and this is the first one i believe in. also i recommend the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; brush!</li>
            <li> This is a miracle worker!!! I have really long hair that loves getting tangled and knotted and this is the first product that completely helped! It has a strange smell. Not a bad smell but not something you want want to have in your face all day. Just spritz some perfume in your hair or a different hair product and problem solved!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American with relaxed, 4A hair.  My hair tangles very easily and is very dry.  My old detangler was discontinued (hate when that happens!) and I have looked for years for a good replacement.  I used it for the first time two days ago after washing and deep conditioning, and I noticed a huge difference in how easy it was to detangle my hair.  I did have to spray a healthy amount of it into my hair and I do wish it felt a little more moisturizing, but since I follow up with a leave-in conditioner, that makes up for it.  Two days later and my hair is still easy to comb.  That never, ever happens.  What&#x27;s amazing is that I&#x27;m at 9 1/2 post relaxer.  Miracle!</li>
            <li> My daughter has super curly hair that frequently tangles.  This product works really well to manage the tangle.</li>
            <li> This works quite well to detangle my hair after a shower. I have fine, straight caucasian hair that is very easy to break but tangles easily. I have friends of color with natural hair who swear by this stuff so I was curious to see how it work on my own hair, and I was pleased to find it works great. I wish there was a nicer smell to it (there really isn&#x27;t a scent at all to this product, which is probably preferable to some people)! This product also doesn&#x27;t build up in my hair and weigh it down. It&#x27;s really great!</li>
            <li> works well enough, decent on wigs too, not the miracle product some espoused it to be, but definitely worth i when price is good.</li>
            <li> Fine hair tangles like crazy. Even better than the Johnson &amp; Johnson we have used for decades! This is now our #! choice</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because I had used the Mane and Tail conditioner, it works great and smells good, will buy again</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair. I purchsed it at Sally&#x27;s together with the shampoo and conditioner. I returned everything. My hair is mid back length and I&#x27;m still searching for a good spray leave in detangler.</li>
            <li> I was using Unite detangled and changed to this. This is a better product for much much much cheaper. Definitely buy this!</li>
            <li> I love using this spray to detangle wigs. This product works perfectly.</li>
            <li> This is still the best detangler on the market. It works fast and easy. No smell and works seamlessly with other products.</li>
            <li> I love this brand so much. It helps your hair grow faster and healthier. The smell of this product smells like apples witch is amazing</li>
            <li> Actually works incredibly well.  I have tried nearly every detangler product without much luck; however, this actually works.  I have very thick hair (down to my waist and all one length).  I also have lived on the beach for the past 8 months so my hair has that salt air exposure so it has the &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; people pay for of &amp;#34;beach hair&amp;#34; that I am NOT going for! :) this is making it more difficult to comb through! I feel like I am ripping chunks of hair out and using literally 1/4 bottle of conditioner every time I wash my hair. This is just beating up my hair and it has been getting worse and worse.  I began using this product about 2 weeks ago and have been able to get a cold through on the first try after spraying this on (literally the first run through with a comb!). That did NOT happen before, EVER&amp;#34; not even before I lived on the beach! This product is amazing. I would not go without it now. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It works better than any other product I&#x27;ve ever used.  You have to be very careful about getting it on the floor, though, because it&#x27;s slippery and difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never used a detangler before using Mane N Tail so I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to expect. I had thought that any leave-in hair care product would make my hair sticky or oily. Not so with this product. I spray it on my freshly washed, towel-dried hair, comb through and then let my hair air dry. Once my hair is dry it looks and feels amazing. My straight hair is incredibly smooth and shiny: so shiny I&#x27;ve had complete strangers walk up to me in public places and tell me that I have beautiful hair. One person told me my hair looked like it should be in a TV commercial, it was so shiny and smooth. Thank you, kind stranger!  As for the detangling aspect of the product I don&#x27;t notice that it helps me detangle my hair very much when it&#x27;s wet; maybe it&#x27;s a little easier to comb through after I spray it on my hair. Where I really notice this product&#x27;s great effect is when my hair is dry. This detangler makes it a lot easier to keep my dry hair smooth and also makes it very easy to brush. It makes my hair feel incredibly silky to the touch and not in the least bit oily or greasy. My hair is waist-length and it has a tendency to tangle and frizz up a bit on its own. But when I use this Mane N Tail product those problems all but disappear.  One word of caution however. The first time I used this detangler I sprayed it on my hair while standing in front of the mirror in my bathroom. When I came back into the bathroom about an hour later I slipped and nearly fell down because the floor was so slick. It turns out that the detangler can make floors and other hard surfaces slippery. When this happened to me the first thing I thought was, &amp;#34;They need to put this information on the label!&amp;#34; Then I picked up the bottle and read the label where it said exactly that. Oops. Serves me right for not reading the label before using it, ha. I solved the problem of slippery floors by simply using it in a carpeted area, like a bedroom. Slippery floors or not this detangler is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Now use for my long-haired, shaggy dog ....and sometimes me. It is helpful, especially in the spray form, for spot use. Comb a tangle from the bottom up, not top down, for least breakage and quickest results.</li>
            <li> I have long, wavy and colored hair and it dose not detangle my hair! My hair dose not look any better with this staff, I guess it&#x27;s not for me!</li>
            <li> I rarely think to write a review on Amazon but this stuff worked so well I had to do it. I brush my 10 year old daughters hair when I think of it, usually because it is so matted it&#x27;s too obvious to hide. When this happens, about every three days, she sits in front of me, we turn on the TV and I go at it for 45 minutes straight. Her hair is about 2 and a half feet long from her crown, it&#x27;s thick and pretty bone straight. During the winter it always gets super matted underneath where it rubs against her coat hood (despite her saying that she brushes it every day). I thought detanglers were for toddlers so I never really considered using them but I just got too desperate. The Mane n&#x27; Tail detangler blew me away! I used it with a detangling hairbrush called the Tangle Teezer, which I also got on Amazon, and it took less than 7 minutes. 7 minutes! The kid even said it didn&#x27;t hurt. Her hair was so smooth and silky and it left no sticky residue or smell (which I was really worried about). It didn&#x27;t make her hair look greasy and it made it super easy to braid. I can&#x27;t recommend this stuff enough.</li>
            <li> This product is great at detangling my very fine long hair, and leaves no residue on my hair either. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical that this would work on my daughter&#x27;s easily tangled fine hair, but it detangled her hair so easily!  I paired this with a knot genie hair brush and we had only two &amp;#34;Ows!!&amp;#34; instead of the usual scream-a-thon.  Totally worth every penny.</li>
            <li> My dogs get tangled because they both have hair, not fur.  I tried this on both of them and it didn&#x27;t even begin to loosen up the tangles!  Very disappointed in this product.  Then I saw it in my local supermarket for less money!  I wound up giving it to my daughter for her 6 year old fine hair.</li>
            <li> good value! works in my daughters hair that tangles easily!</li>
            <li> I have natural kinky hair. I have been natural my ENTIRE life and have used all sorts of products in my lifetime in the past 30+ years to detangle my hair after washing. This product was recommended to me at my local beauty supply store. After washing my hair, I was unable to get a wide tooth comb thru and it was stuck at the root. I sprayed this Main N Tail Detangler in my hair and my hair layed straight and the comb was able to go thru like I had got a magical perm. This product is so unbelievable, no matter if its designed for horses, they have created a formula that is truly incredible. I will always keep a bottle of this magic potion at home close by. It saved me hours of misery!</li>
            <li> Bought this at the local beauty supply store because everything else we tried didn&#x27;t work.  Both our girls have natural hair that is extremely long and extremely curly as they are \\&quot;mixed kids\\&quot;.  Our \\&quot;hair day\\&quot; is approached with anxiety and sadness because it&#x27;s a HUGE, very time consuming process and both kiddos are tender-headed, unfortunately.  Well, this weekend for the first time in a LONG time.... there were next to no tears!  A few \\&quot;owww\\&quot; and \\&quot;ouchie\\&quot; sounds were made, but no crying.  And both heads of hair are officially detangled to the point that they will be able to wear it out for their upcoming performance, and I am not afraid of it!  :) LOL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so thankful for this product.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very thick, slightly wavy hair that&#x27;s mid-back length, and we&#x27;ve had many a crappy morning brushing it out. This detangler helps a TON. On wet or dry hair, we spray it liberally and then wait 5 minutes and it does an incredible job. And it&#x27;s a nice big bottle, not like the \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10\\&quot; that costs more than 2x as much for a 1/3 of the product, but works half as good as this. The only place the \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10\\&quot; wins is in fragrance.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the smell and use it injunction with the shampoo and conditioner. As for the detangling part of it it is okay its not anything special though.</li>
            <li> LOVE this! I use it everyday on my relaxed/natural hair (6 months post). This leaves my hair feeling SO soft. I can spray it on my flat ironed hair and brush it flat. It doesn&#x27;t revert back. I really can&#x27;t get over how soft my hair feels. I use this as a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> So much better than generic detangler I had before this one. Takes a lot of the unpleasantness out of brushing my daughters&#x27; hair!</li>
            <li> This arrived to me half empty....will just buy in store rather than online. Rip off</li>
            <li> Beware where you spray this! Its great on the hair and smells decent, although it makes counters and ESPECIALLY floors super slippery!!</li>
            <li> Old school products will never let you down really.. Fed ex just droped this off along with my fusion flat irons my hair was just washed so i put this detangler to the test right away lol.. I sectioned of my hair in four and sprayed one section i said omg dis stuff dont work.. Nooo give  it a sec or 2  . I took my big tooth comb and tryed again and the tangles are eazy to comb out. Im very happy with this purchase ;-) thanks amazon.  Oh and  after blow drying my hair is super soft and  shiny not hard and dry like it would of been . I love this product and will not be without it for now on. Also i need a perm and its been 3mo and dis stuff really works.</li>
            <li> I love all of the Mane &#x27;n Tail products.  I have VERY thick, long naturally curly hair that tends to knot. Mane &#x27;n Tail Detangler really works.  When I use it, I can brush my hair easily and painlessly. It does what it is supposed to do, and the fact that it is made to be gentle enough for even horses, with no obnoxious perfume smell, makes it simply the best, in my book.</li>
            <li> this product is great on both my daughters hair and plus mine with long hair.  It does good.  Dos not oil up hair.  Or weigh it down which is a must.  There hair looks super healthy and full</li>
            <li> This is a great detangler but I&#x27;ve found that it works amazing if I let the hair dry before combing out the tangles. I have two Poms that have extremely thick, long coats and I use Mane n Tail Shampoo / Conditioner / Detangler on them and they have healthy, shiny, gorgeous coats. Here&#x27;s what I do: I wash, condition, towel dry and spray on the detangler. I let their coat air DRY (even if it takes all day or use a blow dryer to speed it up) before I brush them because wet tangles are hard to get out and the hair is weaker when it&#x27;s wet so there&#x27;s more breakage. If I find a knot before it&#x27;s time for a wash I saturate it with detangler, let it dry and then comb it out. The detangler has literally cut my grooming time in half and my Poms aren&#x27;t miserable because I&#x27;m constantly yanking their hair out when I try to brush them.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my mixed terrier dogs&#x27;s coat so soft and shiny. She has this long feathery tail and the first time I used it, it made such a big difference you could see the spot where I missed it. Depedning on your need, try spraying it onto the comb or your hands for some parts rather than the fur.  I read somewhere not to put it on the muzzle because of ingesting it. too bad because her muzzle could use it. By the way we shampoo our dog first with this shampoo/conditioner from the same company. Great stuff too.</li>
            <li> Did not work for my daughters hair. better off using a serum. love garnier fructis sleek and shine anti frizz serum</li>
            <li> I CANNOT BELIEVE MY DEAR LITTLE EYES. I have a very sensitive, almost 4 year old daughter whose hair gets so unbelievably matted and severely tangled on the daily. After each bath, I am always in tears, as is she, from the constant battle of trying to get the knots and tangles out. And yes, I have tried EVERY SINGLE detangler, conditioner, product, you name it (at least to what I thought) until I found this miracle, almighty detangler GOD. The first time I used this on my daughter&#x27;s hair was the first time she did not scream, kick, cry, or fight to get away from me. A huge weight lifted off my shoulders that first day. I had to use A LOT of sprays our first use, but now we don&#x27;t have to use but 10 or less sprays each bath. Seriously you will be kicking yourself in the behind if you don&#x27;t buy this product and you regularly get seriously matted, tangled hair or if your child does. I PROMISE it won&#x27;t be a mistake! Thank you Mane N Tail!!!</li>
            <li> While in my teens I used Mane n&#x27; Tail products religiously. Back then, I felt their product line was the only thing on the market built to deal with my semi-coarse curly/ kinky hair. I come from a line of \\&quot;mixed\\&quot; type hair (half black half white), and tho my hair is not too coarse, it is very curly and dried easily. In addition, I might add that I live in a desert, so high moisture/ intense hydration products are a must.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mane n&#x27; Tale as a whole is a decent product line, but now that I&#x27;m an adult and have more knowledge and awareness about chemicals and alcohol use in products, I no longer feel their line is for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this leave-in on a whim. I was looking for a product that would hold my daughter and I off until I had the time to do some homework on leave-ins.As a leave-in, this product is OK. The spray cap mists onto hair and provides a wide area of coverage, and the spray itself has a decent smell, but overall, this product (like many others) merely provides the illusion of moisture. A few minutes after application, both my hair and my daughters felt dry yet gooey to the touch. This is the same problem I experienced with the Giovanni &#x27;Organic&#x27; leave-in conditioner. These products are made by carriers who mass produce, so in efforts to spread their product so costs are efficient for both them and the customer, some quality is lost along the way. In the case of some of these leave-ins, they usually carry a blend of ingredients that promotes a sort of illusory moisture, meaning it feels okay at first, but once the chemicals dry you may experience an adverse effect. After some research, the best explanation for this I can give is that these products are more focused on instant gratification than long-term sustainability. Products like this are great at first, then after a year or so of use, suddenly your hair is falling out, or its a lot dryer than usual and you don&#x27;t know how to correct the issue because the last thing you&#x27;d expect is your leave-in, but sure enough it&#x27;s the little things that can cause the most damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A true fix: I&#x27;ve found that a true fix to dry hair is first and foremost to take care of yourself from the inside out... (Green juices, more iron in your diet, and lost and LOTS of water). Second, keep your hair PH balanced, especially while shampooing or while using a leave-in. If you need to educate yourself on how PH balancing works with your hair, please go to youtube and watch videos by kimmaytube. You can type \\&quot;Kimmaytube ph balance\\&quot; in the search. Balancing your hair and keeping it alcohol free is essential to hair health, and acidifying your hair is necessary for maintenance, shine and moisture sealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As much as I respect American business, so long as these over-the-counter leave-ins try to combine herbal ingredients with chemicals, they will never grant true health or repair to human hair. Hair is an organic extension of the human body, so the products we use should be minimal, clean, and their richness should depend on the texture of your hair and the humidity in your environment. My recommendations would be Shea hair moisture cream products mixed with Aloe Vera gel and either Jojoba oil or Castor oil(40/40/20 blend).your leave-in, but sure enough it&#x27;s the little things that can cause the most damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A true fix: I&#x27;ve found that a true fix to dry hair is first and foremost to take care of yourself from the inside out...

            <li> Detangles well&lt;br /&gt;Smells great&lt;br /&gt;Needs to be more mosturizing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m African American with natural hair (3C-4A) and this is my first time using this product. I really like it, but it does need to be more moisturizing, especially for coarse hair. Its a fine mist and does detangle well.</li>
            <li> Worked as described.  Will use again and again !!</li>
            <li> Sprayed some in my hair as soon as it arrived. It definitely got rid of my tangles. Its a must buy, this will be a main staple for my 4C texlaxed hair.</li>
