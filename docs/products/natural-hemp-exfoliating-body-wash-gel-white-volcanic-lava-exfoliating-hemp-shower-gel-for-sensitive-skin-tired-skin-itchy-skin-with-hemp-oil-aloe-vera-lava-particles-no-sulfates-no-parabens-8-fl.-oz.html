            <li>Leaves skin smooth and smells fantastic!!!!</li>
            <li>This is a really nice organic exfoliating body wash.  </li>
            <li>good wash and scrub, just wish it would suds more.</li>
            <li>It was ok</li>
            <li>but I love the Exfoliating Hemp Shower Gel.  </li>
            <li>For what this product does and how it worked, I am really pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>the planet is a better place without them.</li>
            <li>It made my skin feel great and the other great thing is the price.  </li>
            <li>This wash has a nice clean refreshing smell and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Another natural product that is so good for you!</li>
            <li>This gel does not leave any scent - hence deduction of a star.&lt;br /&gt;Provides good variety - and that is good enough to add this to my list of shower products.</li>
            <li>A gel must produce good lather to qualify high on the scale.</li>
            <li>It is fine</li>
            <li>It was nice, and smelled good, but it was not really exfoliating.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the results so far.</li>
            <li>The exfoliating action is nice.</li>
            <li>Overall very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>The White Volcanic Rocks exfoliate spectacularly.</li>
            <li>I always dry brush before I take my shower and use this with an exfoliating wash cloth and my skin feels great and soft.  </li>
            <li>This product is fine and arrived quickly, but it didn&#x27;t wow me and doesn&#x27;t seem to do much.  </li>
            <li>Love that it is natural and has few ingredients, the fewer - the better!</li>
            <li>I use shower gels such as Claus Porto - Musgo Real, Trufitt and Hill, Not Soap Radio, Geo F Trumper and many more.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and cleans and exfoliates at the same time.  </li>
            <li>It does not foam up very much so a large quantity may have to be used.</li>
            <li>works very well for me.</li>
            <li>gel from bcBud works very well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I bought this stuff to help clear up acne but ever since I bought it the psoriasis started to go away, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just pure coincidence or not.</li>
            <li>Although, bcBud should give a little more for your dollar.</li>
            <li>i am pleased to find a product that does the job and does not have those little plastic beads.</li>
            <li>My significant other uses this and we are very please...</li>
            <li>This Gel left my skin fresh and tingling.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Regular body wash products make me itch, even the gentle stuff I was using.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have no problem using this product.  </li>
            <li>Fragrance is not overpowering - bit too gentle for my liking; I like some fragrance left on the body after the bath.</li>
            <li>It smells good, wasn&#x27;t too expensive and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>This is the first body wash/soap I have ever used that doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.</li>
            <li>and I cannot wait to see the other new products you have.</li>

            <li> and I cannot wait to see the other new products you have.</li>
            <li> You might not want to use it on a loofah, but your hands or maybe a flat body sponge that way</li>
            <li> Little expensive for such a small bottle&lt;br /&gt;Smells really good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not natural.</li>
            <li> The exfoliation is gentle, the scent is subtle and my skin is softer after use.  </li>
            <li> I have no doubts I will be stocking up on this item before the dry winter season arrives.</li>
            <li> not leave you dry.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected but works as intended</li>
            <li> It has just enough grit to it to do the job but not as harsh as some salt scrubs.</li>
            <li> I will probably be looking for other options.</li>
            <li> There are days that I like to use a very thick shower gel such as Alterna Bamboo.</li>
            <li> Leaves very little, if any scent behind and not much lather</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if its just me, but I do not want to use thick gels everyday.</li>
            <li> I used to have psoriasis really bad years ago, well it had started to come back.</li>
            <li> Added artificial scent in there, doesn&#x27;t smell hemp at all.</li>
            <li> so, itchy skin was painful and annoying.</li>
            <li> This product dries my skin out very badly.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Regular body wash products make me itch, even the gentle stuff I was using. I have fibromyalgia so, itchy skin was painful and annoying. Will continue to buy. Leaves very little, if any scent behind and not much lather but you can tell it&#x27;s there.</li>
            <li> My significant other uses this and we are very please... Awesome Body Wash Gel</li>
            <li> It was ok and I don&#x27;t have any complaints about it.. but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again..</li>
            <li> This product is also very good.  It is easy to apply and cleans and exfoliates at the same time.  I am very pleased with the results so far.</li>
            <li> This Gel left my skin fresh and tingling.</li>
            <li> Good product would buy again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not natural. Added artificial scent in there, doesn&#x27;t smell hemp at all. Not foamy.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice organic exfoliating body wash.  Because it doesn&#x27;t have sulfates, there is not a lot of lather.  I have sensitive skin and have no problem using this product.  This wash has a nice clean refreshing smell and not overpowering.  I always dry brush before I take my shower and use this with an exfoliating wash cloth and my skin feels great and soft.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I will never use another brand or product again.  The exfoliation is gentle, the scent is subtle and my skin is softer after use.  I have no doubts I will be stocking up on this item before the dry winter season arrives.</li>
            <li> buying again and again and again.</li>
            <li> Another natural product that is so good for you!</li>
            <li> Not what I expected but works as intended</li>
            <li> It has just enough grit to it to do the job but not as harsh as some salt scrubs. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Love that it is natural and has few ingredients, the fewer - the better!</li>
            <li> The bcBud Body Wash is the best body wash I have ever used. The White Volcanic Rocks exfoliate spectacularly. This is the first body wash/soap I have ever used that doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out. I never have to put lotion on my body because this body wash works so well. Give it a try, you&#x27;ll like it. Although, bcBud should give a little more for your dollar.</li>
            <li> Great scrub / wash&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not leave you dry.</li>
            <li> Little expensive for such a small bottle&lt;br /&gt;Smells really good</li>
            <li> It was nice, and smelled good, but it was not really exfoliating.</li>
            <li> I tried the facial cleanser as well but I love the Exfoliating Hemp Shower Gel.  It made my skin feel great and the other great thing is the price.  For what this product does and how it worked, I am really pleased with it.  I thought the bottle looked great too.  Keep making this stuff and I cannot wait to see the other new products you have.</li>
            <li> It smells good, wasn&#x27;t too expensive and gets the job done. You might not want to use it on a loofah, but your hands or maybe a flat body sponge that way you can actually get the exfoliation benefits</li>
            <li> i use this product for my face. works very well for me. i am pleased to find a product that does the job and does not have those little plastic beads. the planet is a better place without them.</li>
            <li> This product is fine and arrived quickly, but it didn&#x27;t wow me and doesn&#x27;t seem to do much.  I read the product description and thought it would be awesome.  It is fine but I am not hooked on it, in fact I keep forgetting to use it.</li>
            <li> I used to have psoriasis really bad years ago, well it had started to come back. I bought this stuff to help clear up acne but ever since I bought it the psoriasis started to go away, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just pure coincidence or not.</li>
            <li> I like the body wash for exfoliating purposes, but for every day use I need to find a different one.  This product dries my skin out very badly.  I have very sensitive skin and it just doesn&#x27;t tolerate this body wash well.  I will probably be looking for other options.</li>
            <li> This body wash works exceptionally well and has a great smell. It does not foam up very much so a large quantity may have to be used. Overall very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> good wash and scrub, just wish it would suds more.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Leaves skin smooth and smells fantastic!!!!</li>
            <li> There are days that I like to use a very thick shower gel such as Alterna Bamboo. Don&#x27;t know if its just me, but I do not want to use thick gels everyday. I like variety - variety of fragrances, variety of gel thickness, its feel on the skin, exfoliating or not. A gel must produce good lather to qualify high on the scale. I use shower gels such as Claus Porto - Musgo Real, Trufitt and Hill, Not Soap Radio, Geo F Trumper and many more.&lt;br /&gt;This gel from bcBud works very well. The exfoliating action is nice. Good instantaneous lather. Fragrance is not overpowering - bit too gentle for my liking; I like some fragrance left on the body after the bath. This gel does not leave any scent - hence deduction of a star.&lt;br /&gt;Provides good variety - and that is good enough to add this to my list of shower products.</li>
