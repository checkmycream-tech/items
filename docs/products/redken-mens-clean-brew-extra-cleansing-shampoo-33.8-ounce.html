            <li> good shampoo, sometimes hard to find.  Has become my standard since first buy.</li>
            <li> Excellent service - arrived as promised. My first &amp;#34;refill&amp;#34; of this product.</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo my husband will use. And, guess how we found out about it ? I am a sample freak, I love sending away for them. Well I sent away for yours and end of story. This is the second bottle we have ordered. I just wish I could find it close to home, it&#x27;s only for sale up north.  Oh well , you have a costumer for life.  Annette jones</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my hair stylist as a shampoo for \\&quot;people who shower a lot and are active.\\&quot;  So that&#x27;s kind of the purpose of the product.  The pricing and shipping of this product is waaay better than the pricing for alternative sizes or the same product in the shop.  And shipping from California did take a week, but no challenges with that.  If I walked to California, it would take longer, so again, no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product works well, you only need about a dime size for a good wash.  It has a distinct smell, but you get used to it.  Ladies don&#x27;t complain (as far as I can tell) for whatever that&#x27;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this to folks who exercise frequently or shower frequently that is.  You should totally shower after exercise.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells fresh and clean with a slight musky (in a good way) scent.  More importantly, it helps to keep my oily hair under control.  It hasn&#x27;t eliminated all of the oils, but I no longer have to worry about leaving a &amp;#34;puddle&amp;#34; of oil every time I use my pillow, or touch my head.  Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> My 16 year old grandson has very oily hair and this is the absolute best product we have found.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent service with Amazon Prime.&lt;br /&gt;JoJo</li>
            <li> I love the texture of my hair after using this. It&#x27;s very soft, and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all. I have medium length hair and can&#x27;t imagine someone with short hair using it, but who knows. The bottle is a little pricey, but definitely worth a buy.</li>
            <li> Five stars for taste; one of the better IPAs that I&#x27;ve had recently.  Not too hoppy and has a really nice foamy head.  However, I feel it should be noted that I think it was this product that caused me to have some of the worst diarrhea of my life; losing 5 lbs over 3 days.  I still think the taste is worth it though.</li>
            <li> Amazing shampoo for all men. Cleans exceptionally well and has a wonderful awesome scent to everyone will love.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Simple and it smells good.&lt;br /&gt;Manly not like flowers</li>
            <li> This shampoo is awesome.  Will clean your hair like nobody&#x27;s business.  My daughter has really oily, thick hair and is hard to get clean but this shampoo has saved us.  Not just for men ladies.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very oily hair and this is the only thing we have found to make her hair look clean..We love it</li>

            <li> Great shampoo. I&#x27;ve always had a hard time finding a shampoo that works well, and who&#x27;s scent I don&#x27;t mind and more importantly, my wife doesn&#x27;t mind. This is my new go to.</li>
