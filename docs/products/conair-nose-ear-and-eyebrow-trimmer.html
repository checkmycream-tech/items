            <li>The attachments are very handy as well.</li>
            <li>Everything about this trimmer is good except one attachment.</li>
            <li>Good for the price.</li>
            <li>but then it quit working for good.  </li>
            <li>Besides that, it&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li>Read the good reviews and decided to give this a try.  </li>
            <li>Good value for the price.</li>
            <li>Product works exceptionally well.</li>
            <li>This was another great gift that my friend is enjoying.</li>

            <li>My husband has been very pleased with the attachments to.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>This works great, easy to use.</li>
            <li>Have been able to adapt and get good use from it.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem as effective as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>i have nothing else to say you have a nice day.</li>
            <li>Works great for mustache trimming, nose and ear hair worth the money</li>
            <li>This is very cheap material .</li>
            <li>It is really simple to use and it works great!</li>
            <li>I changed batteries to make sure it wasn&#x27;t defective.  </li>
            <li>and this is the only one that works the best.</li>
            <li>I GUESS THIS IS MORE FOR A MAN THAN A WOMAN.  </li>
            <li>but it was doing the job OK for what I needed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even enjoyed using this kit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used others that work so much better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad we decided to give this one a chance.</li>
            <li>My guess is that a rechargeable model would be more robust.  </li>
            <li>Prime makes it even better.</li>
            <li>But this Conair is the second product in this type that I had use and allways work GOOD !!</li>
            <li>Much better way to go.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>For under $10 you can&#x27;t find a better combo for trimmers.</li>
            <li>This one works great and seems quieter than the older one.</li>
            <li>The interchangeable heads are very easy to use and do an incredibly detailed job.</li>
            <li>Just need to remember that the on-off switch is exactly 90 degrees from the blades and you&#x27;ll get good results.</li>
            <li>Love it and it is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>once bought, u can use it as many times as u want and its free.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and good product.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s accidentally dropped once it will break easily.</li>
            <li>The swappable heads are easily switched.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>Easy on the skin.</li>
            <li>easy to use and does just what i want it to do.</li>
            <li>May be that&#x27;s why so cheap.</li>
            <li>Wish it had a light.</li>
            <li>Just ordered another one today, because it does what I need it to do, fairly cheap</li>
            <li>I took the whole thing apart and cleaning the terminals and was able to revive it for a couple more uses</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a quick clean up on your side burns, nose, or something little like that this is perfect.</li>
            <li>beats getting waxed, or its a great quick fix to getting unwanted hair off as quickly as possible.</li>
            <li>I Love this Item / Product, it&#x27;s Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I Haven&#x27;t yet been able to figure out just how the Eyebrow Attachment Works, but in time I&#x27;ll come to learning just how exactly it works as well as which attachment</li>
            <li>A snip here, a trim there---this is one of the better trimmers I&#x27;ve used--works very well.</li>
            <li>I love it so much that I am now grooming with ease</li>
            <li>good blades, change out parts for different shaves, no issue with vendor, recommend.</li>
            <li>it is a good personal hygiene maintenance item.</li>
            <li>Build quality appears fragile and everything is surprisingly light.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>I had an older Conair that was much better.  </li>
            <li>Hadd hoped to replace a trimmer I really liked with this one, but it is only OK and not as good as the previous Panasonic I had.</li>
            <li>Mainly for trimmer, for arms and chin hairs!!!</li>
            <li>I bought this one because my previous trimmer was a Conair and it lasted and worked great for over  four years.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite nose hair trimmer (I use the &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; head and not the nose hair trimmer head).</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t to powerful to begin with I</li>
            <li>beard trimmer is way under powered, even with fresh batteries.</li>
            <li>The attachments are useful and easy to interchange with the main power unit.</li>
            <li>A very economical choice that really does the job.  </li>
            <li>and  The price is right.</li>
            <li>When it came  I use it right away.</li>
            <li>He really likes it and the different tools that it came with are handy.</li>
            <li>should have returned it the first time I tried it</li>
            <li>It only took me 3 minutes with the Conair and it is much more even.</li>
            <li>Husband needed something that would last more than one day and this item really fits the bill</li>
            <li>I decided to give it a try though after reading all of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>It actually works and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This is a great little item to care for facial hair.</li>
            <li>and I have never been much for a grooming type.</li>
            <li>works really well on my ears and nose</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like everything else I buy these days it has the feel of cheap Chinese junk.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely a piece of garbage</li>
            <li>Does not have real nose attachment</li>
            <li>So the whole set had to be pitched out.</li>
            <li>It is much better than I expected for the price.</li>
            <li>Use it for my bikini line and for the price it works really well.</li>
            <li>I wanted something cheap that I could use until I go back</li>
            <li>Okay, it works, same ole, same ole technology.</li>
            <li>I had an older model from Conair and I lost the wider attachment.  </li>
            <li>Mainly using for my bikini line</li>
            <li>So I have needed it replaced three times &amp; it already has cost me more to send it back combined than buying a second one.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t remove any hair, I bought it mainly for eyebrows</li>
            <li>I bought this based on the great reviews I had read, and boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li>Does the job, but seems to get hot after barely any use.</li>
            <li>The large piece was completely ineffective, especially compared to an old Conair I bought over 10 years ago.</li>
            <li>ive used several, this does not bite and nick as much as the old ones&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Comes with a clear cover to protect blades.</li>
            <li>It also is safe to use on delicate areas.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find that it does the job.</li>
            <li>This replaces an old Remington rechargeable unit that died.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind spending this amount yearly, it&#x27;s a decent trimmer but don&#x27;t expect it to last.  </li>
            <li>little beauty  takes one AA cell,and will most likely last a couple of months before  another  battery will be needed.</li>
            <li>use for Bikini lines,side burns ,general trimming</li>
            <li>Well, this one, apparently.</li>
            <li>This product is low power and takes care of so little hair that it&#x27;s barely worth using at all.</li>
            <li>Worth the very little money it cost.  </li>
            <li>No, it is not as powerful as an electric trimmer, nor does it replace a razor; but for small areas that you don&#x27;t want to use a razor on, it works quite well.</li>
            <li>Exactly what i expected and received a lot quicker then expected.</li>
            <li>Bought this with high hopes and I haven&#x27;t been let down.</li>

            <li> Took a long time to ship.</li>
            <li> Works extremely well especially for the price!</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is the motor is loud.</li>
            <li> Beats dry shaving/tweezing!</li>
            <li> It works well enough at first but eventually the motor terminals foul which renders it useless.  </li>
            <li> but the blades always rust within 5 tries.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> not used the other attachments.  </li>
            <li> We haven&#x27;t had much luck with trimmers; so I was quite skeptical about buying one for under $10.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and was a little skeptical because he is so particular about this stuff.  </li>
            <li> It has a little instruction booklet</li>
            <li> Look out for my dark Science Fiction Novel, &amp;#34;Pursuit of the Zodiacs.&amp;#34; Launching soon!</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> After three uses it just went dead</li>
            <li> it just made it past the return date</li>
            <li> no more $5 here or there.</li>
            <li> It comes with a small travel bag.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> Now my hubby&#x27;s nose hairs are finally not sticking out of his face and scaring random people.</li>
            <li> No cuts and very few &amp;#34;snagged&amp;#34; hairs.</li>
            <li> but sometimes it&#x27;s difficult to keep the blades in the right direction for cutting.  </li>
            <li> this was almost three times less expensive than the recargable one to start with.</li>
            <li> overall disappointed in this grooming kit.  </li>
            <li> WAS NOT IMPRESSED AT ALL WITH HOW IT TRIMMED</li>
            <li> I believe this is engineered to fail.  </li>
            <li> THAT BAD.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This thing is pathetic.</li>
            <li> Worst trimmer ever.</li>
            <li> This is the worst trimmer I have ever bought.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is very cheap material . I try to Chang and it is break on me . May be that&#x27;s why so cheap. I am not recommend this product any one</li>
            <li> Okay, it works, same ole, same ole technology. I was hoping for improvements on this type of trimmer.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and good product.</li>
            <li> A snip here, a trim there---this is one of the better trimmers I&#x27;ve used--works very well.</li>
            <li> 2 of the trimmers don&#x27;t work! What a rip off!</li>
            <li> Doesnt get close enough. Scratches my skin....overall disappointed in this grooming kit.  Wish I had just bought what i had before.</li>
            <li> Great product! It has a little instruction booklet so you will definitely know what each is for if you don&#x27;t already. It is really simple to use and it works great! I love it so much that I am now grooming with ease and I have never been much for a grooming type. The nose hair trimmer works well.</li>
            <li> The large piece was completely ineffective, especially compared to an old Conair I bought over 10 years ago. This product is low power and takes care of so little hair that it&#x27;s barely worth using at all. I will be returning it immediately.</li>
            <li> Had a rechargable like this at one time and it finally gave it up.  I ordered this one that takes a AA battery and it works great!</li>
            <li> I sent this back because it was too underpowered.  It felt like it was running on a watch battery.  I had an older Conair that was much better.  I changed batteries to make sure it wasn&#x27;t defective.  This didn&#x27;t cut it for me...no pun.</li>
            <li> This thing is pathetic. It has absolutely no power, can barely make it through peach fuss type hair. It does NOT come with a guard for trimming eyebrows!</li>
            <li> Works great for mustache trimming, nose and ear hair worth the money</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite nose hair trimmer (I use the &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; head and not the nose hair trimmer head).</li>
            <li> Does not work well at all. Waste of money</li>
            <li> Product works exceptionally well.</li>
            <li> I have gone through multiple trimmers and found a lot that suck and this is the only one that works the best. I use it for my &amp;#34;bikini&amp;#34; line.</li>
            <li> This is a great little item to care for facial hair. It works well and I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Love it and it is so easy to use. I would definitely recommend this product to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> works really well on my ears and nose</li>
            <li> It actually works and is easy to use.  A very economical choice that really does the job.  Get one, you&#x27;ll like it a lot.</li>
            <li> This item works great. Husband needed something that would last more than one day and this item really fits the bill</li>
            <li> ineffective and built to stay that way.</li>
            <li> I had an older model from Conair and I lost the wider attachment.  This one works great and seems quieter than the older one.</li>
            <li> good blades, change out parts for different shaves, no issue with vendor, recommend.</li>
            <li> I GUESS THIS IS MORE FOR A MAN THAN A WOMAN.  I HAVE PURCHASED OVER 10 TRIMMERS LOOKING FOR ONE THAT WILL TRIM THE HAIRS OVER MY LIP &amp; NOSE &amp; THIS ONE JUST DIDN&#x27;T DO THE TRICK.  WAS NOT IMPRESSED AT ALL WITH HOW IT TRIMMED BUT THE PRICE WASN&#x27;T THAT BAD.</li>
            <li> ive used several, this does not bite and nick as much as the old ones&lt;br /&gt;I use for Bikini lines,side burns ,general trimming</li>
            <li> Does a great job but sometimes it&#x27;s difficult to keep the blades in the right direction for cutting.  Have been able to adapt and get good use from it.  Just need to remember that the on-off switch is exactly 90 degrees from the blades and you&#x27;ll get good results.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and was a little skeptical because he is so particular about this stuff.  He loves it and loves the attachments.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product three times and now it wont even turn on. It wasn&#x27;t to powerful to begin with I should have returned it the first time I tried it but it was doing the job OK for what I needed. After three uses it just went dead it just made it past the return date so I can&#x27;t return it. This is a peace of junk I wont buy another from Conair. I bought this one because my previous trimmer was a Conair and it lasted and worked great for over  four years.</li>
            <li> This was another great gift that my friend is enjoying. I&#x27;ve even enjoyed using this kit. A must have if you like being well groomed.</li>
            <li> Perfect for grooming and getting rid of those stubborn nose and ear hairs. Plus I use it to line up my beard. I&#x27;m very satisfied with it.  Look out for my dark Science Fiction Novel, &amp;#34;Pursuit of the Zodiacs.&amp;#34; Launching soon!</li>
            <li> Conratulations, excellent supplier again for a good business with him, poi everything reported was correct and this is very good</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a quick clean up on your side burns, nose, or something little like that this is perfect. Not recommended for eye brows. Did not work at all.</li>
            <li> Save your money.  I receiver this grooming kit, used it twice, and then it wouldn&#x27;t work at all.  Changed the battery just in case and it still wouldn&#x27;t work.  I threw it in the trash.</li>
            <li> Everything about this trimmer is good except one attachment. I feel it is smaller than similiar&lt;br /&gt;products on the market.</li>
            <li> Nose and ear trimmer attachment works well. Comes with a clear cover to protect blades. Wish it had a light.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t get close enough to the hair. It always leaves some close to the skin that I can feel. I&#x27;ve used others that work so much better.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t really impressed with the quality. If it&#x27;s accidentally dropped once it will break easily.</li>
            <li> I like this item it is a good personal hygiene maintenance item. It also is safe to use on delicate areas.</li>
            <li> Gets my ear hair and does cut me</li>
            <li> What product that advertises as an Eyebrow Trimmer doesn&#x27;t include length guard attachments?? Well, this one, apparently.</li>
            <li> This may not be perfect, but it is the best I&#x27;ve found for body grooming. No cuts and very few &amp;#34;snagged&amp;#34; hairs.</li>
            <li> Good for the price. We haven&#x27;t had much luck with trimmers; so I was quite skeptical about buying one for under $10. I decided to give it a try though after reading all of the positive reviews. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it does the job. No, it is not as powerful as an electric trimmer, nor does it replace a razor; but for small areas that you don&#x27;t want to use a razor on, it works quite well. My husband has been very pleased with the attachments to. I&#x27;m glad we decided to give this one a chance.</li>
            <li> beats getting waxed, or its a great quick fix to getting unwanted hair off as quickly as possible. once bought, u can use it as many times as u want and its free. no more $5 here or there. works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Used as a mustache trimmer.  This replaces an old Remington rechargeable unit that died.&lt;br /&gt;Have not used the other attachments.  Seems well made and sturdy.</li>
            <li> I believe this is engineered to fail.  Very low quality.  It works well enough at first but eventually the motor terminals foul which renders it useless.  I took the whole thing apart and cleaning the terminals and was able to revive it for a couple more uses but then it quit working for good.  This was after about a year.  I suppose you get what you pay for.  If you don&#x27;t mind spending this amount yearly, it&#x27;s a decent trimmer but don&#x27;t expect it to last.  My guess is that a rechargeable model would be more robust.  I will avoid battery powered trimmers from now on.  I&#x27;ve had a number of others and they all quit after 6 months to a year.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this for help in grooming my poodle. It seemed to work well. The only complaint I have is the motor is loud.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re getting what you pay for with this. Here&#x27;s the Pros and Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. The price is right.&lt;br /&gt;2. It comes with a small travel bag.&lt;br /&gt;3. The swappable heads are easily switched.&lt;br /&gt;4. The eyebrow/ear trimmer works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Build quality appears fragile and everything is surprisingly light.&lt;br /&gt;2. The nose hair trimmer seems like it does not work.&lt;br /&gt;3. Doesn&#x27;t seem as effective as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> husband says it works great</li>
            <li> It does what it says it does. All the pieces work the way you expect. Now my hubby&#x27;s nose hairs are finally not sticking out of his face and scaring random people.</li>
            <li> Trimmer just died today. I bought it on November 5th 2014, so I figure I got what I paid for. Just ordered another one today, because it does what I need it to do, fairly cheap</li>
            <li> Like everything else I buy these days it has the feel of cheap Chinese junk.  I used to think the Conair name meant quality, but now I tend to doubt it.</li>
            <li> This Trimmer works as indicated. The attachments are very handy as well. Worth the very little money it cost.  Prime makes it even better.</li>
            <li> I buy a Remington and it did just nothing. But this Conair is the second product in this type that I had use and allways work GOOD !! and  The price is right. When it came  I use it right away. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Absolutely a piece of garbage</li>
            <li> Worst trimmer ever. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I dont like it.&lt;br /&gt;The beard trimmer is way under powered, even with fresh batteries.</li>
            <li> Bought this with high hopes and I haven&#x27;t been let down. This works great, easy to use.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t work as well as i thought it would. i have nothing else to say you have a nice day.</li>
            <li> Purchased for xmas gift. Mainly for trimmer, for arms and chin hairs!!! Beats dry shaving/tweezing!</li>
            <li> Everything works well, as stated in others&#x27; reviews. I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Took a long time to ship. Besides that, it&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li> Does not have real nose attachment</li>
            <li> just as described and works perfectly</li>
            <li> Fantastic!! The interchangeable heads are very easy to use and do an incredibly detailed job.</li>
            <li> A great trimmer for the price. Easy on the skin.</li>
            <li> Thank Goodness! I can finally walk around without tripping over my nose and ear hair...the unibrow can stay. 10 out of 10 - would recomend to a friend. If i had any friends.</li>
            <li> Read the good reviews and decided to give this a try.  For the nose attachment, You have to keep twisting until it turns on.  When it&#x27;s on, it won&#x27;t trim.  I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I had a Remington rechargeable set which finally quit recharging. So the whole set had to be pitched out. Also on trips you would have to take the charger with you in case it was needed.&lt;br /&gt;This little beauty  takes one AA cell,and will most likely last a couple of months before  another  battery will be needed. Since you can get four alkaline AA&#x27;s at Dollar Tree.  and taking an extra one on trips. Much better way to go.&lt;br /&gt;Also this was almost three times less expensive than the recargable one to start with.</li>
            <li> Hadd hoped to replace a trimmer I really liked with this one, but it is only OK and not as good as the previous Panasonic I had. Would not recommend it .</li>
            <li> Does the job, but seems to get hot after barely any use. We shall see how it holds up.</li>
            <li> the tool is just what i like. easy to use and does just what i want it to do. happy</li>
            <li> Exactly what i expected and received a lot quicker then expected. Thank you, great service.</li>
            <li> This is the worst trimmer I have ever bought.  It actually cut my skin and caused bleeding!  Will never buy again.</li>
            <li> The attachments are useful and easy to interchange with the main power unit. I think it&#x27;s a great value for the price.</li>
            <li> It is much better than I expected for the price. I have used it to trim the hair around my ears and to trim my mustache. I can&#x27;t believe how well it handled both chores. I used to spend 5 to 10 minutes trimming my mustache. It only took me 3 minutes with the Conair and it is much more even.</li>
            <li> Works extremely well especially for the price!</li>
            <li> Such a compact, versatile, tool.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! Use it for my bikini line and for the price it works really well. The fact that the biggest head and open up and be cleaned makes this a winner in my book</li>
            <li> I Love this Item / Product, it&#x27;s Exactly what I was looking for.  I Haven&#x27;t yet been able to figure out just how the Eyebrow Attachment Works, but in time I&#x27;ll come to learning just how exactly it works as well as which attachment it is that&#x27;s used for the Eyebrow&#x27;s. .</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my husband. He really likes it and the different tools that it came with are handy. Good value for the price.</li>
            <li> Works well. Mainly using for my bikini line and it does the job.</li>
            <li> For under $10 you can&#x27;t find a better combo for trimmers. I have a WAHL 10+ piece hair, facial hair, &amp; nose trimmer but the blades always rust within 5 tries. I got a 2yr warranty and they force me to pay the shipping when I want to send it back. So I have needed it replaced three times &amp; it already has cost me more to send it back combined than buying a second one. This won&#x27;t rust because the entire blade isn&#x27;t metal like the WAHL ones.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the great reviews I had read, and boy was I wrong. It doesn&#x27;t remove any hair, I bought it mainly for eyebrows and I have tried all 3 different trimmer heads and none work. Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have a different Conair groomer that requires recharging, which I unfortunately left at my family&#x27;s home.  I wanted something cheap that I could use until I go back and this turned out to be perfect.  It works well and since it uses batteries it will be perfect to leave in my suitcase so I never have to leave home a grooming kit again.</li>
