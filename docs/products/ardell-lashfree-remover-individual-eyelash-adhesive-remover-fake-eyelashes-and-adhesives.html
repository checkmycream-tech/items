    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Great!!</li>
            <li>Love this product!!!</li>
            <li>I am not saying this doesnt work to remove lash glue, but all it is really good for is to remove the glue off of the lashes themselves, not from your eyes.  </li>
            <li>I gave a  neutral rating: to be fair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have since trying to get lashes off without</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still looking for something that works much better.</li>
            <li>I put it on and let the solution do its magic and the eyelash slid right off.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works, but it has a very very strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li>If your careful though, its great.</li>
            <li>Shipped SUPER fast!</li>
            <li>The amount was just right because I didn&#x27;t need a lot of solution to remove the lashes I had glued.</li>
            <li>The solution stung just a little when I got some in my eye, but I was able to rinse my eyes easily.</li>
            <li>really it should not be for sale</li>
            <li>The amount you get is tiny tiny tiny, and I think it is a bit of a rip off, but hey it&#x27;s better than ripping out my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>its the smallest bottle i have ever seen even those samples we got for free from the cosmetics shops are much bigger than this tiny little thing it doesnt worth the money</li>
            <li>so far it havent remove my lashes, it breaks off the ends, but there will be a piece stuck to</li>
            <li>It ridiculous that most drug stores sell the glue and not the remover.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;It burned my eyes, and now they are super irritated and slightly puffy.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t know how well it worked because I was able to remove the false eyelashes before the lash remover came.</li>
            <li>it should be given as a sample with any order its a shame to sell this little thing as product for sale if i knew that this is what im going to recieve in this size i woudnt bother myself to order it at the first place and pay for it shipping at alll</li>

            <li> The product did what it said it would do.  I put it on and let the solution do its magic and the eyelash slid right off.</li>
            <li> The product was a little smaller than I had expected but I don&#x27;t know how well it worked because I was able to remove the false eyelashes before the lash remover came.</li>

            <li> I applied and reapplied this to remove my false individual eyelashes and it took over an hour for this stuff to start working. Of course some of it ended up in my eye, and let me tell you...it burned like hades! I&#x27;m still looking for something that works much better.</li>
            <li> I got this product because I could not for the life of me find the stuff that I had to use to get my lashes off.  Last time I had nothing and I basically ended up cutting and ripping my eyelashes out, OUCH! It ridiculous that most drug stores sell the glue and not the remover.    This stuff worked like a charm  in like 6 seconds.  The only thing is you have to find something to apply it like a Q-tip b/c it came with no applicator.  A little got in my eye and it burned for a few seconds, but then it went away.  They def tested this for eyes b/c I thought I would be in trouble when I felt the sting.      I would def recommend this product instead of ripping eyelashes out!</li>
            <li> I am not saying this doesnt work to remove lash glue, but all it is really good for is to remove the glue off of the lashes themselves, not from your eyes.  I use vasoline for my eyes and this to take off the glue from the lashes if I hope to reuse them.  probably wont get it again.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. It didn&#x27;t even take one lash off.&lt;br /&gt;It burned my eyes, and now they are super irritated and slightly puffy.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works, but it has a very very strong chemical smell. It sucks for something you use so close to your eyes. If your careful though, its great.</li>
            <li> Stung my eyes really bad and didn&#x27;t even loosen the adhesive.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work with Ardell lashtite glue</li>
            <li> Great!! Love this product!!! Shipped SUPER fast!</li>
            <li> I gave a  neutral rating: to be fair I had a different brand of eye lash extension (applied by a salon). I was hoping this product would dissolve the glue regardless of the brand. It also burns a lot of you get any in your eye(which is hard to avoid).</li>
            <li> Terrible, doesn&#x27;t work, gets in eyes and burns, waste of money.</li>
            <li> so far it havent remove my lashes, it breaks off the ends, but there will be a piece stuck to you lash still, a piece of lash and glue still there. it helps very little and this bottle is very small. ill not buy it again, ill just rather try another one.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why this product has bad reviews. It worked for me. The amount was just right because I didn&#x27;t need a lot of solution to remove the lashes I had glued. I actually have a lot of glue remover left in the bottle. I just followed the instructions on the package and kept applying the solution with a cotton swab to the roots of my lashes and the glue started to loosen and lashes came off. I do not regret rushing the delivery at all. Recommended to others. The solution stung just a little when I got some in my eye, but I was able to rinse my eyes easily.</li>
            <li> Waste of money. Does not work, I couldn&#x27;t remove even single lash.</li>
            <li> We ordered for wife to use for thinning lashes to remove false but have not used them yet ! But will be used</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have since trying to get lashes off without it is pretty painful, but I thought this stuff took a long time and several applications to work. It also gets into your eyes a bit which is uncomfortable, but not the end of the world.
