    <ol>
            <li>has a wonderful coconut smell..</li>
            <li>My hair look awesome!</li>
            <li>Hasn&#x27;t looked this great in over 10 years!</li>
            <li>This product works the best of all!</li>
            <li>Best my hair has ever looked.</li>
            <li>and I was greatly looking forward to trying it out!</li>
            <li>shampoo is wonderful.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite nexus products!!!!  </li>
            <li>Nexxus products are always top-notch, and this shampoo is no exception.  </li>
            <li>This product is wonderful!</li>
            <li>Excellent product!</li>
            <li>Nexxus products are generally excellent, and this Rejuvenating Shampoo is no exception.</li>
            <li>Plus, the scent is very nice!</li>
            <li>Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Shine Conditioner]], which we thought produced the best luster and shine at a very good price).</li>
            <li>Just Amazing!!</li>
            <li>Good stuff!</li>
            <li>In any event, I found this Nexxus shampoo to be a great product, too.  </li>
            <li>It sounds like a great shampoo</li>
            <li>I believe this product would work great on anyone with thining hair.  </li>
            <li>It feels great and makes your hair look like a million bucks.</li>
            <li>Another great product from  Nexxus.</li>
            <li>This is a great shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t work great for my hair.</li>
            <li>Another bonus is that it doesn&#x27;t strip away my color, which is especially important.  </li>
            <li>Not so great results.</li>
            <li>My hair feels great and it doesn&#x27;t feel as brittle and flyaway as it did before I started using this product.  </li>
            <li>I really love this line of hair care items!!</li>
            <li>The smell is awesome- very sweet and candy like, but not at all overbearing.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Rinses out nicely, works great in tandem with the matching</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>Although when I use just the shampoo, I&#x27;m quite pleased with how my hair looks!</li>
            <li>This shampoo is amazing.</li>
            <li>However, an hour after that, the feeling is quite nice.</li>
            <li>I realize Nexxus is a popular brand</li>
            <li>It cleans your hair, it conditions your hair and it smells nice, but I did not notice any difference in shine, texture or otherwise after a month of usage.</li>
            <li>while giving it some nice body.  </li>
            <li>My wavy, fine, abundant hair is tamed and shows no signs of build up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend both!</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair clean and smelling great.</li>
            <li>So just had to pop in and write something quick to get it off, lol.  </li>
            <li>The Nexxus is quite easy to wash off which is nice.</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent and was easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and my hair has never been in better condition.</li>
            <li>I fear that I will not be able to find this anymore.</li>
            <li>It had a light, silky texture; a pleasant but not overpowering aroma; it lathered up well; and it rinsed cleanly.  </li>
            <li>It strikes me that a smarter choice might be consuming the omega 3, along with gelatin, healthy fats and proteins in one&#x27;s diet, in order to nourish hair.  </li>
            <li>I love Nexxus hair product line.</li>
            <li>do they think it works better</li>
            <li>love nexxus.  </li>
            <li>I love all three.</li>
            <li>The feeling is better than the Head&amp;shoulders.</li>
            <li>This was to give your hair more volume or as they say plump it up.  </li>
            <li>Renewal\\&quot; claims that it will help overprocessed, damaged, and thinning hair achieve a more healthy, shiny, and stronger consistency.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t seem shinier or more manageable.  </li>
            <li>claims about this line of hair products, but I did notice my hair is more manageable, has more volume, and the volume lasts longer through the day.</li>
            <li>Perhaps not, and then you have to spend more money to buy a product that does.</li>
            <li>shampoo smells great, and leaves my hair feeling really soft and nice.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll be most pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>Overall, an excellent producr</li>
            <li>and I did not use the creme rinse just the shampoo, so perhaps one would get better results if used together?</li>
            <li>I bought the Youth renewal shampoo and conditioner and the Elixer and really love these products.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise the shampoo had a nice light scent and rinsed easily, leaving my hair looking really nice and easy to style.</li>
            <li>For normal hair, this would be a great shampoo.</li>
            <li>THis Nexxus shampoo is pretty good</li>
            <li>All of that is great, but as I said, no one thought it performed noticeably better than any other good shampoo/conditioner combo, so we don&#x27;t have anything against it, but probably won&#x27;t be buying more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>shampoo smells great, and leaves my hair feeling really nice but doesn&#x27;t add any extra volume or shine.  </li>
            <li>I had never tried nexxus hair salon hair product&#x27;s but am very highly satisfied with this product, thank you to seller for shipping it to me so quickly!</li>
            <li>It is easy to run through the brush and easy to manage and shape using my favorite Gatsby hair products.</li>
            <li>My hair also feels soft, shiny and looks great.</li>
            <li>The consensus on this one is that it&#x27;s a good shampoo and conditioner, but not noticeably better than any of the other good over the counter</li>
            <li>other thing is that it smells wonderful!</li>
            <li>I love its aroma, and the rich lather that it produces.</li>
            <li>Oh for the hair of my youth, a full head of shiny bouncy hair!</li>
            <li>I guess my requirements for a shampoo to be great are pretty simple: smells good, lathers well, and leaves no residue.  </li>
            <li>It makes it easy to manage as well as can be used on any hair style as well.</li>
            <li>It lathered well and rinsed easily.</li>
            <li>Smell is very mild in comparison with Therappe.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the sweet berry-like fragrance that the Nexxus Youth Renewal Rejuvenating Shampoo has.</li>
            <li>Nexxus Youth Renewal Rejuvenating Shampoo is a good shampoo, but really nothing special.</li>
            <li>Looking for a product to help my fine hair is like looking for the holy grail.</li>
            <li>My hair is baby fine</li>
            <li>The very first day I used the spray, I received many compliments on my hair.</li>
            <li>I received a bottle of this product free for trial and review through BzzAgent.com.</li>
            <li>I used to find it in CVS, Walgreens, WalMart, etc – it was widely available.</li>
            <li>My barber remarked that it is amazing to have so much hair at my age.  </li>
            <li>Maybe sulfate free?  </li>
            <li>At 12-15 dollars a bottle, it isn&#x27;t cheap, but this price is not out of line considering the quality and results that this shampoo delivers.</li>
            <li>But as it has been nearly a year, I have faith that this line will continue to keep my hair in good shape.   </li>
            <li>I found that it works much better than most other products designed for fine hair, but maybe not quite as good a another product I found after purchasing this one.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your hair clean, fresh and very light.</li>
            <li>I like the fact I don&#x27;t seem to need to \\&quot;repeat\\&quot; after the first rinse, as so many shampoos recommend.</li>
            <li>The price is competitive and the product is comparable if not better and the Nexxus name just gives me that peace of mind knowing that I&#x27;m doing the best I can for my hair</li>
            <li>I have used the Nexxus Youth Renewal Blow Dry Spray and had great results with it.</li>
            <li>Nothing special to it.  </li>
            <li>Even at the end of the next day it still leaves your hair smelling good and feeling clean.</li>
            <li>shampoo lathers well, has a mild fragrance, and together with the conditioner, leaves hair clean, manageable, bouncy and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I enjoyed the Nexxus Youth Renewal shampoo so much I bought the conditioner too.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fragrance is a pretty strong floral, but it is all but gone once you rinse the product out.</li>
            <li>What it does is keep it healthy, light (not weighed down), clean, and because it is healthy and fully but lightly conditioned, it does have more volume and appears to have just slightly more hair (which I believe is a visual effect).   </li>
            <li>No longer the fresh clean smell.  </li>
            <li>Nexxus is a quality brand I love but at this point in my life their moisture adding weightless flavor seems to be more to my hair&#x27;s liking and I am hoping I just don&#x27;t need total renewal of my youth yet!</li>
            <li>To be fair, I don&#x27;t have truly problem hair - but this product didn&#x27;t necessarily bring out the best in it (nor did it make it worse).  </li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo!!</li>
            <li>This wouldn&#x27;t be a problem for me if I liked the scent, but it&#x27;s simply not to my taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>: The favorite in our comparison so far, has been [[ASIN:B00A0IWRT4 Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Shine Shampoo]] and [[ASIN:B00AVWJUA8</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product line</li>
            <li>The Youth Renewal Shampoo has got to be my favorite so far.  </li>
            <li>I love the fragrance and the way it makes my hair so soft and silky</li>
            <li>This was a fine shampoo, and I would certainly purchase it if it was readily at hand and nothing else was grabbing my attention.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s not a bad shampoo, really.</li>
            <li>All in all, it was a pleasure testing out the sample sent to me by Amazon, and I would certainly buy this shampoo in the future at my own expense.</li>
            <li>It won’t completely transform your hair and make it thicker and super full.</li>
            <li>I have much better luck with a different Nexxus shampoo, instead.</li>
            <li>and I have tried so many hair care systems that I have lost count trying to get the hair back</li>
            <li>I had almost given up hope, but this system really works and does everything it claims!</li>
            <li>At first, the shampoo seemed too cleansing (stripping) and the conditioner felt too moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also 31 and don&#x27;t yet have aging hair, but I&#x27;m always interested in a product that can give volume without overdrying, and this does just that.</li>
            <li>Overall, I was pleased with the product and would recommend to others to give it a try.</li>
            <li>What differentiates this shampoo, with its higher price-point, from the cheapest drugstore stuff?  </li>
            <li>Salon Quality is exactly what you will be getting.</li>
            <li>Exactly as represented.  </li>
            <li>I have tried several of the Nexxus products and love each and every one of them.  </li>
            <li>I really love the Nexxus line, and the Youth Renewal is no different.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo left my hair silky, shiny and easy to style with the right amount of volume.</li>
            <li>I was able to return this product and get a refund, so I&#x27;m satisfied with that at least.  </li>
            <li>It smells fresh and nice and really works well to tame my frizzy, &amp;#34;Salt and Pepper&amp;#34; hair.</li>
            <li>&quot; I was just looking for a new product to try to help my fine hair which really needs \\&quot;plump and lift\\&quot; action!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many shampoos and conditioners for my dry hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair has medium length and medium thickness and is more on the dry side.</li>
            <li>They smell great and are worth the money, plus a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>items were delivered on time and in a large box with those air pillow things.</li>
            <li>But once I got out of the shower and blow dried, it was magic!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s far better in fixing all kinds of issues - besides, a certain members only store sells it by the gallon at a very agreeable price.&lt;br /&gt;***Update</li>
            <li>Not so much the case.</li>
            <li>The scent in my one free bottle is enough to seal the deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how much thicker my hair feels.</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>it has really helped my hair..</li>
            <li>I have to say I don&#x27;t like this as much as I do the Diametrx shampoo.</li>
            <li>Needs twice as much shampoo for a lather.  </li>
            <li>Does not do much for my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Head&amp;shoulders for years which I really like.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li>My hair responded really well to the shampoo.</li>
            <li>and I get to much out.</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo</li>
            <li>, it works really well.</li>
            <li>They really work well together.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is lightweight and has a subtle, pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li>The smell is subtle and pleasant which I like.</li>
            <li>For a rejuvenating shampoo, it seems a little bit drying, but feels just right after the use of it&#x27;s sister conditioner (which is my favorite product of the three).</li>
            <li>The shampoo has a very strong fragrance which is either a good thing or bad thing depending on your preference.</li>
            <li>but I am not willing to pay $14.00 or more dollars to find out.</li>
            <li>This will deep clean your hair and get rid of smoke, dirt, and grime as well as sweat.</li>
            <li>It left my hair feeling clean with no residue.</li>
            <li>And while I always like to use a conditioner after shampooing (because my hair tends to be dry), I could tell that this shampoo by itself left my hair nicely moisturized.  </li>
            <li>I am 53 years old &amp; really like the Youth renewal line by Nexus!</li>
            <li>This is a nice shampoo that lathers quite a bit with just a small amount of product.</li>
            <li>As I gave a decent review to the Nexxus conditioner sent to me by Amazon, I suppose I should say something about the companion bottle of shampoo I also received.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my second time buying this item and more then likely i will continue to do so.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize when I ordered this that it was supossed to be for \\&quot;older hair.\\</li>
            <li>There is a light scent, almost like cocoa butter, but once I blew dried my hair, there was really any scent so it will not interferer with any perfume that you might wear, or if you simply don&#x27;t want your hair having a strong fragrance.</li>
            <li>It leaves my thick hair feeling soft, light weight and easy to style.</li>
            <li>This shampoo might work for someone with a little healthier hair but, if like me, you&#x27;ve ruined your hair with chemicals and heat, then you may want to keep searching for something better.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo seemed to strip it a bit more than I liked causing it to be very difficult to comb out after washing and conditioning.  </li>
            <li>Humectress is way too heavy for my hair to use more than that.   </li>
            <li>My hair is full, soft, and like the hair I had when younger.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was the scent - sort of like Sweet Tarts, or scented plastic toys targeted at little girls -</li>
            <li>so I am on the search for a new shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li>It  states new york salon on it</li>
            <li>It leaves hair soft and clean, and I do believe that it&#x27;s helped with the dry appearance that my hair sometimes takes on.</li>
            <li>I was fooled as the package looks exactly the same.</li>
            <li>I usually use a hair dryer to speed up removing excess water, and my hair just looks healthy and bouncy.</li>
            <li>New fragrance is perfumey and old fashioned, like a granny.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably a good thing I got it for free, or I would be extremely disappointed with my investment.</li>
            <li>Can no longer use such a nice small amount.  </li>
            <li>However, later when my hairs are completely dry, they become smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I appears to make my hair softer, shinier and adds a little more volume - giving my hair an overall healthier look.</li>
            <li>My hair feels clean, and because I&#x27;m using less product, I don&#x27;t have to replace shampoo quite as often, which is a money saver for me.</li>
            <li>love the conditioner because it doesn&#x27;t build up (at least so far), and I don&#x27;t get that mangy mutt greasy head</li>
            <li>It works for me as far as shine and manageability....</li>
            <li>I use this nearly every day.</li>
            <li>The number one ingredient is water, number two sodium laureth sulfate, known for stripping hair of natural oils.  </li>
            <li>I have this product as part of a system to \\&quot;rejuvenate old hair\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>So far, I have NOT have that problem with Nexxus Renewal (knock wood!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After using the shampoo for a couple of weeks, my normal-dry hair does feel soft and not greasy.</li>
            <li>The Nexxus Youth Renewal made me feel young again.</li>
            <li>I am in my early fifties and I&#x27;ve colored my hair for years</li>
            <li>So so far, it&#x27;s an OK shampoo, good for spring, but if your hair is fried, dried out in cold weather or from the winter of heating, try Therappe.</li>
            <li>After I used this solution the first time with blow drying my hair while hanging my head down really gave me a wild look.  </li>
            <li>However, right after the shower, when my hairs are still wet, I feel like the shampoo glues them together.</li>
            <li>I think this is an above average shampoo for anyone with fine hair.</li>
            <li>She has many older women customers that have thin heads of hair.  </li>
            <li>Cannot recommend, solely due to what my hair feels like right after it finishes drying.</li>
            <li>and it took some time to calm it down and stay in one place.</li>
            <li>It smooths in easily and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>I am in my late 40s with fine hair, but a lot of it.  </li>
            <li>little goes a long way, so its very economical.</li>
            <li>Using just the shampoo, its matching conditioner, and a small amount of gel designed for thin, curly hair, I now have a style that holds together and looks great every day.  </li>
            <li>I have long, straight, recently-for-the-first-time-ever-dyed, white girl</li>
            <li>I have thin hair, but quite a lot of it - the top layer of which also has a tendency to frizz.  </li>
            <li>Paying nearly $30 for shampoo/conditioner every month simply because it smells good seems crazy to me.</li>
            <li>I have very fine and thin hair – I always have, but obviously it gets worse with age and the texture changes on top of that.</li>
            <li>I have used almost the whole bottle of Youth Renewal, with its pearly color, insipid fragrance and matronly mauve bottle, and I can&#x27;t tell a difference from any other product in my bath.  </li>
            <li>This is a clear liquid versus the pearly white cream of the regular Nexxus Youth Renewal shampoo.</li>
            <li>I think it is well worth the few extra dollars.</li>
            <li>Sad they ruined such a nice product.  </li>
            <li>After I worked it out through the roots and rinse thoroughly, my hair feels clean without any sign of stickiness nor grime even after a hard workout jogging for miles outside.</li>
            <li>It looks very concentrated and thick just enough to flow out of the bottle with a gentle squeeze.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was disappointed because I do really like the scent, and it lathers up nicely.</li>
            <li>I have baby fine, thin, wavy, middleaged, Caucasian hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On my very fine, thin, dry, curly hair,I found I couldn&#x27;t use it every day, however, because after a few washes, my hair began to look flatter and even thinner than normal.  </li>
            <li>Not worth the high price.</li>
            <li>The box was pretty large for three small items, but that&#x27;s not a huge concern.</li>

            <li> My hair look awesome!</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t looked this great in over 10 years!</li>

            <li> Best my hair has ever looked.</li>
            <li> and I was greatly looking forward to trying it out!</li>
            <li> shampoo is wonderful.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite nexus products!!!!  </li>
            <li> Nexxus products are always top-notch, and this shampoo is no exception.  </li>
            <li> This product is wonderful!</li>
            <li> Excellent product!</li>
            <li> Nexxus products are generally excellent, and this Rejuvenating Shampoo is no exception.</li>
            <li> Plus, the scent is very nice!</li>
            <li> Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Shine Conditioner]], which we thought produced the best luster and shine at a very good price).</li>
            <li> Just Amazing!!</li>
            <li> Good stuff!</li>
            <li> In any event, I found this Nexxus shampoo to be a great product, too.  </li>
            <li> It sounds like a great shampoo</li>
            <li> I believe this product would work great on anyone with thining hair.  </li>
            <li> It feels great and makes your hair look like a million bucks.</li>
            <li> Another great product from  Nexxus.</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo.  </li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t work great for my hair.</li>
            <li> Another bonus is that it doesn&#x27;t strip away my color, which is especially important.  </li>
            <li> Not so great results.</li>
            <li> My hair feels great and it doesn&#x27;t feel as brittle and flyaway as it did before I started using this product.  </li>
            <li> I really love this line of hair care items!!</li>
            <li> The smell is awesome- very sweet and candy like, but not at all overbearing.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Rinses out nicely, works great in tandem with the matching</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> Although when I use just the shampoo, I&#x27;m quite pleased with how my hair looks!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is amazing.</li>
            <li> However, an hour after that, the feeling is quite nice.</li>
            <li> I realize Nexxus is a popular brand</li>
            <li> It cleans your hair, it conditions your hair and it smells nice, but I did not notice any difference in shine, texture or otherwise after a month of usage.</li>
            <li> while giving it some nice body.  </li>
            <li> My wavy, fine, abundant hair is tamed and shows no signs of build up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend both!</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair clean and smelling great.</li>
            <li> So just had to pop in and write something quick to get it off, lol.  </li>
            <li> The Nexxus is quite easy to wash off which is nice.</li>
            <li> It has a nice scent and was easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> and my hair has never been in better condition.</li>
            <li> I fear that I will not be able to find this anymore.</li>
            <li> It had a light, silky texture; a pleasant but not overpowering aroma; it lathered up well; and it rinsed cleanly.  </li>
            <li> It strikes me that a smarter choice might be consuming the omega 3, along with gelatin, healthy fats and proteins in one&#x27;s diet, in order to nourish hair.  </li>
            <li> I love Nexxus hair product line.</li>
            <li> do they think it works better</li>
            <li> love nexxus.  </li>
            <li> I love all three.</li>
            <li> The feeling is better than the Head&amp;shoulders.</li>
            <li> This was to give your hair more volume or as they say plump it up.  </li>
            <li> Renewal\\&quot; claims that it will help overprocessed, damaged, and thinning hair achieve a more healthy, shiny, and stronger consistency.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem shinier or more manageable.  </li>
            <li> claims about this line of hair products, but I did notice my hair is more manageable, has more volume, and the volume lasts longer through the day.</li>
            <li> Perhaps not, and then you have to spend more money to buy a product that does.</li>
            <li> shampoo smells great, and leaves my hair feeling really soft and nice.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll be most pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> Overall, an excellent producr</li>
            <li> and I did not use the creme rinse just the shampoo, so perhaps one would get better results if used together?</li>
            <li> I bought the Youth renewal shampoo and conditioner and the Elixer and really love these products.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise the shampoo had a nice light scent and rinsed easily, leaving my hair looking really nice and easy to style.</li>
            <li> For normal hair, this would be a great shampoo.</li>
            <li> THis Nexxus shampoo is pretty good</li>
            <li> All of that is great, but as I said, no one thought it performed noticeably better than any other good shampoo/conditioner combo, so we don&#x27;t have anything against it, but probably won&#x27;t be buying more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> shampoo smells great, and leaves my hair feeling really nice but doesn&#x27;t add any extra volume or shine.  </li>
            <li> I had never tried nexxus hair salon hair product&#x27;s but am very highly satisfied with this product, thank you to seller for shipping it to me so quickly!</li>
            <li> It is easy to run through the brush and easy to manage and shape using my favorite Gatsby hair products.</li>
            <li> My hair also feels soft, shiny and looks great.</li>
            <li> The consensus on this one is that it&#x27;s a good shampoo and conditioner, but not noticeably better than any of the other good over the counter</li>
            <li> other thing is that it smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> I love its aroma, and the rich lather that it produces.</li>
            <li> Oh for the hair of my youth, a full head of shiny bouncy hair!</li>
            <li> I guess my requirements for a shampoo to be great are pretty simple: smells good, lathers well, and leaves no residue.  </li>
            <li> It makes it easy to manage as well as can be used on any hair style as well.</li>
            <li> It lathered well and rinsed easily.</li>
            <li> Smell is very mild in comparison with Therappe.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the sweet berry-like fragrance that the Nexxus Youth Renewal Rejuvenating Shampoo has.</li>
            <li> Nexxus Youth Renewal Rejuvenating Shampoo is a good shampoo, but really nothing special.</li>
            <li> Looking for a product to help my fine hair is like looking for the holy grail.</li>
            <li> My hair is baby fine</li>
            <li> The very first day I used the spray, I received many compliments on my hair.</li>
            <li> I received a bottle of this product free for trial and review through BzzAgent.com.</li>
            <li> I used to find it in CVS, Walgreens, WalMart, etc – it was widely available.</li>
            <li> My barber remarked that it is amazing to have so much hair at my age.  </li>
            <li> Maybe sulfate free?  </li>
            <li> At 12-15 dollars a bottle, it isn&#x27;t cheap, but this price is not out of line considering the quality and results that this shampoo delivers.</li>
            <li> But as it has been nearly a year, I have faith that this line will continue to keep my hair in good shape.   </li>
            <li> I found that it works much better than most other products designed for fine hair, but maybe not quite as good a another product I found after purchasing this one.  </li>
            <li> Leaves your hair clean, fresh and very light.</li>
            <li> I like the fact I don&#x27;t seem to need to \\&quot;repeat\\&quot; after the first rinse, as so many shampoos recommend.</li>
            <li> The price is competitive and the product is comparable if not better and the Nexxus name just gives me that peace of mind knowing that I&#x27;m doing the best I can for my hair</li>
            <li> I have used the Nexxus Youth Renewal Blow Dry Spray and had great results with it.</li>
            <li> Nothing special to it.  </li>
            <li> Even at the end of the next day it still leaves your hair smelling good and feeling clean.</li>
            <li> shampoo lathers well, has a mild fragrance, and together with the conditioner, leaves hair clean, manageable, bouncy and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I enjoyed the Nexxus Youth Renewal shampoo so much I bought the conditioner too.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fragrance is a pretty strong floral, but it is all but gone once you rinse the product out.</li>
            <li> What it does is keep it healthy, light (not weighed down), clean, and because it is healthy and fully but lightly conditioned, it does have more volume and appears to have just slightly more hair (which I believe is a visual effect).   </li>
            <li> No longer the fresh clean smell.  </li>
            <li> Nexxus is a quality brand I love but at this point in my life their moisture adding weightless flavor seems to be more to my hair&#x27;s liking and I am hoping I just don&#x27;t need total renewal of my youth yet!</li>
            <li> To be fair, I don&#x27;t have truly problem hair - but this product didn&#x27;t necessarily bring out the best in it (nor did it make it worse).  </li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo!!</li>
            <li> This wouldn&#x27;t be a problem for me if I liked the scent, but it&#x27;s simply not to my taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> : The favorite in our comparison so far, has been [[ASIN:B00A0IWRT4 Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Shine Shampoo]] and [[ASIN:B00AVWJUA8</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product line</li>
            <li> The Youth Renewal Shampoo has got to be my favorite so far.  </li>
            <li> I love the fragrance and the way it makes my hair so soft and silky</li>
            <li> This was a fine shampoo, and I would certainly purchase it if it was readily at hand and nothing else was grabbing my attention.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not a bad shampoo, really.</li>
            <li> All in all, it was a pleasure testing out the sample sent to me by Amazon, and I would certainly buy this shampoo in the future at my own expense.</li>
            <li> It won’t completely transform your hair and make it thicker and super full.</li>
            <li> I have much better luck with a different Nexxus shampoo, instead.</li>
            <li> and I have tried so many hair care systems that I have lost count trying to get the hair back</li>
            <li> I had almost given up hope, but this system really works and does everything it claims!</li>
            <li> At first, the shampoo seemed too cleansing (stripping) and the conditioner felt too moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also 31 and don&#x27;t yet have aging hair, but I&#x27;m always interested in a product that can give volume without overdrying, and this does just that.</li>
            <li> Overall, I was pleased with the product and would recommend to others to give it a try.</li>
            <li> What differentiates this shampoo, with its higher price-point, from the cheapest drugstore stuff?  </li>
            <li> Salon Quality is exactly what you will be getting.</li>
            <li> Exactly as represented.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several of the Nexxus products and love each and every one of them.  </li>
            <li> I really love the Nexxus line, and the Youth Renewal is no different.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo left my hair silky, shiny and easy to style with the right amount of volume.</li>
            <li> I was able to return this product and get a refund, so I&#x27;m satisfied with that at least.  </li>
            <li> It smells fresh and nice and really works well to tame my frizzy, &amp;#34;Salt and Pepper&amp;#34; hair.</li>
            <li> &quot; I was just looking for a new product to try to help my fine hair which really needs \\&quot;plump and lift\\&quot; action!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many shampoos and conditioners for my dry hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair has medium length and medium thickness and is more on the dry side.</li>
            <li> They smell great and are worth the money, plus a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> items were delivered on time and in a large box with those air pillow things.</li>
            <li> But once I got out of the shower and blow dried, it was magic!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s far better in fixing all kinds of issues - besides, a certain members only store sells it by the gallon at a very agreeable price.&lt;br /&gt;***Update</li>
            <li> Not so much the case.</li>
            <li> The scent in my one free bottle is enough to seal the deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much thicker my hair feels.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> it has really helped my hair..</li>
            <li> I have to say I don&#x27;t like this as much as I do the Diametrx shampoo.</li>
            <li> Needs twice as much shampoo for a lather.  </li>
            <li> Does not do much for my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Head&amp;shoulders for years which I really like.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> My hair responded really well to the shampoo.</li>
            <li> and I get to much out.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo</li>
            <li> , it works really well.</li>
            <li> They really work well together.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is lightweight and has a subtle, pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> The smell is subtle and pleasant which I like.</li>
            <li> For a rejuvenating shampoo, it seems a little bit drying, but feels just right after the use of it&#x27;s sister conditioner (which is my favorite product of the three).</li>
            <li> The shampoo has a very strong fragrance which is either a good thing or bad thing depending on your preference.</li>
            <li> but I am not willing to pay $14.00 or more dollars to find out.</li>
            <li> This will deep clean your hair and get rid of smoke, dirt, and grime as well as sweat.</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling clean with no residue.</li>
            <li> And while I always like to use a conditioner after shampooing (because my hair tends to be dry), I could tell that this shampoo by itself left my hair nicely moisturized.  </li>
            <li> I am 53 years old &amp; really like the Youth renewal line by Nexus!</li>
            <li> This is a nice shampoo that lathers quite a bit with just a small amount of product.</li>
            <li> As I gave a decent review to the Nexxus conditioner sent to me by Amazon, I suppose I should say something about the companion bottle of shampoo I also received.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my second time buying this item and more then likely i will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize when I ordered this that it was supossed to be for \\&quot;older hair.\\</li>
            <li> There is a light scent, almost like cocoa butter, but once I blew dried my hair, there was really any scent so it will not interferer with any perfume that you might wear, or if you simply don&#x27;t want your hair having a strong fragrance.</li>
            <li> It leaves my thick hair feeling soft, light weight and easy to style.</li>
            <li> This shampoo might work for someone with a little healthier hair but, if like me, you&#x27;ve ruined your hair with chemicals and heat, then you may want to keep searching for something better.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo seemed to strip it a bit more than I liked causing it to be very difficult to comb out after washing and conditioning.  </li>
            <li> Humectress is way too heavy for my hair to use more than that.   </li>
            <li> My hair is full, soft, and like the hair I had when younger.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was the scent - sort of like Sweet Tarts, or scented plastic toys targeted at little girls -</li>
            <li> so I am on the search for a new shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li> It  states new york salon on it</li>
            <li> It leaves hair soft and clean, and I do believe that it&#x27;s helped with the dry appearance that my hair sometimes takes on.</li>
            <li> I was fooled as the package looks exactly the same.</li>
            <li> I usually use a hair dryer to speed up removing excess water, and my hair just looks healthy and bouncy.</li>
            <li> New fragrance is perfumey and old fashioned, like a granny.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably a good thing I got it for free, or I would be extremely disappointed with my investment.</li>
            <li> Can no longer use such a nice small amount.  </li>
            <li> However, later when my hairs are completely dry, they become smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I appears to make my hair softer, shinier and adds a little more volume - giving my hair an overall healthier look.</li>
            <li> My hair feels clean, and because I&#x27;m using less product, I don&#x27;t have to replace shampoo quite as often, which is a money saver for me.</li>
            <li> love the conditioner because it doesn&#x27;t build up (at least so far), and I don&#x27;t get that mangy mutt greasy head</li>
            <li> It works for me as far as shine and manageability....</li>
            <li> I use this nearly every day.</li>
            <li> The number one ingredient is water, number two sodium laureth sulfate, known for stripping hair of natural oils.  </li>
            <li> I have this product as part of a system to \\&quot;rejuvenate old hair\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> So far, I have NOT have that problem with Nexxus Renewal (knock wood!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using the shampoo for a couple of weeks, my normal-dry hair does feel soft and not greasy.</li>
            <li> The Nexxus Youth Renewal made me feel young again.</li>
            <li> I am in my early fifties and I&#x27;ve colored my hair for years</li>
            <li> So so far, it&#x27;s an OK shampoo, good for spring, but if your hair is fried, dried out in cold weather or from the winter of heating, try Therappe.</li>
            <li> After I used this solution the first time with blow drying my hair while hanging my head down really gave me a wild look.  </li>
            <li> However, right after the shower, when my hairs are still wet, I feel like the shampoo glues them together.</li>
            <li> I think this is an above average shampoo for anyone with fine hair.</li>
            <li> She has many older women customers that have thin heads of hair.  </li>
            <li> Cannot recommend, solely due to what my hair feels like right after it finishes drying.</li>
            <li> and it took some time to calm it down and stay in one place.</li>
            <li> It smooths in easily and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I am in my late 40s with fine hair, but a lot of it.  </li>
            <li> little goes a long way, so its very economical.</li>
            <li> Using just the shampoo, its matching conditioner, and a small amount of gel designed for thin, curly hair, I now have a style that holds together and looks great every day.  </li>
            <li> I have long, straight, recently-for-the-first-time-ever-dyed, white girl</li>
            <li> I have thin hair, but quite a lot of it - the top layer of which also has a tendency to frizz.  </li>
            <li> Paying nearly $30 for shampoo/conditioner every month simply because it smells good seems crazy to me.</li>
            <li> I have very fine and thin hair – I always have, but obviously it gets worse with age and the texture changes on top of that.</li>
            <li> I have used almost the whole bottle of Youth Renewal, with its pearly color, insipid fragrance and matronly mauve bottle, and I can&#x27;t tell a difference from any other product in my bath.  </li>
            <li> This is a clear liquid versus the pearly white cream of the regular Nexxus Youth Renewal shampoo.</li>
            <li> I think it is well worth the few extra dollars.</li>
            <li> Sad they ruined such a nice product.  </li>
            <li> After I worked it out through the roots and rinse thoroughly, my hair feels clean without any sign of stickiness nor grime even after a hard workout jogging for miles outside.</li>
            <li> It looks very concentrated and thick just enough to flow out of the bottle with a gentle squeeze.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was disappointed because I do really like the scent, and it lathers up nicely.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine, thin, wavy, middleaged, Caucasian hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On my very fine, thin, dry, curly hair,I found I couldn&#x27;t use it every day, however, because after a few washes, my hair began to look flatter and even thinner than normal.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the high price.</li>
            <li> The box was pretty large for three small items, but that&#x27;s not a huge concern.</li>
            <li> I am 87 years old and have lots of hair that is thick and straight.  </li>
            <li> But for hair of average thickness and body that is beginning to dry out from over-handling, overuse of product, or too much heat applied during styling</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick (but fine), long and colored</li>
            <li> I use this shampoo with the other two accompanying products Nexxus offers (</li>
            <li> I  use a flat iron and blow dryer occasionally and my hair seems to stay moist and well protected with this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different types of youth-oriented hair sets, and honestly, one smells worse than the other</li>
            <li> I like Nexxus Youth Renewal Rejuvenating Shampoo, but it&#x27;s very high price might make me look at other quality shampoos that cost much less.</li>
            <li> But it left my hair very flat, somewhat greasy and yet it felt dry.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, very wavy, and quite long.</li>
            <li> This works like plain old shampoo.  </li>
            <li> B00ALV8EJM matching conditioner]], along with several other shampoo/conditioner combos.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE:  Now that I&#x27;ve had ample time to use both the shampoo and its matching conditioner in various combinations with other products, I am upgrading both to five stars.  </li>
            <li> I need only a small amount of this shampoo as it produces lather enough to cover my entire hair.</li>
            <li> I find that this makes my color treated hair dry and is not moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I have tested the Nexxus Youth Renewal Pump and Lift Blow Dry Spray through the Vine program.  </li>
            <li> Used along with Nexus&#x27; Youth Renewal conditioner and blow dry spray I found my hair to be noticeably softer, smoother, and even shinier.</li>
            <li> Nexxus Youth Renewal Plump and Lift Blow Dry Spray, 7.5 Ounce]].  </li>
            <li> Just a little bit goes a long way and you can actually feel it working when you massage your scalp.  </li>
            <li> I have had problems with my hair being very dry and looking like straw.</li>
            <li> It was more curly, thick, and difficult to manage.  </li>
            <li> It did not lather well and left my hair feeling stiff and unmanageable.</li>
            <li> I used this product as described even hanging my head upside down to blow dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> The smell clung while my hair dried (I don&#x27;t use a hair dryer), and long after my hair finished drying.</li>
            <li> I have used other brands that work for a while</li>
            <li> I wash my hair every other day.</li>
            <li> As with other Nexsus shampoos I don&#x27;t care for the bottle design.</li>
            <li> This is how they described using this product to spray a mist of this product over your towel dried hair before you blow dry it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a break down like some reviewers do for each of Nexxus</li>
            <li> There are other shampoos I&#x27;ve used where I didn&#x27;t feel the need to use a conditioner everyday, but with this shampoo I felt the need.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to hazard a guess that it wasn&#x27;t the shampoo that caused my hair to go limp over time, but other products I was using with it.  </li>
            <li> I do believe that this product is strengthening my hair, because I see less shedding.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look like dry or dull but it maintain a bit of a shine.</li>
            <li> If you need a little volume, try diametrix instead.</li>
            <li> I know, I KNOW that you cannot put anything on your hair to transform it into what it would be if you&#x27;d never colored or heat styled it in it&#x27;s life, but I was hoping the claims the bottle made help just a little...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo and conditioner for a few weeks, and it makes my hair too fluffy and slightly fizzy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The thicker bottom is hard to squeeze with wet hands</li>
            <li> So, you take a harsh cleanser and add omega 3, argan oil, CoQ10, etc.?  </li>
            <li> after 2 weeks of use: Dried out the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> After trying this product a few times I did see a difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li> not sure if I have less breakage.  </li>
            <li> No frizz at all: less than with supposed anti-frizz shampoos!</li>
            <li> It is a little expensive but a bottle will last at least am month.</li>
            <li> I have oily hair and usually have to shampoo twice, but with this shampoo it cleansed it all in one step.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure that shampoos should be age-focused, anyway.  </li>
            <li> really not sure for thinning hair.</li>
            <li> your hair gets the frizzies, or you usually use a moisturizing-type product, I would try the weightless moisture shampoo and conditioner instead of this one.</li>
            <li> , so I usually have to change what I use about every 6 months, if not sooner.</li>
            <li> Very poor R&amp;D and disregard for current customers.</li>
            <li> big thing with these shampoo/conditioner sets target to the \\&quot;your hair is getting old, too\\&quot; crowd is that they often have a horrible build up problem that weighs your hair down and makes it look even thinner.</li>
            <li> My hair is wavy and tends to get a little frizzy with the wrong products.</li>
            <li> So, right after the shower, the Nexxus shampoo is terrible.</li>
            <li> the worse</li>
            <li> Maybe that seems irrelevant, but sometimes consumers buy with their eyes before anything else.</li>
            <li> Faint floral</li>
            <li> My hair wasn&#x27;t this bad when I was &amp;#34;youthful.&amp;#34; It makes me feel like a slime ball within a week.</li>
            <li> and then my hair gets nasty again</li>
            <li> Worst of all... FRIZZY HAIR!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I use this shampoo with the other two accompanying products Nexxus offers (the conditioner and the spray).  It works for me as far as shine and manageability....not sure if I have less breakage.  My hair color seemed to last longer with this combination of products.</li>
            <li> I received a bottle of this product free for trial and review through BzzAgent.com. It&#x27;s probably a good thing I got it for free, or I would be extremely disappointed with my investment. The first thing I noticed was the scent - sort of like Sweet Tarts, or scented plastic toys targeted at little girls - while washing my hair. No big deal, I&#x27;m washing, it&#x27;ll rinse out. Not so much the case. The smell clung while my hair dried (I don&#x27;t use a hair dryer), and long after my hair finished drying. Every so often the air current might shift and I&#x27;d get the smell in my nose again. This wouldn&#x27;t be a problem for me if I liked the scent, but it&#x27;s simply not to my taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also leaves residue in my hair. My hair goes limp and greasy at a much accelerated rate while using this shampoo, faster if I use it for consecutive washes. My hair wasn&#x27;t this bad when I was &amp;#34;youthful.&amp;#34; It makes me feel like a slime ball within a week. Cannot recommend, solely due to what my hair feels like right after it finishes drying. The scent in my one free bottle is enough to seal the deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo doesn&#x27;t work for me. My hair is thick, very wavy, and quite long. I have much better luck with a different Nexxus shampoo, instead.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is amazing. It is a little expensive but a bottle will last at least am month. I can&#x27;t believe how much thicker my hair feels. I know there is a conditioner that goes with it, but I have never used it. I think it is well worth the few extra dollars.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it when I need a change from the Redken Color Care shampoo. has a wonderful coconut smell..</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo.  It smells fresh and nice and really works well to tame my frizzy, &amp;#34;Salt and Pepper&amp;#34; hair.</li>
            <li> My hair look awesome! Hasn&#x27;t looked this great in over 10 years! My hair is very thick (but fine), long and colored and I have tried so many hair care systems that I have lost count trying to get the hair back I had when I was younger. I had almost given up hope, but this system really works and does everything it claims! My search is finally over. NOTE: It doesn&#x27;t happen overnight. It took about 2 weeks to see the drastic change.</li>
            <li> I have used nexxus in my salon for over 30 yrs.  this line is unlike any line they have ever made!  It is a treatment line.. Shampoo condition and apply elixir every thine you shampoo your hair.. And in a couple months you&#x27;ll have different hair!!!  Just Amazing!!</li>
            <li> Found this at walgreens. At first, the shampoo seemed too cleansing (stripping) and the conditioner felt too moisturizing. But once I got out of the shower and blow dried, it was magic!  I have oily hair and usually have to shampoo twice, but with this shampoo it cleansed it all in one step. I&#x27;m also 31 and don&#x27;t yet have aging hair, but I&#x27;m always interested in a product that can give volume without overdrying, and this does just that. My hair also feels soft, shiny and looks great. I will say tho, that the elixir serum it came with does nothing.</li>
            <li> I think this is an above average shampoo for anyone with fine hair. I found that it works much better than most other products designed for fine hair, but maybe not quite as good a another product I found after purchasing this one.  For me, the Nexxus Renewal Conditioner is what made the biggest difference in my hair. Overall, I was pleased with the product and would recommend to others to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I have been using both the shampoo and conditioner from the Youth Renewal line for almost a year now and my hair has never been in better condition. I have very fine and thin hair – I always have, but obviously it gets worse with age and the texture changes on top of that. I have had problems with my hair being very dry and looking like straw. I have used other brands that work for a while and then my hair gets nasty again so I am on the search for a new shampoo/conditioner. But as it has been nearly a year, I have faith that this line will continue to keep my hair in good shape.   It won’t completely transform your hair and make it thicker and super full. What it does is keep it healthy, light (not weighed down), clean, and because it is healthy and fully but lightly conditioned, it does have more volume and appears to have just slightly more hair (which I believe is a visual effect).   I use this nearly every day. One day a week I use the Humectress line just to break up the routine. Humectress is way too heavy for my hair to use more than that.   I fear that I will not be able to find this anymore. I used to find it in CVS, Walgreens, WalMart, etc – it was widely available. Recently I cannot find it in any stores but Ulta, which is not convenient. It seems whoever stocks the local stores removed Youth Renewal and replaced it with Hydralight. I tried the Hydralight to see if it was an acceptable alternative. But it left my hair very flat, somewhat greasy and yet it felt dry. I immediately went out of my way to pick the Youth Renewal up at Ulta.   Please Nexxus never stop making this line and I hope to find it local stores again soon.</li>
            <li> As I gave a decent review to the Nexxus conditioner sent to me by Amazon, I suppose I should say something about the companion bottle of shampoo I also received.  In any event, I found this Nexxus shampoo to be a great product, too.  It had a light, silky texture; a pleasant but not overpowering aroma; it lathered up well; and it rinsed cleanly.  And while I always like to use a conditioner after shampooing (because my hair tends to be dry), I could tell that this shampoo by itself left my hair nicely moisturized.  All in all, it was a pleasure testing out the sample sent to me by Amazon, and I would certainly buy this shampoo in the future at my own expense.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo!! I am 53 years old &amp; really like the Youth renewal line by Nexus! it has really helped my hair..</li>
            <li> I had never tried nexxus hair salon hair product&#x27;s but am very highly satisfied with this product, thank you to seller for shipping it to me so quickly!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many shampoos and conditioners for my dry hair.  This product works the best of all!</li>
            <li> I like the salon like fragrance I get from this. Even at the end of the next day it still leaves your hair smelling good and feeling clean.</li>
            <li> Best my hair has ever looked. No frizz at all: less than with supposed anti-frizz shampoos! My hair is full, soft, and like the hair I had when younger. I don&#x27;t even need to use conditioner in addition. Hope this product never goes off the market!</li>
            <li> What differentiates this shampoo, with its higher price-point, from the cheapest drugstore stuff?  The number one ingredient is water, number two sodium laureth sulfate, known for stripping hair of natural oils.  I guess I&#x27;d expect a rejuvenating shampoo to go sulfate-free.  So, you take a harsh cleanser and add omega 3, argan oil, CoQ10, etc.?  Are you going for heart-healthy? It strikes me that a smarter choice might be consuming the omega 3, along with gelatin, healthy fats and proteins in one&#x27;s diet, in order to nourish hair.  I&#x27;m not really sure that shampoos should be age-focused, anyway.  I have used almost the whole bottle of Youth Renewal, with its pearly color, insipid fragrance and matronly mauve bottle, and I can&#x27;t tell a difference from any other product in my bath.  But it&#x27;s not a bad shampoo, really.</li>
            <li> I love Nexxus hair product line. This is the 3rd Youth Renewal product ive tried, along with a conditioner and hair thickener.  I have baby fine, thin, wavy, middleaged, Caucasian hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo smells great, and leaves my hair feeling really nice but doesn&#x27;t add any extra volume or shine.  I have to say I don&#x27;t like this as much as I do the Diametrx shampoo. http://www.amazon.com/Nexxus-Diametress-Luscious-Volumizing-Shampoo/dp/B0007NIRSC/ref&#x3D;sr_1_sc_1?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1368735685&amp;sr&#x3D;1-1-spell&amp;keywords&#x3D;diametrix&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way, so its very economical. For normal hair, this would be a great shampoo. If you need a little volume, try diametrix instead.</li>
            <li> My family compared this shampoo and its [[ASIN:B00ALV8EJM matching conditioner]], along with several other shampoo/conditioner combos.  The consensus on this one is that it&#x27;s a good shampoo and conditioner, but not noticeably better than any of the other good over the counter options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo lathers well, has a mild fragrance, and together with the conditioner, leaves hair clean, manageable, bouncy and shiny.  All of that is great, but as I said, no one thought it performed noticeably better than any other good shampoo/conditioner combo, so we don&#x27;t have anything against it, but probably won&#x27;t be buying more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that we did appreciate is that the shampoo and conditioner have different colored caps, which makes them easier to tell apart in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(p.s.: The favorite in our comparison so far, has been [[ASIN:B00A0IWRT4 Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Shine Shampoo]] and [[ASIN:B00AVWJUA8 Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Shine Conditioner]], which we thought produced the best luster and shine at a very good price).</li>
            <li> This was not the same shampoo that i have purchased in our local stores. I was fooled as the package looks exactly the same. It  states new york salon on it and that was the difference.</li>
            <li> I actually never received this product.  I checked on its status and it had been returned as damaged, however it was never removed from my Vine product review list.  So just had to pop in and write something quick to get it off, lol.  If I ever do receive the product, I will come back and do an update.  It sounds like a great shampoo and I was greatly looking forward to trying it out!</li>
            <li> I have this product as part of a system to \\&quot;rejuvenate old hair\\&quot;. This is a nice shampoo that lathers quite a bit with just a small amount of product. It&#x27;s fragrance is a pretty strong floral, but it is all but gone once you rinse the product out. For a rejuvenating shampoo, it seems a little bit drying, but feels just right after the use of it&#x27;s sister conditioner (which is my favorite product of the three). I like the fact I don&#x27;t seem to need to \\&quot;repeat\\&quot; after the first rinse, as so many shampoos recommend. My hair feels clean, and because I&#x27;m using less product, I don&#x27;t have to replace shampoo quite as often, which is a money saver for me. I plan to keep this shampoo and it&#x27;s conditioner in the rotation of hair products that occupy my shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using both Nexxus Renewal shampoo and conditioner (see that review) as a set for several weeks, and I have to say, the combo&#x27;s a winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the conditioner because it doesn&#x27;t build up (at least so far), and I don&#x27;t get that mangy mutt greasy head look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is wonderful. The smell is heavenly, and it doesn&#x27;t take a lot to get a headful of lather. Rinses out nicely, works great in tandem with the matching conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My big thing with these shampoo/conditioner sets target to the \\&quot;your hair is getting old, too\\&quot; crowd is that they often have a horrible build up problem that weighs your hair down and makes it look even thinner. So far, I have NOT have that problem with Nexxus Renewal (knock wood!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing is that it smells wonderful! I&#x27;ve tried a few different types of youth-oriented hair sets, and honestly, one smells worse than the other (the last one made me gag. It smelled like an open tar pit.) do they think it works better the worse it smells?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nexxus is a pleasure to use. My wavy, fine, abundant hair is tamed and shows no signs of build up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend both!</li>
            <li> This was a fine shampoo, and I would certainly purchase it if it was readily at hand and nothing else was grabbing my attention.  However, it isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;d go out of my way to track down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair did not feel transformed after using this.  To be fair, I don&#x27;t have truly problem hair - but this product didn&#x27;t necessarily bring out the best in it (nor did it make it worse).  I have thin hair, but quite a lot of it - the top layer of which also has a tendency to frizz.  It seemed like the volumizers in this shampoo at times exacerbated that situation.  There are other shampoos I&#x27;ve used where I didn&#x27;t feel the need to use a conditioner everyday, but with this shampoo I felt the need.</li>
            <li> love nexxus.  like the way it makes my hair look. will continue to buy and will recommend this to others</li>
            <li> I got the youth renewal shampoo, conditioner and elixir. I love all three. I wash my hair every other day. I do believe that this product is strengthening my hair, because I see less shedding.  The smell is awesome- very sweet and candy like, but not at all overbearing.&lt;br /&gt;The items were delivered on time and in a large box with those air pillow things. The box was pretty large for three small items, but that&#x27;s not a huge concern. I really love this line of hair care items!!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite nexus products!!!!  This shampoo especially works well on my frizzy hair.  It&#x27;s my second time buying this item and more then likely i will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> This is not the same shampoo you would buy at a salon or your local CVS. This is a clear liquid versus the pearly white cream of the regular Nexxus Youth Renewal shampoo. I find that this makes my color treated hair dry and is not moisturizing. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> New fragrance is perfumey and old fashioned, like a granny.  No longer the fresh clean smell.  Not such a silky wash anymore,  probably because silicone was removed?  Can no longer use such a nice small amount.  Needs twice as much shampoo for a lather.  Worst of all... FRIZZY HAIR!  We used the prior formula for quite a while.  Sad they ruined such a nice product.  Very poor R&amp;D and disregard for current customers.</li>
            <li> Does not do much for my hair.</li>
            <li> Nexxus Youth Renewal Rejuvenating Shampoo is a good shampoo, but really nothing special. The \\&quot;youth renewal\\&quot; claim should just be ignored because this isn&#x27;t the Fountain of Youth for hair. The shampoo has a very strong fragrance which is either a good thing or bad thing depending on your preference. After using the shampoo for a couple of weeks, my normal-dry hair does feel soft and not greasy. I like Nexxus Youth Renewal Rejuvenating Shampoo, but it&#x27;s very high price might make me look at other quality shampoos that cost much less.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Head&amp;shoulders for years which I really like. THis Nexxus shampoo is pretty good but I still prefer my Head&amp;shoulders. The Nexxus is quite easy to wash off which is nice. However, right after the shower, when my hairs are still wet, I feel like the shampoo glues them together. I can&#x27;t comb my hair with my fingers (I have no such problem with the Head&amp;shoulders). However, later when my hairs are completely dry, they become smooth and soft. The feeling is better than the Head&amp;shoulders. So, right after the shower, the Nexxus shampoo is terrible. However, an hour after that, the feeling is quite nice. By the way, this shampoo is for woman only. If you walk into Macy&#x27;s cosmetic department (where they sell lotions, make-ups, perfumes etc), you will notice that womanly smell of the products. This conditioner has the same smell which is not for men.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is $14+ per bottle. It makes the claim of restoring a youthful appearance and strength to your hair. I saw no change in my hair whatsoever using both the shampoo and conditioner. Paying nearly $30 for shampoo/conditioner every month simply because it smells good seems crazy to me. I realize Nexxus is a popular brand and I&#x27;ve never had complaints about it, but this shampoo and conditioner don&#x27;t deliver on their promise. It cleans your hair, it conditions your hair and it smells nice, but I did not notice any difference in shine, texture or otherwise after a month of usage. While I&#x27;m at it, I don&#x27;t care for the bottle design and color. Maybe that seems irrelevant, but sometimes consumers buy with their eyes before anything else.</li>
            <li> I have tested the Nexxus Youth Renewal Pump and Lift Blow Dry Spray through the Vine program.  I find it was not for me.  I used this product as described even hanging my head upside down to blow dry my hair.  This is how they described using this product to spray a mist of this product over your towel dried hair before you blow dry it.  This was to give your hair more volume or as they say plump it up.  After I used this solution the first time with blow drying my hair while hanging my head down really gave me a wild look.  My hair was sticking out all over and it took some time to calm it down and stay in one place. I also felt by the end of the day my hair looked like I had never been washed earlier, my hair seamed to clump together.  I am 87 years old and have lots of hair that is thick and straight.  My barber remarked that it is amazing to have so much hair at my age.  She has many older women customers that have thin heads of hair.  I guess there was no reason for me to try something that would plump up my hair.  I believe this product would work great on anyone with thining hair.  It has a nice scent and was easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Letta Meinen</li>
            <li> Salon Quality is exactly what you will be getting. This will deep clean your hair and get rid of smoke, dirt, and grime as well as sweat. I like the way my hair feels after using this shampoo. It feels great and makes your hair look like a million bucks. It makes it easy to manage as well as can be used on any hair style as well. Leaves your hair clean and smelling great. Another great product from  Nexxus.</li>
            <li> Exactly as represented.  I am very pleased with this product.  I have already recommended it to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo.  It leaves my thick hair feeling soft, light weight and easy to style. I  use a flat iron and blow dryer occasionally and my hair seems to stay moist and well protected with this shampoo.  Plus, the scent is very nice! Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the Nexxus Youth Renewal shampoo so much I bought the conditioner too.  I am in my late 40s with fine hair, but a lot of it.  This shampoo left my hair silky, shiny and easy to style with the right amount of volume.</li>
            <li> really not sure for thinning hair.</li>
            <li> Nexxus products are always top-notch, and this shampoo is no exception.  Just enough moisture to leave hair shiny and younger-looking.  On my very fine, thin, dry, curly hair,I found I couldn&#x27;t use it every day, however, because after a few washes, my hair began to look flatter and even thinner than normal.  But for hair of average thickness and body that is beginning to dry out from over-handling, overuse of product, or too much heat applied during styling, this should work beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Now that I&#x27;ve had ample time to use both the shampoo and its matching conditioner in various combinations with other products, I am upgrading both to five stars.  I&#x27;m going to hazard a guess that it wasn&#x27;t the shampoo that caused my hair to go limp over time, but other products I was using with it.  Using just the shampoo, its matching conditioner, and a small amount of gel designed for thin, curly hair, I now have a style that holds together and looks great every day.  Good stuff!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the sweet berry-like fragrance that the Nexxus Youth Renewal Rejuvenating Shampoo has. It&#x27;s not overpowering and leaves a light behind.  I appears to make my hair softer, shinier and adds a little more volume - giving my hair an overall healthier look. When paired with the [[ASIN:B00ALV8EJM Nexxus Youth Renewal Rejuvenating Conditioner, 13.5 Ounce]] as recommended by the manufacturer, I was not please with the results as the volume was no longer there. Although when I use just the shampoo, I&#x27;m quite pleased with how my hair looks!</li>
            <li> I tried this shampoo and it&#x27;s matching conditioner in desperation.  After putting my hair through constant coloring and highlighting torture, I have achieved a state of straw-like, frizzy, scraggly hair.  The \\&quot;Youth Renewal\\&quot; claims that it will help overprocessed, damaged, and thinning hair achieve a more healthy, shiny, and stronger consistency.  Well it didn&#x27;t.  The shampoo seemed to strip it a bit more than I liked causing it to be very difficult to comb out after washing and conditioning.  It didn&#x27;t seem shinier or more manageable.  I know, I know, I KNOW that you cannot put anything on your hair to transform it into what it would be if you&#x27;d never colored or heat styled it in it&#x27;s life, but I was hoping the claims the bottle made help just a little... but no.  I was able to return this product and get a refund, so I&#x27;m satisfied with that at least.  This shampoo might work for someone with a little healthier hair but, if like me, you&#x27;ve ruined your hair with chemicals and heat, then you may want to keep searching for something better.  Maybe sulfate free?  That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m going to try next....  Either that or I may chop it all off and start again.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful! Used along with Nexus&#x27; Youth Renewal conditioner and blow dry spray I found my hair to be noticeably softer, smoother, and even shinier. This shampoo is lightweight and has a subtle, pleasant fragrance. It smooths in easily and a little goes a long way! I really can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product line - I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Nexus products and they definitely did not disappoint with this Youth Renewal line. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> I have tried several of the Nexxus products and love each and every one of them.  The Youth Renewal Shampoo has got to be my favorite so far.  Just a little bit goes a long way and you can actually feel it working when you massage your scalp.  I love the fragrance and the way it makes my hair so soft and silky while giving it some nice body.  I have been buying salon shampoos for a bit now and I think this is going to be my replacement.  The price is competitive and the product is comparable if not better and the Nexxus name just gives me that peace of mind knowing that I&#x27;m doing the best I can for my hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several of the Nexxus brand hair products, and this one, as well as the oil therapy line are my favorites. They smell great and are worth the money, plus a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Nexxus products are generally excellent, and this Rejuvenating Shampoo is no exception. I love its aroma, and the rich lather that it produces. It leaves hair soft and clean, and I do believe that it&#x27;s helped with the dry appearance that my hair sometimes takes on. At 12-15 dollars a bottle, it isn&#x27;t cheap, but this price is not out of line considering the quality and results that this shampoo delivers.</li>
            <li> This works like plain old shampoo.  Nothing special to it.  My &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; hair has not been rejuvenated.  Not worth the high price.</li>
            <li> Oh for the hair of my youth, a full head of shiny bouncy hair! The Nexxus Youth Renewal made me feel young again. My hair responded really well to the shampoo. It lathered well and rinsed easily. As with other Nexsus shampoos I don&#x27;t care for the bottle design. The thicker bottom is hard to squeeze with wet hands and I get to much out. Otherwise the shampoo had a nice light scent and rinsed easily, leaving my hair looking really nice and easy to style.</li>
            <li> My hair is wavy and tends to get a little frizzy with the wrong products. I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo and conditioner for a few weeks, and it makes my hair too fluffy and slightly fizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed because I do really like the scent, and it lathers up nicely. It just doesn&#x27;t work great for my hair. If you want to add volume though, this should do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your hair gets the frizzies, or you usually use a moisturizing-type product, I would try the weightless moisture shampoo and conditioner instead of this one.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize when I ordered this that it was supossed to be for \\&quot;older hair.\\&quot; I was just looking for a new product to try to help my fine hair which really needs \\&quot;plump and lift\\&quot; action! My hair gets acclimated to products (don&#x27;t ask me why), so I usually have to change what I use about every 6 months, if not sooner. Looking for a product to help my fine hair is like looking for the holy grail. I think I have found it! I use the shampoo with the [[ASIN:B00AE07GX0 Nexxus Youth Renewal Plump and Lift Blow Dry Spray, 7.5 Ounce]].  I don&#x27;t have the [[ASIN:B00ALV8EJM Nexxus Youth Renewal Rejuvenating Conditioner, 13.5 Ounce]] yet, but going to buy soon.  The very first day I used the spray, I received many compliments on my hair. Now I use both the shampoo and spray and like the way my hair looks and feels.  I don&#x27;t have a break down like some reviewers do for each of Nexxus claims about this line of hair products, but I did notice my hair is more manageable, has more volume, and the volume lasts longer through the day. Ding! Ding! Ding! We have a winner! Yes, I could find something cheaper, but would it work as well? Perhaps not, and then you have to spend more money to buy a product that does. I hope it works just as well for you!</li>
            <li> Been using a combination of Nexxus Therappe shampoo and Humectress conditioner for years. Jumped to try Youth Renewal as soon as I could. Well. Smell is very mild in comparison with Therappe. Faint floral I guess. Moderate bubbles. Leaves your hair clean, fresh and very light. Translation: it does not have the richness of the Therappe. So so far, it&#x27;s an OK shampoo, good for spring, but if your hair is fried, dried out in cold weather or from the winter of heating, try Therappe. It&#x27;s far better in fixing all kinds of issues - besides, a certain members only store sells it by the gallon at a very agreeable price.&lt;br /&gt;***Update after 2 weeks of use: Dried out the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> I really love the Nexxus line, and the Youth Renewal is no different.  I have long, straight, recently-for-the-first-time-ever-dyed, white girl hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo smells great, and leaves my hair feeling really soft and nice. I use it with the same lines conditioner.</li>
            <li> I guess my requirements for a shampoo to be great are pretty simple: smells good, lathers well, and leaves no residue.  Nexxus Youth Renewal Rejuvenating Shampoo does all three and does all three well.  Another bonus is that it doesn&#x27;t strip away my color, which is especially important.  Pair with the conditioner, and you&#x27;ll be most pleased with the results.  I will definitely buy this brand and product again.</li>
            <li> I am in my early fifties and I&#x27;ve colored my hair for years so I thought this youth renewal shampoo might be just what I need to keep my hair youthful looking.  The bottle lists eight different problems that come with aging hair and though I have not seen all of them in myself yet I want to do everything I can to minimize the damage caused by time. After trying this product a few times I did see a difference in my hair.  It was more curly, thick, and difficult to manage.  Nexxus is a quality brand I love but at this point in my life their moisture adding weightless flavor seems to be more to my hair&#x27;s liking and I am hoping I just don&#x27;t need total renewal of my youth yet!</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo, it works really well. There is a light scent, almost like cocoa butter, but once I blew dried my hair, there was really any scent so it will not interferer with any perfume that you might wear, or if you simply don&#x27;t want your hair having a strong fragrance. It left my hair feeling clean with no residue. I also used [[ASIN:B00ALV8EJM Nexxus Youth Renewal Rejuvenating Conditioner, 13.5 Ounce]], which is the companion conditioner. They really work well together.</li>
            <li> I need only a small amount of this shampoo as it produces lather enough to cover my entire hair. It looks very concentrated and thick just enough to flow out of the bottle with a gentle squeeze. The smell is subtle and pleasant which I like. After I worked it out through the roots and rinse thoroughly, my hair feels clean without any sign of stickiness nor grime even after a hard workout jogging for miles outside. My hair has medium length and medium thickness and is more on the dry side. I usually use a hair dryer to speed up removing excess water, and my hair just looks healthy and bouncy. It doesn&#x27;t look like dry or dull but it maintain a bit of a shine. It is easy to run through the brush and easy to manage and shape using my favorite Gatsby hair products. Overall, an excellent producr and I cannot think of a gripe except for premium tag.</li>
            <li> I have used the Nexxus Youth Renewal Blow Dry Spray and had great results with it. Based on that experience I decided to try the Youth Renewal Shampoo. Not so great results. It did not lather well and left my hair feeling stiff and unmanageable. My hair is baby fine and I did not use the creme rinse just the shampoo, so perhaps one would get better results if used together? I don&#x27;t know but I am not willing to pay $14.00 or more dollars to find out.</li>
            <li> I bought the Youth renewal shampoo and conditioner and the Elixer and really love these products.  My hair feels great and it doesn&#x27;t feel as brittle and flyaway as it did before I started using this product.  Will buy it again.</li>
