            <li> but I do notice that it &#x27;fixed&#x27; my issue a little.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, since I literally JUST got this cream, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s going to work since I&#x27;m still kind of skeptical about creams like this...but fingers</li>

            <li> Even after losing 40 lbs and exercising I still had a lot of loose skin and cellulite.</li>
            <li> After rubbing it in, I put on my Golds Gym waist wrap with the neoprene liner and after about ten minutes, I can feel a little heat and tingle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was not pleased and tries everything to get my body back.</li>
            <li> Like, you know that little pooch when you sit down?</li>

            <li> cream is a little less thick than the stretch mark and scar cream.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s working yet.</li>
            <li> Not sure</li>
            <li> The Cellulite and Body Firming Cream is a fantastic way to firm your skin and combat that nasty cellulite.</li>
            <li> Withing days of using it I could tell a subtle difference.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not a perfect permanent fix</li>
            <li> Anyone who has had a baby know that there is nasty in between period when your body struggles to regain it&#x27;s former glory.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> best cellulite cream, im just using it for couple days but i can feel my skin get firmer..i got this one for discounted prize..thank you</li>
            <li> I have been using Seiva&#x27;s cream for a little bit more than a month and I am really starting to see a difference! I was really shocked; I didn&#x27;t think it would work all that well. I wouldn&#x27;t say that it is any kinda of miracle cream but I do feel like my skin is tighter and smoother after using this product for awhile. I would but this product again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this a few days ago and it came in the mail today and I was so excited I put it right on. I have a 26 inch waist with defined upper abs, but I have a problem with my lower abs. Like, you know that little pooch when you sit down? I hate it. Anyways, I put the cream on my stomach and rubbed it in circular motions like the directions say. It does have a menthol-ish scent, but it doesn&#x27;t really bother me. After rubbing it in, I put on my Golds Gym waist wrap with the neoprene liner and after about ten minutes, I can feel a little heat and tingle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, since I literally JUST got this cream, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s going to work since I&#x27;m still kind of skeptical about creams like this...but fingers crossed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three stars for now, will update after regular use.</li>
            <li> I really did not see a difference while using this. I will continue to use until gone then update my review of anything changes</li>
            <li> I got rash on my abdominal area where I used this cream.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s working yet.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s going to take time to see the results but I hope it will work. I hate stretch marks</li>
            <li> This cream is a great product! I noticed visible results after 2 weeks and after 6 weeks I was very happy with change in skin firmness and appearance I continue to use this product and will recommend it to anyone experiencing cellulite issues.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me in the 30 days or so that I tried it twice a da.  My age may be a factor 54. Not sure but my skin felt softer</li>
            <li> Helps with cellulite. Nice cream</li>
            <li> I feel like this stuff really works and I am always skeptic of creams.</li>
            <li> Having two children the body of my dreams is far .. But still every little bit helps .. I have a lot of cellulite and have tried various scrubs and masks for it .. sad to say most of them don&#x27;t work ..&lt;br /&gt;When I got an opportunity to test this I thought this would be another hoax ..  Am happy to be proved wrong .. After a week of twice a day application.. My skin is smoother and there seems to be an improvement .. This is not that overnight miracle cream .. But it seems that over time .. This will be v beneficial ... Gr8 product</li>
            <li> I have been working it for a week now, and I can see the change. My skin feels so soft after applying that. But I wish I could get little more amount in the jar... :-)</li>
            <li> My skin feels supper silky and my cellulite is less noticeable!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with this product. After much research I decided to buy Sieva Cellulite Firming and Body Contouring Cream and couldn&#x27;t have been more thrilled. I use the product twice a day as the direction instructed, and have seen results. My skin feels firmer, tighter and smoother.  I have been using the product for near a week. And I am loving how my problem areas are you looking better. There is a visible difference. I am very happy with this purchase. Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> I like this product because it goes on so smoothly and it absorbs quickly. It also has a nice scent to it. However, in terms of cellulite, I have not seen any major changes yet, though it does seem to make my skin softer.</li>
            <li> It feels good, still waiting on results!</li>
            <li> the worst money spent</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I have some problem areas on my thighs which really need some help.  Since I have been using the Sieva Body Contouring Cream for one week now and have my skin is feeling softer and smoother!&lt;br /&gt;Another reason I like using the body cream it has a great smell not overpowering or covered with perfume smell.  I have used other creams for contouring in the past that are covered in the perfume smell or really greasy when applying.&lt;br /&gt;An excellent bargain and it works!</li>
            <li> When it comes to skincare products, I always give priority about the scent. When I first open it, it smell so yucky!! It feels like a total jar of chemical.So harsh and strong scent.I only use it on my hips,legs and side of my arms(eeek...) I found two ingredients in it that mainly helps to reduce cellulite- Caffeine and retinyl palpitate. I am still in a process to see the result.&lt;br /&gt;I have received this for free to review.</li>
            <li> works very well, my wife uses it and is very happy</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to try Sieva cellulite cream I don&#x27;t have a major cellulite issue just a bit on the backs of my thighs, it&#x27;s not a perfect permanent fix but I do notice that it &#x27;fixed&#x27; my issue a little. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy this on a regular basis, to me the slight peppermint scent was slightly off putting and the results weren&#x27;t worth what it would cost me to buy it.I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this cream! I have definitely noticed a difference in my cellulite areas. I would recommend this to others to try if they too are self conscious about certain areas of their body.</li>
            <li> Another great product from Sieva! The Cellulite and Body Firming Cream is a fantastic way to firm your skin and combat that nasty cellulite. Anyone who has had a baby know that there is nasty in between period when your body struggles to regain it&#x27;s former glory. During my 3rd pregnancy I gained 60 LBS and had a lot left over when I delivered. Even after losing 40 lbs and exercising I still had a lot of loose skin and cellulite. I was not pleased and tries everything to get my body back. I&#x27;ve tried so many body firming lotions that I could open my own store. lol But the Sieva Cellulite and Body Firming Cream is not like the one you get at the grocery store. It uses a powerful formula of 6 Active Anti-Cellulite ingredients :Caffeine, Retinol, L-Carnitine, Green Tea, Glaucine and Coenzyme-A. In fact it has the most  RETINOL &amp; CAFFEINE then any other cream on the market.&lt;br /&gt;Just like Sieva&#x27;s other creams, this cream is FDA registered, &amp; paraben and cruelty free.  It&#x27;s tested to make sure it&#x27;s not only effective but safe for use. Sieva is so sure that you&#x27;ll love the results that it&#x27;s backed by a 100% money back guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is a little less thick than the stretch mark and scar cream. And I would say that the scent has more of a minty smell to is. The scent does hang around for a while but it&#x27;s a great product. Withing days of using it I could tell a subtle difference. I decided to use it on just one of my legs to see if there was a difference and it&#x27;s pretty great.</li>
            <li> I like to use this product on my legs for the most part and have been pleasantly surprised. It makes my skin feel firmer and smoother and nicely moisturized. This product has a slightly thinner consistency than the stretch mark cream but still feels very nice on my skin and leaves it feeling silky and not sticky or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this product for review. Opinions are my own and come only after extensive personal use.</li>
            <li> So far so good!!!! its not a thick cream but its not greasy I will continue to purchase this cream</li>
            <li> Like this a lot.  It is rather strong but delivers</li>
            <li> After using the entire jar, I did NOT notice any changes in my cellulite or my problem areas.  I would not recommend this product nor would I order it again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect a miracle if you have cellulite. Looks a little better when I use this product, but will not erase cellulite.</li>
            <li> Worked as good as it said!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any difference except for softer skin.</li>
            <li> I use this cream for my arms - because this part of my body makes me feel so self conscious. I have been using this on top of working out and so far, I have noticed that my arms are becoming firmer. I have been religiously using this product and I am happy with the results. It also has quality, all natural ingredients that I appreciate because I have very sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
            <li> Thank you great product its work I recommend it .....</li>
