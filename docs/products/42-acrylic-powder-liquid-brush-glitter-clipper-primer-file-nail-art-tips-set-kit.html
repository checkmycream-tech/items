            <li>Perfect &amp;#34;starter kit&amp;#34; However, the glue I got was brush on and when I knocked it over, it spilled everywhere</li>

            <li>But I liked everything else!</li>
            <li>the accessories are quite good that why I gave two stars</li>
            <li>THE CONTEINERS GOOD  </li>
            <li>is a good product for all the person who are learning to do nails and also have all the instruments and is cheaper then buy it for separated.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s just received and I loved it ..</li>
            <li>Good product but something</li>
            <li>This is to play around, this is a toy, but it can be good for practice .</li>
            <li>Everything was intact and in good shape.</li>
            <li>so i cant say if its a good quality but</li>
            <li>a begginer &amp; this is really good .</li>
            <li>Looks good in the picture</li>
            <li>everything was there, good price for everything you get.</li>
            <li>Good product for the price.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s a good thing because it gives you the chance to slide things in place.</li>
            <li>But it was a good set.</li>
            <li>It is a good starter kit and for the price its good.</li>

            <li>Great starter kit for an ok price.</li>
            <li>so I do thank you guys for that I am so happy :-)</li>
            <li>I love it all, and great quality too.</li>
            <li>Given as a gift for my daughter and she was very pleased with these nail art tips</li>
            <li>Love the brushes and the dotting tools!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am pleased with the kit and cannot wait to try it!</li>
            <li>Love that I got this when I did !</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Just started doing my own acrylics and I freaking love this!</li>
            <li>I choose this rating because I liked my kit</li>
            <li>My product was nice till I tried to use the colored acrylic</li>
            <li>However  the restof the stuff came out nicely</li>
            <li>But nice opi cuticle pen came with.</li>
            <li>and Im loving everything</li>
            <li>She liked it.</li>
            <li>And also it doesn&#x27;t come with nail primer but nice home kit.</li>
            <li>I ordered for my Granddaughter&#x27;s birthday &amp; she was so thrilled with it.</li>
            <li>It gives you a nice variety of colors to work with.</li>
            <li>I do my own nails</li>
            <li>Honestly everything in the kit is alright except for the acrylic powders, brushes, and liquid.</li>
            <li>so I got it before the estimated date which was nice.</li>
            <li>I never had the guts to try to do my own nails until I came across this and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>This is a nice size kit for the price.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pretty sure they are not the best around.</li>
            <li>But this is such a perfect kit to get yourself going doing your own nails....</li>
            <li>Also, the packaging was very cheap (it came in a bag)</li>
            <li>Love this starter kit .</li>
            <li>Love it , all besides the powders are gooey .</li>
            <li>it would have been better to just buy the stuff seperate.</li>
            <li>and I am sure I won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Have to purchase more</li>
            <li>The quality of acrylic powders and glue could be better</li>
            <li>Also in my opinion it comes with too many glitter packs.</li>
            <li>It would have been much better to have more liquid and powder than the glitter.</li>
            <li>I am just ok with this not sire if I would suggest it though.</li>
            <li>Everything else is ok.</li>
            <li>The brushes r ok.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing.</li>
            <li>but I am so going to do it when I get home today.:-)  </li>
            <li>i was pleased with everything else.</li>
            <li>Overall, I was very happy with this set.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with everything I got.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it it came so neatly wrapped granted</li>
            <li>so ok I guess .</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>the brushes were okay</li>
            <li>:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product is cheap!</li>
            <li>I love love love this package it came so neatly packed</li>
            <li>Some what satisfied.</li>
            <li>Had I payed more attention</li>
            <li>I have ordered more nail tips</li>
            <li>the brushes are way better</li>
            <li>If it wasn&#x27;t for not needing to rebuy all the tools I would buy this kit again in the future its definitely a great starter set!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>All around it was an okay buy.</li>
            <li>Every thing was mostly spilled in the bottom of the envelope.</li>
            <li>, I thought it would have more</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE it.</li>
            <li>My daughter enjoyed this product.</li>
            <li>The products are ok.  </li>
            <li>I love this nail set</li>
            <li>If the kit was complete, I&#x27;d chose 5 stars because the colors and glitters are gorgeous!</li>
            <li>Was nice to see her so excited over it.</li>
            <li>This little kit is awesome, i love it!</li>
            <li>I did three sets on myself and it turned out pretty good .</li>
            <li>Comes with great designing extras as well, no instructions are included so if you are brand new to this be prepaired to watch tutorials.</li>
            <li>Awesome love it received it today way before expected time</li>
            <li>It was ok, the monomer wasn&#x27;t the best, had to buy a different one, the brushes were fine to begin with, but they are a pain to clean</li>
            <li>It was good but the acrylic powder not so much</li>
            <li>Loved the whole set.</li>
            <li>but other than that this kit was awesome.</li>
            <li>Nice but not all exact items sent</li>
            <li>Havn&#x27;t tried it out yet but it came here in less than a week and everything is beautiful!</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t see why everyone is complaining about the acrylic being lumpy and sticky because mine worked just fine when I do my clients nails</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!!!!!</li>
            <li>I was super excited when I got it !</li>
            <li>totally great kit for only 50 bucks....</li>
            <li>The glue is not the strongest, BUT if you&#x27;re just starting this is GREAT for practicing.</li>
            <li>everything is cheap and looked like a dollar toy nails kit....</li>
            <li>I just wished my acrylic colors were all filled up.</li>
            <li>But I guess if you are a beginner then you should practice with this cheap product.</li>
            <li>This kit has EVERYTHING in it, and is a fantastic deal for samples of all the basics.</li>
            <li>just started doing my own nails a bit ago, so I got this to really delve into it.</li>
            <li>With good brands it&#x27;s seamless.</li>
            <li>The powders and glitters are probably good for one use or three max, unless you mix them with the clear powder.</li>
            <li>For the amount of stuff in this kit it was worth the money!</li>
            <li>I had originally bought it for myself (with help from my mom on choosing)</li>
            <li>My mom loves the color range it came with and the glitter and rhinestones, all the stuff it came with as well, said that it was better than the first nail kit they got at school, so I gave it to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was really excited when I got it.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m excited.  </li>
            <li>But the packaging wasn&#x27;t great and one of the powders was empty and all over everything inside the box.</li>
            <li>in all pretty great, big bonus with the price as well.</li>
            <li>am happy with the size of everything as it is what I had expected.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s wasn&#x27;t good such as the glue and the powder</li>
            <li>The reason i&#x27;m rating this product a 3 is because all of the acrylic powder wasn&#x27;t full.</li>
            <li>I would recommend buying this product but let the seller know that you want your acrylic powders to be full.</li>
            <li>and I was hoping that this kit would last me awhile and be a good deal.</li>
            <li>Other than that it a great kit.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t come with any nail primer other than that it&#x27;s a great kit.</li>
            <li>It came with everything listed, I love the fact that it&#x27;s a clear glass dish instead of a plastic one, and I love how much it comes with.</li>
            <li>this product works great, it was shipped quickly to my home with minimal leaking, and is exactly as pictured on the website.</li>
            <li>I am so happy I have done a few full sets on myself</li>
            <li>This kit had pretty much everything I needed and love the colors and jems.</li>
            <li>Love it so far!</li>
            <li>Everything came exactly how pictured !</li>
            <li>I love the fact that my package came almost 2 weeks early!</li>
            <li>It came super fast and the quantity you get is huge.</li>
            <li>and I am really happy the write to me and saying it was going to be a little lite</li>
            <li>The nail cutters are a little flimsy but still work great.  </li>
            <li>This kit has nearly everything you need to get started doing nails, just make sure to order an acrylic primer because this kit does not include that.</li>
            <li>This set is good for starting and learning but you will need to purchase additional liquid acrylic and powder if you practice much.</li>
            <li>Also I would have liked if they had the #14 &amp; #16 brush rather than the smaller ones.</li>
            <li>This kit comes with everything you need to make colorful nails</li>
            <li>I recommend better packaging like a box or something more careful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth what you pay for it</li>
            <li>The nail design molds look like fun.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s awesome ( except the acrylic liquid jug was only half full.)</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone just starting out with acrylic nails, or anyone who just needs to get more practice in and get familiar with the tools.</li>
            <li>Other than that everything else was good for beginners.</li>
            <li>I dont like the acrylic but all the other things are good</li>
            <li>when i used the glue i knocked it over and it came right out of the bottle</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t hold right</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t right now</li>
            <li>My order came right on time.</li>
            <li>all super smooth and professional looking.</li>
            <li>The dotting tools and gems will be fun to play with when I get braver ;)</li>
            <li>I did notice it worked better when applied to the tip as opposed to your finger.the file is awesome as it just saws away at the acrylic so even if you are heavy handed and uneven when applying it you can still make it come out</li>
            <li>Very Happy with this order but thought the powders were a little larger</li>
            <li>and I got everything except of my 4way filer.but its ok and for a low price totally worth it</li>
            <li>It comes with far more stuff than you really need so its a lot to play around with.</li>
            <li>Luckily the couple things there were glass in the box were not broken.  </li>
            <li>I first practiced with this stuff</li>
            <li>they look bigger in the picture then they are and they dont stay on nails any better then the glue on nails</li>
            <li>First off I have not done my nails</li>
            <li>so I got exactly what I thought I was going to.</li>
            <li>you would know ahead of time exactly what you are getting.</li>
            <li>i only gave it two stars is because the rest of the stuff is ok.</li>
            <li>and they turned out pretty well.</li>
            <li>So much comes in this kit!</li>
            <li>I am saddened that I hadn&#x27;t purchased it the first time I looked into it months ago.</li>
            <li>it isn&#x27;t even funny.</li>
            <li>it isn&#x27;t even funny</li>
            <li>I love that it came with colored acrylic and the white to cut it with-</li>
            <li>There was powder all ove the things when I first opened it.</li>
            <li>absolutely everything that wasn&#x27;t sealed right was spilled.</li>
            <li>Other than that, overall a great starter kit for a beginner.</li>
            <li>a LOT just to make sure it does not leak and placed it inside of a zip lock bag to make sure it doesn&#x27;t spill all over everything else again.&lt;br /&gt;Other than the bottle having a hole I am also missing the Clear Glass Dappen Dish.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so I am not sure how the products themselves work, but by looking they seem like good quality.</li>
            <li>Good stuff so far for the price, although the small colored powder acrylic is super small and don&#x27;t seem good quality.</li>
            <li>All the nail equipment you will ever need, if you want them to dry super fast I do reccomend a UV acrylic nail drying light</li>
            <li>When they did arrive, they were all there, the set was quite large for the price and everything in the picture was included.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t receive the file, the pink block and the flowers, and the 10 nail forms were very cheap</li>
            <li>got everything that&#x27;s in the picture, took long to arrive but was worth it!!</li>
            <li>The pigment is very high and diluting it evenly makes no difference in the color</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t as much acrylic in container.</li>
            <li>Hardens up fast.</li>
            <li>so i dont really use alot of acrylic to do my nails.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used much of it.</li>
            <li>Haha</li>
            <li>it says how much of each thing you get</li>
            <li>much stuff</li>
            <li>Absolutely fell inlove with this product.</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t want to complain too much.</li>
            <li>I did not receive the liquid so the whole package is obsolete.</li>
            <li>Acrylic powders don&#x27;t work, they are very gooey and sticky &amp; that messes up the brushes.</li>
            <li>I really like this kit.</li>
            <li>the powder is really crappy.</li>
            <li>do yourself a favor and buy a real kit.</li>
            <li>and it was fast shipping too</li>
            <li>This stuff is very harmful to your health.</li>
            <li>which is why this stuff WILL NOT soak off like real nail acrylic.</li>
            <li>so really be cautious with that.</li>
            <li>so shipment was fast.</li>
            <li>but I emailed the seller and they handled it very well</li>
            <li>and I really wish it had options but</li>
            <li>There is tons of acrylic powder and liquid (you don&#x27;t really use much)</li>
            <li>All the acrylic gets sticky and doesnt take very well with the liquid.</li>
            <li>I did really like this kit</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Powder is really gooey, but still works.</li>
            <li>other wise its only a 5 minute wait,  </li>
            <li>but is ok other than that everything works for me</li>
            <li>If you want to have beautiful nails at a cheaper cost buy gel mani kits instead, i recommend still going to a salon but having a home gel mani kit is no where near as harmful as using one of these acrylic kits, the worse you can do with gel is maybe buffing too much of your nail bed...</li>
            <li>Other than that, its okay.</li>
            <li>Nor sure if I didn&#x27;t completely read the description but all the tips are white,  none are clear.  </li>
            <li>LIVE!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to doing nails,  I don&#x27;t really have anything to compare them to,  so for me,  </li>
            <li>somethings were not closed right....</li>
            <li>it was a decent starter kit</li>
            <li>I have seriously never been so upset in my life.</li>
            <li>But, it is a decent starter pack.</li>
            <li>Sure the professionl versions r more expensive but</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t send a few things the was including in the package necessary for make a good work in the nails</li>
            <li>Everything was wrapped up in foil if it had the potential to leak and nothing had there are so many different colors and glitters and baubles</li>
            <li>The pink powder was more of a clear and the liquid and powder together</li>
            <li>but at this point I do not have high expectations.</li>
            <li>I will be a little better at doing acrylics and can invest in a brand name acrylic powder and monomer..</li>
            <li>The reason I rate this a 4 is because I think they should package this item a little better.</li>
            <li>a few scoops of each will do a full set and it lasts so much longer!!</li>
            <li>A waste of my time and money, and the supplies are cheap!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t ok with this, the glue that came with it dried out (without being opened) after about a week.</li>
            <li>the color is exactly the same and goes much farther.</li>
            <li>only thing they missed was the primer but for the price it was worth it ; shhh, I cancelled a date to do my nails tonight .So</li>
            <li>But overall it IS worth the money I paid.</li>
            <li>Other than that, everything is fine, I like it.</li>
            <li>the brushes are cheap, my package came super late</li>
            <li>It came quickly in a deceptively small box that was just jam packed full of nail stuff.</li>
            <li>but I am looking forward to using all my new product.</li>
            <li>works like a professional kit if you know what you are doing!</li>
            <li>I use those by mixing them with the entity clear powder.</li>
            <li>It did arrive early.</li>
            <li>I purchased two of these kits from eBay and also a professional set from beauty west.com.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews before I ordered and the reviews so far and in the description</li>
            <li>As far as a lot of people complaining about the size of the powder and the liquid - if you look in the description and see what the amounts are that you were getting then</li>
            <li>Acrylic Powder too old.</li>
            <li>anyone who complains this isn&#x27;t really what you wanted and obviously don&#x27;t do nails.</li>
            <li>it came 2 weeks early and every ting was in there</li>
            <li>it say that it comes with and also the acrylic liquid bottle it has on the picture isn&#x27;t really that bottle its smaller...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I ignored the negative reviews.</li>
            <li>I dnt do nails professionally</li>
            <li>but so far I like it</li>
            <li>but that can be picked up anywhere for a few dollars and this kit is totally worth the price!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll ever use colored acrylic or all this glitter, but the nail clipper, buffers, glue, liquid and powders are worth the cost of the whole set.  </li>
            <li>I checked all my colors, and the only one that leaked(leaving the container itself empty) was one of the pale rose</li>
            <li>The only thing I was really upset about was that the nail clipper broke on the 2nd nail</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste you money in this you can get at least one good quality monomer and powder for this money....</li>
            <li>I then tried with the expensive products I also bought and the results were a million times better!</li>
            <li>the color is always darker when dry than it appears in powder form, so if you want to have the exact color nails as the powder you may want to add white acrylic powder to the mix and do it in even thirds..</li>
            <li>The glue isn&#x27;t that strong and the nails only last a few days .</li>
            <li>if you mix equal parts, say 4 scoops clear and 4 scoops colored acrylic</li>
            <li>the monomer (acrylic liquid) came with the same bottle as the picture but without label instead someone wrote something in chinesse with a sharpie....the clear acrylic powder was EZ Flow</li>
            <li>And also, everything was SO much tinier than expected.</li>
            <li>The pink acrylic isn&#x27;t super pink but could be with added colors.</li>
            <li>the only thing was that the colors were half filled as well as the white, pink and clear powder.</li>
            <li>the little pots of color dont have very much in them.</li>
            <li>so 1*3 clear 1/3 white and 1/3 white...</li>
            <li>the glitters were bigger but that is nothing major.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very sticky and it&#x27;s a mess.</li>
            <li>By the time the package arrived all of the products were a mess different colors in different places and the liquid had spilled so much that there wasn&#x27;t even enough to do a set of nails.  </li>
            <li>Anyways, I&#x27;m warning all future potential buyers, don&#x27;t waste your time and please think of your health because the guys that created this kit certainly weren&#x27;t thinking of it.</li>
            <li>The liquid and the clear pink and white acrylics are way smaller then the picture shows!!</li>
            <li>Like the clear acrylic I only had pink and white.</li>

            <li> the accessories are quite good that why I gave two stars</li>
            <li> THE CONTEINERS GOOD  </li>
            <li> is a good product for all the person who are learning to do nails and also have all the instruments and is cheaper then buy it for separated.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s just received and I loved it ..</li>
            <li> Good product but something</li>
            <li> This is to play around, this is a toy, but it can be good for practice .</li>
            <li> Everything was intact and in good shape.</li>
            <li> so i cant say if its a good quality but</li>
            <li> a begginer &amp; this is really good .</li>
            <li> Looks good in the picture</li>
            <li> everything was there, good price for everything you get.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s a good thing because it gives you the chance to slide things in place.</li>
            <li> But it was a good set.</li>
            <li> It is a good starter kit and for the price its good.</li>

            <li> Given as a gift for my daughter and she was very pleased with these nail art tips</li>
            <li> Love the brushes and the dotting tools!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I am pleased with the kit and cannot wait to try it!</li>
            <li> Love that I got this when I did !</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Just started doing my own acrylics and I freaking love this!</li>
            <li> I choose this rating because I liked my kit</li>
            <li> My product was nice till I tried to use the colored acrylic</li>
            <li> However  the restof the stuff came out nicely</li>
            <li> But nice opi cuticle pen came with.</li>
            <li> and Im loving everything</li>
            <li> She liked it.</li>
            <li> And also it doesn&#x27;t come with nail primer but nice home kit.</li>
            <li> I ordered for my Granddaughter&#x27;s birthday &amp; she was so thrilled with it.</li>
            <li> It gives you a nice variety of colors to work with.</li>
            <li> I do my own nails</li>
            <li> Honestly everything in the kit is alright except for the acrylic powders, brushes, and liquid.</li>
            <li> so I got it before the estimated date which was nice.</li>
            <li> I never had the guts to try to do my own nails until I came across this and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> This is a nice size kit for the price.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m pretty sure they are not the best around.</li>
            <li> But this is such a perfect kit to get yourself going doing your own nails....</li>
            <li> Also, the packaging was very cheap (it came in a bag)</li>
            <li> Love this starter kit .</li>
            <li> Love it , all besides the powders are gooey .</li>
            <li> it would have been better to just buy the stuff seperate.</li>
            <li> and I am sure I won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Have to purchase more</li>
            <li> The quality of acrylic powders and glue could be better</li>
            <li> Also in my opinion it comes with too many glitter packs.</li>
            <li> It would have been much better to have more liquid and powder than the glitter.</li>
            <li> I am just ok with this not sire if I would suggest it though.</li>
            <li> Everything else is ok.</li>
            <li> The brushes r ok.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing.</li>
            <li> but I am so going to do it when I get home today.:-)  </li>
            <li> i was pleased with everything else.</li>
            <li> Overall, I was very happy with this set.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with everything I got.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it it came so neatly wrapped granted</li>
            <li> so ok I guess .</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> the brushes were okay</li>
            <li> :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product is cheap!</li>
            <li> I love love love this package it came so neatly packed</li>
            <li> Some what satisfied.</li>
            <li> Had I payed more attention</li>
            <li> I have ordered more nail tips</li>
            <li> the brushes are way better</li>
            <li> If it wasn&#x27;t for not needing to rebuy all the tools I would buy this kit again in the future its definitely a great starter set!</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> All around it was an okay buy.</li>
            <li> Every thing was mostly spilled in the bottom of the envelope.</li>
            <li> , I thought it would have more</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE it.</li>
            <li> My daughter enjoyed this product.</li>
            <li> The products are ok.  </li>
            <li> I love this nail set</li>
            <li> If the kit was complete, I&#x27;d chose 5 stars because the colors and glitters are gorgeous!</li>
            <li> Was nice to see her so excited over it.</li>
            <li> This little kit is awesome, i love it!</li>
            <li> I did three sets on myself and it turned out pretty good .</li>
            <li> Comes with great designing extras as well, no instructions are included so if you are brand new to this be prepaired to watch tutorials.</li>
            <li> Awesome love it received it today way before expected time</li>
            <li> It was ok, the monomer wasn&#x27;t the best, had to buy a different one, the brushes were fine to begin with, but they are a pain to clean</li>
            <li> It was good but the acrylic powder not so much</li>
            <li> Loved the whole set.</li>
            <li> but other than that this kit was awesome.</li>
            <li> Nice but not all exact items sent</li>
            <li> Havn&#x27;t tried it out yet but it came here in less than a week and everything is beautiful!</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t see why everyone is complaining about the acrylic being lumpy and sticky because mine worked just fine when I do my clients nails</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was super excited when I got it !</li>
            <li> totally great kit for only 50 bucks....</li>
            <li> The glue is not the strongest, BUT if you&#x27;re just starting this is GREAT for practicing.</li>
            <li> everything is cheap and looked like a dollar toy nails kit....</li>
            <li> I just wished my acrylic colors were all filled up.</li>
            <li> But I guess if you are a beginner then you should practice with this cheap product.</li>
            <li> This kit has EVERYTHING in it, and is a fantastic deal for samples of all the basics.</li>
            <li> just started doing my own nails a bit ago, so I got this to really delve into it.</li>
            <li> With good brands it&#x27;s seamless.</li>
            <li> The powders and glitters are probably good for one use or three max, unless you mix them with the clear powder.</li>
            <li> For the amount of stuff in this kit it was worth the money!</li>
            <li> I had originally bought it for myself (with help from my mom on choosing)</li>
            <li> My mom loves the color range it came with and the glitter and rhinestones, all the stuff it came with as well, said that it was better than the first nail kit they got at school, so I gave it to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was really excited when I got it.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m excited.  </li>
            <li> But the packaging wasn&#x27;t great and one of the powders was empty and all over everything inside the box.</li>
            <li> in all pretty great, big bonus with the price as well.</li>
            <li> am happy with the size of everything as it is what I had expected.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s wasn&#x27;t good such as the glue and the powder</li>
            <li> The reason i&#x27;m rating this product a 3 is because all of the acrylic powder wasn&#x27;t full.</li>
            <li> I would recommend buying this product but let the seller know that you want your acrylic powders to be full.</li>
            <li> and I was hoping that this kit would last me awhile and be a good deal.</li>
            <li> Other than that it a great kit.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t come with any nail primer other than that it&#x27;s a great kit.</li>
            <li> It came with everything listed, I love the fact that it&#x27;s a clear glass dish instead of a plastic one, and I love how much it comes with.</li>
            <li> this product works great, it was shipped quickly to my home with minimal leaking, and is exactly as pictured on the website.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I have done a few full sets on myself</li>
            <li> This kit had pretty much everything I needed and love the colors and jems.</li>
            <li> Love it so far!</li>
            <li> Everything came exactly how pictured !</li>
            <li> I love the fact that my package came almost 2 weeks early!</li>
            <li> It came super fast and the quantity you get is huge.</li>
            <li> and I am really happy the write to me and saying it was going to be a little lite</li>
            <li> The nail cutters are a little flimsy but still work great.  </li>
            <li> This kit has nearly everything you need to get started doing nails, just make sure to order an acrylic primer because this kit does not include that.</li>
            <li> This set is good for starting and learning but you will need to purchase additional liquid acrylic and powder if you practice much.</li>
            <li> Also I would have liked if they had the #14 &amp; #16 brush rather than the smaller ones.</li>
            <li> This kit comes with everything you need to make colorful nails</li>
            <li> I recommend better packaging like a box or something more careful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth what you pay for it</li>
            <li> The nail design molds look like fun.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome ( except the acrylic liquid jug was only half full.)</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone just starting out with acrylic nails, or anyone who just needs to get more practice in and get familiar with the tools.</li>
            <li> Other than that everything else was good for beginners.</li>
            <li> I dont like the acrylic but all the other things are good</li>
            <li> when i used the glue i knocked it over and it came right out of the bottle</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t hold right</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t right now</li>
            <li> My order came right on time.</li>
            <li> all super smooth and professional looking.</li>
            <li> The dotting tools and gems will be fun to play with when I get braver ;)</li>
            <li> I did notice it worked better when applied to the tip as opposed to your finger.the file is awesome as it just saws away at the acrylic so even if you are heavy handed and uneven when applying it you can still make it come out</li>
            <li> Very Happy with this order but thought the powders were a little larger</li>
            <li> and I got everything except of my 4way filer.but its ok and for a low price totally worth it</li>
            <li> It comes with far more stuff than you really need so its a lot to play around with.</li>
            <li> Luckily the couple things there were glass in the box were not broken.  </li>
            <li> I first practiced with this stuff</li>
            <li> they look bigger in the picture then they are and they dont stay on nails any better then the glue on nails</li>
            <li> First off I have not done my nails</li>
            <li> so I got exactly what I thought I was going to.</li>
            <li> you would know ahead of time exactly what you are getting.</li>
            <li> i only gave it two stars is because the rest of the stuff is ok.</li>
            <li> and they turned out pretty well.</li>
            <li> So much comes in this kit!</li>
            <li> I am saddened that I hadn&#x27;t purchased it the first time I looked into it months ago.</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t even funny.</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t even funny</li>
            <li> I love that it came with colored acrylic and the white to cut it with-</li>
            <li> There was powder all ove the things when I first opened it.</li>
            <li> absolutely everything that wasn&#x27;t sealed right was spilled.</li>
            <li> Other than that, overall a great starter kit for a beginner.</li>
            <li> a LOT just to make sure it does not leak and placed it inside of a zip lock bag to make sure it doesn&#x27;t spill all over everything else again.&lt;br /&gt;Other than the bottle having a hole I am also missing the Clear Glass Dappen Dish.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so I am not sure how the products themselves work, but by looking they seem like good quality.</li>
            <li> Good stuff so far for the price, although the small colored powder acrylic is super small and don&#x27;t seem good quality.</li>
            <li> All the nail equipment you will ever need, if you want them to dry super fast I do reccomend a UV acrylic nail drying light</li>
            <li> When they did arrive, they were all there, the set was quite large for the price and everything in the picture was included.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive the file, the pink block and the flowers, and the 10 nail forms were very cheap</li>
            <li> got everything that&#x27;s in the picture, took long to arrive but was worth it!!</li>
            <li> The pigment is very high and diluting it evenly makes no difference in the color</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t as much acrylic in container.</li>
            <li> Hardens up fast.</li>
            <li> so i dont really use alot of acrylic to do my nails.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used much of it.</li>
            <li> Haha</li>
            <li> it says how much of each thing you get</li>
            <li> much stuff</li>
            <li> Absolutely fell inlove with this product.</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t want to complain too much.</li>
            <li> I did not receive the liquid so the whole package is obsolete.</li>
            <li> Acrylic powders don&#x27;t work, they are very gooey and sticky &amp; that messes up the brushes.</li>
            <li> I really like this kit.</li>
            <li> the powder is really crappy.</li>
            <li> do yourself a favor and buy a real kit.</li>
            <li> and it was fast shipping too</li>
            <li> This stuff is very harmful to your health.</li>
            <li> which is why this stuff WILL NOT soak off like real nail acrylic.</li>
            <li> so really be cautious with that.</li>
            <li> so shipment was fast.</li>
            <li> but I emailed the seller and they handled it very well</li>
            <li> and I really wish it had options but</li>
            <li> There is tons of acrylic powder and liquid (you don&#x27;t really use much)</li>
            <li> All the acrylic gets sticky and doesnt take very well with the liquid.</li>
            <li> I did really like this kit</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Powder is really gooey, but still works.</li>
            <li> other wise its only a 5 minute wait,  </li>
            <li> but is ok other than that everything works for me</li>
            <li> If you want to have beautiful nails at a cheaper cost buy gel mani kits instead, i recommend still going to a salon but having a home gel mani kit is no where near as harmful as using one of these acrylic kits, the worse you can do with gel is maybe buffing too much of your nail bed...</li>
            <li> Other than that, its okay.</li>
            <li> Nor sure if I didn&#x27;t completely read the description but all the tips are white,  none are clear.  </li>
            <li> LIVE!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to doing nails,  I don&#x27;t really have anything to compare them to,  so for me,  </li>
            <li> somethings were not closed right....</li>
            <li> it was a decent starter kit</li>
            <li> I have seriously never been so upset in my life.</li>
            <li> But, it is a decent starter pack.</li>
            <li> Sure the professionl versions r more expensive but</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t send a few things the was including in the package necessary for make a good work in the nails</li>
            <li> Everything was wrapped up in foil if it had the potential to leak and nothing had there are so many different colors and glitters and baubles</li>
            <li> The pink powder was more of a clear and the liquid and powder together</li>
            <li> but at this point I do not have high expectations.</li>
            <li> I will be a little better at doing acrylics and can invest in a brand name acrylic powder and monomer..</li>
            <li> The reason I rate this a 4 is because I think they should package this item a little better.</li>
            <li> a few scoops of each will do a full set and it lasts so much longer!!</li>
            <li> A waste of my time and money, and the supplies are cheap!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t ok with this, the glue that came with it dried out (without being opened) after about a week.</li>
            <li> the color is exactly the same and goes much farther.</li>
            <li> only thing they missed was the primer but for the price it was worth it ; shhh, I cancelled a date to do my nails tonight .So</li>
            <li> But overall it IS worth the money I paid.</li>
            <li> Other than that, everything is fine, I like it.</li>
            <li> the brushes are cheap, my package came super late</li>
            <li> It came quickly in a deceptively small box that was just jam packed full of nail stuff.</li>
            <li> but I am looking forward to using all my new product.</li>
            <li> works like a professional kit if you know what you are doing!</li>
            <li> I use those by mixing them with the entity clear powder.</li>
            <li> It did arrive early.</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these kits from eBay and also a professional set from beauty west.com.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before I ordered and the reviews so far and in the description</li>
            <li> As far as a lot of people complaining about the size of the powder and the liquid - if you look in the description and see what the amounts are that you were getting then</li>
            <li> Acrylic Powder too old.</li>
            <li> anyone who complains this isn&#x27;t really what you wanted and obviously don&#x27;t do nails.</li>
            <li> it came 2 weeks early and every ting was in there</li>
            <li> it say that it comes with and also the acrylic liquid bottle it has on the picture isn&#x27;t really that bottle its smaller...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I ignored the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> I dnt do nails professionally</li>
            <li> but so far I like it</li>
            <li> but that can be picked up anywhere for a few dollars and this kit is totally worth the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll ever use colored acrylic or all this glitter, but the nail clipper, buffers, glue, liquid and powders are worth the cost of the whole set.  </li>
            <li> I checked all my colors, and the only one that leaked(leaving the container itself empty) was one of the pale rose</li>
            <li> The only thing I was really upset about was that the nail clipper broke on the 2nd nail</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste you money in this you can get at least one good quality monomer and powder for this money....</li>
            <li> I then tried with the expensive products I also bought and the results were a million times better!</li>
            <li> the color is always darker when dry than it appears in powder form, so if you want to have the exact color nails as the powder you may want to add white acrylic powder to the mix and do it in even thirds..</li>
            <li> The glue isn&#x27;t that strong and the nails only last a few days .</li>
            <li> if you mix equal parts, say 4 scoops clear and 4 scoops colored acrylic</li>
            <li> the monomer (acrylic liquid) came with the same bottle as the picture but without label instead someone wrote something in chinesse with a sharpie....the clear acrylic powder was EZ Flow</li>
            <li> And also, everything was SO much tinier than expected.</li>
            <li> The pink acrylic isn&#x27;t super pink but could be with added colors.</li>
            <li> the only thing was that the colors were half filled as well as the white, pink and clear powder.</li>
            <li> the little pots of color dont have very much in them.</li>
            <li> so 1*3 clear 1/3 white and 1/3 white...</li>
            <li> the glitters were bigger but that is nothing major.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very sticky and it&#x27;s a mess.</li>
            <li> By the time the package arrived all of the products were a mess different colors in different places and the liquid had spilled so much that there wasn&#x27;t even enough to do a set of nails.  </li>
            <li> Anyways, I&#x27;m warning all future potential buyers, don&#x27;t waste your time and please think of your health because the guys that created this kit certainly weren&#x27;t thinking of it.</li>
            <li> The liquid and the clear pink and white acrylics are way smaller then the picture shows!!</li>
            <li> Like the clear acrylic I only had pink and white.</li>
            <li> nail tech thing is pretty hard anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> some are not good but for myself is useful.</li>
            <li> My wife likes the kit it stocked her up on a few new items that she needed.</li>
            <li> No directions with the package to tell you anything.everything was stuffed into a big loose envelope.</li>
            <li> the files wear down the first time you use them and the brushes are stiff.</li>
            <li> dries way too fast making it hard to work with.</li>
            <li> the only complaint I have is when I used the clear powder my nails turned a yellowish color the next day</li>
            <li> i had a lot of trouble with the white, clear and pink acrylic setting up.</li>
            <li> it stays gooey for a long time</li>
            <li> It applies on clumpy and not seamless.</li>
            <li> Came with everything, but package was way smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> Im not a professional</li>
            <li> The packaging was kinda crappy (came in a giant Manila envelope) and a bunch of the pink acrylic powder was spilled inside.</li>
            <li> The acrylics don&#x27;t stay on as long as they probably should have.</li>
            <li> And the pink, clear, and white powder were not filled all the way</li>
            <li> The bottles of acrylic liquid and powder are very small but other then that, fun to play around with.</li>
            <li> Overall, everything is small, not as i expected by what the picture showed but for me being a begginer and new to this, it will work.</li>
            <li> My only problem was that some of the colored acrilic spilt in the bag because the lids weren&#x27;t screwed on tight, but no big deal.</li>
            <li> Due to shipping some residue will be on the outside of the contents.</li>
            <li> like are in this kit and a little 10ml bottle of acrylic liquid for ten bucks this has probably enough stuff to keep my nails done all year plus extras to play with.</li>
            <li> Be warned though some products directions are in Chinese other than that no complaints.</li>
            <li> I spent too much money on this for it to come late and spilled.</li>
            <li> My items look like the contents in each single package have either spilled or used.</li>
            <li> but they fell apart within a short amount of time, not worth 40$.</li>
            <li> glue didn&#x27;t glue nailsor jem&#x27;s down, and the aacrylic is not enough to do nails.</li>
            <li> so I can practice, we were expecting a big package and we were let down.</li>
            <li> everything looks good exept that one of my color acrylic powder was open but nothing bad &amp;&amp; also some were not filed up they where half empty there was only one little thing missing idk</li>
            <li> Oh and FYI for those of you who complained about there being such a small amount of colored acrylic and glitter if you knew what you were doing you would know it&#x27;s intended to be mixed with clear acrylic powder not used alone.</li>
            <li> The only thing it is missing is a nail primer.</li>
            <li> they are a total waste of money</li>
            <li> but the box was empty..</li>
            <li> and it came empty because it spill out inside the bag....</li>
            <li> It took 15 days for me to get this product, from the day I placed my order to today, which I expected.</li>
            <li> and it is to be expected.  </li>
            <li> The clippers you have to be careful cause unproper use</li>
            <li> but I used the pink and did a friend&#x27;s nails</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s to be expected</li>
            <li> It took around 2 weeks to recive it, but i did get it sooner than I expected.</li>
            <li> but it all a rough</li>
            <li> The filing blocks didn&#x27;t work as well as I expected...</li>
            <li> If your not positive what all you need to do them your selves this is your answer.</li>
            <li> The brushes are hard to use and they dont last long at all!</li>
            <li> has everything that it said it was going to have, nothing was missing, it took a long time to get here</li>
            <li> the acrylic is the only thing is rally small</li>
            <li> but the other two are not even a known brand and everything is in chinesse.</li>
            <li> I should know better....:-(</li>
            <li> the glue doesn&#x27;t burn your skin like the other reviews say.</li>
            <li> It came in a small box, everything is smaller than shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> The few little glitters I did receive were spilled all over the bag they were all put together in so all of the colors mixed together.</li>
            <li> The dotting pin was still stuck inside of the bottle so only a little bit got on a few things.</li>
            <li> Poor packaging the powder was open and all over inside of bag glitter was open to and spilled inside of bag</li>
            <li> I have waited weeks only to be missing a few things out that package.</li>
            <li> There was some powder that was on the outside of some of the containers but hardly any</li>
            <li> Not worth the $ though.</li>
            <li> Just go to Sallys and buy ur set because this one is not worth it.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> So not worth it.</li>
            <li> Products are not worth it</li>
            <li> one or two of the pots was slightly opened so everything in the box had powder on  it.</li>
            <li> I had have to powder in the package all over the place half the stuff that was supposed to be in there</li>
            <li> it said I wouldn&#x27;t get it for about a month and a half</li>
            <li> Then it came with no primer and Half the freaking liquid acrylic was spilled.</li>
            <li> I received this kit less than half the estimated delivery time.&lt;br /&gt;Everything was packaged tightly...</li>
            <li> but it was all tightly packed with no problems.  </li>
            <li> so I had a very strong base to hold the acrylic  for at least two weeks.</li>
            <li> U can tell where u applied each section because the previous area dried up</li>
            <li> The glue is not something I would recommend because if it spills it burn and starts smoking &amp; if you get a little on you it burns the skin</li>
            <li> Had a little mishap in the beginning with my package not arriving at all.</li>
            <li> instead I recived little dots to use as nail designs...</li>
            <li> that what I got in the little kit too.</li>
            <li> Was a little disapointed in the powders though.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY, ITS NOT WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> the acrylics were hard to work with with such hard brushes .</li>
            <li> It is what  is just a starter kit, the containers of the contents are not full, theirs no primer, its a mess!</li>
            <li> are all uneven amounts.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> the glue came sealed shut and dried.</li>
            <li> MISSING THE ACRYLIC LIQUID AND SOME DOTING PENS, GLUE .</li>
            <li> But I was missing a nail glue and a nail buffer .</li>
            <li> and it will hurt for a few days .</li>
            <li> it is missing the primer</li>
            <li> You will run out after a few sets.</li>
            <li> I expected the stuff to be in a box at least.</li>
            <li> BUT I will be showing them my package and what was missing before they buy.</li>
            <li> Half of the stuff listed here was not sent to me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also not sure what the gold stickers w black grids r for.  </li>
            <li> I got this kit, primer, UV gel coat and a drill for less than $55!</li>
            <li> Not easy to work with.</li>
            <li> The glue dries a little slow</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not satisfied with this product at all</li>
            <li> The acrylic is difficult to work with... and everything is much smaller than I anticipated.</li>
            <li> IS TOO SMALL AND COME  </li>
            <li> It was just not a great product a i expected it to be</li>
            <li> I have seen a lot of reviews containing complaints on the small amt of colored acrylic..</li>
            <li> Hope this helps a few of you!</li>
            <li> and they came all messed up, the glitters containers are SO small</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s how small the jars of the powder are</li>
            <li> The nail liquid bottle is small too, hand size small.</li>
            <li> Then the acrylic powder are so small and have a spacer in them</li>
            <li> Comes in an envelope bubble wraped powders are small</li>
            <li> I hate it first dey to small d acrylic powder</li>
            <li> The acrylic liquid was the size of a small candle, the acrylic powder was very small as well</li>
            <li> the become like chewing gum and than they become immediately hard...</li>
            <li> granted i shoudnt have been clumsy.</li>
            <li> The glue sucks it</li>
            <li> The liquid is toxic to breath and the overall product WILL damage your nails not to mention lift like crazy.</li>
            <li> only question is why was the inside of the package dirty?</li>
            <li> I mean that when u apply bead after bead of acrylic they blend together.</li>
            <li> It comes with very small liquid and powder.</li>
            <li> They are also very small.</li>
            <li> The powder is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed only in the cuticle oil as there was a box for it</li>
            <li> BTW the brushes are weak they broke.</li>
            <li> , it just really confused me to why it was dirty, like dark dust in there.</li>

            <li> So it was useless.</li>
            <li> I tried out 1 Size 6 pinky nail and the acrylic liquid mixed with the acrylic powders was horrible. .</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I now have to make a trip to the store to get some glue because I don&#x27;t have any.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with the items.</li>
            <li> that stuff is usually expensive.</li>
            <li> Hate the glue, very messy.</li>
            <li> this is crazy.  </li>
            <li> All of my products were dirty and in disarray..</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s very very difficult to work with unles</li>

            <li> And, the smell of the acrylic liquid spread throughout my house and was disgusted.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this starter kit . Has everything I needed besides clippers</li>
            <li> a bunch of junk thrown in a brown box - very disappointing</li>
            <li> Nice but not all exact items sent</li>
            <li> The liquid and the clear pink and white acrylics are way smaller then the picture shows!! Everything looks like it was used like the acrylic colors are all uneven amounts. The stuff is great but I guess you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> Great starter kit for an ok price. No primer come with kit. Due to shipping some residue will be on the outside of the contents. There isn&#x27;t as much acrylic in container. Other than that, everything is fine, I like it.</li>
            <li> This kit has nearly everything you need to get started doing nails, just make sure to order an acrylic primer because this kit does not include that. Also it is helpful to order a practice hand. I am a very happy customer!</li>
            <li> Love it , all besides the powders are gooey .</li>
            <li> It is great to get for a starter kit. Gives you every thing you need to use. If your not positive what all you need to do them your selves this is your answer.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this NO STARS!&lt;br /&gt;the acrylic is s***. do not buy this. the brushes are cheap, my package came super late ALSO THEY DO MOT INCLUDE THE NAIL PRIMER, WHICH YOU NEED TO EVFN LAY THE ACRYLIC. WITHOUT IT YOUR NAIL WONG STAY, IT WILL POP OFF. awful product. DO NOT BUY THIS!</li>
            <li> got everything that&#x27;s in the picture, took long to arrive but was worth it!! got a lot of stuff for a low price.</li>
            <li> the kit came with everything it shows except with a differnt file. i had a lot of trouble with the white, clear and pink acrylic setting up. the little pots of color dont have very much in them. i ordered this dec 6th recieved it around maybe dec 28th. one or two of the pots was slightly opened so everything in the box had powder on  it. when i used the glue i knocked it over and it came right out of the bottle granted i shoudnt have been clumsy. it was a decent starter kit but i wouldnt buy it again. it would have been better to just buy the stuff seperate.</li>
            <li> When I received this item something was spilled inside and a chemical was opened. The smell is everywhere. Nothing was packaged properly,  everything was just thrown in the bag. I will not be purchasing anything else from Eta Tech. I am very disappointed.  I spent too much money on this for it to come late and spilled.</li>
            <li> The acrylic powder is soooo impossible to work with....especially the color ones....the become like chewing gum and than they become immediately hard...it&#x27;s very very difficult to work with unles you want to practice....the accessories are quite good that why I gave two stars</li>
            <li> I have seriously never been so upset in my life. This was a waste of my money. I received my kit well before I was supposed to with reason. Half of the stuff listed here was not sent to me! I didn&#x27;t get any of the glitters, none of the 3-d flowers, no acrylic brushes, and the nail files shown here are not what they send you, not to mention that the jug of acrylic liquid they send you is 10 times smaller than the photo shows! The few little glitters I did receive were spilled all over the bag they were all put together in so all of the colors mixed together.I have never bought something through Amazon&#x27;s website and been so upset with a dealer. I messaged the dealer asking if I could get the things I did not receive and have yet to hear anything from them and I am sure I won&#x27;t. A waste of my time and money, and the supplies are cheap!</li>
            <li> I had have to powder in the package all over the place half the stuff that was supposed to be in there wasn&#x27;t I&#x27;m just not satisfied with this product at all</li>
            <li> Have to purchase more</li>
            <li> Just started doing my own acrylics and I freaking love this! The quality of acrylic powders and glue could be better I guess? But this is such a perfect kit to get yourself going doing your own nails.... I am so happy I have done a few full sets on myself and it&#x27;s awesome because I&#x27;m sure by the time I use up all the stuff in this kit I will be a little better at doing acrylics and can invest in a brand name acrylic powder and monomer..&lt;br /&gt;This has everything that it said it was going to have, nothing was missing, it took a long time to get here but oh well! I&#x27;m having a blast. totally great kit for only 50 bucks....</li>
            <li> I choose this rating because I liked my kit&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this kit for students like myself and there really wasn&#x27;t anything I disliked</li>
            <li> This kit had pretty much everything I needed and love the colors and jems. The only thing it is missing is a nail primer.</li>
            <li> The acrylic is difficult to work with... and everything is much smaller than I anticipated. The glue is not the strongest, BUT if you&#x27;re just starting this is GREAT for practicing.</li>
            <li> This set is good for starting and learning but you will need to purchase additional liquid acrylic and powder if you practice much. It comes with very small liquid and powder. Also I would have liked if they had the #14 &amp; #16 brush rather than the smaller ones. Also in my opinion it comes with too many glitter packs. It would have been much better to have more liquid and powder than the glitter. But, it is a decent starter pack.</li>
            <li> My wife likes the kit it stocked her up on a few new items that she needed. Thank you Nicky&#x27;s Gift Co.</li>
            <li> My product was nice till I tried to use the colored acrylic it doesn&#x27;t hold right it stays gooey for a long time I wasn&#x27;t ok with this, the glue that came with it dried out (without being opened) after about a week. However  the restof the stuff came out nicely it all works and looks great I am just ok with this not sire if I would suggest it though. It did arrive early.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this kit for its liquid or powder. Everything else is ok. Not worth the $ though. I purchased two of these kits from eBay and also a professional set from beauty west.com. From there I got the entity brand. These kits from eBay took forever to arrive. About a month or so. The powder is ridiculous. It doesn&#x27;t stick. Not easy to work with. Hardens up fast. It applies on clumpy and not seamless. With good brands it&#x27;s seamless. I mean that when u apply bead after bead of acrylic they blend together. Not with the eBay ones. U can tell where u applied each section because the previous area dried up and it just doesn&#x27;t blend we&#x27;ll together. The brushes r ok. I prefer the $25 ones like the ibn brand. I like the wheels with nail art, the glitter and colored powder. I use those by mixing them with the entity clear powder. Sure the professionl versions r more expensive but u get what u pay here definitely applies to this.  Lesson learned. It was. Learning experience and now I know. Oh n the glue came sealed shut and dried. So it was useless. The powders seemed to have spilled during shipment so some of the powders sealed out of their containers as if they weren&#x27;t sealed all the way. Screwed on properly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing. I learned from YouTube videos. I first practiced with this stuff and I thought i sucked at doing nails by the quality of my results. I then tried with the expensive products I also bought and the results were a million times better! So don&#x27;t b discouraged</li>
            <li> I am so happy can&#x27;t wait to use it I can&#x27;t right now cuz I have to go to the store :&#x27;(  but I am so going to do it when I get home today.:-)  and I am really happy the write to me and saying it was going to be a little lite so I do thank you guys for that I am so happy :-)</li>
            <li> this product works great, it was shipped quickly to my home with minimal leaking, and is exactly as pictured on the website.</li>
            <li> Ordered this set for my daughter, who is studying cosmetology. She loves it! Her girlfriends, the other students, and her instructors are all crazy about it!</li>
            <li> IS TOO SMALL AND COME  EVERTHING MIX LIKE THEY DIDNT CLOSE THE CONTEINERS GOOD  BUT O.K . MISSING THE ACRYLIC LIQUID AND SOME DOTING PENS, GLUE . THE PAKEGE IS NOT COMPLETED SO NOT HAPPY</li>
            <li> Love it so far! Have done my nails and my mother in laws. You have to purchase nail primer separate. No big deal. The only thing is I have not played with the glitter or the colored powered if anyone has any helpful tips on the colored powered let me know. But nice opi cuticle pen came with.</li>
            <li> they look bigger in the picture then they are and they dont stay on nails any better then the glue on nails they are a total waste of money</li>
            <li> Ithought the sizes would be a bit bigger since everything was 45$ . The glue burns your skin if you accidentally get some on your hand . There was no primer &amp; the acrylics were hard to work with with such hard brushes . It was just not a great product a i expected it to be</li>
            <li> i got all the instruments to do nails. some are not good but for myself is useful. i cant say really is a bad product because i use almost everyday. the acrylic is the only thing is rally small but i use the system dual so i dont really use alot of acrylic to do my nails. is a good product for all the person who are learning to do nails and also have all the instruments and is cheaper then buy it for separated.</li>
            <li> I got everything that was listed in the description of this item. I haven&#x27;t used much of it. I do however with the glitters were bigger but that is nothing major.</li>
            <li> I like my kit I was super excited when I got it ! I did three sets on myself and it turned out pretty good . But I was missing a nail glue and a nail buffer . The glue is not something I would recommend because if it spills it burn and starts smoking &amp; if you get a little on you it burns the skin and it will hurt for a few days . The glue isn&#x27;t that strong and the nails only last a few days . But now I know .</li>
            <li> Excellent Product!&#x27;s just received and I loved it .. now I have my nails me to check the quality of the products, even if they like EZFLOW are very good</li>
            <li> This was the best thing I&#x27;ve ever ordered. Perfect &amp;#34;starter kit&amp;#34; However, the glue I got was brush on and when I knocked it over, it spilled everywhere and my hand got stuck to the table. Haha</li>
            <li> Good product but something&#x27;s wasn&#x27;t good such as the glue and the powder but I can manage. I&#x27;m happy I got a lot of stuff with it</li>
            <li> I needed to start doing my nails myself, and this kit had everything to get me started.  I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll ever use colored acrylic or all this glitter, but the nail clipper, buffers, glue, liquid and powders are worth the cost of the whole set.  The dotting tools and gems will be fun to play with when I get braver ;)</li>
            <li> I received this for Christmas and do a lot of acrylic nails for my daughter and her friends, myself and my friends and family.  I was disappointed only in the cuticle oil as there was a box for it but the box was empty..everything else came as described.  I have seen a lot of reviews containing complaints on the small amt of colored acrylic..however, just so everyone knows, it is not meant to be used as the only acrylic used to do the entire nail..if you mix equal parts, say 4 scoops clear and 4 scoops colored acrylic the color is exactly the same and goes much farther. The pigment is very high and diluting it evenly makes no difference in the color altho the color is always darker when dry than it appears in powder form, so if you want to have the exact color nails as the powder you may want to add white acrylic powder to the mix and do it in even thirds..so 1*3 clear 1/3 white and 1/3 white...a few scoops of each will do a full set and it lasts so much longer!! Hope this helps a few of you! it is missing the primer but that can be picked up anywhere for a few dollars and this kit is totally worth the price! Love the brushes and the dotting tools!</li>
            <li> It came before the stablished date...that was good! But this is for personal use at home....everything is cheap and looked like a dollar toy nails kit....the monomer (acrylic liquid) came with the same bottle as the picture but without label instead someone wrote something in chinesse with a sharpie....the clear acrylic powder was EZ Flow but the other two are not even a known brand and everything is in chinesse. I didn&#x27;t receive the file, the pink block and the flowers, and the 10 nail forms were very cheap and they came all messed up, the glitters containers are SO small is just for one time use only and it came empty because it spill out inside the bag....like I said before! This is to play around, this is a toy, but it can be good for practice . I can&#x27;t tell the quality of the monomer or acrylic powder yet because I didn&#x27;t get the chance to try them just yet but I&#x27;m pretty sure they are not the best around. Don&#x27;t waste you money in this you can get at least one good quality monomer and powder for this money....I should know better....:-(</li>
            <li> First off I have not done my nails yet so I am not sure how the products themselves work, but by looking they seem like good quality. It took 15 days for me to get this product, from the day I placed my order to today, which I expected. I read the reviews before I ordered and the reviews so far and in the description it says how much of each thing you get so I got exactly what I thought I was going to. Everything was in its packaging if it had it and I didn&#x27;t experience any of the issues others had. Yes there is no primer, but it isn&#x27;t in the description so I knew that ahead of time. For the amount of stuff in this kit it was worth the money!</li>
            <li> This kit comes with everything you need to make colorful nails only thing they missed was the primer but for the price it was worth it ; shhh, I cancelled a date to do my nails tonight .So much stuff I don&#x27;t know where to begin I&#x27;m like a kid in a game stop store.</li>
            <li> I purchase this product on December 3rd and it came in the mail 16 days later. The reason i&#x27;m rating this product a 3 is because all of the acrylic powder wasn&#x27;t full. The acrylic liquid was the size of a small candle, the acrylic powder was very small as well and they should of added the primer to this package. However, it did have 3 nail glue and 3d mold which is so awesome i was pleased with everything else. I would recommend buying this product but let the seller know that you want your acrylic powders to be full.</li>
            <li> Its a great starter kit and I got everything except of my 4way filer.but its ok and for a low price totally worth it</li>
            <li> Everything that was supposed to be in the package was there and was packaged neatly. Came on time. Only downside was the size of the largest brush. It wasn&#x27;t really big enough to properly apply the acrylic evenly. Other than that, overall a great starter kit for a beginner.</li>
            <li> You get practically everything needed, for a beginner/start-up! LIVE!</li>
            <li> Awesome love it received it today way before expected time and Im loving everything</li>
            <li> This is a great kit!  I got it about a week ago and have already used almost all of it.&lt;br /&gt;To address some of the issues that others seemed to complain about - It did come in an envelope but it was all tightly packed with no problems.  The glue also worked great.  There was some powder that was on the outside of some of the containers but hardly any and it is to be expected.  The nail cutters are a little flimsy but still work great.  I received everything that I was suppose to receive all in great condition and about a week before it was scheduled to arrive.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is wanting to do there nails themselves.  It has a ton of stuff and all of it seems to work great.  As far as a lot of people complaining about the size of the powder and the liquid - if you look in the description and see what the amounts are that you were getting then you would know ahead of time exactly what you are getting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to doing nails,  I don&#x27;t really have anything to compare them to,  so for me,  they do the job.</li>
            <li> By the time the package arrived all of the products were a mess different colors in different places and the liquid had spilled so much that there wasn&#x27;t even enough to do a set of nails.  A shame because it was a package we/I was expecting to continue purchasing on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fell inlove with this product. Then only thing I need to get now is a nail drill and primer.!</li>
            <li> Had a little mishap in the beginning with my package not arriving at all. But the seller sent another package as soon as I contacted them about not having my items. When they did arrive, they were all there, the set was quite large for the price and everything in the picture was included. But the packaging wasn&#x27;t great and one of the powders was empty and all over everything inside the box. But I don&#x27;t want to complain too much. Overall, I was very happy with this set.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t satisfied with the product. My items look like the contents in each single package have either spilled or used. I tried out 1 Size 6 pinky nail and the acrylic liquid mixed with the acrylic powders was horrible. . I wouldn&#x27;t order from them again! And there is no proper acrylic nail application brush. All the bushes are for smaller acrylic nail art.</li>
            <li> Awesome first kit! Everything is perfect for a starter. The only thing is the Acrylics are tiny. You will run out after a few sets.</li>
            <li> I did not receive the liquid so the whole package is obsolete.</li>
            <li> Acrylic powders don&#x27;t work, they are very gooey and sticky &amp; that messes up the brushes.Also, the packaging was very cheap (it came in a bag) absolutely everything that wasn&#x27;t sealed right was spilled. I recommend better packaging like a box or something more careful. Other than that everything else was good for beginners.</li>
            <li> Hate it...just hate it.</li>
            <li> Acrylic Powder too old. Everything else met my expectations.</li>
            <li> Came with everything, but package was way smaller than expected. Especially the acrylic liquid. But i still have to try it out.! I do recommend it ! Great price!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this kit. It arrived on december 11th, when it was supposed to arrive til after december 25th, which is awesome. Nothing spilled during shipping. Everything was intact and in good shape. The metal glitters and mylar glitters are BEAUTIFUL! And the bag of nail tips is HUGE!&lt;br /&gt;However, the kit listed that 3 bottles of nail glue were included, and I did not receive any. It also listed that there was a standard buffer block, and a 4 way buffer block, I only received a standard one. The bottle of acrylic liquid I received is only about 1/3 the size of the jug pictured.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am pleased with the kit and cannot wait to try it! Unfortunately I now have to make a trip to the store to get some glue because I don&#x27;t have any. I chose 3 stars for this reason. If the kit was complete, I&#x27;d chose 5 stars because the colors and glitters are gorgeous!</li>
            <li> Its a lot of things to get started now my sister is a pro, real glad to buy this. GREAT</li>
            <li> the powder is really crappy. the files wear down the first time you use them and the brushes are stiff. the glue doesn&#x27;t burn your skin like the other reviews say. i only gave it two stars is because the rest of the stuff is ok. but an acrylic kit should not be sold without primer. do yourself a favor and buy a real kit. even if you are just learning. you cant learn with power that dries instantly.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girlfriend. She liked it. She wishes the filling stuff was bigger but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the item on time. And also it doesn&#x27;t come with nail primer but nice home kit. The clippers you have to be careful cause unproper use it will not clip nail properly...</li>
            <li> My order came right on time. I am satisfied with everything I got. My only problem was that some of the colored acrilic spilt in the bag because the lids weren&#x27;t screwed on tight, but no big deal.</li>
            <li> Everything came exactly how pictured ! I love it all, and great quality too. Love that I got this when I did !</li>
            <li> The best! This little kit is awesome, i love it!</li>
            <li> No directions with the package to tell you anything.everything was stuffed into a big loose envelope. Would not recommend to buy.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t send a few things the was including in the package necessary for make a good work in the nails</li>
            <li> I really loved this!! It&#x27;s worth what you pay for it the only complaint I have is when I used the clear powder my nails turned a yellowish color the next day but I used the pink and did a friend&#x27;s nails and they turned out pretty well. I just wish it came with the primer as well but everything else was awesome!!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent!!love it!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it it came so neatly wrapped granted some glitter is on myself and everything else but it&#x27;s to be expected and I don&#x27;t care still have alot of it and probable won&#x27;t use alot anyways..... anyone who complains this isn&#x27;t really what you wanted and obviously don&#x27;t do nails. This will last me quite awhile and I read what it came with and bought nail primer ahead of time.... and it was fast shipping too it said I wouldn&#x27;t get it for about a month and a half and I got it within 2 weeks......</li>
            <li> I ordered for my Granddaughter&#x27;s birthday &amp; she was so thrilled with it. Was nice to see her so excited over it.</li>
            <li> It took forever to get here but  it did arrived on the stimated date. Im not a professional so i cant say if its a good quality but everything looks good exept that one of my color acrylic powder was open but nothing bad &amp;&amp; also some were not filed up they where half empty there was only one little thing missing idk the name  of it but is ok other than that everything works for me im a begginer &amp; this is really good . Thank you August168 buy . I just wished my acrylic colors were all filled up.</li>
            <li> It was good but the acrylic powder not so much</li>
            <li> So much comes in this kit! It&#x27;s awesome ( except the acrylic liquid jug was only half full.) but other than that this kit was awesome. I am saddened that I hadn&#x27;t purchased it the first time I looked into it months ago. I would recommend this to anyone just starting out with acrylic nails, or anyone who just needs to get more practice in and get familiar with the tools.</li>
            <li> The worst thing ever I hate it received everything almost broken and somethings were not closed right....The glue sucks it don&#x27;ot stick. I will never buy from here</li>
            <li> I like that it came 2 weeks early and every ting was in there only .the roses are rubber so ok I guess . the price should be $25 js ,if you soom on the pic or clic on it that&#x27;s how small the jars of the powder are so u might get one set of nails done with each jar will see once I use it lol but gonna go to sallys  n get the stuff for now on js</li>
            <li> It gives you a nice variety of colors to work with. There isn&#x27;t a lot of powder but it works. I love it.</li>
            <li> Message to all: DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. I am a 7 year experienced nail tech and I&#x27;m not saying this because I&#x27;m keeping you from saving money insead of coming to someone like me to make money. This stuff is very harmful to your health. The liquid is toxic to breath and the overall product WILL damage your nails not to mention lift like crazy. You WILL see discoloration and yellowing because the powders and liquid this kit provides aren&#x27;t actual nail product. Its called MMA which is the same stuff they use to create dentures.... yes DENTURES. which is why this stuff WILL NOT soak off like real nail acrylic. If you want to have beautiful nails at a cheaper cost buy gel mani kits instead, i recommend still going to a salon but having a home gel mani kit is no where near as harmful as using one of these acrylic kits, the worse you can do with gel is maybe buffing too much of your nail bed... so really be cautious with that. Anyways, I&#x27;m warning all future potential buyers, don&#x27;t waste your time and please think of your health because the guys that created this kit certainly weren&#x27;t thinking of it.</li>
            <li> I do my own nails and I was hoping that this kit would last me awhile and be a good deal. Honestly everything in the kit is alright except for the acrylic powders, brushes, and liquid. the liquid and powders suck. you can&#x27;t even use them at all. it&#x27;s very sticky and it&#x27;s a mess. the brushes were okay but they fell apart within a short amount of time, not worth 40$.</li>
            <li> Havn&#x27;t tried it out yet but it came here in less than a week and everything is beautiful!</li>
            <li> This was a great buy! I had originally bought it for myself (with help from my mom on choosing) I wanted to try my hand at being a nail technician. It was all great! For the price. It didn&#x27;t come with primer and the monomer wasn&#x27;t the best. The packaging was kinda crappy (came in a giant Manila envelope) and a bunch of the pink acrylic powder was spilled inside. My mom loves the color range it came with and the glitter and rhinestones, all the stuff it came with as well, said that it was better than the first nail kit they got at school, so I gave it to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nail tech thing is pretty hard anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all pretty great, big bonus with the price as well. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four stars because of crappy packaging, monomer and crappy packaging.</li>
            <li> My husband got me this as a gift! I love it! Only thing is that they didn&#x27;t send the tweezers it say that it comes with and also the acrylic liquid bottle it has on the picture isn&#x27;t really that bottle its smaller... also it says it comes with 3D flowers and i didn&#x27;t recieve that instead I recived little dots to use as nail designs... ill just have to purchase the tweezers seprate and also 3d flowers but other than that I love it! I haven&#x27;t gotten the chance to try it out because I still have to buy the nail primer and brush cleanser but I will recommend this item to anyone! It took around 2 weeks to recive it, but i did get it sooner than I expected.</li>
            <li> Not really happy with it .the glue didn&#x27;t glue nailsor jem&#x27;s down, and the aacrylic is not enough to do nails. Looks good in the picture but it all a rough</li>
            <li> The product is cheap! I guess if you are a beginner you can practice with this product. It is what  is just a starter kit, the containers of the contents are not full, theirs no primer, its a mess! The brushes are hard to use and they dont last long at all! When I order this product it took over a month which was not what they promised. But I guess if you are a beginner then you should practice with this cheap product. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to no one! I hope this helps anyone who is deciding on buying this product.</li>
            <li> Do not buy... acrylic powders were sticky and balled up. They are also very small. The acrylic liquid is tiny as well. Just go to Sallys and buy ur set because this one is not worth it.</li>
            <li> Just came in the mail today. I ordered it on Dec. 26th and it wasn&#x27;t supposed to arrive until Jan. 23rd so shipment was fast. Everything was there and intact except for the 3d mold but I can purchase those at my local beauty supply store no biggie. I haven&#x27;t gotten to use it yet but I am looking forward to using all my new product. Oh and FYI for those of you who complained about there being such a small amount of colored acrylic and glitter if you knew what you were doing you would know it&#x27;s intended to be mixed with clear acrylic powder not used alone.</li>
            <li> i ordered this jan 2 and i am still waiting! this is crazy.  i see others that ordered after me and got it already . i cant say enough how disappointed i am in not getting this . i cant even comment on the kit itself because i never got it . it has been sitting in Malaysia for over 10  days.</li>
            <li> everything was there, good price for everything you get. The bottles of acrylic liquid and powder are very small but other then that, fun to play around with. Hate the glue, very messy.</li>
            <li> I love love love this package it came so neatly packed and everything looks just like the picture only problem I had was it didn&#x27;t have the nail clippers but I emailed the seller and they handled it very well they apologized and sent me a nail clipper within 2days. I also don&#x27;t see why everyone is complaining about the acrylic being lumpy and sticky because mine worked just fine when I do my clients nails</li>
            <li> a lot to choose from... a really great buy for someone who loves doing nails.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my younger sister as a beginner nail kit for Christmas she loves it! It has everything she needs to learn with for a great price</li>
            <li> I ordered this kit on January 7 and I received it January 16 so I got it before the estimated date which was nice. I was really excited when I got it. Everything was inside except for the primer. Nothing was spilled. The reason I rate this a 4 is because I think they should package this item a little better. All the stuff in the bag was just tossed around, the package also had holes in it. Mane they should consider putting the items in a box next time and then ship it. Other than that it a great kit.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price. Given as a gift for my daughter and she was very pleased with these nail art tips</li>
            <li> I never had the guts to try to do my own nails until I came across this and decided to give it a try. it was so great but the only problem I had is the it didn&#x27;t come with any nail primer other than that it&#x27;s a great kit.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this for me so I can practice, we were expecting a big package and we were let down. It came in a small box, everything is smaller than shown in the picture. The powders and glitters are probably good for one use or three max, unless you mix them with the clear powder. The nail liquid bottle is small too, hand size small. Overall, everything is small, not as i expected by what the picture showed but for me being a begginer and new to this, it will work. Some what satisfied.</li>
            <li> This kit is awesome! It comes with far more stuff than you really need so its a lot to play around with. It came quickly in a deceptively small box that was just jam packed full of nail stuff. Had I payed more attention I would have known that I didn&#x27;t even need the 4 way buffer or the nail cutters I bought separately. It came super fast and the quantity you get is huge. I bought an acrylic nail kit a week before ordering this and it came with a tiny pot of acrylic powder two pots of glitter like are in this kit and a little 10ml bottle of acrylic liquid for ten bucks this has probably enough stuff to keep my nails done all year plus extras to play with. Everything was wrapped up in foil if it had the potential to leak and nothing had there are so many different colors and glitters and baubles it isn&#x27;t even funny. I have ordered more nail tips just cause I&#x27;m not that into the white ones and I really wish it had options but whatever. There is tons of acrylic powder and liquid (you don&#x27;t really use much) the brushes are way better that what I got in the little kit too. The glue dries a little slow but that&#x27;s a good thing because it gives you the chance to slide things in place. I did notice it worked better when applied to the tip as opposed to your finger.the file is awesome as it just saws away at the acrylic so even if you are heavy handed and uneven when applying it you can still make it come out all super smooth and professional looking. The pink acrylic isn&#x27;t super pink but could be with added colors. I&#x27;m so happy with this it isn&#x27;t even funny I&#x27;m glad I ignored the negative reviews. If it wasn&#x27;t for not needing to rebuy all the tools I would buy this kit again in the future its definitely a great starter set!</li>
            <li> I like the fact it came with ALL essentials it said. Nothing was broken or damaged. The filing blocks didn&#x27;t work as well as I expected... But it was a good set. The acrylics don&#x27;t stay on as long as they probably should have. But overall it IS worth the money I paid.</li>
            <li> Did not come with all the items shown in the picture or list.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money. The \\&quot;sparkle\\&quot; acryllic isnt sparkley. All the acrylic gets sticky and doesnt take very well with the liquid. Mylar is just giant sparkles. So not worth it. Not even if ur a student</li>
            <li> I received this kit less than half the estimated delivery time.&lt;br /&gt;Everything was packaged tightly...However, it was so compressed that one of the dotting pins pierced the bottom of the liquid acrylic bottle. The dotting pin was still stuck inside of the bottle so only a little bit got on a few things. With the bottom of the bottle pierced I had to tape the bottom a LOT just to make sure it does not leak and placed it inside of a zip lock bag to make sure it doesn&#x27;t spill all over everything else again.&lt;br /&gt;Other than the bottle having a hole I am also missing the Clear Glass Dappen Dish.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with the size of everything as it is what I had expected.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with the items. the glitter spill out of the storage also I receive only 10 nail forms instead of 20. The brushes are not the best as well as the glue, but everything else are Ok.</li>
            <li> All the nail equipment you will ever need, if you want them to dry super fast I do reccomend a UV acrylic nail drying light other wise its only a 5 minute wait,  works like a professional kit if you know what you are doing! Comes with great designing extras as well, no instructions are included so if you are brand new to this be prepaired to watch tutorials.</li>
            <li> This is a nice size kit for the price. I don&#x27;t have any complaints. Can&#x27;t wait to try it !!</li>
            <li> It works and everything comes out perfectly I love it. The nails I do are beautiful.  But im not a pro.</li>
            <li> Poor packaging the powder was open and all over inside of bag glitter was open to and spilled inside of bag</li>
            <li> DAMN IT L WANT MINES TO COME NOW AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH......WELL L WILL LOL GOT TO BOYS SO L HAVE TO DO IT ON A DAY THEIR GONE</li>
            <li> I did really like this kit the only thing was that the colors were half filled as well as the white, pink and clear powder. And the containers are alot smaller in person then the picture. It is a good starter kit and for the price its good. Was a little disapointed in the powders though. All around it was an okay buy.</li>
            <li> When it was sent to my house it was in a orange envelope. Every thing was mostly spilled in the bottom of the envelope. I expected the stuff to be in a box at least. I will never buy ant thing big because I would be scared for the packing.</li>
            <li> It was ok, the monomer wasn&#x27;t the best, had to buy a different one, the brushes were fine to begin with, but they are a pain to clean nd the bristles came off on one. And the pink, clear, and white powder were not filled all the way, I thought it would have more but no. But I liked everything else!</li>
            <li> The pink powder was more of a clear and the liquid and powder together dries way too fast making it hard to work with.</li>
            <li> Very Happy with this order but thought the powders were a little larger but im happy with the order thank you !!</li>
            <li> Loved the whole set. They even took extra precaution by wrapping each liquid container in foil for spillage.</li>
            <li> This kit has EVERYTHING in it, and is a fantastic deal for samples of all the basics. I love that it came with colored acrylic and the white to cut it with- that stuff is usually expensive.</li>
            <li> It took 10 days from order day to delivery date which is awesome. I haven&#x27;t used it yet but I&#x27;m excited.  Nor sure if I didn&#x27;t completely read the description but all the tips are white,  none are clear.  I dnt do nails professionally so this going to be my learning kit. I will experiment.  I&#x27;m also not sure what the gold stickers w black grids r for.  Maybe to measure the length of the nails.  The nail design molds look like fun.</li>
            <li> All of my products were dirty and in disarray.. they seem like they was used before, i could smell the chemicals when the mail carrier handed it to me..</li>
            <li> This product was a disaster. I have been waiting for it for about a month, and when it arrived, it was thrown together in an envelope! And also, everything was SO much tinier than expected. Also, the acrylic powder (white) spilled all over the package. And, the smell of the acrylic liquid spread throughout my house and was disgusted. But lastly, the nail glue. It got on my hands and it burned the skin off, it is still on. DO NOT BUY, ITS NOT WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> I got these for a friend of mine and she completely loved them!!! best birthday surprise ever! she completely loved them. and for myself I have my nails done by her when I need to! great kit!</li>
            <li> Everything was just thrown into an envelope and when it arrived at my house the acrylic liquid was busted. Never again</li>
            <li> I love the fact that my package came almost 2 weeks early! I wasn&#x27;t expecting it until the end of May, and it&#x27;s the middle of May.&lt;br /&gt;I just started doing my own nails a bit ago, so I got this to really delve into it. I absolutely LOVE it. It came with everything listed, I love the fact that it&#x27;s a clear glass dish instead of a plastic one, and I love how much it comes with. Yes, it doesn&#x27;t come with primer, but you already would know that if you read what it came with. I got this kit, primer, UV gel coat and a drill for less than $55! That&#x27;s a steal!!&lt;br /&gt;My only question is why was the inside of the package dirty? I don&#x27;t mind, it just really confused me to why it was dirty, like dark dust in there. I checked all my colors, and the only one that leaked(leaving the container itself empty) was one of the pale rose color(which I probably wouldn&#x27;t have used anyway).</li>
            <li> I have waited weeks only to be missing a few things out that package. Like the clear acrylic I only had pink and white. Then the acrylic powder are so small and have a spacer in them so they really is enough to do your nails once or twice out of each container. Then it came with no primer and Half the freaking liquid acrylic was spilled. I was recommending this item to my friends before I received it BUT I will be showing them my package and what was missing before they buy. Also i did use the products and it already lifting. I dehydrated the nail I used IBD primer and there acrylic liquid(because the liquid in the package was ruin) so I had a very strong base to hold the acrylic  for at least two weeks. Products are not worth it the best thing you will be getting out of this are the rhinestone, filer, and clipper. BTW the brushes are weak they broke. Thank god I had good brushes.</li>
            <li> Very nice kit. Got here on recles time. Thanks so much!!!!!</li>
            <li> My daughter enjoyed this product.</li>
            <li> I did get everything it said and what showed in the picture. Comes in an envelope bubble wraped powders are small but so far I like it I havent used it yet its alright.  There was powder all ove the things when I first opened it. I think this a good starter kit.</li>
            <li> I now got my set an I hate it first dey to small d acrylic powder is s*** an I didn&#x27;t get my damn finger smh never again will I buy from dis company</li>
            <li> Everything I needed in one set.  Except for the acrylic nail primer</li>
            <li> I dont like the acrylic but all the other things are good</li>
            <li> this kit took forever to come but i was so happy when i received it.. it is a great starter kit and i would recommend purchasing.</li>
            <li> Good stuff so far for the price, although the small colored powder acrylic is super small and don&#x27;t seem good quality. But the rest is good!</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast. Came 2 weeks before the actual date. Powder is really gooey, but still works. The only thing I was really upset about was that the nail clipper broke on the 2nd nail I tried clipping ðŸ˜• &amp; brushes arent so good. oh &amp; that it doesn&#x27;t come with a primer,  so you have to buy that separate. Other than that, its okay. Comes with everything you see on pic.</li>
            <li> Everything in this picture was accounted for.  However the box was in horrible shape and there was a coating of dust and dirt on every item in the box. Luckily the couple things there were glass in the box were not broken.  I have yet to use the product but at this point I do not have high expectations.</li>
            <li> The products are ok.  However, it took almost a MONTH to receive them.</li>
            <li> I love this nail set it comes with everything you need and works great. Be warned though some products directions are in Chinese other than that no complaints.</li>
            <li> It came with almost everything you need but it isn&#x27;t very good quality</li>
            <li> I NEED THE ITEMS BEFORE NOVEMBER 14</li>
