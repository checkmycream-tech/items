            <li>Preferred Fragrance continues to please me with their awesome perfume impressions.</li>
            <li>But, as soon as I put some on, I loved it!</li>
            <li>Even though I was not fond of the smeel, I gave it to a friend, and she loves it so still a great product.</li>

            <li>Will be buying more for the price.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this smell.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I fell in love with this perfume as soon as it arrived.</li>
            <li>So this spray is just OK.  </li>
            <li>A very sweet, inexpensive gift.</li>
            <li>ALTHOUGH THIS PERFUME IS A CHEAP REPLICA OF COACH POPPY AND SMELLS MORE ALONG THE LINES OF COACH POPPY FLOWER,  </li>
            <li>Luckily, I like both of the Poppy perfumes, so I really enjoy this &amp;#34;blend&amp;#34; of the two in Touch Popular.</li>
            <li>I compared this &amp;#34;Touch Popular&amp;#34;  perfume to them, and it smells like a mix of both, but leans more toward Poppy Flower than the original Poppy.</li>
            <li>I JUST WISH IT SMELLED MORE LIKE COACH&#x27;S ORIGINAL POPPY.....</li>
            <li>It was easy to find</li>
            <li>It should have smelled clean and refreshing, but to my easily irritated nose, all it gave me was a severe sinus headache.  </li>
            <li>It was cloying and cheap smelling.</li>
            <li>For as cheap as this is I&#x27;m not complaining since I do like the smell</li>
            <li>I am a Coach poppy blossom fan but had never tried the original poppy.  </li>
            <li>This scent first of all, is lovely.  </li>
            <li>I was not keen on the idea of spending so much for the name brand until sure, so this was an inbetween.  </li>
            <li>Smells good and lasts a while, would highly recommend to anybody that enjoyed the Coach perfumes, especially those on a budget.</li>
            <li>I said, it might be fine for most, but if sharp, clean, air-ish scents irritate you, it&#x27;s better if you skip this one.</li>
            <li>its fresh and light but for me has lasted much longer</li>
            <li>It smells fresh and floral.</li>
            <li>love the bottle and the smell makes me want to get the real thing , smell don&#x27;t last long but smell really good , worth the money</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how close it smells to the real thing!</li>
            <li>Instead it smells exactly like Coach Poppy Flower.</li>
            <li>Did not smell as much like Poppy as I would have liked, but for the price I guess I expected too much.</li>
            <li>Scent doesn&#x27;t last long but for the price it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>and like i said the price was reasonable</li>
            <li>Not to mention, it&#x27;s WAY easier on my wallet than buying the real deal.</li>
            <li>jSmells like the real coach Poppy  product  </li>
            <li>I really like how this smells, however it doesn&#x27;t smell like Poppy at all.</li>
            <li>The perfume is not exactly Coach smelling, but very sweet and similar enough I am a very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery, bottle was very similar to the real thing.</li>
            <li>I really like it so far.</li>
            <li>In my opinion this smelled nothing like Poppy--it smells more like a heavy floral air freshener.</li>
            <li>It is strong enough to last through the day.</li>
            <li>As long as you don&#x27;t put on too much, it&#x27;s not overwhelming, and it&#x27;s a very unique perfume!</li>
            <li>When I first got this product, I was a little worried because just smelling it, it was kind of odd.</li>
            <li>It smells almost exactly like it and it stays on for a very long time!  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have super high expectations because of the price and some of the other reviews, but was gladly proven wrong.</li>
            <li>a very SHARP POWERFUL ONE.  </li>
            <li>(I know, weird description, but I&#x27;m trying to get the idea across to people like me who do not have as much experience with perfume and can pick out each and every note in one squirt :) )</li>
            <li>mine barely smells like anything at all.  </li>
            <li>I cant even use it, shipping was fast but not worth the money when I cant even use it</li>

            <li> then I expected.  </li>
            <li> It smells kinda like fabric softener mixed with cut grass and a dried wildflower sachet rolled into one.</li>
            <li> It has a strong unpleasant scent, almost like a flower that was just picked out of the garden.</li>
            <li> Not only does it have a strong unpleasant flower smell, but it has a strong alcohol smell which is just sickening</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not something you notice from sniffing the nozzle of the bottle, it has to break down on your skin for it to come through.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li> This I purchased, because I found a little fift set of lotion, and roller perfume of $1.00 at Christmas.  </li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S WORKS SO UNBELIEVABLY NICER WITH MY BODY CHEMISTRY.</li>
            <li> Maybe i got a weak one</li>
            <li> Not happy at all , the sprayer will not work</li>
            <li> im very unhappy .</li>
            <li> I HATE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> this was the worst smelling perfume I have ever had.</li>

            <li> This perfume is a wonderful mix of Coach Poppy and Poppy Flower scents. It is strong enough to last through the day. I didn&#x27;t have super high expectations because of the price and some of the other reviews, but was gladly proven wrong. The perfume is not exactly Coach smelling, but very sweet and similar enough I am a very satisfied customer. The best part is my perfume snob friend cant tell the difference when I&#x27;m wearing it. Will be buying more for the price.</li>
            <li> Smells good and lasts a while, would highly recommend to anybody that enjoyed the Coach perfumes, especially those on a budget.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this smell.  its fresh and light but for me has lasted much longer then I expected.  very satisfied</li>
            <li> Not happy at all , the sprayer will not work I cant even use it, shipping was fast but not worth the money when I cant even use it im very unhappy .</li>
            <li> Smells good.  Scent doesn&#x27;t last long but for the price it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Like the price! This I purchased, because I found a little fift set of lotion, and roller perfume of $1.00 at Christmas.  Then went on line and found it for sale in larger form. Nice!</li>
            <li> In my opinion this smelled nothing like Poppy--it smells more like a heavy floral air freshener. It was cloying and cheap smelling.</li>
            <li> love it..very affordable! i would definatly order this again.It was easy to find and like i said the price was reasonable</li>
            <li> I HATE IT!!!! this was the worst smelling perfume I have ever had. It has a strong unpleasant scent, almost like a flower that was just picked out of the garden. Not only does it have a strong unpleasant flower smell, but it has a strong alcohol smell which is just sickening, I AM SOOO DISSAPOINTED!</li>
            <li> I have a magazine with a scratch n sniff page, that has Coach Poppy, &amp; Coach Poppy flower on it. I compared this &amp;#34;Touch Popular&amp;#34;  perfume to them, and it smells like a mix of both, but leans more toward Poppy Flower than the original Poppy. Preferred fragrance also makes an impression of Poppy Flower, which I haven&#x27;t smelled yet, so I wonder which Poppy it smells like? Luckily, I like both of the Poppy perfumes, so I really enjoy this &amp;#34;blend&amp;#34; of the two in Touch Popular. Not to mention, it&#x27;s WAY easier on my wallet than buying the real deal. Preferred Fragrance continues to please me with their awesome perfume impressions. :)</li>
            <li> It smells almost exactly like it and it stays on for a very long time!  I really like it so far.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this perfume as soon as it arrived. The box and bottle are adorable, and the perfume is amazing. It smells fresh and floral. A very sweet, inexpensive gift. I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I am a Coach poppy blossom fan but had never tried the original poppy.  I was not keen on the idea of spending so much for the name brand until sure, so this was an inbetween.  Even though I was not fond of the smeel, I gave it to a friend, and she loves it so still a great product.</li>
            <li> love the bottle and the smell makes me want to get the real thing , smell don&#x27;t last long but smell really good , worth the money</li>
            <li> When I first got this product, I was a little worried because just smelling it, it was kind of odd. But, as soon as I put some on, I loved it! As long as you don&#x27;t put on too much, it&#x27;s not overwhelming, and it&#x27;s a very unique perfume!</li>
            <li> This scent first of all, is lovely.  It smells kinda like fabric softener mixed with cut grass and a dried wildflower sachet rolled into one. (I know, weird description, but I&#x27;m trying to get the idea across to people like me who do not have as much experience with perfume and can pick out each and every note in one squirt :) )&lt;br /&gt;  The problem is: as soon as I sprayed this on my skin, a somewhat &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;airy&amp;#34; smell started to seep through....a very SHARP POWERFUL ONE.  It should have smelled clean and refreshing, but to my easily irritated nose, all it gave me was a severe sinus headache.  I ended up having to sell it to a friend at work.  It&#x27;s not something you notice from sniffing the nozzle of the bottle, it has to break down on your skin for it to come through.&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, it might be fine for most, but if sharp, clean, air-ish scents irritate you, it&#x27;s better if you skip this one.</li>
            <li> So this spray is just OK.  It doesn&#x27;t last long at all, and the smell is alright.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> jSmells like the real coach Poppy  product  good sized bottle  I would buy it again  good price  thank you  and good by</li>
            <li> Did not smell as much like Poppy as I would have liked, but for the price I guess I expected too much.</li>
            <li> Before ordering i had read a lot of reviews saying this smelled alot like Coach Poppy. mine barely smells like anything at all.  Maybe i got a weak one</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, bottle was very similar to the real thing. Packaging was as suspected. Would recommend if looking for a nice perfume but at a lower cost.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how close it smells to the real thing! I wear it all the time and I get compliments on it all the time. Strong smell of poppy&#x27;s! I got mine for $5 on sale... Hmmm $45 or $5? lol Smells almost exactly like \\&quot;Coach Poppy\\&quot;. Love it!</li>
            <li> I really like how this smells, however it doesn&#x27;t smell like Poppy at all. Instead it smells exactly like Coach Poppy Flower. For as cheap as this is I&#x27;m not complaining since I do like the smell but the title is a bit misleading.</li>
            <li> ALTHOUGH THIS PERFUME IS A CHEAP REPLICA OF COACH POPPY AND SMELLS MORE ALONG THE LINES OF COACH POPPY FLOWER,  IT&#x27;S WORKS SO UNBELIEVABLY NICER WITH MY BODY CHEMISTRY. I JUST WISH IT SMELLED MORE LIKE COACH&#x27;S ORIGINAL POPPY.....ESPECIALLY FOR THE PRICE..I&#x27;D CONSIDER BUYING IT AGAIN.</li>
