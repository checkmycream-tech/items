            <li>/&gt;It smells great.</li>
            <li>I got a great price on this product.</li>
            <li>and it was not all that good at holding (despite the name)</li>
            <li>I had to use a lot of it to keep my hair looking good all day.</li>
            <li>but this one is a really good option.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and is a good deal for the price.</li>
            <li>Herbal essences is a good line of products across the board.</li>
            <li>It smells good, works well, and doesn&#x27;t make me break out.  </li>

            <li>The curl takes on a nice shape and stays in place.</li>
            <li>It smells really nice too.</li>
            <li>I might as well have put water in my hair hoping for some kind of hold.</li>
            <li>VERY IMPORTANT: while it&#x27;s drying, DON&#x27;T TOUCH IT.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly, so I really can not give this product a good or an excellent.  </li>
            <li>(I think the more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; old-style Herbal Essences product this gel replaced had a bit more hold.)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not my favorite</li>
            <li>I love the way my hair looks when it&#x27;s damp with its beach-waviness.  </li>
            <li>This product was okay</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the smell &amp; the texture it leaves my curls.</li>
            <li>I love this hair gel.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>i love it.  </li>
            <li>But once I hit puberty, my hair drastically thinned out and became more and more curly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Herbal Essences hair gel works a lot better.</li>
            <li>I love Herbal Essences product and these one will be my go to.</li>
            <li>This stuff is FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li>This stuff smells pretty good and is super sticky on your fingers.</li>
            <li>At first it seems crunchy but dries nicely.</li>
            <li>Then I take just a little bit of gel, rub it in my palms/fingers, and distribute it the best I can evenly throughout my hair.</li>
            <li>Turns out I still have some natural wave, so I researched good scrunching products and found this.</li>
            <li>There is a really light clean berry smell.</li>
            <li>A cheap option for a super curly girl.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite hair product!</li>
            <li>but I do like it a good amount and will buy more if my other stuff isn&#x27;t on sale</li>
            <li>I am always on the hunt for good products at low prices.</li>
            <li>I gave up the cost of the perms I love because I am now retired and decided to have straight hair.</li>
            <li>For a hair product that&#x27;s under $3, that&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>It smells great and doesn&#x27;t create dandruff or flakes like other gels do.</li>
            <li>I have tried several different curly hair gels and I like this one best.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice, and it goes on easy without a sticky, dry finish.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new favorite gel</li>
            <li>It works great, and I have found that I can still have a perm in the winter when it is less humid.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m often told that my hair smells nice, which I think is true of the entire Herbal Essences line.    </li>
            <li>I tried this gel to see if it helped my fine hair to keep from blowing too much when outdoors.</li>
            <li>wave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After moving to a much hotter and MUCH more humid state, my mostly straight hairstyle wasn&#x27;t going to work for me anymore.</li>
            <li>This is great because it doesn&#x27;t make your hair crunchy and stiff.</li>
            <li>Its not over powering at all which is great, some other products she uses gives me a headache, or maybe its just her (haha).</li>
            <li>but they make me break out here &amp; there on my scalp right alone</li>
            <li>My curls never held, and if they did hold some, they would fall right out after an hour</li>
            <li>Tousle Me Softly Mousse For Easy Tousling,</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t found anything that works better, plus it&#x27;s relatively cheap compared to other products.</li>
            <li>I used the gel for many years back before Herbal Essences rebranded, switched to the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>The top layer is straight while underlying hairs are slightly wavy, so for the most part, my hair looks straight.  </li>
            <li>Then went to super cheap stuff, which always left my hair flaking.</li>
            <li>Can usually get this for under $4 each and it lasts a while, so definitely a good deal on a product that works.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found I get great results if I don&#x27;t comb and disrupt the curl pattern as little as possible.</li>
            <li>It is hard to find a good product for curly hair</li>
            <li>Creates awesome curls without making my hair seem hard and wet.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It will deepen the curl and keep it from getting really frizzy.  </li>
            <li>This is not a gel for people with straight hair who want a curly style.</li>
            <li>My wife has naturally straight hair and likes to scrunch it often when we go out to give it the semi-wet look.</li>
            <li>So much so that every stylist makes mention of it when they assess my hair.  </li>
            <li>If I want I can use the curling iron w/o combing my hair out, then I can arrange my hair with my fingers only, or I can comb my hair out use the curling iron to smooth out any frizz then comb and go.</li>
            <li>I like this product for curly and straight hair days.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t really hold up to my standards.</li>
            <li>It also helps my hair stay straight</li>
            <li>this is a very competitively priced option for that.</li>
            <li>I really like this hair gel.</li>
            <li>really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This smelled really yummy and works well.</li>
            <li>Although I tried for months to deal with straight hair, it drove me nuts.</li>
            <li>They work great with my thick, naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>It gives enough staying power - even on hot and humid days that I don&#x27;t end up with a head full of frizz.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many other hair gels, but they always would make me break out.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time using it and it does wonders on my natural hair.</li>
            <li>It keeps its hold all day and my curls stay frizz and fluff free.</li>
            <li>I sectioned my hair in two halves (left and right).</li>
            <li>I took one section and split that into two, twisting them around each other like a huge twisty braid.  </li>
            <li>The perfect thing to weigh down my thick curly hair before I add mousse and hair spray as the final touches.</li>
            <li>but they don&#x27;t exactly hold for the entire day.</li>
            <li>It works about the same as other gels and mousses, except it seems to be more condensed, leaving a heavier coat on my hair.</li>
            <li>, 6-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 4)]], which does seem to cut down on the frizz, and if I&#x27;m going out again after work, I smooth in some [[ASIN:B0028K3JE4 Herbal Essences</li>
            <li>, I let my hair dry a little bit on its own.</li>
            <li>It works well with people who have naturally curly</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a couple of cons to this gel: it won&#x27;t cut it on really humid days and it only holds up for about 8 to 10 hours at a stretch.</li>
            <li>Softly Finishing Touch Cream, 7.6-Ounce Jars (Pack Of 3)]] and restyle.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, will curl but won&#x27;t keep the curl, and is naturally wavy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried lots of curling products over the years: John Frieda, Aussie, Suave, Garnier Fructis, Tressemme, fancy expensive stuff you get at the hair salon because they used it on your hair and it looked good (you know what I&#x27;m talking about)</li>
            <li>But careful, too much will make your hair sticky!</li>
            <li>But, if you let it air dry, you end up with soft (not crunchy), full-bodied, managable, non-frizzy, calm hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Decent go-to product for my long hair.</li>
            <li>Gel adds some shape to soft hair after daily showers.</li>
            <li>Totally Twisted curl scrunching gel is really nice.</li>
            <li>It will dry hard, but a second quick scrunch about an hour later leaves me with soft, natural curls.</li>
            <li>I put the clear gel into my hair after my shower and let it air dry.</li>
            <li>I get out of the shower, I softly towel dry my hair.</li>

            <li> My hair is naturally curly, so I really can not give this product a good or an excellent.  It works well with people who have naturally curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;It will deepen the curl and keep it from getting really frizzy.  But careful, too much will make your hair sticky!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Herbal Essences products for about a decade. They work great with my thick, naturally curly hair. I used the gel for many years back before Herbal Essences rebranded, switched to the [[ASIN:B0028K3JUS Herbal Essences Tousle Me Softly Mousse For Easy Tousling, 6.8-Ounce Bottles (Pack Of 12)]] for awhile and recently returned to the gel. I&#x27;m growing my hair out, and the mouse just didn&#x27;t have enough lift with the additional weight.    This is not a gel for people with straight hair who want a curly style. This is a gel for people with curly hair who want something that will dry soft and not feel heavy. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for someone with very thin or very short hair - try one of the two mousse varieties instead. I usually scrunch my hair right after I shower and wrap it in a towel for 10 to 15 minutes as it starts to dry. It will dry hard, but a second quick scrunch about an hour later leaves me with soft, natural curls. I&#x27;m often told that my hair smells nice, which I think is true of the entire Herbal Essences line.    There&#x27;s a couple of cons to this gel: it won&#x27;t cut it on really humid days and it only holds up for about 8 to 10 hours at a stretch. (I think the more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; old-style Herbal Essences product this gel replaced had a bit more hold.) I use the [[ASIN:B0013KYRIM Herbal Essences Long Term Relationship Split End Protector, 6-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 4)]], which does seem to cut down on the frizz, and if I&#x27;m going out again after work, I smooth in some [[ASIN:B0028K3JE4 Herbal Essences Tousle Me Softly Finishing Touch Cream, 7.6-Ounce Jars (Pack Of 3)]] and restyle. For a hair product that&#x27;s under $3, that&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different curly hair gels and I like this one best. I tried Tresemme Extra hold bouncy curls and it was not all that good at holding (despite the name) I had to use a lot of it to keep my hair looking good all day. I got tired of lack of hold so I tried Suave Max hold and that was so incredibly sticky that I hated doing my hair at all. Herbal Essences Totally Twisted curl scrunching gel is really nice. Not so sticky and still holds all day long. It is hard to find a good product for curly hair but this one is a really good option.</li>
            <li> My wife has naturally straight hair and likes to scrunch it often when we go out to give it the semi-wet look. Lots of products out there offer the ability to do this but they don&#x27;t exactly hold for the entire day. The totally twisted curl gel holds for at least 10 hours while we are out and at least 8 hours in hot weather. There is a really light clean berry smell. Its not over powering at all which is great, some other products she uses gives me a headache, or maybe its just her (haha). Either way this is a great product. I have even used a few times and you can pick it up way cheaper on here when theres a coupon!</li>
            <li> A cheap option for a super curly girl. At first it seems crunchy but dries nicely. Helps eliminate frizz and define curls!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not my favorite but I do like it a good amount and will buy more if my other stuff isn&#x27;t on sale</li>
            <li> I did not purchase this product through Amazon, because it was cheaper at my local store.  I like this product and will purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have LOTS of thick hair.  So much so that every stylist makes mention of it when they assess my hair.  The top layer is straight while underlying hairs are slightly wavy, so for the most part, my hair looks straight.  I love the way my hair looks when it&#x27;s damp with its beach-waviness.  I used this product in the hopes that I could achieve that look and it did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I got the waves: I applied about 2 quarter-sized dollops of this gel from my tips to about 75% towards the scalp.  My hair was damp and towel-dried.  I sectioned my hair in two halves (left and right). I took one section and split that into two, twisting them around each other like a huge twisty braid.  I twirled that into a bun and pinned in place.  Repeat on the other half.  I slept in it and parts were still damp in the morning so I blow-dried on the low setting.  I undid the buns and they came out wavy! You can see this in the sepia toned photo.  The other photo was taken mid-afternoon and you can see there was hardly a difference.</li>
            <li> This product was okay-did not achieve the look I was going for and made my hair stiff.  Definitely not as good as the no longer produced Tress Tranzition Extreme Curl Gel.</li>
            <li> Love this product. This is the only curly hair gel that works for me. I have thin but curly hair and this gel keeps my curls together without weighing them down.</li>
            <li> The curl scrunch is perfect for almost any hair style, when I want to scrunch my hair all I have to do is scrunch with my fingers as I dry and the small amount of natural curl I have stays in place.  If I want I can use the curling iron w/o combing my hair out, then I can arrange my hair with my fingers only, or I can comb my hair out use the curling iron to smooth out any frizz then comb and go.</li>
            <li> It smells so good! It it can actually manage my hair! It doesn&#x27;t dry hard or flake either.</li>
            <li> Great Smell &amp; works great!</li>
            <li> I like this product for curly and straight hair days. It&#x27;s not greasy and is a good deal for the price. Herbal essences is a good line of products across the board.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells pretty good and is super sticky on your fingers. However I bought this to use on my curly hair to give it that extra curl and keep the frizz away and it doesn&#x27;t really hold up to my standards. My hair was falling a little flat not too long after using this.</li>
            <li> The perfect thing to weigh down my thick curly hair before I add mousse and hair spray as the final touches.</li>
            <li> I use this gel because of a YouTube video, and it lives up to the rave.  I combine with mousse and finish with hairspray.  Stunning and beautiful, shiny curls.</li>
            <li> I am always on the hunt for good products at low prices. After trying several different products on my very thick, very curly shoulder-length hair, I think this is the winner. The smell is nice, and it goes on easy without a sticky, dry finish. The curl takes on a nice shape and stays in place. Can usually get this for under $4 each and it lasts a while, so definitely a good deal on a product that works.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite hair product! I love the smell &amp; the texture it leaves my curls. If I could use only one product for my hair, for the rest of my life, this would be the one!</li>
            <li> I love this hair gel.  It smells good, works well, and doesn&#x27;t make me break out.  I have tried many other hair gels, but they always would make me break out.  This did not.  I added it to my amazon mom subscribe and save and got it got a GREAT price.  It works best if you apply it right out of the shower.  I usually brush my hair first.  After that you can either blow dry your hair or let it dry by itself.  If you blow dry use a hair brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great for my hair type.  My hair is soft, will curl but won&#x27;t keep the curl, and is naturally wavy.  This gel helps keep the curls in once I use my circling iron.  It also helps my hair stay straight it I use the straightener.</li>
            <li> This is great because it doesn&#x27;t make your hair crunchy and stiff. It smells really nice too. Try and get the matching hair spray for the fly aways that always happen.</li>
            <li> My hubby uses this one. It&#x27;s too thick for me but for him it&#x27;s not too thin or too thick. He doesn&#x27;t want to come away from a product with the wet look just needs something to tame his waves and this is a very competitively priced option for that.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I was expecting, but it smells good and I do use it, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to help my hair ..........</li>
            <li> Love this product. Creates awesome curls without making my hair seem hard and wet.</li>
            <li> I use this gel with mousse and Aussie sprunch spray hairspray and a bit of Aussie Instant Freeze hairspray and my curly ringlets stay in place with touchable (read not crunchy) curls.  i love it.  It gives enough staying power - even on hot and humid days that I don&#x27;t end up with a head full of frizz.  This is the best gel I have used in all my years and I am always getting compliments on my hair.</li>
            <li> I tried this gel to see if it helped my fine hair to keep from blowing too much when outdoors. I have tried numerous mousses, gels, and hair products that add lift or volume but they make me break out here &amp; there on my scalp right alone the hairline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bend over and collect my hair away from the scalp &amp; apply the mousse or gel, trying to avoid contact with my skin, but it still causes the break-out problem. I used this gel exclusively for two weeks and had a break out, so I quit using it. I also did not like the stiff, lacquer-like finish that it left on my hair. It works about the same as other gels and mousses, except it seems to be more condensed, leaving a heavier coat on my hair.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you a little bit about my hair. When I was growing up, I had extremely thick, wavy hair. But once I hit puberty, my hair drastically thinned out and became more and more curly. I am twenty years old now and have medium to thin half curly half wavy hair just past my collarbone. Usually I blow dry my hair with a 3 inch round brush so that I get everything out of my natural body and wave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After moving to a much hotter and MUCH more humid state, my mostly straight hairstyle wasn&#x27;t going to work for me anymore. So I got the book [[ASIN:076115678X Curly Girl: The Handbook]] and decided to embrace my inner curliness. I&#x27;ve tried lots of curling products over the years: John Frieda, Aussie, Suave, Garnier Fructis, Tressemme, fancy expensive stuff you get at the hair salon because they used it on your hair and it looked good (you know what I&#x27;m talking about). I think I&#x27;ve found the winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I get out of the shower, I softly towel dry my hair. Then, as I get dressed and do my makeup, I let my hair dry a little bit on its own. Then I take just a little bit of gel, rub it in my palms/fingers, and distribute it the best I can evenly throughout my hair. I&#x27;ve found I get great results if I don&#x27;t comb and disrupt the curl pattern as little as possible. VERY IMPORTANT: while it&#x27;s drying, DON&#x27;T TOUCH IT. It will cause frizz. But, if you let it air dry, you end up with soft (not crunchy), full-bodied, managable, non-frizzy, calm hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I took off one star is because it doesn&#x27;t hold up through the night sleeping on it. But that&#x27;s a lot to ask of one simple gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy it again. It is holding up well despite the humidity in the south.</li>
            <li> I really like this hair gel. It smells good and hold my curls really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my local Walmart didn&#x27;t have them in stock anymore, I ended up having to by two other brands of hair gel. They were awful. I might as well have put water in my hair hoping for some kind of hold. My curls never held, and if they did hold some, they would fall right out after an hour and my hair would turn fluffly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Herbal Essences hair gel works a lot better. It keeps its hold all day and my curls stay frizz and fluff free.</li>
            <li> this was very nice medium sized but perfect for my hair I appreciate your business.</li>
            <li> Great product! I love Herbal Essences product and these one will be my go to. On day&#x27;s that I want curl I apply a small amount.&lt;br /&gt;It smells great.</li>
            <li> This smelled really yummy and works well. I would definately buy again.</li>
            <li> Decent go-to product for my long hair. I apply it in a &#x27;scrunching&#x27; motion, which helps keep shape of waves in my hair - no pulling.  Gel adds some shape to soft hair after daily showers. Apply when hair is damp. Is a water-soluble product and breaks down if applied to really wet hair. Recommend.</li>
            <li> My go-to scrunching gel. Haven&#x27;t found anything that works better, plus it&#x27;s relatively cheap compared to other products.</li>
            <li> I have long 3a curls and have been switching between gel brands for years. I started with the expensive salon stuff, but my budget couldn&#x27;t handle the prices. Then went to super cheap stuff, which always left my hair flaking. This stuff is FANTASTIC! It tames my frizz and manages my curls without weighting them down.&lt;br /&gt;My routine is to shower at night and let my hair air dry while I sleep, then in the morning (while my hair is still a little damp) I put this through my hair. I try to coat ever section of my hair for full/even control, a dollop per section.</li>
            <li> Perfect product for my curly hair. I put the clear gel into my hair after my shower and let it air dry. It keeps it curly and wavy without being crunchy!</li>
            <li> I have been having hair problems with my hair in the NC mountain air. I gave up the cost of the perms I love because I am now retired and decided to have straight hair. Although I tried for months to deal with straight hair, it drove me nuts. Turns out I still have some natural wave, so I researched good scrunching products and found this. It works great, and I have found that I can still have a perm in the winter when it is less humid.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t curl my hair that well</li>
            <li> I have curly/frizzy hair and have used the same gel for YEARS. I left it at home while away on vacation and got this brand instead. It&#x27;s my new favorite gel and it&#x27;s about 1/3 of the price!</li>
            <li> Does the job of holding the scrunch</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time using it and it does wonders on my natural hair.</li>
            <li> I got a great price on this product. It smells great and doesn&#x27;t create dandruff or flakes like other gels do.</li>
            <li> Great for curly hair!</li>
