            <li>Love love love this brush!</li>
            <li>With all the many brushes to buy I thought I would take a chance on this brush</li>
            <li>Love Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li>I use it primarily to add darker eyeshadows in the corner.</li>
            <li>As the shape makes it super easy to get into the corner of your eyes.</li>
            <li>i love it, is very precise to apply makeup, and the material of the brush is very soft.</li>
            <li>and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;a bristles are strong and very very gentle.</li>
            <li>The brush arrived quickly and was well packaged.</li>
            <li>Received this brush quickly and began using it right away.  </li>
            <li>This brush is really sturdy with a comfortable handle.</li>
            <li>This brush is amazing for conceal or contour areas of the face, such as the side of the nose and around the mouth.</li>

            <li>I usually use my Beauty Blender for my under eye, but sometimes I don&#x27;t want to disturb my make up when I&#x27;ve put on mascara and want a touch up for example and this brush is great for those moments.</li>
            <li>This precisely tapered edge is great for applying concealer and the very soft bristles work nicely to blend, especially for the delicate undereye area.</li>
            <li>I have never owned a Sigma brush before, this little brush is very soft,the handle is a great length for balance.  </li>
            <li>, I recommend going over it with a beauty blender to really press it into the skin for a more natural look.</li>
            <li>Good for getting in those tight corners around and eyes and nose</li>
            <li>I will be buying more Sigma brushes in the future.</li>
            <li>I love these brushes and have them in in the performance eyes kit and the mr bunny essential sigma max kit.</li>
            <li>It took me some time to get used to this brush and this has become my most recent go to brush for the corner.</li>
            <li>But this brush really works after I use it.  </li>
            <li>Very well made.</li>
            <li>I use it mainly for under eye concealing and eye-shadow blending near the eyelid area as well.  </li>
            <li>I must say,I am on my way of having the complete set of allll sigma brushes!</li>
