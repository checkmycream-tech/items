            <li>Well I am happy to say ; he loved it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s excellent design and one of the most satisfying purchases!</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I very happy, gillette fusion proglide power is perfect, it smooth easily been to cut.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>4- 6 shaves, but if I go slower the shave feels good.</li>
            <li>I have started switching between an electric shaver and the Gillette Fusion Power with good results.</li>
            <li>: Close shave, good handle, the power option&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>Good razor.</li>
            <li>and I use a good quality organic conditioner instead of shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>Power button is fairly straightforward&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>My girlfriend loved it.</li>
            <li>The vibrations are very pleasant to the skin, clean shave for 1 pass.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is very accessible and cuts great.</li>
            <li>Excellent razor, very smooth and comfortable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I made this change!</li>
            <li>but this one it just amazing.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Gillette for their excellent response.</li>
            <li>The razor was nice.</li>
            <li>The sideburn trimer is nice too.  </li>
            <li>nice.</li>
            <li>awesome beyond belief really i know its alot but splurge.</li>
            <li>I own Proglide and this one (proglide Power)too...</li>
            <li>This special edition razor is just the best razor available on the market.</li>
            <li>Gillette Fusion is the best razor that I have used so far.</li>
            <li>and this is by far the best razor I have ever used, cut through the whiskers with zero resistance you don&#x27;t feel that tug on your skin from the whiskers being pulled before it gets cut by the blade.</li>
            <li>Give a close very smooth shave.</li>
            <li>It is very smooth and no cuts/burns.</li>
            <li>I normally use the power series, but this is just as good!  </li>
            <li>I thought how much better can it be?  </li>
            <li>but I like this one better.  </li>
            <li>The Gillette power razor works faster and gives a closer shave on most of my not-so-young face.</li>
            <li>and I think ok, I love</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried many fixed-blade shavers.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s important to share effective solutions.  </li>
            <li>If you like your electric toothbrush you will love this razor.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love it, works like a charm.</li>
            <li>I think it is OK but based on what I read about it</li>
            <li>I was able to get mine for like $7, and that&#x27;s about the extent of what I&#x27;d pay for one.</li>
            <li>Smooth and no razor burn!</li>
            <li>tried both with and without power on, and it&#x27;s more effortless with power for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>sure it glides and its realy soft&lt;</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>I just Love it , the ease with i can get</li>
            <li>But you can stand for razor would have done more.</li>
            <li>Completely satisfied with this product</li>
            <li>Nice clean shave.</li>
            <li>It has a cute indicator light that shows its on and does a better job of triming the sideburns and close quarter areas.  </li>
            <li>Overall very good shave.</li>
            <li>Been shaving for fifty plus years and have never had a more comfortable, easy, smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I had the older version for 6 years and loved it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried both the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power and the Schick Hydro Power, and the Gillette model is far superior, it just feels better on the face and produces a smoother shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a good alternative to electric shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>I thing that seems less than perfect is that I don&#x27;t get the &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re into the typical cartridge razors, then this is probably the best on the market.</li>
            <li>I was impressed that the little vibration does make a difference in the shave.  </li>
            <li>Cheaper than CVS, and always available.</li>
            <li>From the sound, the frequency is probably ultrasonic.</li>
            <li>Enjoy;</li>
            <li>Enjoy;</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a great product.</li>
            <li>Enjoy the combination of electric and manual use.  </li>
            <li>smooth result and convenient for me in the sense of just replace the cartridge if it is overused..</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been happy with my shave quality for several years.</li>
            <li>i like it bcoz its more thick and nice to hold!!!</li>
            <li>The reason I know this is when we went out to the store he wanted to check this brands shaving creme for sensitive skin; we came home with their brand shaving creme; it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li>I have to say this is the cadillac of shavers and totally worth it!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely a small price to pay for an excellent shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was so excited about the shave I just had to jump online and post a review.</li>
            <li>Pretty decent and the price is fair.</li>
            <li>Be sure to use it in conjunction with the Proglide Power cartridges as the blade are made thinner than the regular ones and will provide a nice close shave.</li>
            <li>I used the Fusion Power for  about two years then decided it just wasn&#x27;t good enough anymore.</li>
            <li>I use a safety/double-edge razor at home, and much prefer that method of shaving; however, cartridges are much more convenient for travel (hence my purchase).</li>
            <li>The shave its very close and leaved my skin so smooth!</li>
            <li>I really have a fever for this razor, even more than a fever for cowbell.  </li>
            <li>the gold color and the fancy packaging make me feel like a true Olympian.  </li>
            <li>the price was decent but totally pleased with my purchased.</li>
            <li>comfortable and smooth Shave is very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Seems like every new razor they come out with it better than the rest</li>
            <li>I was so glad to have a new, improved version to give him in his stocking.  </li>
            <li>Retired the previous model for this one and as good as the old one was, this one is noticeably better!</li>
            <li>Then after the first shave I had to go over places on my face to get that clean shaven feeling.</li>
            <li>I replaced it with a new blade; smooth, clean shave.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Bought it at a cheap reasonable price.</li>
            <li>the power feature allows the shave to be effortless, smooth and fast.</li>
            <li>the regular pro glide is amazing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve shaving 3 or 4 times a week, and I&#x27;m on my third week, and I&#x27;m still getting a nice close shave.</li>
            <li>The good thing is that it looks like this handle is cross-compatible with my other Gillette Fusion blades that I still have sitting at home.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bought this as part of his stocking stuffer gifts this past Christmas 2012 and a pack of cartridge refills, figuring if he didn&#x27;t like it, I&#x27;d have a nice razor for my legs :).</li>
            <li>finally switched over the to Proglide Power, deciding it&#x27;s better to dish out a few more bucks and get a better result.</li>
            <li>Razor is good but the batteries don&#x27;t last more than a few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I have ever had as close of a shave as I did when I first used this razor.</li>
            <li>Really fast and no sensation/fear of snagging/nicking!</li>
            <li>;-)  </li>
            <li>First time, I use sensorexcel, My irritation and sometimes bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li>Vibration isn&#x27;t too strong and helps to keep the blades clean and definitely makes for a very close shave.</li>
            <li>Appeared to be first line rejects based on quality of product.</li>
            <li>it was my first power razor that vibrates</li>
            <li>I got this for my bro as his first razor and likes it.</li>
            <li>First time to this POWER stuff - and it certainly DOES make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>When I first opened this package I knew that I was in for a real treat,</li>
            <li>My shave time has easily been cut in half, each stroke is smooth and I don&#x27;t feel it.</li>
            <li>This one however has a single blade edger on the top edge of it.  </li>
            <li>There are so many five star reviews mine would get lost in the plethora, but the curious will check out the four star comments searching for negativos.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;need&amp;#34; this, but got a discount coupon from Gillette</li>
            <li>It really does just glide.  </li>
            <li>Seems to work very well, whether power button is on or off.</li>
            <li>I expected much more.  </li>
            <li>The five blades gently does the work done and doesn&#x27;t damage your skin.</li>
            <li>He doesn&#x27;t have much to compare it to but it works.</li>
            <li>It really does help get a closer shave.</li>
            <li>Like most razors the refill cartridges are really expensive, and I think these are a bit more than others, so I would tell people what I have mentioned, but I believe I would recommend this to a friend</li>
            <li>Clever, those engineers; it isn&#x27;t marketing hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A really decent price for this brand of razor.</li>
            <li>It is a high quality product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>will the blade hold up considering its high price?</li>
            <li>At current blade prices not yet worth the premium.</li>
            <li>sure how long the batter will last though as i just started using it</li>
            <li>Shaves as normal non-vibrating razor and gets a closer shave.  </li>
            <li>I found I had to move the razor slower than I do with my other razor, but my face felt really smooth.</li>
            <li>Been having it for a while now, I just buy new blades for it.</li>
            <li>The plastic holder, however, received major improvement and now it&#x27;s less bulky and looks a lot better.</li>
            <li>First off, I&#x27;ve had an electric shaver for that last 1.5 years</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>, I gave it a try and was I ever surprised!</li>
            <li>I am amazed how much engineering goes into design of a simple razor which is centuries old!</li>
            <li>I am 76 years old, weigh 140lbs, am 6 feet, retired and shave daily, so I do not feel I have an unusual shaving situation that might contribute to my experience.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to the old fashioned manual way.</li>
            <li>Guess i&#x27;m an old fog...</li>
            <li>It really was noticeably smoother than the shave I was getting with regular disposables.</li>
            <li>For me the question is if it&#x27;s worth the extra price for the Proglide vs regular Fusion blades.  </li>
            <li>It hums a pleasant tone (unlike electric razors sounding like a little chainsaw) that apparently jiggles the blades imperceptibly sideways.</li>
            <li>the less razer burns the better, also the battery lasts a long time, and it makes it easier and smoother then without one.</li>
            <li>I have had a couple of these in the past and I always seem to loose or break them thru my own fault.  </li>
            <li>I would get this kind of shave with my other razor, only when I had a new blade for the first time, but no matter how careful I was, i would cut myself in a few places.</li>
            <li>No snags or anything different than a normal shave.</li>
            <li>I have used the new (updated version) razor for several weeks and</li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s previous, battery-powered razor gave up right before the holidays.  </li>
            <li>occasionally you can get a decent deal at some big name wholesale clubs, but this is one reason I can&#x27;t give the razor 5 stars.</li>
            <li>If you push the knife straight down like you would dicing carrots, the bread squashes and it&#x27;s difficult to get a nice chunk.</li>
            <li>They all recommend a safety razor - but you have to be very careful and it takes much longer.</li>
            <li>I have coarse facial hair and sensitive skin on my neck and this razor powers through a three day beard like nothing.  </li>
            <li>i really didn&#x27;t know what to expect, I mean who really needs a battery power razor, but I gave it a try.</li>
            <li>I shave my whole face once with mostly down strokes and then on the second pass I do up strokes.  </li>
            <li>it is not; the 5-blade cartridges are not nearly as smooth and pull-free as the Mach III three blades and last for only 5-7 days maximum, with increasing discomfort related to pulling and not cutting efficiently; I have to go over difficult shaving spots much more than the Mach III to get a close shave.  </li>
            <li>Disposable razors are less expensive than cartridge systems, but I never realized they aren&#x27;t as good quality.</li>

            <li> The Gillette power razor works faster and gives a closer shave on most of my not-so-young face.</li>
            <li> and I think ok, I love</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried many fixed-blade shavers.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s important to share effective solutions.  </li>
            <li> If you like your electric toothbrush you will love this razor.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love it, works like a charm.</li>
            <li> I think it is OK but based on what I read about it</li>
            <li> I was able to get mine for like $7, and that&#x27;s about the extent of what I&#x27;d pay for one.</li>
            <li> Smooth and no razor burn!</li>
            <li> tried both with and without power on, and it&#x27;s more effortless with power for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> sure it glides and its realy soft&lt;</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> I just Love it , the ease with i can get</li>
            <li> But you can stand for razor would have done more.</li>
            <li> Completely satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> Nice clean shave.</li>
            <li> It has a cute indicator light that shows its on and does a better job of triming the sideburns and close quarter areas.  </li>
            <li> Overall very good shave.</li>
            <li> Been shaving for fifty plus years and have never had a more comfortable, easy, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I had the older version for 6 years and loved it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried both the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power and the Schick Hydro Power, and the Gillette model is far superior, it just feels better on the face and produces a smoother shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a good alternative to electric shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> I thing that seems less than perfect is that I don&#x27;t get the &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re into the typical cartridge razors, then this is probably the best on the market.</li>
            <li> I was impressed that the little vibration does make a difference in the shave.  </li>
            <li> Cheaper than CVS, and always available.</li>
            <li> From the sound, the frequency is probably ultrasonic.</li>
            <li> Enjoy;</li>
            <li> Enjoy;</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a great product.</li>
            <li> Enjoy the combination of electric and manual use.  </li>
            <li> smooth result and convenient for me in the sense of just replace the cartridge if it is overused..</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been happy with my shave quality for several years.</li>
            <li> i like it bcoz its more thick and nice to hold!!!</li>
            <li> The reason I know this is when we went out to the store he wanted to check this brands shaving creme for sensitive skin; we came home with their brand shaving creme; it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li> I have to say this is the cadillac of shavers and totally worth it!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a small price to pay for an excellent shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was so excited about the shave I just had to jump online and post a review.</li>
            <li> Pretty decent and the price is fair.</li>
            <li> Be sure to use it in conjunction with the Proglide Power cartridges as the blade are made thinner than the regular ones and will provide a nice close shave.</li>
            <li> I used the Fusion Power for  about two years then decided it just wasn&#x27;t good enough anymore.</li>
            <li> I use a safety/double-edge razor at home, and much prefer that method of shaving; however, cartridges are much more convenient for travel (hence my purchase).</li>
            <li> The shave its very close and leaved my skin so smooth!</li>
            <li> I really have a fever for this razor, even more than a fever for cowbell.  </li>
            <li> the gold color and the fancy packaging make me feel like a true Olympian.  </li>
            <li> the price was decent but totally pleased with my purchased.</li>
            <li> comfortable and smooth Shave is very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seems like every new razor they come out with it better than the rest</li>
            <li> I was so glad to have a new, improved version to give him in his stocking.  </li>
            <li> Retired the previous model for this one and as good as the old one was, this one is noticeably better!</li>
            <li> Then after the first shave I had to go over places on my face to get that clean shaven feeling.</li>
            <li> I replaced it with a new blade; smooth, clean shave.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Bought it at a cheap reasonable price.</li>
            <li> the power feature allows the shave to be effortless, smooth and fast.</li>
            <li> the regular pro glide is amazing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve shaving 3 or 4 times a week, and I&#x27;m on my third week, and I&#x27;m still getting a nice close shave.</li>
            <li> The good thing is that it looks like this handle is cross-compatible with my other Gillette Fusion blades that I still have sitting at home.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bought this as part of his stocking stuffer gifts this past Christmas 2012 and a pack of cartridge refills, figuring if he didn&#x27;t like it, I&#x27;d have a nice razor for my legs :).</li>
            <li> finally switched over the to Proglide Power, deciding it&#x27;s better to dish out a few more bucks and get a better result.</li>
            <li> Razor is good but the batteries don&#x27;t last more than a few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I have ever had as close of a shave as I did when I first used this razor.</li>
            <li> Really fast and no sensation/fear of snagging/nicking!</li>
            <li> ;-)  </li>
            <li> First time, I use sensorexcel, My irritation and sometimes bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li> Vibration isn&#x27;t too strong and helps to keep the blades clean and definitely makes for a very close shave.</li>
            <li> Appeared to be first line rejects based on quality of product.</li>
            <li> it was my first power razor that vibrates</li>
            <li> I got this for my bro as his first razor and likes it.</li>
            <li> First time to this POWER stuff - and it certainly DOES make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> When I first opened this package I knew that I was in for a real treat,</li>
            <li> My shave time has easily been cut in half, each stroke is smooth and I don&#x27;t feel it.</li>
            <li> This one however has a single blade edger on the top edge of it.  </li>
            <li> There are so many five star reviews mine would get lost in the plethora, but the curious will check out the four star comments searching for negativos.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;need&amp;#34; this, but got a discount coupon from Gillette</li>
            <li> It really does just glide.  </li>
            <li> Seems to work very well, whether power button is on or off.</li>
            <li> I expected much more.  </li>
            <li> The five blades gently does the work done and doesn&#x27;t damage your skin.</li>
            <li> He doesn&#x27;t have much to compare it to but it works.</li>
            <li> It really does help get a closer shave.</li>
            <li> Like most razors the refill cartridges are really expensive, and I think these are a bit more than others, so I would tell people what I have mentioned, but I believe I would recommend this to a friend</li>
            <li> Clever, those engineers; it isn&#x27;t marketing hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A really decent price for this brand of razor.</li>
            <li> It is a high quality product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> will the blade hold up considering its high price?</li>
            <li> At current blade prices not yet worth the premium.</li>
            <li> sure how long the batter will last though as i just started using it</li>
            <li> Shaves as normal non-vibrating razor and gets a closer shave.  </li>
            <li> I found I had to move the razor slower than I do with my other razor, but my face felt really smooth.</li>
            <li> Been having it for a while now, I just buy new blades for it.</li>
            <li> The plastic holder, however, received major improvement and now it&#x27;s less bulky and looks a lot better.</li>
            <li> First off, I&#x27;ve had an electric shaver for that last 1.5 years</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> , I gave it a try and was I ever surprised!</li>
            <li> I am amazed how much engineering goes into design of a simple razor which is centuries old!</li>
            <li> I am 76 years old, weigh 140lbs, am 6 feet, retired and shave daily, so I do not feel I have an unusual shaving situation that might contribute to my experience.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to the old fashioned manual way.</li>
            <li> Guess i&#x27;m an old fog...</li>
            <li> It really was noticeably smoother than the shave I was getting with regular disposables.</li>
            <li> For me the question is if it&#x27;s worth the extra price for the Proglide vs regular Fusion blades.  </li>
            <li> It hums a pleasant tone (unlike electric razors sounding like a little chainsaw) that apparently jiggles the blades imperceptibly sideways.</li>
            <li> the less razer burns the better, also the battery lasts a long time, and it makes it easier and smoother then without one.</li>
            <li> I have had a couple of these in the past and I always seem to loose or break them thru my own fault.  </li>
            <li> I would get this kind of shave with my other razor, only when I had a new blade for the first time, but no matter how careful I was, i would cut myself in a few places.</li>
            <li> No snags or anything different than a normal shave.</li>
            <li> I have used the new (updated version) razor for several weeks and</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s previous, battery-powered razor gave up right before the holidays.  </li>
            <li> occasionally you can get a decent deal at some big name wholesale clubs, but this is one reason I can&#x27;t give the razor 5 stars.</li>
            <li> If you push the knife straight down like you would dicing carrots, the bread squashes and it&#x27;s difficult to get a nice chunk.</li>
            <li> They all recommend a safety razor - but you have to be very careful and it takes much longer.</li>
            <li> I have coarse facial hair and sensitive skin on my neck and this razor powers through a three day beard like nothing.  </li>
            <li> i really didn&#x27;t know what to expect, I mean who really needs a battery power razor, but I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> I shave my whole face once with mostly down strokes and then on the second pass I do up strokes.  </li>
            <li> it is not; the 5-blade cartridges are not nearly as smooth and pull-free as the Mach III three blades and last for only 5-7 days maximum, with increasing discomfort related to pulling and not cutting efficiently; I have to go over difficult shaving spots much more than the Mach III to get a close shave.  </li>
            <li> Disposable razors are less expensive than cartridge systems, but I never realized they aren&#x27;t as good quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid to buy refills though, I&#x27;m sure they are even more expensive.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the &#x27;vibration&#x27; really contributes to closer shave.</li>
            <li> The blades maybe over priced to replace them, but they last me an amazingly long time,and the save is unmatched in closeness and comfort.</li>
            <li> It last for a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really clear to me that there&#x27;s any actual difference between the gold version and the others, but I feel like a million bucks when I shave with this.  </li>
            <li> And that little AAA is supposed to last, like, nearly forever, and I believe it.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this razor since normally I don&#x27;t like the quad and higher blade razors.  </li>
            <li> They last me between 3 weeks and a month with a single shave per day.  </li>
            <li> My husband had the usual complaints most husbands and men in general have; sensitive skin and their unhappy with their razor/razors.</li>
            <li> But a little sawing action produces acceptable slices.</li>
            <li> Blades are somewhat spendy but not really considering multiple shaves per unit.</li>
            <li> Well, no killing on blade sales here but for me I&#x27;ll be a long term blade customer for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> is that long.</li>
            <li> Battery goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A very smooth shave, marred only by the size of the razor, which makes it difficult to get into small corners of your face like around your mouth and ears.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen other reviews that complain that the blades don&#x27;t last that long.  </li>
            <li> When my Mach III Power broke related to the battery compartment contacts failing, I explored what had transpired razor-wise in the last few years, and settled on the Fusion Proglide Power.  </li>
            <li> They explained that this is not normal and sent me coupon to replace the defective unit.  </li>
            <li> i have very thick facial hair, and a lot of other razers leave me with razer burns, but this does now, it isn&#x27;t as smooth to the thick hair as the other razers i have used, but</li>
            <li> The downside is having to use a messy shaving cream and occasional cuts if I am in a hurry or forceful.</li>
            <li> This method and this razor has gotten me the closest shave and with minimal or no irritation.  </li>
            <li> The electric toothbrush is no better than the standard toothbrushes and just like the toothbrush this razor is no better than the standard Gillette blue throw away razors.  </li>
            <li> There is no warranty on it, so be careful.</li>
            <li> I expected pulling and tugging.</li>
            <li> razor was poor quality; blade appeared to be exceedingly dull starting with first shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is actually my 2nd Gillette Fusion Proglide Power as my previous one got water in the battery compartment and basically killed the battery and the electric system.  </li>
            <li> not sure how the vibration that the battery provides works, but it totally eliminated the pulling feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I stopped using my other shaver after using this kinda of power razor..</li>
            <li> Other sites explained that there is a difference between the quality of blades used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But for $10, if the base last a year or two that is fine with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Vibration is high speed but very subtle.  </li>
            <li> Sorry, this is really a fiver,</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have a heavy beard and get roughly 8 shaves if that helps anyone?</li>
            <li> My choice came down to this and the Shick Hydro 5.</li>
            <li> 50 % less razor bumps!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nothing has been changed in the razor since previous edition but the color.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say how long each blade lasts until replacement or until when it loses comfort since I just bought this, but i&#x27;ll update as soon as I have an</li>
            <li> I am underwhelmed at the least and frankly disappointed at the most.</li>
            <li> I read a few reviews about this razor and took a chance</li>
            <li> the product came in time but the container was broken like %40 on one side, enough to tear it out!</li>
            <li> Imagine a razor that would do its job without any trouble...</li>
            <li> after few secs u feel Formication....</li>
            <li> if u get this for the price of  proglide , go for it, else dont waste ur money...</li>
            <li> Not sure about the power feature (i&#x27;m not used to it).</li>
            <li> They can be difficult to find at least in my area, and there are several choices.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It started by reading a few articles online from serious shaving experts.</li>
            <li> I always hate the first shave after hair</li>
            <li> Its was hard to improve on the Fusion</li>
            <li> just slowly go over surface and voila&#x27;</li>
            <li> I mean how could you improve a razor.</li>
            <li> And although I thought the vibrating handle was a gimmick and either wouldn&#x27;t help or might actually increase the likelihood of being cut, it turned out I was completely wrong!</li>
            <li> The electric pulsing and the quality blades do the namesake of this razor serious justice.  </li>
            <li> Heads are expensive (typical for Gillette), but Gillette is all i ever use.</li>
            <li> Poor promotion.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a fake.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I shave in the shower and then go over the difficult areas with my electric shaver.</li>
            <li> The replacement blades are expensive.</li>
            <li> I am not impressed.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the blade didn&#x27;t cut well at all, and the comfort levels were lower than my Fusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I always thing we have hit the max number of blades in a razor, but then Gillette prove me wrong and add another for a closer shave!</li>
            <li> Replacement blades are very expensive.  </li>
            <li> The blade was so bad</li>
            <li> I used it twice; bad shave each time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that is that bad.  </li>
            <li> I got sick of going to the pharmacy to find out that they are locked or backordered.</li>

            <li> PRIOR COMMENT:  Razor is good but the batteries don&#x27;t last more than a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  May 26, 2015.  Gillette Customer Service contacted me regarding my comment about the batteries not working.  They explained that this is not normal and sent me coupon to replace the defective unit.  I have used the new (updated version) razor for several weeks and the power feature is working well.  Thanks to Gillette for their excellent response.</li>
            <li> Gillette Fusion is the best razor that I have used so far. Seems like every new razor they come out with it better than the rest</li>
            <li> Great razor but it comes at premium. Noticeable improvement in shave quality vs. regular Fusion blades especially against the grain.  For me the question is if it&#x27;s worth the extra price for the Proglide vs regular Fusion blades.  At current blade prices not yet worth the premium.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my hubby and he loves it!!!!  Battery life on this product is great.  Nice clean shave. 50 % less razor bumps!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it. I&#x27;m afraid to buy refills though, I&#x27;m sure they are even more expensive.</li>
            <li> i really didn&#x27;t know what to expect, I mean who really needs a battery power razor, but I gave it a try. I don&#x27;t think I have ever had as close of a shave as I did when I first used this razor. I found I had to move the razor slower than I do with my other razor, but my face felt really smooth. I would get this kind of shave with my other razor, only when I had a new blade for the first time, but no matter how careful I was, i would cut myself in a few places. Then after the first shave I had to go over places on my face to get that clean shaven feeling. I thing that seems less than perfect is that I don&#x27;t get the &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; shaven feeling with this razor after about 4- 6 shaves, but if I go slower the shave feels good. Like most razors the refill cartridges are really expensive, and I think these are a bit more than others, so I would tell people what I have mentioned, but I believe I would recommend this to a friend</li>
            <li> Give a close very smooth shave. Retired the previous model for this one and as good as the old one was, this one is noticeably better!</li>
            <li> Cheaper than CVS, and always available. I got sick of going to the pharmacy to find out that they are locked or backordered.</li>
            <li> The razor was nice. The blade was so bad I thought it was a fake. It felt like it had been used before. I used it twice; bad shave each time. I replaced it with a new blade; smooth, clean shave.[[ASIN:B007MXK11Q Gillette Fusion Proglide Power 1 Razor 1 Cartridge 1 Battery Kit]]</li>
            <li> It is a high quality product. Pretty decent and the price is fair. One of the best shaving experiences I have ever had, has been with this product. Highly recommended. You will not regret buying it.</li>
            <li> I had the older version for 6 years and loved it.  Then this one came along, I waited.  I thought how much better can it be?  When I purchased and used it - it was amazing!  Gillette outdid themselves.  I recommend that you stop waiting and get it now.</li>
            <li> I always thing we have hit the max number of blades in a razor, but then Gillette prove me wrong and add another for a closer shave!</li>
            <li> For some time now I&#x27;ve shaved my head (and mug of course). Tried &#x27;em all; including cheapie throw-away dollar-store bags of them, the Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual non-powered model (like this but no battery vibrator which is so-so), and a high-dollar high-zoot electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought this thing was probably a marketing ploy gimmick, but reading some reviews I gave it a try anyway. Guess what? This razor produces an excellent shave of both the dome and the mug. Really fast and no sensation/fear of snagging/nicking! It hums a pleasant tone (unlike electric razors sounding like a little chainsaw) that apparently jiggles the blades imperceptibly sideways. From the sound, the frequency is probably ultrasonic. ;-)  Think of slicing a baguette. If you push the knife straight down like you would dicing carrots, the bread squashes and it&#x27;s difficult to get a nice chunk. But a little sawing action produces acceptable slices. I think that&#x27;s what the Gillette Fusion battery model does. Clever, those engineers; it isn&#x27;t marketing hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this thing for a couple of weeks and no indication yet of a blade replacement. And that little AAA is supposed to last, like, nearly forever, and I believe it. Blades are somewhat spendy but not really considering multiple shaves per unit. The electronic handle itself costs relative peanuts: Eleven bucks from Amazon for a high-tech gizmo. That&#x27;s been the Gillette business model since Day One a hundred years ago: Essentially give away the handles but make a killing on replacement blades. Well, no killing on blade sales here but for me I&#x27;ll be a long term blade customer for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think you have the point: Get one and try it; you&#x27;ll like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Know why I gave it four star instead of five? Reverse psychology. There are so many five star reviews mine would get lost in the plethora, but the curious will check out the four star comments searching for negativos. Sorry, this is really a fiver, A-1 all the way, but I fooled you didn&#x27;t I? Enjoy; KeetoeBurrito.&lt;br /&gt;---(end, thank goodness)---y a fiver, A-1 all the way, but I fooled you didn&#x27;t I?

            <li> This is the 1st Fusion Proglide razor I&#x27;ve owned.  I did have a prior Fusion razor that worked well but I like this one better.  It has a cute indicator light that shows its on and does a better job of triming the sideburns and close quarter areas.  Its was hard to improve on the Fusion but they did it.</li>
            <li> I am amazed by this item.  I&#x27;ve shaving 3 or 4 times a week, and I&#x27;m on my third week, and I&#x27;m still getting a nice close shave.</li>
            <li> I have been an electric shaver user all my life. I have started switching between an electric shaver and the Gillette Fusion Power with good results. The Gillette power razor works faster and gives a closer shave on most of my not-so-young face. The downside is having to use a messy shaving cream and occasional cuts if I am in a hurry or forceful. Sometimes I shave in the shower and then go over the difficult areas with my electric shaver. Overall, this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I like the looks, the feel, the comfort and use.  Closest shave ever.  Enjoy the combination of electric and manual use.  The sideburn trimer is nice too.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> First time, I use sensorexcel, My irritation and sometimes bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;Last time, I use mach3 and I think ok, I love it.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I very happy, gillette fusion proglide power is perfect, it smooth easily been to cut.&lt;br /&gt;Very nice. I recommend.</li>
            <li> Vibration isn&#x27;t too strong and helps to keep the blades clean and definitely makes for a very close shave. Great.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;need&amp;#34; this, but got a discount coupon from Gillette so I ordered it. it works great - very happy w it.</li>
            <li> The product is great, and the vibrations prevents irritations. However, the product only lasts about 4-5 shaves. The replacement blades are expensive.</li>
            <li> razor was poor quality; blade appeared to be exceedingly dull starting with first shave. Appeared to be first line rejects based on quality of product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a good alternative to electric shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Close shave, good handle, the power option&lt;br /&gt;Cons: None</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s previous, battery-powered razor gave up right before the holidays.  I was so glad to have a new, improved version to give him in his stocking.  Thank you, Gillette!</li>
            <li> I have had a couple of these in the past and I always seem to loose or break them thru my own fault.  They can be difficult to find at least in my area, and there are several choices.  I have to say this is the cadillac of shavers and totally worth it!  The blades maybe over priced to replace them, but they last me an amazingly long time,and the save is unmatched in closeness and comfort.</li>
            <li> Still using it almost 2 years later. Good razor.</li>
            <li> First off, I&#x27;ve had an electric shaver for that last 1.5 years and I&#x27;ve tried many fixed-blade shavers.  I have sensitive skin so, I&#x27;ve tried different shavers and methods to minimize the irritation.  My last preference for a fixed-blade was the Gillette Fusion non-electric.  I read a few reviews about this razor and took a chance and I&#x27;m very happy that I did.  I shave in the shower now and I use a good quality organic conditioner instead of shaving cream.  The electric pulsing and the quality blades do the namesake of this razor serious justice.  It really does just glide.  My method... I shave in two passes.  I shave my whole face once with mostly down strokes and then on the second pass I do up strokes.  This method and this razor has gotten me the closest shave and with minimal or no irritation.  I have found a solution that works for me... and that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m writing this review. I think it&#x27;s important to share effective solutions.  Buy this razor and give it a shot.  I&#x27;ve seen other reviews that complain that the blades don&#x27;t last that long.  They last me between 3 weeks and a month with a single shave per day.  I don&#x27;t think that is that bad.  It&#x27;s definitely a small price to pay for an excellent shave.</li>
            <li> Been shaving for fifty plus years and have never had a more comfortable, easy, smooth shave. Still do not understand the function of the battery but whatever it is it works.</li>
            <li> i have very thick facial hair, and a lot of other razers leave me with razer burns, but this does now, it isn&#x27;t as smooth to the thick hair as the other razers i have used, but in the end. the less razer burns the better, also the battery lasts a long time, and it makes it easier and smoother then without one.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the &#x27;vibration&#x27; really contributes to closer shave. Seems to work very well, whether power button is on or off.</li>
            <li> If you like your electric toothbrush you will love this razor.  The electric toothbrush is no better than the standard toothbrushes and just like the toothbrush this razor is no better than the standard Gillette blue throw away razors.  I shave one side of my face with each razor and can tell no difference, both are excellent.</li>
            <li> It stopped working after 4.5 months of use. There is no warranty on it, so be careful. I will say it does shave very nice.</li>
            <li> Wow! I figured the battery thing was going to be a gimmick, I mean how could you improve a razor. The Gillette Fusion Proglide with battery is incredible. We are on vacation and I forgot a razor so I have gone 5 days without shaving. I always hate the first shave after hair is that long. I expected pulling and tugging. Instead: The smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever experienced. The good thing is that it looks like this handle is cross-compatible with my other Gillette Fusion blades that I still have sitting at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how the vibration that the battery provides works, but it totally eliminated the pulling feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited about the shave I just had to jump online and post a review.</li>
            <li> I stopped using my other shaver after using this kinda of power razor..smooth result and convenient for me in the sense of just replace the cartridge if it is overused..</li>
            <li> Did not see any battery kit. Also, the vendor could have sent an xtra cartridge. Poor promotion. I am not impressed.</li>
            <li> Nothing has been changed in the razor since previous edition but the color. The plastic holder, however, received major improvement and now it&#x27;s less bulky and looks a lot better.</li>
            <li> my husband&#x27;s face is now smoother, cleaner looking.  this is the best shaver ever and i will give to my brothers as well.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Somehow it&#x27;s very different. It last for a long time. And it&#x27;s affordable. You can just replace it one in a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried both the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power and the Schick Hydro Power, and the Gillette model is far superior, it just feels better on the face and produces a smoother shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is actually my 2nd Gillette Fusion Proglide Power as my previous one got water in the battery compartment and basically killed the battery and the electric system.  I like to use the razor in the shower so maybe they need to re-work the cap so it doesn&#x27;t allow water inside. But for $10, if the base last a year or two that is fine with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest beef is the blades though, they are way overpriced. occasionally you can get a decent deal at some big name wholesale clubs, but this is one reason I can&#x27;t give the razor 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Bought it at a cheap reasonable price. Love it, works like a charm. A really decent price for this brand of razor.</li>
            <li> awesome beyond belief really i know its alot but splurge. just slowly go over surface and voila&#x27; no 5 x over same spot.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor because it was on sale and I had read a lot about it.  I think it is OK but based on what I read about it I expected much more.  The thinner blades seem to be it&#x27;s best feature.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference using the battery or not using it.  Replacement blades are very expensive.  It only comes with one blade.</li>
            <li> When my Mach III Power broke related to the battery compartment contacts failing, I explored what had transpired razor-wise in the last few years, and settled on the Fusion Proglide Power.  I am underwhelmed at the least and frankly disappointed at the most. A Mach III it is not; the 5-blade cartridges are not nearly as smooth and pull-free as the Mach III three blades and last for only 5-7 days maximum, with increasing discomfort related to pulling and not cutting efficiently; I have to go over difficult shaving spots much more than the Mach III to get a close shave.  I should probably have followed my instincts and replaced the Mach III, which I now feel is the best course to take.  I am 76 years old, weigh 140lbs, am 6 feet, retired and shave daily, so I do not feel I have an unusual shaving situation that might contribute to my experience.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s excellent design and one of the most satisfying purchases! It is very smooth and no cuts/burns. I am amazed how much engineering goes into design of a simple razor which is centuries old!</li>
            <li> the power feature allows the shave to be effortless, smooth and fast. will the blade hold up considering its high price?</li>
            <li> I normally use the power series, but this is just as good!  Upon further reading, the only advantage I can tell is that the power series was made to actually shave against the hair.</li>
            <li> I had been eyeballing the Proglide Power for quite some time now, but never actually bought it. I used the Fusion Power for  about two years then decided it just wasn&#x27;t good enough anymore. My choice came down to this and the Shick Hydro 5. I went with the Hydro 5 because replacement blades were cheaper and lubrication strips last quite some time. Unfortunately, the blade didn&#x27;t cut well at all, and the comfort levels were lower than my Fusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally switched over the to Proglide Power, deciding it&#x27;s better to dish out a few more bucks and get a better result. I can say that I am extremely happy. My shave time has easily been cut in half, each stroke is smooth and I don&#x27;t feel it. The grip is excellent, much better than the Hydro 5. The trimmer is very accessible and cuts great. I can honestly say this is the best razor I have ever used in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say how long each blade lasts until replacement or until when it loses comfort since I just bought this, but i&#x27;ll update as soon as I have an answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be happy to answer any questions about the product as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re into the typical cartridge razors, then this is probably the best on the market. I was able to get mine for like $7, and that&#x27;s about the extent of what I&#x27;d pay for one. I use a safety/double-edge razor at home, and much prefer that method of shaving; however, cartridges are much more convenient for travel (hence my purchase).</li>
            <li> it was my first power razor that vibrates and now i dont think i can go back. the regular pro glide is amazing but this one it just amazing.</li>
            <li> the product came in time but the container was broken like %40 on one side, enough to tear it out! I still used it and yesss it is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used in life! Smooth and no razor burn! 3 stars because of the container!</li>
            <li> Imagine a razor that would do its job without any trouble... THIS IS IT! THE best razor I&#x27;ve ever used... BUY IT!</li>
            <li> I have been a Gillette Fusion user for awhile and decided to get the Power version for the heck of it.  I have coarse facial hair and sensitive skin on my neck and this razor powers through a three day beard like nothing.  I was impressed that the little vibration does make a difference in the shave.  The only thing I do not like is that it is a plastic body and I like the weight of the Fusion Proglide body, which I think contains a bit of metal.  The battery is replaceable and the product should last quite awhile. Be sure to use it in conjunction with the Proglide Power cartridges as the blade are made thinner than the regular ones and will provide a nice close shave.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving for 30+ years and this is by far the best razor I have ever used, cut through the whiskers with zero resistance you don&#x27;t feel that tug on your skin from the whiskers being pulled before it gets cut by the blade.</li>
            <li> First time to this POWER stuff - and it certainly DOES make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;I tried both with and without power on, and it&#x27;s more effortless with power for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard and get roughly 8 shaves if that helps anyone?</li>
            <li> sure it glides and its realy soft&lt;br /&gt;l l l l l l l l l l l l l</li>
            <li> The shave its very close and leaved my skin so smooth! i love it. the price was decent but totally pleased with my purchased.</li>
            <li> I just Love it , the ease with i can get comfortable and smooth Shave is very good.&lt;br /&gt;i used to use mach 3 and Philips norello before , but this is miles ahead of what Mach 3 is .&lt;br /&gt;i m not sure how long the batter will last though as i just started using it</li>
            <li> I own Proglide and this one (proglide Power)too... i didnt like the vibration option in this.... i personally feel it does nothing... after few secs u feel Formication.... i like it bcoz its more thick and nice to hold!!! if u get this for the price of  proglide , go for it, else dont waste ur money... remember, both have the same blades....</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this razor since normally I don&#x27;t like the quad and higher blade razors.  This one however has a single blade edger on the top edge of it.  Excellent!  Overall very good shave.</li>
            <li> This special edition razor is just the best razor available on the market. The five blades gently does the work done and doesn&#x27;t damage your skin.</li>
            <li> I got this for my bro as his first razor and likes it. He doesn&#x27;t have much to compare it to but it works.</li>
            <li> Great razor. The vibrations are very pleasant to the skin, clean shave for 1 pass. Blades are also qualitative, no skin irritation. Battery goes a long way. But you can stand for razor would have done more.</li>
            <li> Best razor. Been having it for a while now, I just buy new blades for it. Completely satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> I really have a fever for this razor, even more than a fever for cowbell.  When I first opened this package I knew that I was in for a real treat, the gold color and the fancy packaging make me feel like a true Olympian.  It&#x27;s not really clear to me that there&#x27;s any actual difference between the gold version and the others, but I feel like a million bucks when I shave with this.  After shaving with the razor I have the speed of Usain Bolt and the focus of a 20m air pistol shooter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;- Gold&lt;br /&gt;- Power button is fairly straightforward&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- Have to fight people off who visit and want to use my razor</li>
            <li> Excellent razor, very smooth and comfortable. Heads are expensive (typical for Gillette), but Gillette is all i ever use. Not sure about the power feature (i&#x27;m not used to it). I&#x27;m used to the old fashioned manual way. Guess i&#x27;m an old fog...</li>
            <li> A very smooth shave, marred only by the size of the razor, which makes it difficult to get into small corners of your face like around your mouth and ears.</li>
            <li> My husband had the usual complaints most husbands and men in general have; sensitive skin and their unhappy with their razor/razors. Bought this as part of his stocking stuffer gifts this past Christmas 2012 and a pack of cartridge refills, figuring if he didn&#x27;t like it, I&#x27;d have a nice razor for my legs :). Well I am happy to say ; he loved it. The reason I know this is when we went out to the store he wanted to check this brands shaving creme for sensitive skin; we came home with their brand shaving creme; it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li> I am impressed with the way this works.  Shaves as normal non-vibrating razor and gets a closer shave.  Rinses under water without issue and works well.  Vibration is high speed but very subtle.  No snags or anything different than a normal shave.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been happy with my shave quality for several years. I went from using an electric to disposables. Disposable razors are less expensive than cartridge systems, but I never realized they aren&#x27;t as good quality. I&#x27;ve tried a variety of different brands and always tended towards the more expensive of the disposables.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It started by reading a few articles online from serious shaving experts. They all recommend a safety razor - but you have to be very careful and it takes much longer. What I noticed was that almost all of them said they use the Gillette Fusion when they travel. Other sites explained that there is a difference between the quality of blades used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I gave it a try and was I ever surprised! It really was noticeably smoother than the shave I was getting with regular disposables. My girlfriend loved it. And although I thought the vibrating handle was a gimmick and either wouldn&#x27;t help or might actually increase the likelihood of being cut, it turned out I was completely wrong! It really does help get a closer shave. I&#x27;ve tried with the vibration switch off and on - and on makes a big difference. I&#x27;m really glad I made this change!</li>
