            <li>Good product, non stinging.</li>
            <li>I used this product for many years, and have loved the ease, how well it removed my mascara, and the price.  </li>
            <li>I use these on my dogs eyes  and my own but for me I have to rinse, all these things leave a residue.  </li>
            <li>As an effective product, I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>These work so much better and don&#x27;t leave any kind of &#x27;film&#x27; on your eyelashes or eyelids.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these pads for a couple of years now and for the most part, I love them.  </li>
            <li>It is adorable.  </li>
            <li>No scraping, nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I love these eye pads.</li>
            <li>Better results using soap and water and a wash cloth.  </li>
            <li>I need more than one pad to remove makeup from one eye, but I like them,</li>
            <li>and I did truly love it, so</li>
            <li>They are not oily, they get most of the makeup off, and they are convenient.</li>
            <li>Favorite eye make up remover.</li>
            <li>I love these eye makeup remover pads.  </li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>But it did well taking off mostly everything else.</li>
            <li>The container stays sealed and it is just more convenient than caring remover and makeup pads.  </li>
            <li>I will say that when I used to buy these pads in the store they seemed to work a bit better</li>
            <li>I have used these for years and love them.  </li>
            <li>Reasonalbe price :)</li>
            <li>I love this product and have used it for years.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t have a strong smell which is even better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried to switch to creams, but they all irritate my eyes and don&#x27;t work any more easily than these.  </li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;m going back to using gentle unscented baby wipes, they are wonderful for taking off makeup and they are nice and thick.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Fixes eyeliner mistakes easily and neatly.</li>
            <li>but I love them to tuck in my purse to do mascara and around the eye clean up during a night out.</li>
            <li>These Almay Eye Makeup pads are amazing and are very gentle on my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Works good at removing makeup...makes my eyes a little irritated, but does a good job removing everything with just one pad</li>
            <li>Happy with this product and use it daily</li>
            <li>Would like having a travel size available.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the oil pads vs oil free</li>
            <li>I confirmed this by calling the Almay customer service line, 1-800-992-5629.  </li>
            <li>I uses these in the morning to clean my eyes.</li>
            <li>AND they are much more gentle on your eyes.</li>
            <li>They do a great job of removing eye makeup but they also come in very handy for wiping those little mistakes while putting on makeup, especially errant mascara marks under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have allergies or overly-sensitive skin, I just have mild irritation with some mascaras and products for my eyes, which is why I have used Almay for years.  </li>
            <li>I live on these !!!!</li>
            <li>just make sure to get the Almay oil free or if you have dry skin around the eyes and plan on only using it at night - the non oil free feels really nice - just oily</li>
            <li>Anyone using eye makeup need this to clean it off, so fast and gentle!!</li>
            <li>But overall, they are great at removing makeup and are very gentle and soft on the eyes and lashes.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes or make them tear up like a lot of other products and at a good price.</li>
            <li>Does a great job at taking off heavy eye makeup after a night out!</li>
            <li>Works okay for regular make-up.</li>
            <li>This item does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>Love these non oily pads that never sting and remove eye make up overall very well</li>
            <li>but I much prefer the Blum Naturals pads.</li>
            <li>I was looking for gentle eye makeup remover pads that don&#x27;t rip all my eyelashes out.  </li>
            <li>I really like these eye makeup remover pads.</li>
            <li>I had eye lid surgery and after the healing process I was very leery to put anything on eyes.</li>
            <li>Takes all eye make-up off gently.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them and don&#x27;t know what I would do without them!</li>
            <li>As a whole, value plus product, I give it 4 stars.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like these pads.</li>
            <li>these are much, much cheaper 120 pads for $5</li>
            <li>I really like these makeup remover pads for traveling.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product, really gets all the eyeliner off and mascara too.</li>
            <li>it took my makrup off really well and didn&#x27;t sting.</li>
            <li>Works really well and doesnt hurt your eyes which is always an issue for me.</li>
            <li>Thanks to OC Girl for comfirming my suspicion that they changed the formula.</li>
            <li>they dry out very quickly.  </li>
            <li>When my Costco stock of this finally was used up, I made sure to replace with the same brand.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s supposed to be hard to remove, but this makes it much more manageable!</li>
            <li>Not as good as the kind with an oil base.</li>
            <li>It takes a little more rubbing with waterproof mascara, but let&#x27;s face it, that&#x27;s the nature of the beast.</li>
            <li>They work very well and are not messy to use.  </li>
            <li>I had extra containers stored, so I didn&#x27;t run out right away after they changed the formula.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without these on my vanity</li>
            <li>This new formula bothers my eyes.</li>
            <li>Starting using when i wore contact lenses as its pil free and still using 10 years later.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive eyes.  </li>
            <li>My eyes are very sensitive to lots of things and these don&#x27;t cause a problem.  </li>
            <li>They offered to refund my money, but what I really want is a bottle of the old formula back!!!  </li>
            <li>These pads burn my eyes and they aren&#x27;t particularly sensitive.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t remove my mascara completely</li>
            <li>He sits and waits for me to clean the boogers out of his little eyes every morning.  </li>
            <li>But when I finally ran out, I couldn&#x27;t figure out all of the new containers as they weren&#x27;t as clearly labeled as before.  </li>
            <li>These are much better to use in place of rough eye lid scrubs which are super expensive ($15 for 30 pads)</li>
            <li>(Again, I used these for a ve-ry long time, there is no comparison with the quality of the older ones to this one. )</li>
            <li>Occasionally, when I receive a new container the top few pads are dried out.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m willing to hold my breath and pay for them although I do think they&#x27;re a little over-priced (no matter where you buy them).</li>
            <li>These pads are smaller first of all, and also have ingredients I&#x27;m less found of and a distinctive smell to them.</li>

            <li> so I&#x27;m willing to hold my breath and pay for them although I do think they&#x27;re a little over-priced (no matter where you buy them).</li>
            <li> These pads are smaller first of all, and also have ingredients I&#x27;m less found of and a distinctive smell to them.</li>
            <li> and I find that this makeup remover gives back a little moisture to the skin while removing dark, waterproof mascara and liner quickly and thoroughly.</li>
            <li> They must have changed the formula because these pads are very dry, and even if slightly moist at first...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m finding these a little drying to use as my main make-up remover</li>
            <li> The fact that they are thin makes it easier to clean up after under-eye smudges without removing all mascara and starting over again.</li>
            <li> I just leave the last pad I use at night in the container and that takes off the little smudge left over the next day.  </li>
            <li> I typically have very dry sensitive skin around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I purchased a new tub late last year and it stung my eyes!</li>
            <li> The only downside is that they sometimes burn my eyes and it takes quite a few to get all the mascara off, they are very tiny wipes.  </li>
            <li> not too much gunk left behind.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought it was my imagination, but the irritation kept getting worse with each use.  </li>
            <li> The simple solution of fix however is to just set the container upside down and it evenly distributes the liquid.</li>
            <li> They work well but could definitely be a little larger.</li>
            <li> Mascara takes a little extra rubbing and pad.</li>
            <li> and I like that they&#x27;re little individual pads.  </li>
            <li> The formula is gentle on my sensitive eyes, however the pads are fairly small and very thin, thus they don&#x27;t get everything entirely off the eye lid.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t irritate my eye area as some other products do.</li>
            <li> I wake up and have black down my eyes.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t have an oily mess when I&#x27;m done, need no cotton balls, and</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the formula has changed, but I do tend to have a little mascara mark in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Almay makeup remover pads take off my eye makeup without any trouble.</li>
            <li> Using the oil-free product is just too harsh</li>
            <li> I can stick a few in a plastic bag and in my makeup case and don&#x27;t have to worry when I&#x27;m traveling.</li>
            <li> Finally, I called the company to find out why something I had been using for years was now irritating my eyes.</li>
            <li> I dont want to get eye wrinkles JUST from rubbing too hard or with harsh items around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Usually take 2 however.</li>
            <li> If they are too wet they can cause sting so just be wary of that.</li>
            <li> Usually I have to use 2 for each eye to get all my makeup off!</li>
            <li> Pads were too small and thin.</li>
            <li> This works well without irritating my eyes.  </li>
            <li> They are so thin and flimsy that you have to use 2 at a time.</li>
            <li> I got it to remove water-proof mascara, however, and it&#x27;s just absolutely useless for that.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> but theyre very thin.</li>

            <li> Almay makeup remover pads take off my eye makeup without any trouble. They don&#x27;t irritate my eye area as some other products do. This is a good value and I always buy them here.</li>
            <li> I have been using these of years - best product on the market!</li>
            <li> These pads remove makeup well but I much prefer the Blum Naturals pads. These pads are smaller first of all, and also have ingredients I&#x27;m less found of and a distinctive smell to them. They work well but could definitely be a little larger.</li>
            <li> They burn my eyes, however all the makeup does come off</li>
            <li> These work great but theyre very thin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these pads for a couple of years now and for the most part, I love them.  Occasionally, when I receive a new container the top few pads are dried out.  The simple solution of fix however is to just set the container upside down and it evenly distributes the liquid.</li>
            <li> I was looking for gentle eye makeup remover pads that don&#x27;t rip all my eyelashes out.  These Almay Eye Makeup pads are amazing and are very gentle on my eyes.  The only downside is that they sometimes burn my eyes and it takes quite a few to get all the mascara off, they are very tiny wipes.  But overall, they are great at removing makeup and are very gentle and soft on the eyes and lashes.</li>
            <li> I used this product for many years, and have loved the ease, how well it removed my mascara, and the price.  When my Costco stock of this finally was used up, I made sure to replace with the same brand.  They must have changed the formula because these pads are very dry, and even if slightly moist at first...they dry out very quickly.  (Again, I used these for a ve-ry long time, there is no comparison with the quality of the older ones to this one. ) I am very disappointed and would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Works good at removing makeup...makes my eyes a little irritated, but does a good job removing everything with just one pad</li>
            <li> Removes make stubborn eye make up.  Usually take 2 however.</li>
            <li> I use these on my dogs eyes  and my own but for me I have to rinse, all these things leave a residue.  But the dog loves them.  He sits and waits for me to clean the boogers out of his little eyes every morning.  It is adorable.  Too bad the vet won&#x27;t put a sample in a microscope and treat him for mange......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I digress.  These work, and are inexpensive.  No scraping, nice and smooth.  very thin, thus the price.  not too much gunk left behind.  good for the road.</li>
            <li> I typically have very dry sensitive skin around my eyes.  Using the oil-free product is just too harsh and I find that this makeup remover gives back a little moisture to the skin while removing dark, waterproof mascara and liner quickly and thoroughly.</li>
            <li> These pads burn my eyes and they aren&#x27;t particularly sensitive.  I need to rinse them out immediately after use.  They work, but I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I love these eye pads. I used to use a cotton swab with baby oil or water to remove mascara. These work so much better and don&#x27;t leave any kind of &#x27;film&#x27; on your eyelashes or eyelids. I sent some to my sister and she loves them, too.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.  Had to use several pads to remove eye makeup.  Better results using soap and water and a wash cloth.  Should have read the reviews.</li>
            <li> Happy with this product and use it daily</li>
            <li> Works okay for regular make-up. I got it to remove water-proof mascara, however, and it&#x27;s just absolutely useless for that.</li>
            <li> I really like these eye makeup remover pads. They don&#x27;t leave a burning feeling on your skin and don&#x27;t burn your eyes. Would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive eyes.  This works well without irritating my eyes.  Takes some rubbing but not a lot.  Would like having a travel size available.  As it is I take some out and put in a zip lock bag.</li>
            <li> These work great for removing mascara and dose not burn my eyes at all .</li>
            <li> The formula is gentle on my sensitive eyes, however the pads are fairly small and very thin, thus they don&#x27;t get everything entirely off the eye lid.</li>
            <li> Saves a lot of washcloth cleaning.</li>
            <li> I need more than one pad to remove makeup from one eye, but I like them, cause it&#x27;s comfy to take them to trips for just in case</li>
            <li> I had eye lid surgery and after the healing process I was very leery to put anything on eyes. My daughters recommended me to use the liquid of this product and I did truly love it, so I tried the pads and I am so hooked! Anyone using eye makeup need this to clean it off, so fast and gentle!!</li>
            <li> They are not oily, they get most of the makeup off, and they are convenient. If they are too wet they can cause sting so just be wary of that. You have to scrub a bit but I don&#x27;t have an oily mess when I&#x27;m done, need no cotton balls, and these are portable. I can stick a few in a plastic bag and in my makeup case and don&#x27;t have to worry when I&#x27;m traveling.</li>
            <li> I wear contacs and everything stings.  Love these non oily pads that never sting and remove eye make up overall very well</li>
            <li> I wish that the pads went furthur. I need one for each eye when I remove makeup. Mascara takes a little extra rubbing and pad.</li>
            <li> Takes all eye make-up off gently. Non oily formula is perfect if you&#x27;re a contact lens wearer!</li>
            <li> Favorite eye make up remover. Starting using when i wore contact lenses as its pil free and still using 10 years later.</li>
            <li> And I also feel it does not take my mascara off well.  I wake up and have black down my eyes.  Not impressed.</li>
            <li> Pads were too small and thin.</li>
            <li> makes make up removal for teen easier</li>
            <li> Product did not work.  Smeared make-up around the eye area, did not actually remove it.  RETURNED!</li>
            <li> These are the best eye makeup remover pads that exist, and I have been using them for over a decade. These pads do not burn your eyes, and they do not leave a greasy residue like some others do. They are great at getting off eyeshadow, eyeliner, and mascara. It takes a little more rubbing with waterproof mascara, but let&#x27;s face it, that&#x27;s the nature of the beast. It&#x27;s supposed to be hard to remove, but this makes it much more manageable! I highly recommend them and don&#x27;t know what I would do without them!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t remove my mascara completely</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without these on my vanity so I&#x27;m willing to hold my breath and pay for them although I do think they&#x27;re a little over-priced (no matter where you buy them). As an effective product, I&#x27;d give it 5 stars. As a whole, value plus product, I give it 4 stars. They do a great job of removing eye makeup but they also come in very handy for wiping those little mistakes while putting on makeup, especially errant mascara marks under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like these pads. They are so thin and flimsy that you have to use 2 at a time. Usually I have to use 2 for each eye to get all my makeup off! So, I&#x27;m going back to using gentle unscented baby wipes, they are wonderful for taking off makeup and they are nice and thick.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love these eye makeup remover pads.  They work very well and are not messy to use.  I don&#x27;t feel any residue on my eye after use.</li>
            <li> Love these. They remove eye makeup in a second. No scrubbing needed. Fixes eyeliner mistakes easily and neatly. I live on these !!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m finding these a little drying to use as my main make-up remover but I love them to tuck in my purse to do mascara and around the eye clean up during a night out.</li>
            <li> Does a great job at taking off heavy eye makeup after a night out! Doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes or make them tear up like a lot of other products and at a good price.</li>
            <li> These are much better to use in place of rough eye lid scrubs which are super expensive ($15 for 30 pads) these are much, much cheaper 120 pads for $5 AND they are much more gentle on your eyes. I dont want to get eye wrinkles JUST from rubbing too hard or with harsh items around my eyes. I uses these in the morning to clean my eyes. They work great.</li>
            <li> This remover did not remove my eyeliner, and the fumes from the chemicals made my eyes water and sting a bit. But it did well taking off mostly everything else.</li>
            <li> I really like these makeup remover pads for traveling.  The container stays sealed and it is just more convenient than caring remover and makeup pads.  I will say that when I used to buy these pads in the store they seemed to work a bit better - I don&#x27;t know if the formula has changed, but I do tend to have a little mascara mark in the morning.  I just leave the last pad I use at night in the container and that takes off the little smudge left over the next day.  All in all a good product that doesn&#x27;t irritate my eye or my contacts!</li>
            <li> This eye makeup remover works well and I like that they&#x27;re little individual pads.  They don&#x27;t have a strong smell which is even better.</li>
            <li> Best eye makeup remover that I have found in years. just make sure to get the Almay oil free or if you have dry skin around the eyes and plan on only using it at night - the non oil free feels really nice - just oily</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to switch to creams, but they all irritate my eyes and don&#x27;t work any more easily than these.  My eyes are very sensitive to lots of things and these don&#x27;t cause a problem.  The fact that they are thin makes it easier to clean up after under-eye smudges without removing all mascara and starting over again.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, really gets all the eyeliner off and mascara too. does not hurt eyes or sting</li>
            <li> it took my makrup off really well and didn&#x27;t sting. But after i took my makeup off my eyes kept watering and they we&#x27;re irritated. takes makeup off good but irritates my eyes</li>
            <li> I have used these for years and love them.  I prefer this non-oily version since the oil irritates my eyes.</li>
            <li> I prefer the oil pads vs oil free</li>
            <li> Good product, non stinging. Works really well and doesnt hurt your eyes which is always an issue for me. Reasonalbe price :)</li>
            <li> This item does exactly what it says. Only con is the smell.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work!! Even if you use like 3 pads</li>
            <li> They changed the formula!  I confirmed this by calling the Almay customer service line, 1-800-992-5629.  I have been using Almay for years--I had extra containers stored, so I didn&#x27;t run out right away after they changed the formula.  But when I finally ran out, I couldn&#x27;t figure out all of the new containers as they weren&#x27;t as clearly labeled as before.  This new formula bothers my eyes. At first I thought it was my imagination, but the irritation kept getting worse with each use.  Finally, I called the company to find out why something I had been using for years was now irritating my eyes. Low and behold, they changed the formula on all of their make up removers.  They offered to refund my money, but what I really want is a bottle of the old formula back!!!  I don&#x27;t even have allergies or overly-sensitive skin, I just have mild irritation with some mascaras and products for my eyes, which is why I have used Almay for years.  Now, I&#x27;m in the market for another product.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have used it for years. I purchased a new tub late last year and it stung my eyes! Thanks to OC Girl for comfirming my suspicion that they changed the formula. Plus the pads are thinner than they used to be. So disappointed!</li>
            <li> Not as good as the kind with an oil base.</li>
