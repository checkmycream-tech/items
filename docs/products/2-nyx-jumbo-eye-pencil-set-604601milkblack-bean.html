    <ol>
            <li>These are great!!</li>
            <li>Great product!!</li>
            <li>Great eyeliner!</li>
            <li>The colors are great</li>
            <li>great color, but you can&#x27;t sharpen these....</li>
            <li>Arrived on time, bought these pencils online, because the milk pencil is very popular and is always out of stock at my nearby stores.</li>
            <li>Both smudge a lot but while they&#x27;re still in place look good</li>
            <li>I honestly ordered these to try them because Talia Joy recommended them in one of her makeup tutorial videos.</li>
            <li>love these pens yes a plus plus it goes great underneath your eye shadows</li>
            <li>I love NYX lipsticks too!</li>
            <li>I simply love these pencils!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>The pigments are great and it goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>It has great color pay off and smooth consistency.</li>
            <li>Nice eye crayons.</li>
            <li>Kind of has a creamy texture but haven&#x27;t noticed any creasing.</li>
            <li>does glide very easily</li>
            <li>Most of the ones I liked were over 25 a piece.  </li>
            <li>So far so good!!!</li>
            <li>as a primer on the lids, lightly blending with your finger when applying light/ bright colors to cause them to show up</li>
            <li>Glides on easily too!</li>
            <li>I need more NYX jumbo eye pencils.</li>
            <li>I see why many MUA&#x27;s swear by it.  </li>
            <li>I use these mostly on my water line</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t help to stay but the white one is perfect</li>
            <li>Love and will purchase again when I run out.</li>
            <li>It would have been better if the shades were muted.</li>
            <li>They last all day and the prie is great!</li>
            <li>but i wasn&#x27;t really sure what to use.  </li>
            <li>love this.</li>
            <li>I love that the NYX Jumbo Pencils go on so smooth!</li>
            <li>need more practice with it.  </li>
            <li>I like both of these eye pencils - they are jumbo size and so easy to use - creamy and fantastic!  </li>
            <li>Both colors lend easily to making eye shadows pop, as well as blending in and making an easy gradient and smoky eye if you wish.</li>
            <li>They are soft and bright.</li>
            <li>I would recommend getting this product WITH the NYX pencil sharpener (it has a side that will fit these pencils).</li>
            <li>but I wish it were a bit creamier/more smooth.</li>
            <li>and it was so smooth and creamy...</li>
            <li>These pencils are really popular, they make eyeshadows pop really well.</li>
            <li>I like that it is smooth and creamy though.</li>
            <li>this pencil arrived, I was not disappointed; it was in perfect condition and really delivered the standard of quality I expect from NYX.&lt;br</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s soft on your eyes and face, couldn&#x27;t give them a better review, definitely my favorite makeup tool.</li>
            <li>it was such a good deal to get both of them, i couldn&#x27;t resist.  </li>
            <li>Nice only when you use an eye primer</li>
            <li>/&gt;They can be nice if you apply thinly enough to avoid creasing/smudging.</li>
            <li>I was looking for one that would go one smooth without damaging my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how much I love these, they&#x27;ve instantly become staples for my makeup collection.</li>
            <li>I gave this a 4 star rating because it really creases on your eyelids!</li>
            <li>I love the milky white color.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery too!</li>
            <li>But I was able to take it in to my local Ulta and exchange it for a sealed one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE</li>
            <li>I love using Milk on my waterline and inner corners to make my eyes look wider and really pop.</li>
            <li>... I bought these because NYX products ROCK just as much as the higher ends</li>
            <li>but this is easy, I think because it&#x27;s so big.</li>
            <li>The black is also great if you want a larger eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Very pigmented.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast as promised (-:</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>The actual product is fantastic, the problem I had was the packaging.</li>
            <li>yet they are sooo much</li>
            <li>White makes the eyes look larger, they have a very smooth creamy feel to them</li>
            <li>Milk can be used as a highlight, (under brow, top of cheek bone and down the nose).</li>
            <li>They stay on all day, and the color is vibrant.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>The other pencil was completely fine though.</li>
            <li>The milk and black bean went on so smoothly and really made my eye shadows pop.</li>
            <li>I always had trouble lining the inner bottom eyelid or getting it dark enough and these pencils are the best...</li>
            <li>and WOW these are my new must-haves.</li>
            <li>a professional Makeup Artist, I am always on the hunt for versatile product.</li>
            <li>What I really love about Milk is using it as an eyeshadow base, especially when using bright shadow.</li>
            <li>I forgot that it came with Black Bean as well, and at first I was a little worried I wouldn&#x27;t be able to find a use for it</li>
            <li>Excited to try for Halloween makeup and everyday as well.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t seem to use the black one right even putting a primer on water line</li>
            <li>My first NYX purchase was the dark brown jumbo eye pencil</li>
            <li>The white is nice and brightening (I like to use it as a primer or base for my eyeshadows, or to just use by itself to make me look wide awake) and the black is nice for smokey looks (something I don&#x27;t do very often considering I wear glasses and the shade clashes with my skin tone).</li>
            <li>Black Bean also delivered on the standard of quality as the color was very vibrant and pretty; unfortunately it is far too dark for me and overwhelms my eyes</li>
            <li>I really like these pencils, the only reason that I am giving it a 4 is because it creases ever so slightly.</li>

            <li> I wanted the jumbo pencil in milk for a long time because I&#x27;ve always heard such rave reviews about it and without having any luck finding it in stores anywhere I decided to try amazon</li>
            <li> I have not tried the black one because of the creasing of the white one.</li>
            <li> I use these for my water line, the black for a smudgy sultry look and the white to make my eyes pop.</li>
            <li> I use Black Bean on my eyelids and Milk on my waterline as well as occasionally using as a primer for my shadows.</li>
            <li> The white was too white and the black was too black!  </li>
            <li> it only took a few days to get to my house.  </li>
            <li> For those that are curious as to how they work</li>
            <li> They work very well as a base which was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> Ive used the milk pencil as a base to make my eyeshadow pop even more...</li>
            <li> Maybe if I apply less product to the lids.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t tried the black yet.  </li>
            <li> the black bean does slightly crease up after a few hours.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of trouble with them smudging and traveling around the eye area though.</li>
            <li> Was pretty disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Not sure if they responded.</li>
            <li> You can sharpen them so that they&#x27;re a little thinner/more pointed, but they aren&#x27;t for a subtle look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and this is cheaper and better than some of the expensive base out there.  </li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t use it as a primer or a base like some people use, i only use the white for my tear duct.  </li>
            <li> Black Bean can be used the same, as a base on the lid before dark smoky eye, or liner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a hard time doing liner on my waterline</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s me that has a hard time applying it.  </li>
            <li> I melted the white one to use as a base for some Halloween makeup</li>
            <li> /&gt;Use the seal was broken on the Milk pencil.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Fast shipping. I need more NYX jumbo eye pencils.</li>
            <li> love these pens yes a plus plus it goes great underneath your eye shadows it make them pop in color</li>
            <li> I went to Ulta and compared every designer brand of eye pencil.  I was looking for one that would go one smooth without damaging my sensitive skin.  Most of the ones I liked were over 25 a piece.  I was blown away when I found these.  They are soft and bright. My daughter was complaining of the same thing so I let her try mine and she wanted a set too so these are for her.  I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Nice eye crayons. Very pigmented. And help blend and deepen shadows when used with them.</li>
            <li> I always had trouble lining the inner bottom eyelid or getting it dark enough and these pencils are the best...I see why many MUA&#x27;s swear by it.  Glides on easily too!</li>
            <li> I use these mostly on my water line and I have no complaints. They stay on all day, and the color is vibrant.</li>
            <li> I like both of these eye pencils - they are jumbo size and so easy to use - creamy and fantastic!  I love NYX lipsticks too!</li>
            <li> They work very well as a base which was exactly what I was looking for. I melted the white one to use as a base for some Halloween makeup my make up stayed on all night.</li>
            <li> Nice only when you use an eye primer but I can&#x27;t seem to use the black one right even putting a primer on water line doesn&#x27;t help to stay but the white one is perfect</li>
            <li> I wanted the jumbo pencil in milk for a long time because I&#x27;ve always heard such rave reviews about it and without having any luck finding it in stores anywhere I decided to try amazon and WOW these are my new must-haves. I love using Milk on my waterline and inner corners to make my eyes look wider and really pop. I forgot that it came with Black Bean as well, and at first I was a little worried I wouldn&#x27;t be able to find a use for it but I tried it out on my waterline and it&#x27;s amazing. I&#x27;ve always had a hard time doing liner on my waterline but this is easy, I think because it&#x27;s so big. The pigments are great and it goes on smooth. Kind of has a creamy texture but haven&#x27;t noticed any creasing. I can&#x27;t tell you how much I love these, they&#x27;ve instantly become staples for my makeup collection.</li>
            <li> I am not a MUA.  Just wear makeup once in a while and this is cheaper and better than some of the expensive base out there.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard a lot about the jumbo eye pencils from NYX and decided to finally check them out for myself.&lt;br /&gt;As a professional Makeup Artist, I am always on the hunt for versatile product. NYX Jumbo Eye Pencil is just that! It has great color pay off and smooth consistency. Milk can be used as a highlight, (under brow, top of cheek bone and down the nose). What I really love about Milk is using it as an eyeshadow base, especially when using bright shadow. Black Bean can be used the same, as a base on the lid before dark smoky eye, or liner. I would recommend getting this product WITH the NYX pencil sharpener (it has a side that will fit these pencils). Love and will purchase again when I run out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d personally rate it 4.5 stars. The colors are great but I wish it were a bit creamier/more smooth. My first NYX purchase was the dark brown jumbo eye pencil and it was so smooth and creamy... The white is nice and brightening (I like to use it as a primer or base for my eyeshadows, or to just use by itself to make me look wide awake) and the black is nice for smokey looks (something I don&#x27;t do very often considering I wear glasses and the shade clashes with my skin tone).</li>
            <li> So far so good!!! Ive used the milk pencil as a base to make my eyeshadow pop even more... Shipping was fast as promised (-:</li>
            <li> The white was too white and the black was too black!  It would have been better if the shades were muted.</li>
            <li> I use the white for my waterline and innercorner. The black is also great if you want a larger eyeliner. I put my makeup on at  6 in the morning and it stays on all day even at 9 at night. These are great!!</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast. The milk and black bean went on so smoothly and really made my eye shadows pop. A little goes a very long way. The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars was because the milk pencil was already opened but I didn&#x27;t send it back because it didn&#x27;t look used at all.</li>
            <li> These pencils are really popular, they make eyeshadows pop really well. I have a lot of trouble with them smudging and traveling around the eye area though. You can sharpen them so that they&#x27;re a little thinner/more pointed, but they aren&#x27;t for a subtle look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They can be nice if you apply thinly enough to avoid creasing/smudging.</li>
            <li> without a doubt the smartest makeup purchase I&#x27;ve made. Both colors lend easily to making eye shadows pop, as well as blending in and making an easy gradient and smoky eye if you wish. White makes the eyes look larger, they have a very smooth creamy feel to them that&#x27;s soft on your eyes and face, couldn&#x27;t give them a better review, definitely my favorite makeup tool.</li>
            <li> great color, but you can&#x27;t sharpen these....</li>
            <li> I gave this a 4 star rating because it really creases on your eyelids! You have to have a primer and even then it creases slighty. I like that it is smooth and creamy though. I love the milky white color. I have not tried the black one because of the creasing of the white one. It creased about 1-2 hours after I applied. I will keep playing with this product to see if I can get it to not crease. Maybe if I apply less product to the lids. I do like it for inner eye highlight.</li>
            <li> Both smudge a lot but while they&#x27;re still in place look good haha. Was pretty disappointed with this product. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> The actual product is fantastic, the problem I had was the packaging. One pencil came unwrapped and the lid was cracked. The pencil part didn&#x27;t look like it had been tampered with so I still use it. The other pencil was completely fine though.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, bought these pencils online, because the milk pencil is very popular and is always out of stock at my nearby stores. Excited to try for Halloween makeup and everyday as well.</li>
            <li> I really like these pencils, the only reason that I am giving it a 4 is because it creases ever so slightly. I think though it&#x27;s a fixable solution (I&#x27;ll just have to play around and see).</li>
            <li> I use these for my water line, the black for a smudgy sultry look and the white to make my eyes pop. They last all day and the prie is great! Fast delivery too!</li>
            <li> I honestly ordered these to try them because Talia Joy recommended them in one of her makeup tutorial videos. i had been wanting something white to put in my tear duct but i wasn&#x27;t really sure what to use.  i don&#x27;t use it as a primer or a base like some people use, i only use the white for my tear duct.  haven&#x27;t tried the black yet.  it was such a good deal to get both of them, i couldn&#x27;t resist.  it only took a few days to get to my house.  love this.</li>
            <li> I love that the NYX Jumbo Pencils go on so smooth! I use Black Bean on my eyelids and Milk on my waterline as well as occasionally using as a primer for my shadows. Great product!!</li>
            <li> I just the white one as an eye primer.</li>
            <li> These two pencils are a must have for any makeup geek such as myself. For those that are curious as to how they work it is simply this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use the white pencil (Milk)  as a primer on the lids, lightly blending with your finger when applying light/ bright colors to cause them to show up better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use the seal was broken on the Milk pencil. I contacted the seller....Not sure if they responded. I did not see anything. But I was able to take it in to my local Ulta and exchange it for a sealed one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Try depotting the pencils and applying with a brush.</li>
            <li> does glide very easily but I think it&#x27;s me that has a hard time applying it.  need more practice with it.  the black bean does slightly crease up after a few hours. I was using it like an eye liner .</li>
            <li> ... I bought these because NYX products ROCK just as much as the higher ends yet they are sooo much cheaper!&lt;br /&gt;The MILK pencil is a staple in my make up stash; I use it as a primer, liner, w/e.&lt;br /&gt;When this pencil arrived, I was not disappointed; it was in perfect condition and really delivered the standard of quality I expect from NYX.&lt;br /&gt;The Black Bean also delivered on the standard of quality as the color was very vibrant and pretty; unfortunately it is far too dark for me and overwhelms my eyes so I&#x27;ll be giving this one away and ordering a lighter color in the future.</li>
            <li> I simply love these pencils!</li>
            <li> Adorei, são lindos e originais. A entrega foi muito rápida e o preço vale a pena, porque comprei dois pelo preço de 1. Recomento muito.</li>
            <li> I am definitely repurchasing MILK. Great eyeliner! Does well in the waterline</li>
