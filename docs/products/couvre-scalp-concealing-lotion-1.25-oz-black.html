            <li>This has to be the easiest and best concealer to use.  </li>
            <li>I am using the product, but is not the best.</li>
            <li>Just thinning this works perfect.</li>
            <li>/&gt;A couple of things you do have to watch out for is that since the product is very good at staining, you should take care not to rub it on clothing, which can happen if your not paying close attention.</li>
            <li>I use this product all the time and it works great.</li>
            <li>and it works great.  </li>

            <li>and I am SURE</li>
            <li>bought this product from Amazon to help me with my thinning hair on top.</li>
            <li>There are tricks for sure to get the best results, but one can try out different ways of using the product.</li>
            <li>Better products out there</li>
            <li>Love this item.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for many years.  </li>
            <li>The seller was great also, shipped items quickly, answered questions quickly, an overall great experience.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, good seller.</li>
            <li>Washes out easily with soap and water.</li>
            <li>I did combine this product with hair fiber powder (Nanogen) to get fantastic results, I cant believe how good these products work and how real the results are.</li>
            <li>It comes out with shampoo, but not so easy in just water</li>
            <li>However, it washes out easy and doesn&#x27;t stain anything</li>
            <li>Has strong smell as well.  </li>
            <li>so you can go swimming with it and still look fine.  </li>
            <li>thought it&#x27;s mostly light colored.  </li>
            <li>Its great for me masking my alopecia, dont fall with water, in the pool or spa, only fall the product with shampoo or soap.</li>
            <li>Completely bald &amp;#34;probably not so good.</li>
            <li>Good solution until permanent hair regrowth is avail in the future.</li>
            <li>no one noticed i had product on even in full sun.</li>
            <li>I have full coverage of hair</li>
            <li>I use this product because I have mild Alopecia.</li>
            <li>It  is glossy on bold spot.</li>
            <li>Product works great for a slight bald spot.</li>
            <li>When you blend this into your scalp, it really does make a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find it useful for me.</li>
            <li>Right product, on time, and right price.</li>
            <li>This stuff comes right off and does not stay on as stated.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this product was very nicely crafted and I can definitely recommend it for daily use!</li>
            <li>Does exactly what I wanted!, a product that covers the scalp and looks real.</li>
            <li>My hair isn&#x27;t too long, but i don&#x27;t think it will work great with short or shaved hair.</li>
            <li>so this is mostly for being out in public, on stage, and helping to cover up that shinny bald spot from thinning while you use another treatment for your hair regrowth.  </li>
            <li>In fact, the first time I used it people in my family were wondering where my balding spot went, and were amazed at how well it concealed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price I think shouldn&#x27;t be $20, more like $10, but it does last quite awhile if you know how to use it sparingly.  </li>
            <li>With so many bald spots in on my scalp, this products is the only item I can use to let me wear my hair out with confidence.  </li>
            <li>Expensive but works great!</li>
            <li>nice thing I liked about this product was that it does last a long time, even with daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Been using this product for a long time, haven&#x27;t found anything better.  </li>
            <li>You pretty much have to wash it out nightly otherwise</li>
            <li>As other have mentioned, it does rub off very easily, even after being &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; for hours.  </li>
            <li>It is virtually undetectable, easy to apply and makes you look younger.  </li>
            <li>Just gently rub in w applicator a dab at a time like you would covering a blemish.</li>
            <li>I guess if someone put a magnifying glass to my head they could tell It wasn&#x27;t real,</li>
            <li>but I literally had my wife and sister look very close</li>
            <li>and they couldn&#x27;t tell it wasn&#x27;t my real scalp color and hair</li>
            <li>Fast arrival.</li>
            <li>very helpful to my aging hair covers up the unwanted color in my head  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very oily, reminds me of oil based paint.  </li>
            <li>It works really well.  </li>
            <li>If you just have a thinned out spot in the back of your head like me, a little more than the size of a pea will do fine for concealing your hair loss.w months.  </li>
            <li>If you just have a thinned out spot in the back of your head like me, a little more than the size of a pea will do fine for concealing your hair loss.</li>
            <li>it really makes me look half bald, but with this product it makes it look like I have no thinning and a full head of hair!</li>
            <li>I find its best to use it after a bath and after I have dried my hair a little bit but not when its completely dry.  </li>
            <li>It spreads easily when the hair is a little damp.</li>
            <li>I feel more confidence as I go about my day and that says a lot about such a little product.</li>
            <li>It wont work for someone who clearly has bald patches.  </li>
            <li>I find it easiest to put it on with my finger or a soft water color paintbrush.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use much to make a big difference</li>
            <li>Use it frequently.</li>
            <li>and I think it is well worth the money spent.  </li>
            <li>However, if it does get wet over time it will start to come out and look funny</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m told it could take up to 2 years to see any major improvement.  </li>
            <li>One of these is that it really helped to get other items to assist with the application of</li>
            <li>Also  it does not completely dry up</li>
            <li>I also doubt that this tube will last as long as the older tube of the same size--maybe that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s &#x27;dilluted.&#x27;</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product did not smear when a little wet or after a full day out.</li>

            <li> /&gt;The product did not smear when a little wet or after a full day out.</li>
            <li> Topik does not stay on , Dermmatch not the right color, Fumore too dark in auburn!!!</li>
            <li> It does have a little bit of an odor to it, but it&#x27;s not unpleasant at all, and very subtle when you first put it on.  </li>
            <li> However, it appears that the black lotion has been reformulated as it does not cover as well as the old formula (that used to come in the white and brown tube).</li>
            <li> Also, the product never seemed to dry</li>
            <li> I use the Couvre lotion almost daily, unless I don&#x27;t have to go out at all, then I can let my hair down..</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that this product can get everywhere if your not careful.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it everyday, only once in a way, for parties, occasions, etc.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also decided to try using some other treatments recommended to me to see if it will help.  </li>
            <li> For one, the stuff does come out of the hair onto other things it comes into contact with.  </li>
            <li> I have a big thin spot on the back of my head.  </li>
            <li> This product&#x27;s price is too expensive for it&#x27;s worth, it&#x27;s too messy to use.</li>
            <li> my pillow covers are turn black</li>
            <li> I have used this product (black Couvre masking lotion)  for over 20 years.  </li>
            <li> It does not cake up or flake in any weather, hot or cold.</li>
            <li> Also it will not weigh down your hair or make it feel stiff as this goes on your scalp not your surrounding hair.</li>
            <li> little shine require after useing</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m concerned might leave color streaks down my shirt!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product on and off for a few years.  </li>
            <li> I buy one once every few months.  </li>
            <li> Believe me, DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY on this one.</li>
            <li> it is just the individual hairs are thin and brittle.</li>
            <li> But a few tricks can help avoid doing that, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Messy and it rubs off unless hairspray is used to set the lotion.</li>
            <li> Helps cover up the small spots of hair missing.</li>
            <li> You have to put very very little on the sponge and keep re-applying.  </li>
            <li> Is too small for the price</li>
            <li> I can use it every day but just to lazy to do it.  </li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t believe the bad review and try this product out, ((I wet the sponge and then, squeeze out the water, then apply a small amount of Couvre on the sponge and press it firmly on my scalp and blend it in where needed-BE CAREFUL in the Front of the hair line not to pass your thinning hairline</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I have longer hair, but it was hard to get it on my scalp without getting all over my roots and the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li> I recommend this if you at least have &amp;#34;some&amp;#34; hair.</li>
            <li> This product does cover this up and makes my hair appear thick.</li>
            <li> It will not make you hair fuller but it covers the thin spot so they are not noticeable.</li>
            <li> I started to thin at age 23 and now at 37</li>
            <li> Having a thyroid condition that makes my hair thin is not fun :(</li>
            <li> Reviews about users having globs run down their head are idiots.</li>
            <li> Also it is expensive for the amount you get.</li>
            <li> plus it smells bad...</li>
            <li> so it isn&#x27;t so ugly.  </li>
            <li> so stupid i use this for shoes</li>
            <li> If this product is discontinued, I would be miserable!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Product works great for a slight bald spot. Have been using for 1.5+ yrs without issues. Just gently rub in w applicator a dab at a time like you would covering a blemish. No additional balding or side effects observed. Reviews about users having globs run down their head are idiots. I don&#x27;t work for and am not affiliated in any way with the manufacturer. Washes out easily with soap and water. Good solution until permanent hair regrowth is avail in the future.</li>
            <li> This is a godsend for thinning areas. It will not make you hair fuller but it covers the thin spot so they are not noticeable. You can then can use some fiber type product  to get the fullness you want. I find it easiest to put it on with my finger or a soft water color paintbrush. The wind can blow  and your scalp won&#x27;t show. Also it will not weigh down your hair or make it feel stiff as this goes on your scalp not your surrounding hair.</li>
            <li> Helps cover up the small spots of hair missing. You can notice my hair is gone. My hair isn&#x27;t too long, but i don&#x27;t think it will work great with short or shaved hair.</li>
            <li> I use this product all the time and it works great. It does not cake up or flake in any weather, hot or cold. It stays flexiable in or out of the pool.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what I wanted!, a product that covers the scalp and looks real. I have hair, it is just thinning so in bright lights or the sun it really makes me look half bald, but with this product it makes it look like I have no thinning and a full head of hair! no one noticed i had product on even in full sun. I did combine this product with hair fiber powder (Nanogen) to get fantastic results, I cant believe how good these products work and how real the results are. I guess if someone put a magnifying glass to my head they could tell It wasn&#x27;t real, but I literally had my wife and sister look very close and they couldn&#x27;t tell it wasn&#x27;t my real scalp color and hair and I am SURE no one else will notice. So don&#x27;t believe the bad review and try this product out, ((I wet the sponge and then, squeeze out the water, then apply a small amount of Couvre on the sponge and press it firmly on my scalp and blend it in where needed-BE CAREFUL in the Front of the hair line not to pass your thinning hairline or it will show like a blotch on your head.))</li>
            <li> This has to be the easiest and best concealer to use.  It comes out with shampoo, but not so easy in just water so you can go swimming with it and still look fine.  However, if it does get wet over time it will start to come out and look funny so this is mostly for being out in public, on stage, and helping to cover up that shinny bald spot from thinning while you use another treatment for your hair regrowth.  I&#x27;ve been using this product on and off for a few years.  I started to thin at age 23 and now at 37 I have a big thin spot on the back of my head.  My doctor suspects the thinning is a result of me being a celiac, but since I have an uncle that went bald on my dad&#x27;s side it could be MPB (time will tell).  After several months of diet and vitamins I have started to regrow some hair thought it&#x27;s mostly light colored.  I&#x27;m told it could take up to 2 years to see any major improvement.  I&#x27;ve also decided to try using some other treatments recommended to me to see if it will help.  In the meantime I&#x27;m using this to help conceal it some so it isn&#x27;t so ugly.  When you blend this into your scalp, it really does make a huge difference.  In fact, the first time I used it people in my family were wondering where my balding spot went, and were amazed at how well it concealed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this product isn&#x27;t without it&#x27;s drawbacks.  For one, the stuff does come out of the hair onto other things it comes into contact with.  You don&#x27;t want a woman running her hand through your hair as it will come off on her hand.  You also want to wash this out in the evening before bed, because it will get on your pillow.  However, it washes out easy and doesn&#x27;t stain anything so it&#x27;s not a big deal if it does get on your pillow.  It does have a little bit of an odor to it, but it&#x27;s not unpleasant at all, and very subtle when you first put it on.  The price I think shouldn&#x27;t be $20, more like $10, but it does last quite awhile if you know how to use it sparingly.  I buy one once every few months.  If you just have a thinned out spot in the back of your head like me, a little more than the size of a pea will do fine for concealing your hair loss.w months.

            <li> Covering scalp&lt;br /&gt;Only little shine require after useing</li>
            <li> Been using this for years, works for me.</li>
            <li> This product&#x27;s price is too expensive for it&#x27;s worth, it&#x27;s too messy to use. Believe me, DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY on this one. If you want an alternative for this lousy product, you might as well use a non-fueled household BB-Q charcoal:)</li>
            <li> I have been using Couvre for about 4 years now and I think it is well worth the money spent.  You don&#x27;t need to use much to make a big difference and I typically only order a tube twice a year.  I have worn the product while I am swimming and it works great.  Great product in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use this product for years and would be lost without it.  I&#x27;m so glad I discovered that Amazon.com carries it and hopefully never have to worry about running out of it! Thank you for the competitive pricing too!!</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a long time, haven&#x27;t found anything better.  I use it together with Toppik fibers.</li>
            <li> I rate my experience A.  Right product, on time, and right price.</li>
            <li> I use this product because I have mild Alopecia. I have full coverage of hair it is just the individual hairs are thin and brittle. This product does cover this up and makes my hair appear thick. Do not buy if you have bald spots! The only complaint I have is that this product can get everywhere if your not careful. Also it is expensive for the amount you get.</li>
            <li> With so many bald spots in on my scalp, this products is the only item I can use to let me wear my hair out with confidence.  The only downfall is that if you rub or scratch your hair, you will get dye on your fingers, but your spot is still covered.  As a swimmer, it does not come off. I wish it would last in between shampoos. If this product is discontinued, I would be miserable!!!!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, good seller. Good product, as described.</li>
            <li> I am using the product, but is not the best. Maybe I need to learn how to use it.</li>
            <li> Very nice item. Works great. Fast arrival. Pleasant transaction.</li>
            <li> Arrived as listed. Thank you</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for last several years.  Two problems.  It  is glossy on bold spot. Also  it does not completely dry up</li>
            <li> Its great for me masking my alopecia, dont fall with water, in the pool or spa, only fall the product with shampoo or soap.</li>
            <li> This product is great, improves appearance like you would not believe.  It is virtually undetectable, easy to apply and makes you look younger.  The seller was great also, shipped items quickly, answered questions quickly, an overall great experience.</li>
            <li> This stuff comes right off and does not stay on as stated. I will not purchase again. The stuff in the spray can lasts longer.</li>
            <li> Amazing product that goes hand in hand with Toppik! Both together are a wonder product that boosts self-esteem that repairs a fragile ego.</li>
            <li> Expensive but works great! I recommend this if you at least have &amp;#34;some&amp;#34; hair. Just thinning this works perfect. Completely bald &amp;#34;probably not so good.</li>
            <li> excellent product, fast shipping</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I have longer hair, but it was hard to get it on my scalp without getting all over my roots and the rest of my hair. It left my hair waxy and sticky. Also, the product never seemed to dry and I would get it all over my hands any time I touched my hair/head.</li>
            <li> Well i saw the video of couvre and i thought i found a solution of my baldness but its not happen when i use it my pillow covers are turn black my towel are turn black.peoples are also found out that use some kind of paint.I don&#x27;t find it useful for me.</li>
            <li> PLEASE RATE my view if you like it! I use the Couvre lotion almost daily, unless I don&#x27;t have to go out at all, then I can let my hair down..lol!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product from Amazon to help me with my thinning hair on top. Couvre does a neat trick and it does it well: it helps to darkens the scalp, giving the illusion of hair by obscuring my underlying, bright scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product did not smear when a little wet or after a full day out. I feel more confidence as I go about my day and that says a lot about such a little product. There are tricks for sure to get the best results, but one can try out different ways of using the product. One of these is that it really helped to get other items to assist with the application of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One nice thing I liked about this product was that it does last a long time, even with daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of things you do have to watch out for is that since the product is very good at staining, you should take care not to rub it on clothing, which can happen if your not paying close attention. But a few tricks can help avoid doing that, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product was very nicely crafted and I can definitely recommend it for daily use!</li>
            <li> very helpful to my aging hair covers up the unwanted color in my head  amazing wonderful and helpful. needs some change in your hair  purchase  couvre masking loton</li>
            <li> Works ok! Better products out there</li>
            <li> It did not blend well with my hair. It was too noticeable.</li>
            <li> Love this item. Use it frequently. Covers gray hair and does not rub off on clothing. Will order again after I use all.</li>
            <li> Bring back Auburn!!! Topik does not stay on , Dermmatch not the right color, Fumore too dark in auburn!!! Bring back Auburn masking lotion!!!!</li>
            <li> Is too small for the price plus it smells bad...</li>
            <li> Works as supposed to but it&#x27;s very oily, reminds me of oil based paint.  Has strong smell as well.  As other have mentioned, it does rub off very easily, even after being &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; for hours.  You pretty much have to wash it out nightly otherwise will leave color on everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t used it during rain but I&#x27;m concerned might leave color streaks down my shirt!</li>
            <li> Messy and it rubs off unless hairspray is used to set the lotion. Even then I wouldn&#x27;t want to be caught in a rain storm without an umbrella. Having a thyroid condition that makes my hair thin is not fun :(</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years.  It works really well.  I bought it at the same time as Toppik but I found that did not work. The trick is to apply it to the scalp whereby both the scalp and the hair are the same color.  It works when you have thinning hair.  It wont work for someone who clearly has bald patches.  You need to figure out how to use it well. I find its best to use it after a bath and after I have dried my hair a little bit but not when its completely dry.  It spreads easily when the hair is a little damp. You have to put very very little on the sponge and keep re-applying.  I don&#x27;t use it everyday, only once in a way, for parties, occasions, etc.  I can use it every day but just to lazy to do it.  Its a great product for someone with thinning hair but as I said, once you have bald patches, its usefulness will reduce.</li>
            <li> I have used this product (black Couvre masking lotion)  for over 20 years.  However, it appears that the black lotion has been reformulated as it does not cover as well as the old formula (that used to come in the white and brown tube). It is not as viscous, spreads thinner, and does not &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; as well.  I also doubt that this tube will last as long as the older tube of the same size--maybe that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s &#x27;dilluted.&#x27;</li>
            <li> so stupid i use this for shoes</li>
