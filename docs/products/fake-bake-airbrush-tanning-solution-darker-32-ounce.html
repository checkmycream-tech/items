            <li> Instant deep dark results.</li>
            <li> but it fades when dry.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it lasts as long as other brands I used..</li>
            <li> goes on nice brown color,only lasts about 3 days.not at all long-lasting like other solutions, I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product, says airbrush but is actually a self tanner lotion and too thick to be sprayed.</li>
            <li> This turned people green</li>
            <li> Just a little ticked that I just bought it 2 weeks ago and the price dropped $6  bad timing</li>
            <li> I have been using fake bake for years and using the airbrush tanning solution for over a year now.  </li>
            <li> fake bake adjusts to the pigments in your skin, so it doesn&#x27;t make you orange!</li>
