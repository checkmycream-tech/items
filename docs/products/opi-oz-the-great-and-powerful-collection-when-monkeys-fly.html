            <li>This will take forever, but the results are AWESOME.</li>
            <li>The multi sized glitter was awesome!</li>
            <li>Excellent product.</li>
            <li>I love this polish!!</li>
            <li>I loved it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gorgeous.</li>
            <li>it looks good over any basecoat and any color.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with the quality.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love the sparkle &amp; shine!</li>
            <li>Love this glittery polish!  </li>
            <li>Using it on the tips of the nails gives the illusion of dipping your fingers in gold flake, nice effect.  </li>
            <li>what a great fit and color - so many sparkles</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply</li>
            <li>I think this looks best when used just on one nail - like the big toe or ring finger...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s got pieces of glitter that are more like confetti</li>
            <li>Love OPI&lt;br /&gt;LoVe</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m so glad I found somewhere to buy it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The sparkles look even better at night.</li>
            <li>and then these flakes over the top gives an even deeper layered effect to the dipped look.  </li>
            <li>Then, top this with a couple of coats of top coat.</li>
            <li>love it - just what I was looking for</li>
            <li>the Oz collection is fabulous!</li>
            <li>Each time I have used this top coat, I end up taking it off as the pieces of sparkle lift and bother me.</li>
            <li>Gorgeous pastilles of pure shine....</li>
            <li>This was my first time with the product as my own.</li>
            <li>I used it over black and it looks great!</li>
            <li>but it is very pretty!</li>
            <li>It looked great &amp; lasted a really long time.</li>
            <li>Great long wearing polish.  </li>
            <li>Surprisingly, once you put a clear coat over it, it&#x27;s not got too much texture, so that&#x27;s a huge plus.</li>
            <li>I used this over a pink polish and it looked great.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The big gold pieces do tend to peel off but just make sure to put a top coat on it</li>
            <li>and once I left I had to buy this polish to use on my own nails and do my family and friends nails.  </li>
            <li>the name alone makes you laugh</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty glitter</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this color, but the pieces of sparkle are big and pretty but tend to life and peel and are a nuisance.</li>
            <li>I originally saw this color on my boyfriend&#x27;s sister and she was wearing it over a soft gold.</li>
            <li>The polish is magical and fun adding a little sparkle to my pedi/mani.</li>
            <li>them on your nail because they don&#x27;t really paint on that well.</li>
            <li>the Outcome!&lt;br /&gt;Fabulous!&lt;br /&gt;Glamorous, elegant, classy, mysterious,</li>
            <li>This is a great polish for an accent nail, you have to add several layers and &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; just the bigger pieces of glitter to lay down</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Even the extra time removing it from my nails was worth it.</li>
            <li>It was a special - limited time thing</li>
            <li>Working with large glitter can take a short time to get used to for those who don&#x27;t often work with this type of polish, but it is very forgiving.  </li>
            <li>but i wish the bigger gold flakes would they flat, besides that its fine.</li>
            <li>This is not small glitter.  </li>

            <li> This is not small glitter.  </li>
            <li> The trick with this one is to lay down a couple of base coats, and then layer several (at least 3) coats of When Monkey&#x27;s Fly on top.  </li>
            <li> I appreciate the long lasting OPI color always.</li>
            <li> and it is long lasting.  </li>

            <li> I usually have to use a file.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a tad hard to get off.</li>
            <li> A ncie touch when you want a little sparkle on a statement nail, or when you have white nails as a base.</li>
            <li> This is BIG glitter; it&#x27;s ugly don&#x27;t buy it.  </li>
            <li> Worst nail polish in the whole world.  </li>
            <li> I found it difficult to remove some of the glitter, but not overly difficult or impossible.  </li>
            <li> and it won&#x27;t be as bad!</li>

            <li> I think this looks best when used just on one nail - like the big toe or ring finger...it&#x27;s got pieces of glitter that are more like confetti and you have to &amp;#34;arrange&amp;#34; them on your nail because they don&#x27;t really paint on that well. I use an orange stick to get them just where I want them. Surprisingly, once you put a clear coat over it, it&#x27;s not got too much texture, so that&#x27;s a huge plus.</li>
            <li> Love OPI&lt;br /&gt;LoVe OZ&lt;br /&gt;LOVe the Idea&lt;br /&gt;LOVE the Outcome!&lt;br /&gt;Fabulous!&lt;br /&gt;Glamorous, elegant, classy, mysterious, BLING!&lt;br /&gt;As OZ would do!</li>
            <li> I love this polish!! It was a special - limited time thing so I&#x27;m so glad I found somewhere to buy it!&lt;br /&gt;The big gold pieces do tend to peel off but just make sure to put a top coat on it and it won&#x27;t be as bad!</li>
            <li> I originally saw this color on my boyfriend&#x27;s sister and she was wearing it over a soft gold. I loved it so I decided to purchase it myself. I used it over black and it looks great! The sparkles look even better at night. They have a rainbow effect. I would definitely recommend this nail polish!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gorgeous. Tons of sparkle. But it&#x27;s a tad hard to get off. I usually have to use a file.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the sparkle &amp; shine! I used it on the tips of my nails only to create a bolder effect. It looked great &amp; lasted a really long time.</li>
            <li> Polish was just as shown, I&#x27;ve been trying to find this discontinued color! Exactly what I was looking for. ;)</li>
            <li> I like this polish a lot.  It has large gold and multicolored flakes in a clear base.  I used this over a pink polish and it looked great.  Working with large glitter can take a short time to get used to for those who don&#x27;t often work with this type of polish, but it is very forgiving.  I found it difficult to remove some of the glitter, but not overly difficult or impossible.  Great long wearing polish.  I&#x27;m planning to try this over black next.  Using it on the tips of the nails gives the illusion of dipping your fingers in gold flake, nice effect.  Using gold on the tips of the nail and then these flakes over the top gives an even deeper layered effect to the dipped look.  I&#x27;ve gotten lots of compliments and may do a youtube video using this polish.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The trick with this one is to lay down a couple of base coats, and then layer several (at least 3) coats of When Monkey&#x27;s Fly on top.  Then, top this with a couple of coats of top coat. This will take forever, but the results are AWESOME.</li>
            <li> A ncie touch when you want a little sparkle on a statement nail, or when you have white nails as a base.</li>
            <li> Worst nail polish in the whole world.  The glitter in the bottle will not come out.  You can only get one or two to come out at a time.  This is not small glitter.  This is BIG glitter; it&#x27;s ugly don&#x27;t buy it.  I like the smal glitter polishes. ;P</li>
            <li> love it - just what I was looking for</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty glitter i like it but i wish the bigger gold flakes would they flat, besides that its fine.</li>
            <li> The polish is magical and fun adding a little sparkle to my pedi/mani. I appreciate the long lasting OPI color always.</li>
            <li> Love this glittery polish!  Even the extra time removing it from my nails was worth it. The multi sized glitter was awesome!</li>
            <li> I had a pedicure done and once I left I had to buy this polish to use on my own nails and do my family and friends nails.  Everyone loves the chunky glitter, especially as a pedicure.</li>
            <li> Sparkles and Shine! Oh MY! the Oz collection is fabulous! the name alone makes you laugh, OPI is number 1 with me. what a great fit and color - so many sparkles and you know a girl can never have enough sparkle..... Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Very satisfied with the quality. Very easy to apply and it is long lasting.  This was my first time with the product as my own. I had used it for holidays when visiting  a friend.</li>
            <li> In \\&quot;when monkeys fly,\\&quot; the big gold glitter curls up like a taco. Does not lay flat on the nail. Please look for swatches and reviews before purchasing</li>
            <li> Gorgeous pastilles of pure shine....it looks good over any basecoat and any color. Put them on your toes and wear gold sandals and dazzle the world!</li>
            <li> This is a great polish for an accent nail, you have to add several layers and &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; just the bigger pieces of glitter to lay down but it is very pretty!</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of the OPI sparkle polishes. I wanted to love this color, but the pieces of sparkle are big and pretty but tend to life and peel and are a nuisance. Each time I have used this top coat, I end up taking it off as the pieces of sparkle lift and bother me.</li>
