            <li>If you&#x27;re buying this product because you&#x27;re already awesome at painting your nails, and you want to do some cool nail art--go for it!  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to see what else you have product wise.</li>
            <li>Good luck...</li>
            <li>I just love this stuff it works great</li>
            <li>I can make my toes all cute!</li>
            <li>IT IS MY FAVORITE PEEL-OFF PRODUCT!</li>
            <li>So glad to have found Liquid Palisade now!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>If you are doing any kind of nail art where you might get polish on your finger</li>
            <li>After peeling it off, the edge of the polish is not always nice.</li>
            <li>If you do your own nails, you have to have this.</li>
            <li>Many believe it to be the BEST top coat available (sold on amazon as well)A must have after you finish your polish application.</li>
            <li>Good stuff, but avoid touching your fingers together.</li>
            <li>I was really excited when I discovered this product, and I still think it&#x27;s a great idea, but it just didn&#x27;t do the job for me.  </li>
            <li>Words of caution: the rubber sticks to itself very easily, so make sure your fingers don&#x27;t touch, or both strips of rubber will start peeling off when you try to pull your fingers apart.  </li>
            <li>My order was lost in the mail, I emailed them and they shipped a replacement free of charge that day!</li>
            <li>I found out by the time I ordered another box that the brush seemed to have been updated and it worked even better.  </li>
            <li>I have always wanted to do more with my nails beside just painting them and this allows me to do just that.</li>
            <li>Also, the nail polish that ends up on top of the rubber barrier DOES NOT peel off with the rubber.  </li>
            <li>I love this product [[ASIN:B005G7Y8D2</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough great things about this product...a genius must have invented it!  </li>
            <li>I will continue to work with it to see if I can get better at peeling it off and incorporating it into my nail art designs.</li>
            <li>working more with nails.</li>
            <li>(PHENOMENAL PRODUCT)</li>
            <li>-ever&amp;quot;I don&#x27;t happen to think it works any better than the palisades.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Needs to be packed better for shipping.</li>
            <li>, I was able to nudge it toward the skin and off the side of the nail without any problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Would love it....</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I got this product!</li>
            <li>This would be a great product if the application brush didn&#x27;t completely fall apart.</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m on the TOPIC of a great nail products, another must have(sold on Amazon as well!)is Quimica nail hardener, for natural nails.</li>
            <li>The idea of the product is good but to really maximize results</li>
            <li>Kind of a wired product, but useful.</li>
            <li>super easy!  </li>
            <li>a five-year-old child painted the hand that you write with, and the hand that you don&#x27;t write with looks okay at best), DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY.  </li>
            <li>Peals off easy.  </li>
            <li>but it sure helps with designs and clean application of polish.</li>
            <li>Not as easy to work with as it looks...</li>
            <li>The idea is great,but after two applications the application brush ,which needs to be fine point,completely became fan tip.</li>
            <li>Try to apply with \\&quot;fine precision\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>It took more time to apply it than it was worth.</li>
            <li>I now enjoy doing my nails at home</li>
            <li>It applies smoothly and peels off smoothly.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s such a great idea, and while it does take some getting used to, once you get the hang out it, I PROMISE you</li>
            <li>it created a perfect, straight line for the french.  </li>
            <li>It was just featured on the Katie show and all of the ladies were raving about it!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use and quick - bottom line</li>
            <li>makes putting on polish quick and easy</li>
            <li>I dip that in polish remover and use it to clean up the edges of my nails.</li>
            <li>The product has an interesting odor, but it works very well.</li>
            <li>I really love this product and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Overall good idea, but</li>
            <li>2nd time use not so good.  </li>
            <li>my original review was written 4+ yrs ago, they have improved many plus, there are NEW liquid latex products for nail art, sponging, stamping, etc.</li>
            <li>A steady hand is needed and would be better put on by someone</li>
            <li>It is incredibly easy to use...simply apply it around your nail bed and when it dries (dries super fast) you can shape it just how you want it...</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and helps with clean up of nail polish around nail bed, could probably get the same job done with elmers glue.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend a top coat called Seche Vite (straightens things out and dries lightening FAST!</li>
            <li>This product definitely works as advertised and basically an amazing product concept</li>
            <li>has always been a challenge with more clean up around the edges (big time waster).</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t peel right.</li>
            <li>the Quimica posts)It may help you decide if it&#x27;s right for you.</li>
            <li>I think this is such a great extra thing to have when it comes to doing your nails.</li>
            <li>Good for nail art also, but things get slightly tricky if you&#x27;re trying to accomplish overlapping lines.</li>
            <li>With Liquid Palisades, using my right or left hand, my self done manicures are perfect everytime and no more worries and time</li>
            <li>It applies easily enough, dries quickly, and peels off easily, but the paint job you&#x27;re left with is by no means better than one you could do yourself.  </li>
            <li>I first saw it on TV on the Today show when Kim Kardashian was oohing and ahhing over it.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering more in the future!</li>
            <li>found that it all doesn&#x27;t come off at first but</li>

            <li>Liquid Palisade - Better Than Nail Polish Remover - French Manicure - Nail Art - Polish Perfection]]</li>
            <li>I love this product but it&#x27;s overpriced especially for the size....</li>
            <li>Make sure you wipe the extra nail polish off the brush before you start to polish.  </li>
            <li>you get waaaayyyy more &amp; it only costs 11 on amazon!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>review that follows is exactly what I thought of this product at the time....</li>
            <li>A couple times on my first use, I got some on the nails along with the side of skin</li>
            <li>and it gets into those hard to reach places you can&#x27;t get with a brush or what you use its amazing!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier to try to keep the polish off in the first place.(or use</li>
            <li>so much so that now when I rarely do go to a even high end salon for a manicure,I see mistakes.</li>
            <li>I own both and Mess</li>
            <li>Too much</li>
            <li>I really recommend it for the nail art lovers 👌</li>
            <li>One of Palisades suggested uses, would be to create a line of demarcation for FRENCH tips.(nice way to keep the french tip line nice and even )</li>
            <li>But I am right handed and therefore using my left hand to paint my right</li>
            <li>Blue Tack is sold at most major Home depot type stores.</li>
            <li>a life-long, never going to use it up, tub for $10 on Amazon and put it in your own empty polish container and get the same exact product/effect.</li>
            <li>clean up brush is for), its for nail art that gets polish all over your fingers such as spongeing gradients or water marbling.</li>
            <li>I love French Manicures - especially in the summer.  </li>
            <li>The thin brush makes it very easy to apply just where you want it and just the right amount.  </li>
            <li>It dries pretty quickly which is a good thing but CAN be a bad thing.</li>
            <li>it does the same exact thing..</li>
            <li>I use it for my first coat as I&#x27;m always neater with the second coat.  </li>
            <li>It removes easily, and protects your nails from messy polish cleanup.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind this product is NOT meant for getting the perfect manicure if you are sloppy (that&#x27;s what acetone and small</li>
            <li>It took some getting used to because I was using too much nail polish and not enough liquid palisade.</li>
            <li>Came two days early.</li>
            <li>This is a good idea in theory, but it is so expensive.</li>
            <li>The advice always given to students is to polish up to, but not into the cuticle area,(a picture within a frame if you will) use fast light strokes starting with the first stroke down the center.</li>
            <li>Also this would be a great thing for teenagers, slumber parties, stocking stuffer and a lot of other random times.  </li>
            <li>This helped keep clean ups simple round my cuticle area.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t used directly on painted nails for a design with a second nail color</li>
            <li>the product is kind of difficult.</li>
            <li>Liquid latex even comes in almost the exact same shade of purple as well as a bunch of other colors.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t last very long and drys out quickly so honestly a lot gets wasted definitely not worth</li>
            <li>Not everyone can use Quimica if you have sensitive nail beds or have recently removed acrylic nails, or your natural nail beds are in rough shape, it may cause you discomfort.</li>
            <li>/execuction recently entering the nail polish world, unfortunately that same nail polish world figured out the source product pretty quickly (which is vastly cheaper).  </li>
            <li>but the brush is so thin and fine that I think I&#x27;d be successful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> so much so that now when I rarely do go to a even high end salon for a manicure,I see mistakes.</li>
            <li> I own both and Mess</li>
            <li> Too much</li>
            <li> I really recommend it for the nail art lovers 👌</li>
            <li> One of Palisades suggested uses, would be to create a line of demarcation for FRENCH tips.(nice way to keep the french tip line nice and even )</li>

            <li> I love French Manicures - especially in the summer.  </li>
            <li> The thin brush makes it very easy to apply just where you want it and just the right amount.  </li>
            <li> It dries pretty quickly which is a good thing but CAN be a bad thing.</li>
            <li> it does the same exact thing..</li>
            <li> I use it for my first coat as I&#x27;m always neater with the second coat.  </li>
            <li> It removes easily, and protects your nails from messy polish cleanup.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind this product is NOT meant for getting the perfect manicure if you are sloppy (that&#x27;s what acetone and small</li>
            <li> It took some getting used to because I was using too much nail polish and not enough liquid palisade.</li>
            <li> Came two days early.</li>
            <li> This is a good idea in theory, but it is so expensive.</li>
            <li> The advice always given to students is to polish up to, but not into the cuticle area,(a picture within a frame if you will) use fast light strokes starting with the first stroke down the center.</li>
            <li> Also this would be a great thing for teenagers, slumber parties, stocking stuffer and a lot of other random times.  </li>
            <li> This helped keep clean ups simple round my cuticle area.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used directly on painted nails for a design with a second nail color</li>
            <li> the product is kind of difficult.</li>
            <li> Liquid latex even comes in almost the exact same shade of purple as well as a bunch of other colors.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t last very long and drys out quickly so honestly a lot gets wasted definitely not worth</li>
            <li> Not everyone can use Quimica if you have sensitive nail beds or have recently removed acrylic nails, or your natural nail beds are in rough shape, it may cause you discomfort.</li>
            <li> /execuction recently entering the nail polish world, unfortunately that same nail polish world figured out the source product pretty quickly (which is vastly cheaper).  </li>
            <li> but the brush is so thin and fine that I think I&#x27;d be successful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It not only works for regular polish, but works over dry polish, too, for the nail art my daughters and their friends like to do all the time.</li>
            <li> will last a long time, cost is maybe 4.99?</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s pretty obvious the price is ridiculous and there are cheaper options.</li>
            <li> It was hard to make a straight line-it kept getting on my nail.</li>
            <li> Try &amp;quot;BLUE TACK&amp;quot; it has uses like hanging posters on walls without nails etc.(sounds strange)</li>
            <li> however, if your going to waste money, I&#x27;d rather you only dump 4.99 instead of the 25.00 plus; as bad as the blue tack works, it however is better than the palisades!</li>
            <li> Cuts my total prep time in half.</li>
            <li> My little girl had a blast with this because we was making all kinds of silly shapes and with different colors she thought is was really cool.</li>
            <li> it does what it&#x27;s expected to do</li>
            <li> other then just your nails.</li>
            <li> No More simply doesn&#x27;t do the job as well.</li>
            <li> but you have to be very careful how you put it on.  </li>
            <li> I still say it was not worth the price</li>
            <li> In my opinion, this is not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> but once it was &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; (dark purple color)</li>
            <li> Much cheaper and less frustrating!</li>
            <li> Palisades has come way down in price, plus, they&#x27;ve improved the brush.</li>

            <li> I would recommend buying liquid latex body paint then buying a empty nail polish bottle, and putting the latex in the bottle and using that as a polish base, there is 8x as much quality in the latex than the palisade 😊</li>

            <li> By the time we had used it about 20 times, the brush was getting a little difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> I like it, but I think is a little too expensive for the amount of liquid palisade you get.</li>
            <li> the solution is thin and hard to apply and peel off.</li>

            <li> Instead, you get this weird nail polish lip that sticks up off your nail, and when I tried to clip this away with nail clippers, it just made it look worse.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s purple, it&#x27;s obviously not ideal as a peel-off basecoat.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great customer service! My order was lost in the mail, I emailed them and they shipped a replacement free of charge that day! The product has an interesting odor, but it works very well. My nails have never looked so good!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and helps with clean up of nail polish around nail bed, could probably get the same job done with elmers glue.</li>
            <li> Smelly but works well!</li>
            <li> This helped keep clean ups simple round my cuticle area. Pricey for the size of product. If you plan on painting nails a lot i would just buy liquid latex ms brush it on and save the money for basically the same product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  I first saw it on TV on the Today show when Kim Kardashian was oohing and ahhing over it.  I ordered it then and my daughters and I thought it was amazing!  By the time we had used it about 20 times, the brush was getting a little difficult to use.  I found out by the time I ordered another box that the brush seemed to have been updated and it worked even better.  It not only works for regular polish, but works over dry polish, too, for the nail art my daughters and their friends like to do all the time. I will be ordering more in the future!</li>
            <li> I think this is such a great extra thing to have when it comes to doing your nails. It makes a big difference when painting because you can outline you skin and nails so if you are like me you aren&#x27;t getting it everywhere other then just your nails. My little girl had a blast with this because we was making all kinds of silly shapes and with different colors she thought is was really cool. Also this would be a great thing for teenagers, slumber parties, stocking stuffer and a lot of other random times.  I haven&#x27;t gotten to do my toes yet but this product will be great to have this summer with wearing sandals. I can make my toes all cute! I have always wanted to do more with my nails beside just painting them and this allows me to do just that.</li>
            <li> This would be a great product if the application brush didn&#x27;t completely fall apart. The idea is great,but after two applications the application brush ,which needs to be fine point,completely became fan tip. Try to apply with \\&quot;fine precision\\&quot;. For the price,I would wait until it is remedied.....</li>
            <li> The product works well but you have to be very careful how you put it on.  A steady hand is needed and would be better put on by someone else.&lt;br /&gt;I found that it all doesn&#x27;t come off at first but all in all it does what it&#x27;s expected to do and that is to avoid getting nail polish on&lt;br /&gt;your skin.</li>
            <li> I just love this stuff it works great</li>
            <li> Works great but stinks there are now cheaper less stinky ones out there.</li>
            <li> This product does work! It was just featured on the Katie show and all of the ladies were raving about it!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use and quick - bottom line: this is your answer to doing your own manicure to perfection!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter . A bit pricey, but she likes it .</li>
            <li> makes putting on polish quick and easy</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re buying this product because you&#x27;re already awesome at painting your nails, and you want to do some cool nail art--go for it!  If, however, you&#x27;re like me (it usually looks like a five-year-old child painted the hand that you write with, and the hand that you don&#x27;t write with looks okay at best), DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY.  I was really excited when I discovered this product, and I still think it&#x27;s a great idea, but it just didn&#x27;t do the job for me.  It applies easily enough, dries quickly, and peels off easily, but the paint job you&#x27;re left with is by no means better than one you could do yourself.  Words of caution: the rubber sticks to itself very easily, so make sure your fingers don&#x27;t touch, or both strips of rubber will start peeling off when you try to pull your fingers apart.  Also, the nail polish that ends up on top of the rubber barrier DOES NOT peel off with the rubber.  Instead, you get this weird nail polish lip that sticks up off your nail, and when I tried to clip this away with nail clippers, it just made it look worse.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I got this product! I used it for all of my manis... But then the brush fell apart. Then Liquid Palisade clumped around the aplicatator rod. Then I was disappointed because the product dried up IN THE BOTTLE. I had the bottle very tightly sealed, yet it still dried up. Big disappointment. Waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> It was hard to make a straight line-it kept getting on my nail. When I removed it I still had to touch up with polish remover. It took more time to apply it than it was worth.</li>
            <li> I love this product [[ASIN:B005G7Y8D2 Liquid Palisade - Better Than Nail Polish Remover - French Manicure - Nail Art - Polish Perfection]] for doing at home pedicures &amp; manicures too!  I have always struggled with shaky hands when I polish...this product is great because I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting the polish on my cuticles and skin.  It is incredibly easy to use...simply apply it around your nail bed and when it dries (dries super fast) you can shape it just how you want it...it is goof proof...super easy!  The thin brush makes it very easy to apply just where you want it and just the right amount.  I even did a french manicure myself...much less expensive than going to a nail salon...it created a perfect, straight line for the french.  I cannot say enough great things about this product...a genius must have invented it!  I now enjoy doing my nails at home and it saves me tons of $$$$.  [[ASIN:B005G7Y8D2 Liquid Palisade - Better Than Nail Polish Remover - French Manicure - Nail Art - Polish Perfection]]</li>
            <li> I love this product but it&#x27;s overpriced especially for the size.... I would recommend buying liquid latex body paint then buying a empty nail polish bottle, and putting the latex in the bottle and using that as a polish base, there is 8x as much quality in the latex than the palisade 😊 I hope this helps you money savers😍😉</li>
            <li> This is amazing! It applies smoothly and peels off smoothly. One thing is: after a while, the latex builds up on the brush and was too hard to pull off , so I ended up cutting the brush. It dries pretty quickly which is a good thing but CAN be a bad thing. I definitely recommend this. However, it&#x27;s pretty obvious the price is ridiculous and there are cheaper options. Mess No More by Mini Mani Moo is one example. I own both and Mess No More simply doesn&#x27;t do the job as well. The applicator is AWFUL with Mess No More and the solution is thin and hard to apply and peel off. Plus, if you get some on the nail, you can&#x27;t see it, so then it peels of water marble or whatever. Liquid Palisade, however, is purple, so you can fix it before you start on your design. Because it&#x27;s purple, it&#x27;s obviously not ideal as a peel-off basecoat. IT IS MY FAVORITE PEEL-OFF PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t last very long and drys out quickly so honestly a lot gets wasted definitely not worth this price be easier to just use glue.</li>
            <li> If you are doing any kind of nail art where you might get polish on your finger this is the stuff you need!! You can apply it with precision and get close to your cuticles.  It removes easily, and protects your nails from messy polish cleanup.</li>
            <li> This is a good idea in theory, but it is so expensive. While you are applying it, the opening to the little container gets clogged up with the liquid. After peeling it off, the edge of the polish is not always nice. I quit using this product and got a small art brush. I dip that in polish remover and use it to clean up the edges of my nails. Much cheaper and less frustrating!</li>
            <li> I love French Manicures - especially in the summer.  Liquid Palisade allows me to make perfect Frenchies every time. It took some getting used to because I was using too much nail polish and not enough liquid palisade. Make sure you wipe the extra nail polish off the brush before you start to polish.  I used to glop the nail polish on my fingers and then wipe off the extra. No need to do that now.  Wish this product had been around sooner! Thinking about all the hours I could have saved... So glad to have found Liquid Palisade now! This is a must have for everyone that does their own nails!</li>
            <li> The idea of the product is good but to really maximize results you can&#x27;t be a novice to nail art.  I will continue to work with it to see if I can get better at peeling it off and incorporating it into my nail art designs.</li>
            <li> Works great for me. Cuts my total prep time in half. I really love this product and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have been doing my own nails for over 25 years and practice does make perfect, so much so that now when I rarely do go to a even high end salon for a manicure,I see mistakes. But I am right handed and therefore using my left hand to paint my right has always been a challenge with more clean up around the edges (big time waster). With Liquid Palisades, using my right or left hand, my self done manicures are perfect everytime and no more worries and time wasted cleaning up nail bed. I wish this product was made years ago. In fact I wish I had thought of it. Genius. This product is here to stay. Look out big guys like Revlon and Loreal, somebody invented this product before you. Hurray for the little guy/girl inventor. Can&#x27;t wait to see what else you have product wise.</li>
            <li> Kind of a wired product, but useful. It takes sometime to learn how to properly use the product. Too much and it&#x27;s messy. Use to little and it doesn&#x27;t peel right. Overall good idea, but the product is kind of difficult.</li>
            <li> Eliminates the need to remove polish on your skin after you polish your nails. If you do your own nails, you have to have this.</li>
            <li> its not that whether i like it or not.. but $22 plus shipping for a tube of liquid body paint?? all you have to do is search for latex body paint.. it does the same exact thing.. you get waaaayyyy more &amp; it only costs 11 on amazon!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Ammonia-Free-Liquid-Latex-Paint/dp/B006GDEBB4/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1423376996&amp;sr&#x3D;1-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;liquid+body+paint</li>
            <li> Product worked great for 1st time use. 2nd time use not so good.  The opening started to gum up and when I tried to put the brush back in the bottle it would not go in.  This made the bristles on the brush fray out and now the brush is useless to use.&lt;br /&gt;Great product but how it is dispensed needs to go back to the drawing board.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money.</li>
            <li> UPDATE : my original review was written 4+ yrs ago, they have improved many plus, there are NEW liquid latex products for nail art, sponging, stamping, etc. Palisades has come way down in price, plus, they&#x27;ve improved the brush. However, this product is still one of the pricier ones they sell on Amazon. Type in &amp;quot;Liquid latex&amp;quot; and you&#x27;ll find a myriad of different products used for the nails...Read the reviews that may help in your selection.....Good luck...&lt;br /&gt;This review that follows is exactly what I thought of this product at the time.... I still say it was not worth the price they were asking 32.00 with ship...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve been in the nail industry (cosmetology)for 27 yrs. working more with nails. I&#x27;ve sat on my states licensing board. I&#x27;m a licensed instructor cosmetologist &amp;amp; manicurist. I&#x27;ve taught at an accredited cosmetology school for over 17 years.  I&#x27;m experienced with nail products.  One of Palisades suggested uses, would be to create a line of demarcation for FRENCH tips.(nice way to keep the french tip line nice and even ) Palisades is a &amp;quot;MAJOR disappointment&amp;quot; It&#x27;s not pliable, plus the brush falls apart. Another suggested use is to avoid getting polish on your cuticles.It&#x27;s much easier to try to keep the polish off in the first place.(or use an orange wood stick dip it in remover and push the mistakes off.) The advice always given to students is to polish up to, but not into the cuticle area,(a picture within a frame if you will) use fast light strokes starting with the first stroke down the center. I highly recommend a top coat called Seche Vite (straightens things out and dries lightening FAST! Many believe it to be the BEST top coat available (sold on amazon as well)A must have after you finish your polish application. While I&#x27;m on the TOPIC of a great nail products, another must have(sold on Amazon as well!)is Quimica nail hardener, for natural nails. (PHENOMENAL PRODUCT) Often Amazon sells the two items together. Not everyone can use Quimica if you have sensitive nail beds or have recently removed acrylic nails, or your natural nail beds are in rough shape, it may cause you discomfort. Please read my review.(on the Quimica posts)It may help you decide if it&#x27;s right for you. Two must haves seche Vite and Quimica.  Your nails get so strong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t care to try polishing techniques. Try &amp;quot;BLUE TACK&amp;quot; it has uses like hanging posters on walls without nails etc.(sounds strange) it&#x27;s the same concept as palisades, the blue gummy putty can be molded around the cuticle area to keep polish off, Blue Tack also can be used for a demarcation line for french polish, visit &amp;quot;You Tube&amp;quot; Type in how to do a ( French manicure)the narrator is British. Blue Tack is sold at most major Home depot type stores. One pkg. will last a long time, cost is maybe 4.99? I&#x27;m &amp;quot;Not&amp;quot; promoting this product &amp;quot;what-so-ever&amp;quot;I don&#x27;t happen to think it works any better than the palisades. however, if your going to waste money, I&#x27;d rather you only dump 4.99 instead of the 25.00 plus; as bad as the blue tack works, it however is better than the palisades! I believe all women can learn to keep polish off the cuticle areas. I brought the palisades in to let some of my students use it; it was unanimous, it&#x27;s useless!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like to write negative reviews ( look at others I have left) In my opinion, this is not worth the money.  The truth is, I would Not buy it again, even if the cost was less than a dollar. I recently found it in my nail drawer (after a lengthy time of NEVER using it)I tossed it, it was taking up space!</li>
            <li> I love it I do water marble and it gets into those hard to reach places you can&#x27;t get with a brush or what you use its amazing! Love it I really recommend it for the nail art lovers 👌</li>
            <li> I love this product! it&#x27;s such a great idea, and while it does take some getting used to, once you get the hang out it, I PROMISE you this will be your manicure must have!</li>
            <li> Great product. Needs to be packed better for shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen nail bloggers use this product for a while and decided that as a very sloppy nail painter, I must try it out.  I don&#x27;t think I will ever paint my nails without it again!  I use it for my first coat as I&#x27;m always neater with the second coat.  Peals off easy.  A couple times on my first use, I got some on the nails along with the side of skin but once it was &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; (dark purple color), I was able to nudge it toward the skin and off the side of the nail without any problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used directly on painted nails for a design with a second nail color but the brush is so thin and fine that I think I&#x27;d be successful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> This product definitely works as advertised and basically an amazing product concept/execuction recently entering the nail polish world, unfortunately that same nail polish world figured out the source product pretty quickly (which is vastly cheaper).  I take off one star because its outrageously priced for what is essentially liquid latex which you can buy a life-long, never going to use it up, tub for $10 on Amazon and put it in your own empty polish container and get the same exact product/effect. Liquid latex even comes in almost the exact same shade of purple as well as a bunch of other colors. Keep in mind this product is NOT meant for getting the perfect manicure if you are sloppy (that&#x27;s what acetone and small clean up brush is for), its for nail art that gets polish all over your fingers such as spongeing gradients or water marbling.</li>
            <li> Although it is pricey, this product is terrific.</li>
            <li> I like it, but I think is a little too expensive for the amount of liquid palisade you get.</li>
            <li> Would love it....but that price.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. It&#x27;s a bit pricey for what it is but it sure helps with designs and clean application of polish.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my daughter as a gift, and she uses it all the time. Paints her cuticles so the paint will not stick, since she says she&#x27;s sloppy applying polish. She loves the stuff and uses it every time she paints her nails, which is quite often.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, but avoid touching your fingers together. Came two days early. I like it</li>
            <li> Not as easy to work with as it looks...when doing nail art. Great around the cuticles! Good for nail art also, but things get slightly tricky if you&#x27;re trying to accomplish overlapping lines.</li>
            <li> Got here on time and works well.</li>
    </ol>
