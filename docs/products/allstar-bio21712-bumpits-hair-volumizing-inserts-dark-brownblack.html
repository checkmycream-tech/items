            <li>If you follow the directions that come with the product, it works great.</li>
            <li>and I love it!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best to watch YouTube to see more hair styles.  </li>
            <li>delivery time was great and packaging was just fine, the product itself is not the greatest  </li>
            <li>and I have loved the results that I had with them.</li>
            <li>my girl loved this shizz.</li>
            <li>It was a Good idea, but a crappy turnout.</li>
            <li>If others had good luck with this product, I&#x27;m more than happy for them.  </li>
            <li>The combs are good about holding the unit on your head, but I dont know how effective it would be for all day wear or a night out on the town.</li>
            <li>They are so easy to use, can create many looks, and came perfect and as described.  </li>
            <li>She is extremely Happy with it but would have liked More Hair Styles with instructions to use.</li>

            <li>I love these Bumpits!</li>
            <li>I have used them on many occasions now and received compliments everytime!</li>
            <li>From the first time I used it (a week of so ago) it worked great!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I took the chance and purchased this, as it is my go to hair item!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>satisfied customer!</li>
            <li>and it looked amazing.  </li>
            <li>DON&#x27;T EVEN BUY FOR FUN!!!</li>
            <li>GREAT ITEM FOR A QUICK HAIR DO.</li>
            <li>It falls over or very easily shifts out of place.</li>
            <li>There are some excellent tutorials on how to use these on youtube, where you can clearly see that they do work if used correctly.</li>
            <li>the best hope i had was the clear one.  </li>
            <li>I think there are better ways of puffing the hair, like a very cheap kind of sponge thar</li>
            <li>Item is a good accessory to have if you want to jazz up your hair style, its cheap and easy to use.</li>
            <li>im better off teasing my hair by myself</li>
            <li>but they are ok</li>
            <li>though I&#x27;d imagine it&#x27;d stay even better if you do.     </li>
            <li>The best description of it I can give is that it is cresent-shaped with tiny arrow-shaped projections around the edges of it.</li>
            <li>When you try to pass hair over the top of it, it won&#x27;t stay upright.</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;But, I am hopeful that it will offer the fundamental use for which I purchased it, to make my hair look more smashing than it already is.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so you have more front hair to cover the teeth.  </li>
            <li>But, I probably would opt to put on some hair product on top to make sure the hair on top doesn&#x27;t move and expose the teeth.</li>
            <li>I thought great this would be so much easier that making a bump myself.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s an ok product.</li>
            <li>Maybe if it was more flexible or made of a thinner plastic I&#x27;d like it better.</li>
            <li>I love lots of volume in my hair and when I saw it advertised on TV, I thought it would be just the thing for me.  </li>
            <li>Would gladly order from th again.</li>
            <li>So glad I was able to get this product.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to use an aersol hairspray though.  </li>
            <li>I love this bumpits though i am still trying to get used to how to do it with my hair, i love it still</li>
            <li>Birthday Gift for Grand Daughter which she had requested.  </li>
            <li>I found Many Sites have them, have  outstanding styles.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>BUT MY HAIR LOOKS BETTER THAN MY DAUGHTERS.</li>
            <li>The light brown one is very light.</li>
            <li>I have no been able to enjoy this product because it doesn&#x27;t stay in place and pulls my hair out.  </li>
            <li>When I ordered the Bumpits, I thought they would be easy to use...</li>
            <li>It was so easy to use</li>
            <li>Well it looks easy on TV.  </li>
            <li>These are easy to use and I like the look of them, which is smoother than if I just teased my hair.  </li>
            <li>However, I have put one on a friend with fine hair</li>
            <li>bought them to use with my Halloween costume,tried them out in advance but would not stay in my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I believe people use this type of broche because they look fine with these product.</li>
            <li>It does look super cute though, esp with headbands..</li>
            <li>It worked great for a short time, then seemed to fall out easily.</li>
            <li>Works best if you tease your hair a little to hold them in place.</li>
            <li>THIS IS A GREAT BUY FOR THE PRICE AND MAKES YOUR HAIR HAVE INSTANT VOLUME.</li>
            <li>Use bobby pins to secure combs.</li>
            <li>Lightly smooth out.  </li>
            <li>and I recommend them to anyone who wants more volume.  </li>
            <li>So, overall it is a good product.</li>
            <li>Perhaps with much practice and patience it would work better, but I had a co-worker put mine in.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to open it..and the packaging inside is very lovely.</li>
            <li>Came quickly, and as promised.</li>
            <li>The trick seems to be to tease your hair more and to put the bumpit more towards the back of the head</li>
            <li>IF YOU NEED A QUICK DO.</li>
            <li>I rarely use them, but they fit well on the first try.</li>
            <li>Works really well and as easy as like seen on TV gets.</li>
            <li>Mine kept falling out on the floor..not exactly the look I was going for!  </li>
            <li>Three different sizes to choose which makes it nice.</li>
            <li>But as far as I&#x27;m concerned, the Bumpit is a piece of non-working, cheap plastic, overly priced piece of junk!  </li>
            <li>Beside this issue well worth to Buy.</li>
            <li>this the only product i liked using for my hair.</li>
            <li>it does not even look real when you put it in, one may as well just look on youtube for instructions on the real thing!!!</li>
            <li>It does exactly what I wanted and worked out super.</li>
            <li>I liked it very much, because it&#x27;s very simple to use.</li>
            <li>they sat right on and stayed, without any tangles trying to get them off.</li>
            <li>Perhaps I just don&#x27;t have the right type of hair to make the Bumpit work.  </li>
            <li>Very useful and easy to put them and arrange different hair styles.</li>
            <li>I only tried one but walked it next door to my great neice</li>
            <li>I receieved the product very fast</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are a bit obnoxious to use when you first get them, but I got the hang of it pretty quickly and now my ponytails are much cuter than they used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, this is one nifty little product that won&#x27;t break your wallet.</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty silky</li>
            <li>No matter how many times I tried to use my hair to cover the tiny teeth they always shown through.</li>
            <li>(great look for growing out thick bangs).</li>
            <li>If you have shorter or thinner hair, it might be an idea to try them on first.</li>
            <li>The only thing that took more work was trying to hide the teeth.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t never bought it in the first place.  </li>
            <li>I love the different sizes.</li>
            <li>The picture shows exactly what you get.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what it looks like.</li>
            <li>I got ones that matched my hair color, but I still didn&#x27;t like parts of them showing through enough to use them more often.  </li>
            <li>MY KIDS BOUGHT SOME FIRST.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product awhile back and love it.</li>
            <li>After watching a good number of Youtube videos on how to prep the hair and insert this device, I didn&#x27;t have too much trouble making it work on me.  </li>
            <li>The concept of this device is good, but the particular product is certainly not!</li>
            <li>But if you plan on leaving you hair down and just this bumpit on top it will not stay.!</li>
            <li>The infomercial looked very convincing, because I wore a hairstyle similar to the model demonstrating the use of the bumpit on tv, but when I attempted to put on the larger bumpit - it always fell right off of my head.  </li>
            <li>I think that pretty much defeats the purpose.</li>
            <li>Pricey for 3 pieces of molded plastic &amp; teasing comb, but worth achieving in seconds what normally takes lots of work, time &amp; hairspray.</li>
            <li>They are a lot of fun and add spunk to normal hair dos.  </li>
            <li>I have regular easy to style hair.</li>
            <li>It actually looked very good for the first half of the day, but by evening the teeth were all showing and the bumpit was drooping at a pretty low angle.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t beat the price, and the shipper was fast and prompt.  </li>
            <li>REALLY WORKS</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to tease much or use much hairspray.  </li>
            <li>I really like my Bumpits, and have gotten tons of compliments.</li>
            <li>That way styling your hair over it would be much easier.   </li>
            <li>These Bumpits were a blast for spicing up your hair into a sixties and seventies high rise hair do!</li>
            <li>An aluminum teasing comb is really all you need to get this look without the drama.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s absolute scam</li>
            <li>Got the product to me in a very telu manner.</li>
            <li>Her Big bday was Fantastic and this topped it off</li>
            <li>VERY COST EFFICIENT.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I like this product because it does not require too much time.</li>
            <li>To be honest, this product was kind of disappointing.</li>
            <li>The bangs bumpit didn&#x27;t budge.. the large ones did shift after the claw clip slid off, so they certainly stay better with style/accessories that corral them in the hair, than with just hair let down.    </li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this product until I actually tried it out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure I have thin hair, especially at the top of my head.  </li>
            <li>In my humble opinion, this is a product that \\&quot;works\\&quot; better on TV than in real life.</li>
            <li>If you want to add volume to your hair for an event lasting a few hours, this would be a good option.  </li>
            <li>I love having three sizes, although I personally don&#x27;t want to actually look like Snooki</li>
            <li>made her hair super big.</li>
            <li>DEFINITELY recommend product by BIG SEXY HAIR called  &amp;#34;WHAT A TEASE&amp;#34; to make hair stand up and reduce teasing breakage.</li>
            <li>as advertised, seem to be solidly made and the price is right.</li>
            <li>Packaged well, in the correct color, and brand new.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if the texture of your hair is what makes the bumpit work better</li>
            <li>With my current length, the bump-it is a little tricky to maneuver (I believe longer hair will work better with this), but it makes for some cute, messy up-do&#x27;s for me to wear to work and out and about.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m having a little bit of an issue with the little prongs sticking out through my hair, but clearly this is a product that requires some practice, and I personally just need to get better at smoothing my hair over the top.</li>
            <li>You just might have good luck with it if your hair is long and thick, but otherwise, I don&#x27;t think so.</li>
            <li>The tiny little prongs grab the hair and hold it in place very securely.</li>
            <li>It gives volume to fine, limp hair.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair but had to straighten it for my costume.  </li>
            <li>You can see the prongs through your hair and it makes your head look completely abnormal.</li>
            <li>i could not use it as I hace naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>It gives my little front poof more structure and helps keep its shape all through a long day.</li>
            <li>Liked the rounder volume of wearing both larger bumpits, and the small bumpit maintains the volume on bangs swept back over at the hairline</li>
            <li>I have only used these a few times but they are easy to use</li>
            <li>This bumpit is the right one for medium to dark hair.  </li>
            <li>No matter how many different ways I try them, they always make my head look oddly deformed, and they&#x27;re always partially visible.</li>
            <li>Once I wiggled the bumpit into my hair and scalp (surprisingly this doesn&#x27;t hurt despite how sharp looking the teeth on the bottom are) behind the tuft of hair I would grab, the bumpit didn&#x27;t move for me.  </li>
            <li>For an entire day - you might want to try old fashioned teasing.</li>
            <li>Eventually, I cropped my hair to a more pixie chic style that&#x27;s much easier to maintain since I&#x27;m constantly on-the-go, and unfortunately my bumpit products wound up stored away in a box and left in my closet where I haven&#x27;t used them since.</li>
            <li>its wonderful..however not good when your husband or significant other wants to run their fingers through your hair.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first, seeing as my hair is straight and thin; I wasn&#x27;t sure how well it would stay in.  </li>
            <li>When straightened, my hair is very straight and slick and has no volume.  </li>
            <li>But I found that I was still able to see the little nubs sticking through my hair as my hair settled over the course of the day and my hair is fairly thick.  </li>
            <li>It sits on your head awkwardly and you better hope the wind doesn&#x27;t blow too hard or too light and don&#x27;t even think about bending over either.  </li>

            <li> Maybe if it was more flexible or made of a thinner plastic I&#x27;d like it better.</li>
            <li> I love lots of volume in my hair and when I saw it advertised on TV, I thought it would be just the thing for me.  </li>
            <li> Would gladly order from th again.</li>
            <li> So glad I was able to get this product.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to use an aersol hairspray though.  </li>
            <li> I love this bumpits though i am still trying to get used to how to do it with my hair, i love it still</li>
            <li> Birthday Gift for Grand Daughter which she had requested.  </li>
            <li> I found Many Sites have them, have  outstanding styles.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> BUT MY HAIR LOOKS BETTER THAN MY DAUGHTERS.</li>
            <li> The light brown one is very light.</li>
            <li> I have no been able to enjoy this product because it doesn&#x27;t stay in place and pulls my hair out.  </li>
            <li> When I ordered the Bumpits, I thought they would be easy to use...</li>
            <li> It was so easy to use</li>
            <li> Well it looks easy on TV.  </li>
            <li> These are easy to use and I like the look of them, which is smoother than if I just teased my hair.  </li>
            <li> However, I have put one on a friend with fine hair</li>
            <li> bought them to use with my Halloween costume,tried them out in advance but would not stay in my fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I believe people use this type of broche because they look fine with these product.</li>
            <li> It does look super cute though, esp with headbands..</li>
            <li> It worked great for a short time, then seemed to fall out easily.</li>
            <li> Works best if you tease your hair a little to hold them in place.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A GREAT BUY FOR THE PRICE AND MAKES YOUR HAIR HAVE INSTANT VOLUME.</li>
            <li> Use bobby pins to secure combs.</li>
            <li> Lightly smooth out.  </li>
            <li> and I recommend them to anyone who wants more volume.  </li>
            <li> So, overall it is a good product.</li>
            <li> Perhaps with much practice and patience it would work better, but I had a co-worker put mine in.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to open it..and the packaging inside is very lovely.</li>
            <li> Came quickly, and as promised.</li>
            <li> The trick seems to be to tease your hair more and to put the bumpit more towards the back of the head</li>
            <li> IF YOU NEED A QUICK DO.</li>
            <li> I rarely use them, but they fit well on the first try.</li>
            <li> Works really well and as easy as like seen on TV gets.</li>
            <li> Mine kept falling out on the floor..not exactly the look I was going for!  </li>
            <li> Three different sizes to choose which makes it nice.</li>
            <li> But as far as I&#x27;m concerned, the Bumpit is a piece of non-working, cheap plastic, overly priced piece of junk!  </li>
            <li> Beside this issue well worth to Buy.</li>
            <li> this the only product i liked using for my hair.</li>
            <li> it does not even look real when you put it in, one may as well just look on youtube for instructions on the real thing!!!</li>
            <li> It does exactly what I wanted and worked out super.</li>
            <li> I liked it very much, because it&#x27;s very simple to use.</li>
            <li> they sat right on and stayed, without any tangles trying to get them off.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I just don&#x27;t have the right type of hair to make the Bumpit work.  </li>
            <li> Very useful and easy to put them and arrange different hair styles.</li>
            <li> I only tried one but walked it next door to my great neice</li>
            <li> I receieved the product very fast</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are a bit obnoxious to use when you first get them, but I got the hang of it pretty quickly and now my ponytails are much cuter than they used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, this is one nifty little product that won&#x27;t break your wallet.</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty silky</li>
            <li> No matter how many times I tried to use my hair to cover the tiny teeth they always shown through.</li>
            <li> (great look for growing out thick bangs).</li>
            <li> If you have shorter or thinner hair, it might be an idea to try them on first.</li>
            <li> The only thing that took more work was trying to hide the teeth.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t never bought it in the first place.  </li>
            <li> I love the different sizes.</li>
            <li> The picture shows exactly what you get.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what it looks like.</li>
            <li> I got ones that matched my hair color, but I still didn&#x27;t like parts of them showing through enough to use them more often.  </li>
            <li> MY KIDS BOUGHT SOME FIRST.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product awhile back and love it.</li>
            <li> After watching a good number of Youtube videos on how to prep the hair and insert this device, I didn&#x27;t have too much trouble making it work on me.  </li>
            <li> The concept of this device is good, but the particular product is certainly not!</li>
            <li> But if you plan on leaving you hair down and just this bumpit on top it will not stay.!</li>
            <li> The infomercial looked very convincing, because I wore a hairstyle similar to the model demonstrating the use of the bumpit on tv, but when I attempted to put on the larger bumpit - it always fell right off of my head.  </li>
            <li> I think that pretty much defeats the purpose.</li>
            <li> Pricey for 3 pieces of molded plastic &amp; teasing comb, but worth achieving in seconds what normally takes lots of work, time &amp; hairspray.</li>
            <li> They are a lot of fun and add spunk to normal hair dos.  </li>
            <li> I have regular easy to style hair.</li>
            <li> It actually looked very good for the first half of the day, but by evening the teeth were all showing and the bumpit was drooping at a pretty low angle.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price, and the shipper was fast and prompt.  </li>
            <li> REALLY WORKS</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to tease much or use much hairspray.  </li>
            <li> I really like my Bumpits, and have gotten tons of compliments.</li>
            <li> That way styling your hair over it would be much easier.   </li>
            <li> These Bumpits were a blast for spicing up your hair into a sixties and seventies high rise hair do!</li>
            <li> An aluminum teasing comb is really all you need to get this look without the drama.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s absolute scam</li>
            <li> Got the product to me in a very telu manner.</li>
            <li> Her Big bday was Fantastic and this topped it off</li>
            <li> VERY COST EFFICIENT.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I like this product because it does not require too much time.</li>
            <li> To be honest, this product was kind of disappointing.</li>
            <li> The bangs bumpit didn&#x27;t budge.. the large ones did shift after the claw clip slid off, so they certainly stay better with style/accessories that corral them in the hair, than with just hair let down.    </li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this product until I actually tried it out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure I have thin hair, especially at the top of my head.  </li>
            <li> In my humble opinion, this is a product that \\&quot;works\\&quot; better on TV than in real life.</li>
            <li> If you want to add volume to your hair for an event lasting a few hours, this would be a good option.  </li>
            <li> I love having three sizes, although I personally don&#x27;t want to actually look like Snooki</li>
            <li> made her hair super big.</li>
            <li> DEFINITELY recommend product by BIG SEXY HAIR called  &amp;#34;WHAT A TEASE&amp;#34; to make hair stand up and reduce teasing breakage.</li>
            <li> as advertised, seem to be solidly made and the price is right.</li>
            <li> Packaged well, in the correct color, and brand new.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the texture of your hair is what makes the bumpit work better</li>
            <li> With my current length, the bump-it is a little tricky to maneuver (I believe longer hair will work better with this), but it makes for some cute, messy up-do&#x27;s for me to wear to work and out and about.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having a little bit of an issue with the little prongs sticking out through my hair, but clearly this is a product that requires some practice, and I personally just need to get better at smoothing my hair over the top.</li>
            <li> You just might have good luck with it if your hair is long and thick, but otherwise, I don&#x27;t think so.</li>
            <li> The tiny little prongs grab the hair and hold it in place very securely.</li>
            <li> It gives volume to fine, limp hair.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair but had to straighten it for my costume.  </li>
            <li> You can see the prongs through your hair and it makes your head look completely abnormal.</li>
            <li> i could not use it as I hace naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> It gives my little front poof more structure and helps keep its shape all through a long day.</li>
            <li> Liked the rounder volume of wearing both larger bumpits, and the small bumpit maintains the volume on bangs swept back over at the hairline</li>
            <li> I have only used these a few times but they are easy to use</li>
            <li> This bumpit is the right one for medium to dark hair.  </li>
            <li> No matter how many different ways I try them, they always make my head look oddly deformed, and they&#x27;re always partially visible.</li>
            <li> Once I wiggled the bumpit into my hair and scalp (surprisingly this doesn&#x27;t hurt despite how sharp looking the teeth on the bottom are) behind the tuft of hair I would grab, the bumpit didn&#x27;t move for me.  </li>
            <li> For an entire day - you might want to try old fashioned teasing.</li>
            <li> Eventually, I cropped my hair to a more pixie chic style that&#x27;s much easier to maintain since I&#x27;m constantly on-the-go, and unfortunately my bumpit products wound up stored away in a box and left in my closet where I haven&#x27;t used them since.</li>
            <li> its wonderful..however not good when your husband or significant other wants to run their fingers through your hair.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, seeing as my hair is straight and thin; I wasn&#x27;t sure how well it would stay in.  </li>
            <li> When straightened, my hair is very straight and slick and has no volume.  </li>
            <li> But I found that I was still able to see the little nubs sticking through my hair as my hair settled over the course of the day and my hair is fairly thick.  </li>
            <li> It sits on your head awkwardly and you better hope the wind doesn&#x27;t blow too hard or too light and don&#x27;t even think about bending over either.  </li>
            <li> The other two Bumpits in the kit will lay dormant in the bottom of a bathroom drawer until some future Halloween costume calls them back into action.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have super thick hair, but I don&#x27;t have super thin hair either.</li>
            <li> My hair is slick straight, pretty long and licorice whip heavy.</li>
            <li> That said, from the other reviews I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if your hair type has a lot to do with whether it works well for you.</li>
            <li> However, when I switched to the tiny pint size one, it stayed in place, but only as long as I held clip in place at the back of my head.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, fine hair and this will be easily hidden for me and give me lift that lasts.  </li>
            <li> Comfortable even when reclining on a headrest, not to mention they didn&#x27;t tip... still less uncomfy than reclining on the common claw/butterfly clip.    </li>
            <li> I had wanted to do styles in my hair that had lots of volume for my naturally flat hair.</li>
            <li> No amount of teasing my already pretty thick hair had made it cover a Bumpit the way they show in the commercials.</li>
            <li> Pull hair straight up, tease down in front twice or three times-same in back, hairspray and lay it down.  </li>
            <li> The small one is way too small and not sure what i am supposed to do with it, but it&#x27;s nice to have the option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Take a wide tooth pick at root to pull back up if it falls a bit and hairspray.  </li>
            <li> and I can only imagine it being used in a pageant or drag show.</li>
            <li> and they stay in place for a long time.</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s on your head, it doesn&#x27;t even look normal; one is too big and the other is ridiculously small (can you say, \\&quot;cone head\\&quot;?)  </li>
            <li> I finally decided to try these in the dark brown color.</li>
            <li> If your wearing this at a party/wedding and your dancing it would definitely move  down.</li>
            <li> so I typically choose the middle one.</li>
            <li> I am not very talented when it comes to doing hair but this made it look professional.</li>
            <li> Hope faded when the supplier informed they only received the light blonde units. :(</li>
            <li> the tiny one will work for a front little bump.</li>
            <li> all seriousness, I wanted to buy these when I actually saw them on TV a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> Good concept - very bad design.</li>
            <li> I attempted to get this thing to work in my hair for about four hours with no positive results.</li>
            <li> Seriously ladies-go and get an old fasioned teasing comb our Moms used.  </li>
            <li> The first thing wrong is that it says \\&quot;as seen on TV.\\</li>
            <li> I drove over to the other location to pick it up.   </li>
            <li> It took me 30 minutes and extremely sore arms to get it to not look like I had something stuck in my hair.</li>
            <li> You can see it in your hair, so I won&#x27;t be able to use it. :(</li>
            <li> None of it works, smalL, big ...</li>
            <li> The largest size that came with is pretty laughable</li>
            <li> The yellow will hard to cover.</li>
            <li> Not a success.</li>
            <li> my heavy hair coil, headband and claw clip slid and flew off as expected.</li>
            <li> These \\&quot;prongs\\&quot; on the base are supposed to grab the hair with the prongs over the top securing whatever hair you drape of them.   </li>
            <li> Also, when I played around with it, I was able to use it without using hairspray or any hairproducts, which I honestly hate to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I wouldnt trust these if you are wearing your hair down.  </li>
            <li> so you can see the black plastic.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t be bothered to tease or mess with hairspray...</li>
            <li> (the infomercials are pretty cheesy!)</li>
            <li> It bites a little bit, though.  </li>
            <li> A little bit of hair spray</li>
            <li> They need a little bit work but stay well put.</li>
            <li> It did hurt my head though with the little plastic nubs that keep it in place.</li>
            <li> I used to tease my hair, but quickly got sick of the rats nest.  </li>
            <li> Although, my hair is of medium thickness, it also tends to look a bit awkward when my bald spots are showing in certain areas on my head while using the bumpit, regardless of how well I tried to fix my hair.  </li>
            <li> I just think that should have a size between the \\&quot;mini\\&quot; and the \\&quot;medium\\&quot;, so we can have a little volume for our everyday outfits.</li>
            <li> I wore all 3 and whipped my head around a few pirouettes to test..</li>
            <li> This is one product I wish I didnt waste my money over.</li>
            <li> YOU COULD SAY I WAS GREEN WITH ENVY.</li>
            <li> Only way you could leave it on is if you put bobby pins behind it or make a bun.</li>
            <li> I also did not realize it came in different colors and had the wrong one--</li>
            <li> so I am not sure why you would need these.</li>
            <li> Bumpit makes me look like an alien.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair and it isn&#x27;t very thick</li>
            <li> all it did was snarl it and had a hard time getting the product out of my hair.  </li>
            <li> The plastic is too hard and it hurts the head.</li>
            <li> thick, rather course hair),</li>
            <li> Perhaps if you have really thick hair they will work for you.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product at th As Seen On Tv store and had thick hair (my beautician&#x27;s dream).  </li>
            <li> Unless you have really thick hair, these are not doable.</li>
            <li> I thought the concept was completely ridiculous</li>
            <li> It was nearly impossible for my to get the bumpit to stay in my hair at the proper angle.  </li>
            <li> the hair behind it will fall at an angle that looks weird, simply due to gravity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With the cost of shipping this is not a good value for the money and its description is misleading.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Bumpits with very low expectation considering other reviews that said these were terrible.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I was not pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> my hair is very thin and blond, so the head band is coming out of my hair, because my head is small, plus my hair is thin</li>
            <li> I have a lot of very thick hair</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> and she practically uses her everyday!!!</li>
            <li> Therefore, I figured with all the reviews saying it doesn&#x27;t work on thin hair that this would not work for me.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s doable for people with thin hair.  </li>
            <li> My kids have thin hair (and so does just about every kid in their dance class)</li>
            <li> Perhaps it is because eI have thin hair.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend for anyone with thin hair.  </li>
            <li> No matter how much i teased my hair, i couldn&#x27;t hide the plastic and it felt weird and uncomfortable!!!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;the teeth are also very hard to hide!</li>
            <li> Tried a few times and it keeps falling off :(</li>
            <li> Wrong, it got stuck in my hair everytime</li>
            <li> Sorry, but you can see these when you put them in your hair.</li>
            <li> WRONG.</li>
            <li> it was difficult to use and when I did try put it in my hair</li>
            <li> As it is, it&#x27;s a necessary evil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say that i purchased this product.</li>
            <li> I was WRONG!  </li>
            <li> Fail!</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work all that well for me. :(</li>
            <li> , it will look stupid and unnatural.  </li>
            <li> This product is so annoying.</li>
            <li> I must be an idiot, because I cannot figure these things out.</li>
            <li> This product was HORRIBLE.</li>
            <li> The worst product I ever bought.</li>
            <li> This is a horrible product.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Worked great for my costume.</li>
            <li> I still can&#x27;t figure out how to use these in my hair, maybe it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
            <li> They are so easy to use, can create many looks, and came perfect and as described.  You can&#x27;t beat the price, and the shipper was fast and prompt.  A++++!</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t stay in your hair. They suck. Best part of this buy was a comb I got with the box.</li>
            <li> REALLY WORKS AS SHOWN IN PICTURE...GOOD PRODUCT! THIS IS A GREAT BUY FOR THE PRICE AND MAKES YOUR HAIR HAVE INSTANT VOLUME.</li>
            <li> I always get compliments on this and I recommend them to anyone who wants more volume.  I thought the concept was completely ridiculous (the infomercials are pretty cheesy!) but once I tried them, I was hooked!  I have a lot of very thick hair so I don&#x27;t have to tease much or use much hairspray.  However, I have put one on a friend with fine hair and I just had to tease it a lot to hide the piece.</li>
            <li> to me i think bump its are a waste of money because they really dont work for my hair. im better off teasing my hair by myself but they are ok</li>
            <li> I bought the Bumpits with very low expectation considering other reviews that said these were terrible. I actually like mine. I don&#x27;t have super thick hair, but I don&#x27;t have super thin hair either. My hair is pretty silky so I was worried that they wouldn&#x27;t stay, but my worries are all in vain. I really like my Bumpits, and have gotten tons of compliments.</li>
            <li> There is a discrepancy between the image and description.  The first thing wrong is that it says \\&quot;as seen on TV.\\&quot;  The TV version is a 2 pack with 4 bumpits.  The photo depicts 4 bumpits and claims to be a 2 pack.  When I received this package what I received was one package containing 3 bumpits.  With the cost of shipping this is not a good value for the money and its description is misleading.  Order from another source.</li>
            <li> This product was HORRIBLE. I attempted to get this thing to work in my hair for about four hours with no positive results. No matter how many times I tried to use my hair to cover the tiny teeth they always shown through. I have very thick hair so I thought this product would look great. Wrong, it got stuck in my hair everytime and I ended up looking like \\&quot;Elvira\\&quot;. I definatly got my money back on this.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product!!! I have dark brown hair and it isn&#x27;t very thick but I was able to have AMAZING volume! I recently wore it to a friend&#x27;s wedding and then again to a garden party and I got tons of compliments on my hair. The key is, you still have to tease your hair so you can&#x27;t see the teeth. With some teasing and fluffing all of the teeth were covered with maximum volume! I am not very talented when it comes to doing hair but this made it look professional. I plan on purchasing these for friends for Christmas!</li>
            <li> I rarely use them, but they fit well on the first try. So, overall it is a good product.</li>
            <li> Quite pleased! Pricey for 3 pieces of molded plastic &amp; teasing comb, but worth achieving in seconds what normally takes lots of work, time &amp; hairspray. Liked the rounder volume of wearing both larger bumpits, and the small bumpit maintains the volume on bangs swept back over at the hairline (great look for growing out thick bangs). Comfortable even when reclining on a headrest, not to mention they didn&#x27;t tip... still less uncomfy than reclining on the common claw/butterfly clip.    I wore all 3 and whipped my head around a few pirouettes to test.. my heavy hair coil, headband and claw clip slid and flew off as expected. Bumpits stayed. The bangs bumpit didn&#x27;t budge.. the large ones did shift after the claw clip slid off, so they certainly stay better with style/accessories that corral them in the hair, than with just hair let down.    That said, from the other reviews I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if your hair type has a lot to do with whether it works well for you. When I tried them at As Seen on TV shop at the mall- they sat right on and stayed, without any tangles trying to get them off. My hair is slick straight, pretty long and licorice whip heavy. I didn&#x27;t have a problem with the teeth showing, but my hair&#x27;s stubborn straightness probably helped. If you have shorter or thinner hair, it might be an idea to try them on first. I can&#x27;t be bothered to tease or mess with hairspray... though I&#x27;d imagine it&#x27;d stay even better if you do.     It does look super cute though, esp with headbands.. you might feel extra flat-headed without them afterwards.</li>
            <li> When I ordered the Bumpits, I thought they would be easy to use...I was WRONG!  LOL!  But I figured it out, and with some work, they do make my hair look great!</li>
            <li> it does not even look real when you put it in, one may as well just look on youtube for instructions on the real thing!!!</li>
            <li> In my humble opinion, this is a product that \\&quot;works\\&quot; better on TV than in real life. I eagerly awaited the arrival of this product at my local supplier. They finally arrived! Hope faded when the supplier informed they only received the light blonde units. :( Supplier called another location who had the unit designed for darker hair. I drove over to the other location to pick it up.   Got it home and tried and tried to work with it. The best description of it I can give is that it is cresent-shaped with tiny arrow-shaped projections around the edges of it. These \\&quot;prongs\\&quot; on the base are supposed to grab the hair with the prongs over the top securing whatever hair you drape of them.   PROBLEM: Heads are curved structures. When you place the unit on your head, there is nothing to keep it upright. When you try to pass hair over the top of it, it won&#x27;t stay upright. It falls over or very easily shifts out of place. It seems that if the unit had been made with tuck combs attached to it, you could anchor it to your hair  to keep it in place. That way styling your hair over it would be much easier.   The supplier told me that they were being discontinued. After purchasing it, I can see why.  Overall opinion: Good concept - very bad design.</li>
            <li> For Halloween, I needed to make my hair big.  This did the trick.  People couldn&#x27;t believe.  It was so easy to use and it looked amazing.  It made the costume.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Bought these for a Halloween costume. Came quickly, and as promised. Packaged well, in the correct color, and brand new.</li>
            <li> I finally decided to try these in the dark brown color. Surprisingly, this is one nifty little product that won&#x27;t break your wallet. I have shoulder-length hair that I am currently trying to grow out. With my current length, the bump-it is a little tricky to maneuver (I believe longer hair will work better with this), but it makes for some cute, messy up-do&#x27;s for me to wear to work and out and about. I&#x27;m not sure if the texture of your hair is what makes the bumpit work better (I have thick, rather course hair), but I have had no problems at all getting it to stay in place. The tiny little prongs grab the hair and hold it in place very securely. I am wearing it at this moment and this thing is not budging! I&#x27;m having a little bit of an issue with the little prongs sticking out through my hair, but clearly this is a product that requires some practice, and I personally just need to get better at smoothing my hair over the top. There are some excellent tutorials on how to use these on youtube, where you can clearly see that they do work if used correctly. Buy it at Bed Bath and Beyond and use a 20% coupon for an even cheaper buy!</li>
            <li> The worst product I ever bought.</li>
            <li> I have yet to use this product.&lt;br /&gt;But, I am hopeful that it will offer the fundamental use for which I purchased it, to make my hair look more smashing than it already is.&lt;br /&gt;I plan on using the &amp;#34;Bump It&amp;#34; this Tuesday.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frieda</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure I have thin hair, especially at the top of my head.  Therefore, I figured with all the reviews saying it doesn&#x27;t work on thin hair that this would not work for me.  But I tried it out for myself.      After watching a good number of Youtube videos on how to prep the hair and insert this device, I didn&#x27;t have too much trouble making it work on me.  Once I wiggled the bumpit into my hair and scalp (surprisingly this doesn&#x27;t hurt despite how sharp looking the teeth on the bottom are) behind the tuft of hair I would grab, the bumpit didn&#x27;t move for me.  The only thing that took more work was trying to hide the teeth.  I think it&#x27;s doable for people with thin hair.  The trick seems to be to tease your hair more and to put the bumpit more towards the back of the head so you have more front hair to cover the teeth.  Also, when I played around with it, I was able to use it without using hairspray or any hairproducts, which I honestly hate to use. But, I probably would opt to put on some hair product on top to make sure the hair on top doesn&#x27;t move and expose the teeth.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t never bought it in the first place.  The infomercial looked very convincing, because I wore a hairstyle similar to the model demonstrating the use of the bumpit on tv, but when I attempted to put on the larger bumpit - it always fell right off of my head.  However, when I switched to the tiny pint size one, it stayed in place, but only as long as I held clip in place at the back of my head.  Although, my hair is of medium thickness, it also tends to look a bit awkward when my bald spots are showing in certain areas on my head while using the bumpit, regardless of how well I tried to fix my hair.  Eventually, I cropped my hair to a more pixie chic style that&#x27;s much easier to maintain since I&#x27;m constantly on-the-go, and unfortunately my bumpit products wound up stored away in a box and left in my closet where I haven&#x27;t used them since.</li>
            <li> Sorry, but you can see these when you put them in your hair. I would not buy again. Perhaps if you have really thick hair they will work for you.</li>
            <li> My co-workers and I ordered these for halloween.  I have naturally curly hair but had to straighten it for my costume.  When straightened, my hair is very straight and slick and has no volume.  It was nearly impossible for my to get the bumpit to stay in my hair at the proper angle.  Perhaps with much practice and patience it would work better, but I had a co-worker put mine in.  Hairspray definitely helps hold it in place!  It actually looked very good for the first half of the day, but by evening the teeth were all showing and the bumpit was drooping at a pretty low angle.  If you want to add volume to your hair for an event lasting a few hours, this would be a good option.  For an entire day - you might want to try old fashioned teasing.</li>
            <li> I liked it very much, because it&#x27;s very simple to use. I just think that should have a size between the \\&quot;mini\\&quot; and the \\&quot;medium\\&quot;, so we can have a little volume for our everyday outfits. The medium size is like \\&quot;part-volume\\&quot;. But it&#x27;s very good.</li>
            <li> As seen on TV. Well it looks easy on TV.  I have no been able to enjoy this product because it doesn&#x27;t stay in place and pulls my hair out.  ouch.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting the bumpits for some time. I was excited to open it..and the packaging inside is very lovely. I eagerly grabbed my hairspray and followed the directions. Now if you can stand the bumpit in your haiir and scalp for the duration of the day..its wonderful..however not good when your husband or significant other wants to run their fingers through your hair. lol</li>
            <li> These Bumpits were a blast for spicing up your hair into a sixties and seventies high rise hair do! Works really well and as easy as like seen on TV gets.</li>
            <li> I dressed up as FLO for Halloween and needed something to puff up my hair.  This item was perfect!  Three different sizes to choose which makes it nice.</li>
            <li> I thought great this would be so much easier that making a bump myself. WRONG. it was difficult to use and when I did try put it in my hair all it did was snarl it and had a hard time getting the product out of my hair.  As seen on TV isnt what you see!</li>
            <li> I think there are better ways of puffing the hair, like a very cheap kind of sponge thar has a velcro on it. But it&#x27;s an ok product.</li>
            <li> I also did not realize it came in different colors and had the wrong one--I passed it on to someone else.</li>
            <li> Just love these things! Very useful and easy to put them and arrange different hair styles. If you like your hair with volume, don´t hesitate in buying them.</li>
            <li> Always wanted to look like Snooki?  This is your product!  it works GREAT! I love having three sizes, although I personally don&#x27;t want to actually look like Snooki so I typically choose the middle one. The small one is way too small and not sure what i am supposed to do with it, but it&#x27;s nice to have the option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as advertised, seem to be solidly made and the price is right.</li>
            <li> They sent me in a color I didnt not pick. Blonde. I have brown/dark hair. The yellow will hard to cover. This is one product I wish I didnt waste my money over.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m writing this review. My daughters do Irish dance and the teacher required that I buy these for styling their hair for competition. This product is so annoying. My kids have thin hair (and so does just about every kid in their dance class) and you can see these plastic bits poking out of their hair all the time. Maybe if it was more flexible or made of a thinner plastic I&#x27;d like it better. As it is, it&#x27;s a necessary evil.</li>
            <li> If others had good luck with this product, I&#x27;m more than happy for them.  But as far as I&#x27;m concerned, the Bumpit is a piece of non-working, cheap plastic, overly priced piece of junk!  I love lots of volume in my hair and when I saw it advertised on TV, I thought it would be just the thing for me.  Perhaps I just don&#x27;t have the right type of hair to make the Bumpit work.  You just might have good luck with it if your hair is long and thick, but otherwise, I don&#x27;t think so. Mine kept falling out on the floor..not exactly the look I was going for!  The concept of this device is good, but the particular product is certainly not!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say that i purchased this product. I have regular easy to style hair. It took me 30 minutes and extremely sore arms to get it to not look like I had something stuck in my hair. Even at that, i would not walk out of the house that way. I&#x27;ve even tried it on different friends and familys hair to try a varity of textures. Not a success. An aluminum teasing comb is really all you need to get this look without the drama.</li>
            <li> I have only used these a few times but they are easy to use and I have loved the results that I had with them.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work so well for blonds.  You can see it in your hair, so I won&#x27;t be able to use it. :(</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this product until I actually tried it out. You can see the prongs through your hair and it makes your head look completely abnormal. Fail!</li>
            <li> WHAT A SCAM.....does NOT work at all......it&#x27;s absolute scam and I beg you not the buy it ever.  None of it works, smalL, big ...NOPE!!!!</li>
            <li> I love the different sizes. They totally make your hair look fuller and the 60&#x27;s hairstyle look I was going for was achieved.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work. Tried a few times and it keeps falling off :(</li>
            <li> Got the product to me in a very telu manner. Would gladly order from th again.</li>
            <li> The picture shows exactly what you get.</li>
            <li> So glad I was able to get this product.  It does exactly what I wanted and worked out super.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work all that well for me. :( i gave them to my mom and they didn&#x27;t work for either.</li>
            <li> my girl loved this shizz. made her hair super big. she kinda looked like amy winehouse tho</li>
            <li> Included teasing comb the BEST for good results. Use bobby pins to secure combs. DEFINITELY recommend product by BIG SEXY HAIR called  &amp;#34;WHAT A TEASE&amp;#34; to make hair stand up and reduce teasing breakage.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a Halloween costume. It worked great for a short time, then seemed to fall out easily. Perhaps it is because eI have thin hair. No complaints against the seller.</li>
            <li> I recieved these on time, without any damage. They are a lot of fun and add spunk to normal hair dos.  It&#x27;s best to watch YouTube to see more hair styles.  Works best if you tease your hair a little to hold them in place.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product at th As Seen On Tv store and had thick hair (my beautician&#x27;s dream).  Almost shoulder length and red, the best hope i had was the clear one.  There were 3 different sizes.  I ended up having to use the smallest one.  No matter how much i teased my hair, i couldn&#x27;t hide the plastic and it felt weird and uncomfortable!!!  Seriously ladies-go and get an old fasioned teasing comb our Moms used.  Pull hair straight up, tease down in front twice or three times-same in back, hairspray and lay it down.  Lightly smooth out.  Take a wide tooth pick at root to pull back up if it falls a bit and hairspray.  You can do it with all sizes of hair.  Just watch Snooki in the earlier days and you get a visual.  Make sure to use an aersol hairspray though.  Cheaper, the better!!!</li>
            <li> It gives volume to fine, limp hair.  It bites a little bit, though.  This bumpit is the right one for medium to dark hair.  The light brown one is very light.</li>
            <li> To be honest, this product was kind of disappointing. I had wanted to do styles in my hair that had lots of volume for my naturally flat hair. I did not know that you still had to tease the hair before putting the &amp;#34;bumpit&#x27;&#x27; in. I think that pretty much defeats the purpose. I think teasing hair can totally give you the same effect as these, so I am not sure why you would need these.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what it looks like. However, it did not work how I wanted it to.</li>
            <li> These are easy to use and I like the look of them, which is smoother than if I just teased my hair.  But I found that I was still able to see the little nubs sticking through my hair as my hair settled over the course of the day and my hair is fairly thick.  Granted I got ones that matched my hair color, but I still didn&#x27;t like parts of them showing through enough to use them more often.  Would not recommend for anyone with thin hair.  The largest size that came with is pretty laughable and I can only imagine it being used in a pageant or drag show.</li>
            <li> I love this bumpits though i am still trying to get used to how to do it with my hair, i love it still</li>
            <li> ...and its awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all seriousness, I wanted to buy these when I actually saw them on TV a few years ago.  Finally bit the bullet and bought them.&lt;br /&gt;They are a bit obnoxious to use when you first get them, but I got the hang of it pretty quickly and now my ponytails are much cuter than they used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldnt trust these if you are wearing your hair down.  The combs are good about holding the unit on your head, but I dont know how effective it would be for all day wear or a night out on the town.</li>
            <li> I love these Bumpits! A little bit of hair spray and they stay in place for a long time. They need a little bit work but stay well put. I have used them on many occasions now and received compliments everytime!</li>
            <li> Birthday Gift for Grand Daughter which she had requested.  She is extremely Happy with it but would have liked More Hair Styles with instructions to use. I researched on Web. I found Many Sites have them, have  outstanding styles. I just emailed her the links. Beside this issue well worth to Buy. Her Big bday was Fantastic and this topped it off she stated.  :)</li>
            <li> great for a Halloween costume.</li>
            <li> bought them to use with my Halloween costume,tried them out in advance but would not stay in my fine hair.  Tried to return them before Halloween, (it&#x27;s not like I wore them or anything) but the seller will not respond. DON&#x27;T EVEN BUY FOR FUN!!!</li>
            <li> delivery time was great and packaging was just fine, the product itself is not the greatest  would recommend it to someone with a lot of time, patience, and hairspray</li>
            <li> Unless you have really thick hair, these are not doable. I bought it for a wig and the bumpit  got so tangled up in it.</li>
            <li> I used this product as part of a Halloween costume.  It stayed put and worked well.  It did hurt my head though with the little plastic nubs that keep it in place.</li>
            <li> GREAT ITEM FOR A QUICK HAIR DO. MY KIDS BOUGHT SOME FIRST. I GUESS YOU COULD SAY I WAS GREEN WITH ENVY. BUT MY HAIR LOOKS BETTER THAN MY DAUGHTERS. THE ITEM WAS PROMPTLY SHIPPED. IF YOU NEED A QUICK DO. THIS IS A GREAT ITEM TO FIX YOUR WIG. VERY COST EFFICIENT.</li>
            <li> I like the product but does not stay in your hair even if you tease your hair. If your wearing this at a party/wedding and your dancing it would definitely move  down. Only way you could leave it on is if you put bobby pins behind it or make a bun. Thats the inly way it would stay on.  But if you plan on leaving you hair down and just this bumpit on top it will not stay.!</li>
            <li> When I was unsuccessful at finding the Bumpit in stores, I decided to purchase it online.  From the first time I used it (a week of so ago) it worked great!  It stayed in my hair and looked like I actually teased it.  I used to tease my hair, but quickly got sick of the rats nest.  This is a great alternative!  I was skeptical at first, seeing as my hair is straight and thin; I wasn&#x27;t sure how well it would stay in.  I&#x27;m glad I took the chance and purchased this, as it is my go to hair item!</li>
            <li> It sounds like a great idea, but it does NOT work. It cannot ever work.  The design is flawed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter where you place it, it will look stupid and unnatural.  do NOT trust those pictures! the hair behind it will fall at an angle that looks weird, simply due to gravity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the teeth are also very hard to hide! you might manage, but that is going to be hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;forget about bumpits!</li>
            <li> i could not use it as I hace naturally curly hair n it just embedded itself in n didnt want to come out.te bristle on the end. I only tried one but walked it next door to my great neice n she loves it!</li>
            <li> The plastic is too hard and it hurts the head. I have never used it after the one time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product awhile back and love it. It helps me make a perfect poof look and there is nothing to it! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I must be an idiot, because I cannot figure these things out. No matter how many different ways I try them, they always make my head look oddly deformed, and they&#x27;re always partially visible. No amount of teasing my already pretty thick hair had made it cover a Bumpit the way they show in the commercials. The Hollywood (bigger) Bumpit makes me look like an alien. The only part of this set that I like and use with any consistency is the Mini Bumpit. It gives my little front poof more structure and helps keep its shape all through a long day. The other two Bumpits in the kit will lay dormant in the bottom of a bathroom drawer until some future Halloween costume calls them back into action.</li>
            <li> The bump it&#x27;s do not work they don&#x27;t even stand the hair. Would not recommend this for anyone to buy</li>
            <li> I have thick, fine hair and this will be easily hidden for me and give me lift that lasts.  It might be more difficult to disguise if your hair is thinner.  If you follow the directions that come with the product, it works great.</li>
            <li> Item is a good accessory to have if you want to jazz up your hair style, its cheap and easy to use.Would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I love it! I believe people use this type of broche because they look fine with these product. thank you.</li>
            <li> Crappy piece of plastic. Shows through the hair even when &amp;#34;teased&amp;#34; a ton. It was a Good idea, but a crappy turnout.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t use for what I bought it for. Couldn&#x27;t figure it out.</li>
            <li> this the only product i liked using for my hair.I like this product because it does not require too much time.</li>
            <li> I receieved the product very fast and I love it!! I also purchased one for my daughter and she practically uses her everyday!!! Thank you!! satisfied customer!</li>
            <li> This is a horrible product.  It sits on your head awkwardly and you better hope the wind doesn&#x27;t blow too hard or too light and don&#x27;t even think about bending over either.  As a matter of fact, don&#x27;t move or else it will fall out.  When it&#x27;s on your head, it doesn&#x27;t even look normal; one is too big and the other is ridiculously small (can you say, \\&quot;cone head\\&quot;?)  Needless to say, I was not pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I just tried it on my hair, and you must have a lot of hair for it to work. my hair is very thin and blond, so the head band is coming out of my hair, because my head is small, plus my hair is thin so you can see the black plastic.&lt;br /&gt;only the tiny one will work for a front little bump. the others, I have the feeling I will use it for buns.</li>
