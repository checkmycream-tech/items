            <li>For twenty some dollars, this is a great cologne, even though its not &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; (eau de toilette, basically a weaker version of full blown perfume).</li>

            <li>A good product at a great price and fast shipping</li>

            <li>the smell is ok</li>
            <li>What I like the most about ordering stuff from Amazon is the speed that they put on every order.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li>Glad there&#x27;s Amazon</li>
            <li>So many women say \\&quot;oh, what&#x27;s your cologne\\&quot; or \\&quot;you smell</li>
            <li>and i love when he uses it.</li>
            <li>I bought it because I love it, so I knew what I was going to get.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re on a budget this is one of the better affordable men&#x27;s fragrances.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my husbands favorite.</li>
            <li>No complaints:)</li>
            <li>For $20 this is better than anything you would find at a discount shelf at Ross or Marshall&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I will buy more as soon as it runs out</li>
            <li>You should consider it as a short-term accessory to your persona and nothing more.</li>
            <li>my favorite perfume ... love</li>
            <li>I wish it smelled more</li>
            <li>It projects incredibly well, as I described, so if you want a refreshing, masculine cologne that smells of citrus and musk and will command attention without being imposing, I enthusiastically recommend Swiss Army</li>
            <li>I use most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a perfume which has always enjoyed its aroma.</li>

            <li>i love...</li>
            <li>And it is priced so much better on amazon than what I find it for in the stores.</li>
            <li>I had to spray it into the air to see how it smells and love it.</li>
            <li>so i figured it had to be a favorite of his,when i asked him</li>
            <li>But that just makes scents.  :-)</li>
            <li>This is his favorite cologne.</li>
            <li>and this is the best with a nice clean male scent!</li>
            <li>liked it because it is 100% original</li>
            <li>This is not something I could wear every day, but it is a nice, clean fragrance.  </li>
            <li>very good product is just what I expected, for the price I paid I am satisfied with the purchase, and would recommend to buy!</li>
            <li>This Eau the Toilette smells great and it&#x27;s the original, not fake.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this...now just hoping that special someone does as well!</li>
            <li>it starts with summer morning ,ending up with fall sunset.superb unique!</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS ONE TOO AS WELL, GREAT OLD TIMER ON THE MARKET.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like an overwhelming strong smell this cologne may not be for you.</li>
            <li>I only use the best and this is the best hands down.</li>
            <li>It really smells good, For the price I personally think it is a very good</li>
            <li>Smells good and came fast..</li>
            <li>Very nice perfume, masculine.</li>
            <li>my boys loved it and said: we got our secret weapon, we all are very pleased and happy with the product</li>
            <li>It arrived exactly when they said it would and at a much better price than you would pay in a department store!</li>
            <li>I love this perfume has an amazing aroma and is very durable in the body and clothing</li>
            <li>Not as Strong as i remember</li>
            <li>I like this fragrance as its not overpoweringly strong.</li>
            <li>If there&#x27;s a strong presence of bergamot and/or lemon, even bette.  </li>
            <li>If there&#x27;s a strong presence of bergamot and/or lemon, even bette.  </li>
            <li>Not too strong.</li>
            <li>I like this fragrance as its not overpoweringly strong.</li>
            <li>strongly recommend the costumer avoiding this  Eau De Toilette.</li>
            <li>It is not a Well-known perfume, but who uses it the first time become addict, a very rich aroma!</li>
            <li>More often than not I find that fragances are too sweet or too musky or too citrusy and so on.</li>
            <li>Not bad, but I like Swiss Unlimited better.</li>
            <li>It projects incredibly well, as I described, so if you want a refreshing, masculine cologne that smells of citrus and musk and will command attention without being imposing, I enthusiastically recommend Swiss Army Classic.</li>
            <li>It has that strong musk smell fit for a man.</li>
            <li>It came quickly and had zero damage!</li>
            <li>Engaging scent and not overpowering or offensive to people with allergies.</li>
            <li>The cologne smells the same as it did 10 years ago, but I think the great scent&#x27;s longevity is shorter now than it used to be.  </li>
            <li>He loves it and it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>My husband smells fabulous in this cologne...</li>
            <li>I will enjoy it a lot.</li>
            <li>a cheap price</li>
            <li>extremely happy with this product I will try after shave after this need to try next in line</li>
            <li>its worth more than what you will pay.</li>
            <li>Such a great scent on my husband.</li>
            <li>So when I find a cologne that strikes a good balance for my personal taste, it gets a prominent spot in my fragrance rotation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very good colonne, classic and never goes old.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had so many positive comments on cologne!  </li>
            <li>Original product, smell nice, i like it so much</li>
            <li>Great smell, quick shipment, definitely recommend!!!</li>
            <li>This is most definitely one of Swiss Army&#x27;s greatest works in their line of male scents.</li>
            <li>It is certainly an original article and category.</li>
            <li>What can be said about a product you are familiar with?</li>
            <li>Not the original product I had purchased before.  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s really nice about this fragrance is that although it commands attention and draws much notice, it&#x27;s very inoffensive and versatile, appealing to both sexes and all ages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought I was getting the original formula of this cologne.  </li>
            <li>This is most definitely one of Swiss Army&#x27;s greatest works in their line of male scents.</li>
            <li>todo bien el articulo llego en buen estado en el tiempo estimado y original como el ofrecido espero</li>
            <li>muy buen producto, es %100  original.</li>
            <li>LASTS IN THIS CHANGE IN A MATTER OF HOURS THERE AND SMELL THE ORIGINAL THAT DECEPTION ...</li>
            <li>and i was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>exelente, producto original</li>
            <li>pretty satisfied</li>
            <li>100% Original el perfume...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a distinct, unique blend of citrus, musk, and a hint of warm spice that is sophisticated, understated, and yet bold, masculine, and inviting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Swiss Army cologne gave a \\&quot;clean scent\\</li>
            <li>Everything is ok with this product.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks you very much.&lt;br /&gt;ItÂ´s was a gift..and muy boyfriend enjoy it a lot.</li>
            <li>While the scent is pleasant, it is definitely not what I</li>
            <li>Very clean and crisp.</li>
            <li>overall I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good occasional-use cologne, meaning it&#x27;s good if you want to smell nice just for a few hours if you&#x27;re going to a party or something, but as for day-long wear, it&#x27;s a no-go.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used most of the top scents including Creed at one point (I like Creed, but IMHO they can be a bit strong for daily wear...</li>
            <li>adopted it on special occasions, and is characterized by the scarcity and quality with others</li>
            <li>special for the day to day ..</li>
            <li>I have been using this cologne since 2007 and its one of my favorites when I have to go parties and special events, otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t recommend..</li>
            <li>thanks a lot thanks to them is precisely what they offered me the article is very nice and is what I wanted thanks</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s getting hard to find, great price!</li>
            <li>, the smell it&#x27;s really great, just what we expected</li>
            <li>but overall it seems to stay for a good amount of time.</li>
            <li>Comes in a neat box and the bottle looks cool too</li>
            <li>Women and Men alike comment on how much they love the scent.  </li>
            <li>good product is for personal use and always buy</li>
            <li>thanks for having some available !</li>
            <li>,he immediately spayed it on and and wore it all day,mother in law said it lasts for a long time and she liked it to,great cologne!</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast, as for the smell I love it for my boyfriend</li>
            <li>And if you were to ask my wifeâs opinion, she would say I am stating it too mildly.</li>
            <li>Pretty quickly, I started noticing how many compliments I consistently received for this.  </li>
            <li>muy buena aparte super responsables y la entrega super rapida y a tiempo</li>
            <li>When I received it, I could see right away that it was not the original cologne, even though the picture represented it to be.  </li>
            <li>Maybe my expectations were too high for a knife manufacturer&#x27;s venture into fragrance. :)</li>
            <li>Very crisp smell.</li>
            <li>The website describes it as âfresh and tangy notes of citrus, blended with lavender, sweet spice and woodsy notes.â</li>
            <li>note: despite it being eau de toilette you don&#x27;t need more than 4 sprays to get people to smell it, you can put more to make it more potent but 4 is fine for a casual day to day basis.</li>
            <li>Probably the best long last men&#x27;s spray out there for the price!!!!!!!Would recommend to any guy!!!!</li>
            <li>Thanks swiss army!!</li>
            <li>Not too strong, but not weak either.</li>
            <li>This is a great scent that one can wear everyday to the office or work, or wherever.</li>
            <li>It smells fresh and not too over-powering.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not unhappy with it,</li>
            <li>Article &#x27;s expected , good packaging and attention , I fulfilled my expectations</li>
            <li>Just as good as I expected for.</li>
            <li>Its light and refreshing, lasts for a short period of time and can be worn at all times, at work or play.</li>
            <li>I have paid 50 for this in a department store and it was still well worth it.</li>
            <li>My favorite so far.</li>
            <li>Its light and refreshing, lasts for a short period of time and can be worn at all times, at work or play.</li>
            <li>i love this cologne since i was like 17 years old</li>
            <li>This is a really nice cologne which last for hours.</li>
            <li>Even the next day, my shirts still have a really nice smell.</li>
            <li>The scent is not too strong and yet it has a sweet masculine smell.  </li>
            <li>This juice smells very good, but it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>Had a slight problem with my original order - Amazon rectified the situation promptly, and I am very pleased with the outcome.</li>
            <li>and I have the boy that is just the right one for him.</li>
            <li>The right smell at the right price.</li>
            <li>I bought half a dozen of my favorite fragances from Amazon and are really satisfied with them.</li>
            <li>It is a good perfume, I recommend it because I really like, I arrive in time expected and as described by.</li>
            <li>in my day it was Dakkar and Polo mostly, there were a few others I don&#x27;t remember off the top of my head.  </li>
            <li>Masculine smell but not too strong.</li>
            <li>I wear it sometimes to mix things up, but for some reason she very much prefers the quite cheaper Halston 1-12.</li>
            <li>you very much for your attention</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear cologne very much but</li>
            <li>thank you very much</li>
            <li>very very goodd</li>
            <li>you very much</li>
            <li>One of the things that I really like about this cologne is that it&#x27;s relatively timeless; although I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s appropriate for below high school age, I can easily see men of all ages wearing Swiss Army cologne.</li>
            <li>Thanks and regards from Colombia!</li>
            <li>the difference is only $15 and smell better.</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to it by a friend of mine, and I had to get it after.</li>
            <li>And got to ask a friend to bring one more back to Taiwan.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This has been my signature, go-to all-seasons fragrance since I first bought it a decade ago.</li>
            <li>Although I also like Lacoste Rouge (red bottle), CK Euphoria, Bleu de Chanel, L&#x27;Homme by YSL, and Jake by Hollister, Swiss Army is what I use most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a truly enticing, sensual, sexy fragrance that&#x27;s not only pleasing to the man wearing it, but also to those nearby.</li>

            <li>$22 for a 3.4 ounce bottle (THANKS AMAZON!)</li>
            <li>I received exactly what I ordered</li>
            <li>of all the big name pricey colognes i&#x27;ve bought, i get the most compliments from my wife on this one.</li>
            <li>Shipped on time and the product was exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>Family and friends love the smell, especially the ladies!</li>
            <li>Kind of musky, peppery with a hint of vanilla.</li>
            <li>Thanks Swiss Army!</li>
            <li>This is first time i ordered any perfume based on the reviews</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d consider it to be one of the top scents along with Perry Ellis 360 Red.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed and wanted.</li>
            <li>This is one of the first times I&#x27;ve ever purchased scent online without smelling it first in person.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would definitely buy better product than this.</li>
            <li>, I really liked the product, what I expected.</li>
            <li>, so i know whats up ;)</li>
            <li>A real classic from Victorinox.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Good for everyday or formal use.</li>
            <li>The popular, or fashionable, colognes are extremely overpriced.</li>
            <li>It came on timely manner, very well wrapped and a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Thanks you very much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been his favorite for a long time</li>
            <li>because it has a sweet but masculine scent.  </li>
            <li>even the guy I&#x27;m currently dating said Swiss Army Classic makes me smell incredibly sexy.</li>
            <li>The smell stays on your skin for most of the day but it doesn&#x27;t emanate into the room around you for very long at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very particular about cologne.</li>
            <li>Very mild smell -  for short time</li>
            <li>Additionally, it seems that they are too much like ladies perfume, or too musky, or too citrusy, etc.</li>
            <li>Rarely does one find a scent that is truly masculine.</li>
            <li>Additionally, it is refreshing and complimentary, not overpowering like the expensive âstylishâ scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Expected a bit more from the Swiss Army brand.</li>
            <li>The price quoted on amazon was much lower than that from department stores.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and I would buy this again.</li>
            <li>Responsible seller, Article fulfilled the requirements.</li>
            <li>Greetings and thanks for everything.</li>
            <li>have real doubts  about this product!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Which is saying something because he is very picky.</li>
            <li>thanks Swiss Army    </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like it that much</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I really like this cologne.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I got this scent as a free sample with one of my orders for Fahrenheit by Christian Dior.  </li>
            <li>, Everything arrived in order, I received it in the stipulated time, thanks</li>
            <li>thanks for everything.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>The product fulfilled the expectations, thanks</li>
            <li>very good&lt;br /&gt;item</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>The price is also reasonable, in stores a 3.4 ounce of this cost ~$50.</li>
            <li>Since this perfume came out, I have always lovedit so much.</li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
            <li>express liberty, Thanks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very picky about my smells</li>
            <li>, why pay that when you can get it on here for much cheaper</li>
            <li>they dont sell these in stores much anymore</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>responsible and quality</li>
            <li>The scent is very intolerable, resulting in sever headache.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>More than expected.</li>
            <li>so i decided to get him the real deal.</li>
            <li>I really suggest you check out the scent before buying it.  </li>
            <li>I wore it the next day at the office and every girl there noticed it, and individually commented on how nice I smelled.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was amazing when I was single in college obviously, but now that I&#x27;m married my wife loves it and wants me to wear it when we go out on the town.</li>
            <li>It has a light smell, it&#x27;s a good cologne to wear everyday or for work or other occasion.</li>
            <li>if you are looking for a simple clean citrus smell, look no further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>they work really well if used under a suit jacket though; fortunately my days of suits are limited now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Let me say first that it is masculine.</li>
            <li>have received quite a few compliments from women, but more importantly, my wife actually likes it â</li>
            <li>for performance, Swiss Army is better than average.</li>
            <li>Turns out, he loves the smell, I love the smell and other people compliment him on it!</li>
            <li>couple months ago I saw this Victorinox Swiss Army Classic listed</li>
            <li>Classic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a classic scent that I have worn for years .</li>
            <li>I had bought Swiss Army Classic twice before in brick and morter store.  </li>
            <li>Army Classic is described as consisting of notes of mint, bergamot, lavender, clary sage, musk, cardamom, coriander, and ginger.</li>
            <li>Initially it&#x27;s the ginger and bergamot that are most noticeable, followed by the cardamom and musk, and finally rounded out with sage and lavender.&lt;br</li>

            <li>more when they do not accept the return of these products really arrependido to buy and waste my money.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended with also buy again.</li>
            <li>I remember high school</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I received this cologne as a gift during my senior year in high school.</li>
            <li>It lasts on my manly man for about 8 hours and lingers on his clothes a little bit more.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely a manly man smell and well worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>It is true that this is scent comes on strong and gets subtle as it&#x27;s worn, but</li>
            <li>I wore Lagerfeld during those days and a different scent (if done right)</li>
            <li>You really need to spray it on good to make it last for any measurable amount of time, and even then it will only stay on you long enough for two hours or so.</li>
            <li>The product was definitely new and not tampered with.</li>
            <li>my hubby cannot live without it.    </li>
            <li>Was looking for a new cologne for my boyfriend when I saw this.</li>
            <li>amazom.com 100% new in box with no product details</li>
            <li>The scent is the exact same, the bottle altered slightly over time, and sometimes inconsistencies on the manufacturer listed on the packaging, but it&#x27;s still the same great product.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s reality, it seems the original this perfume, in that I&#x27;m giving my opinion later, you do not use it when removing them, but to use the smell goes very fast, or is expired or imitation is not recommend to buy them ...</li>
            <li>, this is the last time I bought perfume on Amazon, the price is not to low compare with the original</li>
            <li>Product is exactly the same but seller provides one image, which does not represent what it delivers.</li>
            <li>That bottle is still sitting only used until my first order of this cologne arrived a couple days</li>
            <li>name/brand may be different but the smell is exactly as it was before.</li>
            <li>Ok - I should have listened to other reviewers that said this isn&#x27;t the same formula as the old one.</li>
            <li>Thankfully I still have the old aluminum Bottle Holster to slide the new bottle into.  </li>
            <li>A few sprays (1 or 2) easily lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I would use it as an everyday cologne as it was inexpensive cologne and different from using Axe like most high school students.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this hands down, although dont expect the fragrance to last for more than a couple of hours.</li>
            <li>and how it lasts a long time and how I have not once heard any negative comments about this fragrance and in fact many have ordered it right in front of me once they found out about it</li>
            <li>Finally, I will certainly use it for my shoes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light smell but &amp;#34;still a little man smell to it&amp;#34; as my wife said.</li>
            <li>The lid is different, before it had a little ring on top of the lid.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m nearly 50 now.)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what else may have changed with the rebranding, but I&#x27;d be surprised if the scent changed.</li>
            <li>It reminds me somewhat of the old Brut cologne or an aftershave.</li>
            <li>send my a REAL Swiss Army or give me back my money</li>
            <li>and i can tell it does not smell to anything after 10 minutes, buyed directly from amazon llc,</li>
            <li>This is the type of cologne you would like if you prefer the mature smelling ones, not sporty, or sweet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Too much hastle for me to return especially after opening it and trying.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 27 years old at the time of this review.</li>
            <li>15 year old began wearing it as well and his classmates like it too.  </li>
            <li>The result is a pleasing masculine scent.</li>
            <li>I like this odor for my Dad, well enough to have used the whole bottle on just Sunday sprays and repurchasing it.</li>
            <li>I have a bottle that&#x27;s about 6 years old that I needed to replace.</li>
            <li>The old formula was gold.</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;m giving it to him early.</li>
            <li>I bought this because the image shows the Old version (the case that does not say VICTORINOX).</li>
            <li>/&gt;(I sometimes secretly spray it on my pillow, because I love it that much).</li>
            <li>The smell is not strong and good for everyday use.</li>
            <li>But the reviews from other shoppers made this worth a gamble.</li>
            <li>Hopefully you will understand that I am not declaring Victorinox Swiss Army Classic to be the one and only cologne for all men.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Swiss Army Classic for probably ten years of so.</li>
            <li>&gt; The aroma stays for a while, but the older version lasted definitely longer.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend the essence and aroma of the perfume does not equal another.</li>
            <li>This one wears out a little too quick, I&#x27;m thinking I may have gotten a counterfeit</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really disappointing that it doesn&#x27;t last longer than it does because it smells so great.</li>
            <li>Decent aroma which lasts a fairly long time.</li>
            <li>This is not original brand, when I use the perfume smells good, but one hour late smells different</li>
            <li>The Product Description points out that there âare several factors that can affect the natural smell of your skin and, in turn, the way a scent smells on you.  </li>
            <li>I was really surprised when I realized it came both the spray and the shower gel, the information says it&#x27;s just only one!</li>
            <li>Meets all my expectations, what I expected and I would recommend to those who are very fond of this fragrance.</li>
            <li>He is keeping it a secret though :)  </li>
            <li>The scent is so unique that I could identify that its my hubby if he happens to walk past my office (working in the same company)</li>
            <li>Complex and rich fragrance.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a decent fragrance, but like another comment said, it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>Not bad, just a little different, and the scent does not last nearly as long.</li>
            <li>but it seems to very watered down version.</li>
            <li>i will try to be neutral, the smells its simply ok a little alcoholic smell, the smells dissapear after 5 minutes, tried to use on another person just to check the smells and the others people sensation</li>
            <li>A classic, nice and flashy, and practically for everyday use.</li>
            <li>I initially started using this back in high school when I was looking for a light/fresh scent that wasn&#x27;t worn by every other guy in school.  </li>
            <li>Its hard to spray it and keep it at a discrete smell because its so powerful.</li>

            <li> A kind of indulgency with myself.</li>
            <li> Smells really good, the girls really love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, packaged nicely, been a fave scent for awhile now.  </li>

            <li> excellent and of course or recommend the whole community and the product</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still one of the best scents on the market you can tell because the price hasn&#x27;t really dropped since it came out.</li>
            <li> Nice smell.</li>

            <li> The surface is not metal, now it&#x27;s plastic, and doesn&#x27;t smell all day, I liked it as it was before...</li>
            <li> excellent condition recomeindo provider thanks</li>
            <li> The case used to be some kind of metal , now it is plastic.</li>

            <li> The only thing better than looking good and smelling good is looking good and smelling good at a bargain price!</li>
            <li> Its really good for $25 , nice musty scent but not to strong.</li>
            <li> For twenty some dollars, this is a great cologne, even though its not &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; (eau de toilette, basically a weaker version of full blown perfume).</li>
            <li> /&gt;ItÂ´s worth , cheap and one of the best colognes by Swiss Army.</li>
            <li> A good product at a great price and fast shipping</li>
            <li> ideal scent is crisp, refreshing and somewhat citrusy with notes of musk and a touch of warm spice.</li>

            <li> It projects incredibly well, as I described, so if you want a refreshing, masculine cologne that smells of citrus and musk and will command attention without being imposing, I enthusiastically recommend Swiss Army</li>

            <li> And it is priced so much better on amazon than what I find it for in the stores.</li>
            <li> I had to spray it into the air to see how it smells and love it.</li>
            <li> so i figured it had to be a favorite of his,when i asked him</li>
            <li> But that just makes scents.  :-)</li>
            <li> This is his favorite cologne.</li>
            <li> and this is the best with a nice clean male scent!</li>
            <li> liked it because it is 100% original</li>
            <li> This is not something I could wear every day, but it is a nice, clean fragrance.  </li>

            <li> This Eau the Toilette smells great and it&#x27;s the original, not fake.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this...now just hoping that special someone does as well!</li>
            <li> it starts with summer morning ,ending up with fall sunset.superb unique!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS ONE TOO AS WELL, GREAT OLD TIMER ON THE MARKET.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like an overwhelming strong smell this cologne may not be for you.</li>

            <li> Very nice perfume, masculine.</li>
            <li> my boys loved it and said: we got our secret weapon, we all are very pleased and happy with the product</li>

            <li> I love this perfume has an amazing aroma and is very durable in the body and clothing</li>
            <li> Not as Strong as i remember</li>
            <li> I like this fragrance as its not overpoweringly strong.</li>
            <li> If there&#x27;s a strong presence of bergamot and/or lemon, even bette.  </li>
            <li> If there&#x27;s a strong presence of bergamot and/or lemon, even bette.  </li>
            <li> Not too strong.</li>
            <li> I like this fragrance as its not overpoweringly strong.</li>
            <li> strongly recommend the costumer avoiding this  Eau De Toilette.</li>
            <li> It is not a Well-known perfume, but who uses it the first time become addict, a very rich aroma!</li>
            <li> More often than not I find that fragances are too sweet or too musky or too citrusy and so on.</li>
            <li> Not bad, but I like Swiss Unlimited better.</li>
            <li> It projects incredibly well, as I described, so if you want a refreshing, masculine cologne that smells of citrus and musk and will command attention without being imposing, I enthusiastically recommend Swiss Army Classic.</li>
            <li> It has that strong musk smell fit for a man.</li>
            <li> It came quickly and had zero damage!</li>
            <li> Engaging scent and not overpowering or offensive to people with allergies.</li>
            <li> The cologne smells the same as it did 10 years ago, but I think the great scent&#x27;s longevity is shorter now than it used to be.  </li>
            <li> He loves it and it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> My husband smells fabulous in this cologne...</li>
            <li> I will enjoy it a lot.</li>
            <li> a cheap price</li>
            <li> extremely happy with this product I will try after shave after this need to try next in line</li>
            <li> its worth more than what you will pay.</li>
            <li> Such a great scent on my husband.</li>
            <li> So when I find a cologne that strikes a good balance for my personal taste, it gets a prominent spot in my fragrance rotation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very good colonne, classic and never goes old.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had so many positive comments on cologne!  </li>
            <li> Original product, smell nice, i like it so much</li>
            <li> Great smell, quick shipment, definitely recommend!!!</li>
            <li> This is most definitely one of Swiss Army&#x27;s greatest works in their line of male scents.</li>
            <li> It is certainly an original article and category.</li>
            <li> What can be said about a product you are familiar with?</li>
            <li> Not the original product I had purchased before.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s really nice about this fragrance is that although it commands attention and draws much notice, it&#x27;s very inoffensive and versatile, appealing to both sexes and all ages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting the original formula of this cologne.  </li>
            <li> This is most definitely one of Swiss Army&#x27;s greatest works in their line of male scents.</li>
            <li> todo bien el articulo llego en buen estado en el tiempo estimado y original como el ofrecido espero</li>
            <li> muy buen producto, es %100  original.</li>
            <li> LASTS IN THIS CHANGE IN A MATTER OF HOURS THERE AND SMELL THE ORIGINAL THAT DECEPTION ...</li>
            <li> and i was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> exelente, producto original</li>
            <li> pretty satisfied</li>
            <li> 100% Original el perfume...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a distinct, unique blend of citrus, musk, and a hint of warm spice that is sophisticated, understated, and yet bold, masculine, and inviting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Swiss Army cologne gave a \\&quot;clean scent\\</li>
            <li> Everything is ok with this product.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks you very much.&lt;br /&gt;ItÂ´s was a gift..and muy boyfriend enjoy it a lot.</li>
            <li> While the scent is pleasant, it is definitely not what I</li>
            <li> Very clean and crisp.</li>
            <li> overall I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good occasional-use cologne, meaning it&#x27;s good if you want to smell nice just for a few hours if you&#x27;re going to a party or something, but as for day-long wear, it&#x27;s a no-go.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used most of the top scents including Creed at one point (I like Creed, but IMHO they can be a bit strong for daily wear...</li>
            <li> adopted it on special occasions, and is characterized by the scarcity and quality with others</li>
            <li> special for the day to day ..</li>
            <li> I have been using this cologne since 2007 and its one of my favorites when I have to go parties and special events, otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t recommend..</li>
            <li> thanks a lot thanks to them is precisely what they offered me the article is very nice and is what I wanted thanks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting hard to find, great price!</li>
            <li> , the smell it&#x27;s really great, just what we expected</li>
            <li> but overall it seems to stay for a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> Comes in a neat box and the bottle looks cool too</li>
            <li> Women and Men alike comment on how much they love the scent.  </li>
            <li> good product is for personal use and always buy</li>
            <li> thanks for having some available !</li>
            <li> ,he immediately spayed it on and and wore it all day,mother in law said it lasts for a long time and she liked it to,great cologne!</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast, as for the smell I love it for my boyfriend</li>
            <li> And if you were to ask my wifeâs opinion, she would say I am stating it too mildly.</li>
            <li> Pretty quickly, I started noticing how many compliments I consistently received for this.  </li>
            <li> muy buena aparte super responsables y la entrega super rapida y a tiempo</li>
            <li> When I received it, I could see right away that it was not the original cologne, even though the picture represented it to be.  </li>
            <li> Maybe my expectations were too high for a knife manufacturer&#x27;s venture into fragrance. :)</li>
            <li> Very crisp smell.</li>
            <li> The website describes it as âfresh and tangy notes of citrus, blended with lavender, sweet spice and woodsy notes.â</li>
            <li> note: despite it being eau de toilette you don&#x27;t need more than 4 sprays to get people to smell it, you can put more to make it more potent but 4 is fine for a casual day to day basis.</li>
            <li> Probably the best long last men&#x27;s spray out there for the price!!!!!!!Would recommend to any guy!!!!</li>
            <li> Thanks swiss army!!</li>
            <li> Not too strong, but not weak either.</li>
            <li> This is a great scent that one can wear everyday to the office or work, or wherever.</li>
            <li> It smells fresh and not too over-powering.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not unhappy with it,</li>
            <li> Article &#x27;s expected , good packaging and attention , I fulfilled my expectations</li>
            <li> Just as good as I expected for.</li>
            <li> Its light and refreshing, lasts for a short period of time and can be worn at all times, at work or play.</li>
            <li> I have paid 50 for this in a department store and it was still well worth it.</li>
            <li> My favorite so far.</li>
            <li> Its light and refreshing, lasts for a short period of time and can be worn at all times, at work or play.</li>
            <li> i love this cologne since i was like 17 years old</li>
            <li> This is a really nice cologne which last for hours.</li>
            <li> Even the next day, my shirts still have a really nice smell.</li>
            <li> The scent is not too strong and yet it has a sweet masculine smell.  </li>
            <li> This juice smells very good, but it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Had a slight problem with my original order - Amazon rectified the situation promptly, and I am very pleased with the outcome.</li>
            <li> and I have the boy that is just the right one for him.</li>
            <li> The right smell at the right price.</li>
            <li> I bought half a dozen of my favorite fragances from Amazon and are really satisfied with them.</li>
            <li> It is a good perfume, I recommend it because I really like, I arrive in time expected and as described by.</li>
            <li> in my day it was Dakkar and Polo mostly, there were a few others I don&#x27;t remember off the top of my head.  </li>
            <li> Masculine smell but not too strong.</li>
            <li> I wear it sometimes to mix things up, but for some reason she very much prefers the quite cheaper Halston 1-12.</li>
            <li> you very much for your attention</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear cologne very much but</li>
            <li> thank you very much</li>
            <li> very very goodd</li>
            <li> you very much</li>
            <li> One of the things that I really like about this cologne is that it&#x27;s relatively timeless; although I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s appropriate for below high school age, I can easily see men of all ages wearing Swiss Army cologne.</li>
            <li> Thanks and regards from Colombia!</li>
            <li> the difference is only $15 and smell better.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to it by a friend of mine, and I had to get it after.</li>
            <li> And got to ask a friend to bring one more back to Taiwan.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This has been my signature, go-to all-seasons fragrance since I first bought it a decade ago.</li>
            <li> Although I also like Lacoste Rouge (red bottle), CK Euphoria, Bleu de Chanel, L&#x27;Homme by YSL, and Jake by Hollister, Swiss Army is what I use most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a truly enticing, sensual, sexy fragrance that&#x27;s not only pleasing to the man wearing it, but also to those nearby.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a truly enticing, sensual, sexy fragrance that&#x27;s not only pleasing to the man wearing it, but also to those nearby.</li>
            <li> $22 for a 3.4 ounce bottle (THANKS AMAZON!)</li>
            <li> I received exactly what I ordered</li>
            <li> of all the big name pricey colognes i&#x27;ve bought, i get the most compliments from my wife on this one.</li>
            <li> Shipped on time and the product was exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> Family and friends love the smell, especially the ladies!</li>
            <li> Kind of musky, peppery with a hint of vanilla.</li>
            <li> Thanks Swiss Army!</li>
            <li> This is first time i ordered any perfume based on the reviews</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d consider it to be one of the top scents along with Perry Ellis 360 Red.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed and wanted.</li>
            <li> This is one of the first times I&#x27;ve ever purchased scent online without smelling it first in person.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would definitely buy better product than this.</li>
            <li> , I really liked the product, what I expected.</li>
            <li> , so i know whats up ;)</li>
            <li> A real classic from Victorinox.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Good for everyday or formal use.</li>
            <li> The popular, or fashionable, colognes are extremely overpriced.</li>
            <li> It came on timely manner, very well wrapped and a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Thanks you very much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been his favorite for a long time</li>
            <li> because it has a sweet but masculine scent.  </li>
            <li> even the guy I&#x27;m currently dating said Swiss Army Classic makes me smell incredibly sexy.</li>
            <li> The smell stays on your skin for most of the day but it doesn&#x27;t emanate into the room around you for very long at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very particular about cologne.</li>
            <li> Very mild smell -  for short time</li>
            <li> Additionally, it seems that they are too much like ladies perfume, or too musky, or too citrusy, etc.</li>
            <li> Rarely does one find a scent that is truly masculine.</li>
            <li> Additionally, it is refreshing and complimentary, not overpowering like the expensive âstylishâ scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Expected a bit more from the Swiss Army brand.</li>
            <li> The price quoted on amazon was much lower than that from department stores.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Responsible seller, Article fulfilled the requirements.</li>
            <li> Greetings and thanks for everything.</li>
            <li> have real doubts  about this product!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Which is saying something because he is very picky.</li>
            <li> thanks Swiss Army    </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like it that much</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I really like this cologne.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I got this scent as a free sample with one of my orders for Fahrenheit by Christian Dior.  </li>
            <li> , Everything arrived in order, I received it in the stipulated time, thanks</li>
            <li> thanks for everything.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> The product fulfilled the expectations, thanks</li>
            <li> very good&lt;br /&gt;item</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> The price is also reasonable, in stores a 3.4 ounce of this cost ~$50.</li>
            <li> Since this perfume came out, I have always lovedit so much.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
            <li> express liberty, Thanks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky about my smells</li>
            <li> , why pay that when you can get it on here for much cheaper</li>
            <li> they dont sell these in stores much anymore</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> responsible and quality</li>
            <li> The scent is very intolerable, resulting in sever headache.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> More than expected.</li>
            <li> so i decided to get him the real deal.</li>
            <li> I really suggest you check out the scent before buying it.  </li>
            <li> I wore it the next day at the office and every girl there noticed it, and individually commented on how nice I smelled.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was amazing when I was single in college obviously, but now that I&#x27;m married my wife loves it and wants me to wear it when we go out on the town.</li>
            <li> It has a light smell, it&#x27;s a good cologne to wear everyday or for work or other occasion.</li>
            <li> if you are looking for a simple clean citrus smell, look no further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> they work really well if used under a suit jacket though; fortunately my days of suits are limited now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Let me say first that it is masculine.</li>
            <li> have received quite a few compliments from women, but more importantly, my wife actually likes it â</li>
            <li> for performance, Swiss Army is better than average.</li>
            <li> Turns out, he loves the smell, I love the smell and other people compliment him on it!</li>
            <li> couple months ago I saw this Victorinox Swiss Army Classic listed</li>
            <li> Classic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a classic scent that I have worn for years .</li>
            <li> I had bought Swiss Army Classic twice before in brick and morter store.  </li>
            <li> Army Classic is described as consisting of notes of mint, bergamot, lavender, clary sage, musk, cardamom, coriander, and ginger.</li>
            <li> Initially it&#x27;s the ginger and bergamot that are most noticeable, followed by the cardamom and musk, and finally rounded out with sage and lavender.&lt;br</li>

            <li> more when they do not accept the return of these products really arrependido to buy and waste my money.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended with also buy again.</li>
            <li> I remember high school</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I received this cologne as a gift during my senior year in high school.</li>
            <li> It lasts on my manly man for about 8 hours and lingers on his clothes a little bit more.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely a manly man smell and well worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> It is true that this is scent comes on strong and gets subtle as it&#x27;s worn, but</li>
            <li> I wore Lagerfeld during those days and a different scent (if done right)</li>
            <li> You really need to spray it on good to make it last for any measurable amount of time, and even then it will only stay on you long enough for two hours or so.</li>
            <li> The product was definitely new and not tampered with.</li>
            <li> my hubby cannot live without it.    </li>
            <li> Was looking for a new cologne for my boyfriend when I saw this.</li>
            <li> amazom.com 100% new in box with no product details</li>
            <li> The scent is the exact same, the bottle altered slightly over time, and sometimes inconsistencies on the manufacturer listed on the packaging, but it&#x27;s still the same great product.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s reality, it seems the original this perfume, in that I&#x27;m giving my opinion later, you do not use it when removing them, but to use the smell goes very fast, or is expired or imitation is not recommend to buy them ...</li>
            <li> , this is the last time I bought perfume on Amazon, the price is not to low compare with the original</li>
            <li> Product is exactly the same but seller provides one image, which does not represent what it delivers.</li>
            <li> That bottle is still sitting only used until my first order of this cologne arrived a couple days</li>
            <li> name/brand may be different but the smell is exactly as it was before.</li>
            <li> Ok - I should have listened to other reviewers that said this isn&#x27;t the same formula as the old one.</li>
            <li> Thankfully I still have the old aluminum Bottle Holster to slide the new bottle into.  </li>
            <li> A few sprays (1 or 2) easily lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I would use it as an everyday cologne as it was inexpensive cologne and different from using Axe like most high school students.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this hands down, although dont expect the fragrance to last for more than a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> and how it lasts a long time and how I have not once heard any negative comments about this fragrance and in fact many have ordered it right in front of me once they found out about it</li>
            <li> Finally, I will certainly use it for my shoes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light smell but &amp;#34;still a little man smell to it&amp;#34; as my wife said.</li>
            <li> The lid is different, before it had a little ring on top of the lid.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m nearly 50 now.)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what else may have changed with the rebranding, but I&#x27;d be surprised if the scent changed.</li>
            <li> It reminds me somewhat of the old Brut cologne or an aftershave.</li>
            <li> send my a REAL Swiss Army or give me back my money</li>
            <li> and i can tell it does not smell to anything after 10 minutes, buyed directly from amazon llc,</li>
            <li> This is the type of cologne you would like if you prefer the mature smelling ones, not sporty, or sweet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Too much hastle for me to return especially after opening it and trying.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 27 years old at the time of this review.</li>
            <li> 15 year old began wearing it as well and his classmates like it too.  </li>
            <li> The result is a pleasing masculine scent.</li>
            <li> I like this odor for my Dad, well enough to have used the whole bottle on just Sunday sprays and repurchasing it.</li>
            <li> I have a bottle that&#x27;s about 6 years old that I needed to replace.</li>
            <li> The old formula was gold.</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m giving it to him early.</li>
            <li> I bought this because the image shows the Old version (the case that does not say VICTORINOX).</li>
            <li> /&gt;(I sometimes secretly spray it on my pillow, because I love it that much).</li>
            <li> The smell is not strong and good for everyday use.</li>
            <li> But the reviews from other shoppers made this worth a gamble.</li>
            <li> Hopefully you will understand that I am not declaring Victorinox Swiss Army Classic to be the one and only cologne for all men.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Swiss Army Classic for probably ten years of so.</li>
            <li> &gt; The aroma stays for a while, but the older version lasted definitely longer.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend the essence and aroma of the perfume does not equal another.</li>
            <li> This one wears out a little too quick, I&#x27;m thinking I may have gotten a counterfeit</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really disappointing that it doesn&#x27;t last longer than it does because it smells so great.</li>
            <li> Decent aroma which lasts a fairly long time.</li>
            <li> This is not original brand, when I use the perfume smells good, but one hour late smells different</li>
            <li> The Product Description points out that there âare several factors that can affect the natural smell of your skin and, in turn, the way a scent smells on you.  </li>
            <li> I was really surprised when I realized it came both the spray and the shower gel, the information says it&#x27;s just only one!</li>
            <li> Meets all my expectations, what I expected and I would recommend to those who are very fond of this fragrance.</li>
            <li> He is keeping it a secret though :)  </li>
            <li> The scent is so unique that I could identify that its my hubby if he happens to walk past my office (working in the same company)</li>
            <li> Complex and rich fragrance.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a decent fragrance, but like another comment said, it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Not bad, just a little different, and the scent does not last nearly as long.</li>
            <li> but it seems to very watered down version.</li>
            <li> i will try to be neutral, the smells its simply ok a little alcoholic smell, the smells dissapear after 5 minutes, tried to use on another person just to check the smells and the others people sensation</li>
            <li> A classic, nice and flashy, and practically for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I initially started using this back in high school when I was looking for a light/fresh scent that wasn&#x27;t worn by every other guy in school.  </li>
            <li> Its hard to spray it and keep it at a discrete smell because its so powerful.</li>
            <li> It smells different and the smell did not last for long time, will not order next time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure whether it is a real one.</li>
            <li> The odor doesn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li> The scent last really long even after two washes...    </li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t think it will last that long.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really last so long.</li>
            <li> It lasts really long, I can smell it on clothes the next day.</li>
            <li> How long the scent will last</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> This is a nice smell I enjoy smelling on my husband, its hard to find but at least Amazon.com still sells it or I would go crazy</li>
            <li> I just got my new bottle in the mail, a few days late, but that didn&#x27;t really bother me.</li>
            <li> It sort of reminds me of Old Spice however just a little bit</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s an EDT cologne, I expected it to last a bit longer than it does.</li>
            <li> gave inly 4 stars because I it doesn&#x27;t stays on you for long periods of time.</li>
            <li> I hope excuse what I&#x27;ll say</li>
            <li> The extra star I&#x27;m giving is due to bottle design.</li>
            <li> the only thing is that it should last a little smell of it ...</li>
            <li> The scent itself was entirely different than what I was expecting, it seems like it&#x27;s almost...watered down.  </li>
            <li> I paid half of what I would have paid at a local department store.  </li>
            <li> Luckily Swiss Army products tend to be of a high quality, and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed by this product.</li>
            <li> have had women come up to me even when I am totally out of shape and a mess and ask &amp;#34;What [scent]</li>
            <li> I wish it would last a little longer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d also add that it&#x27;s not very distinctive.</li>
            <li> The product was quality and was shipped carefully.</li>
            <li> Fragrance as we expected: Odor enduring in time.</li>
            <li> Everything as expected.</li>
            <li> Definitely not as strong and it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; to you like the last bottle I had purchased (in store).  </li>
            <li> &quot;; it&#x27;s a little weaker than a \\&quot;Parfume\\&quot; -- which isn&#x27;t bad, it just means you have to use a little more to get the same level of scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He had an imitation bottle of this on his dresser and it was empty</li>
            <li> I had my doubts in choosing which previously had a perfume of these, but the packaging was a little different, and did not know if the perfume changed too, but</li>
            <li> I received it in a timely matter due to Amazon Prime.  </li>
            <li> &quot; it wasn&#x27;t an overpowering cologne as other colognes in the market.</li>
            <li> It disappears only after 1 hour and need at least 5-6 sprays to project.</li>
            <li> Was not worth it.</li>
            <li> Since Victorinox bought the brand I have the feeling that the scent and the time it gets fixed in your skin or clothes has decreased.  </li>
            <li> This fancy cloth black bag does not come together with the perfume!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To start, the casing was plastic instead of metal like previous bottles I had purchased.  </li>
            <li> A little of CK One.  </li>
            <li> THIS PERFUME IS A FRAUD, IS NOT ORIGINAL, I HAVE YEARS AND USING THIS PERFUME SCENT</li>
            <li> /&gt;Obviously, I was disappointed years back when I learned normal vendors no longer carried the product, so I began ordering on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday and received compliments from my friends.</li>
            <li> When I purchased, it had the round Wenger logo, not the Shield Victorinox logo that is pictured</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not over powering at all, I like to put a few sprays on my bed spread after the bed is made.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cologne for a few days now</li>
            <li> I used this product for a few years here and there.</li>
            <li> everyday scent.</li>
            <li> amazon should not sell these restricted products to their customers and make them waste time and money seems a mockery and a delusion of amazon and</li>
            <li> want my fancy cloth black bag!</li>
            <li> I like this as its not strong.</li>
            <li> This new formula smells soapy and is so disappointing.</li>
            <li> The product was in bad condition!!!&lt;br /&gt;It doesnt smell like a real Swiss Army.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After an hour, I&#x27;m not sure anyone would notice the scent unless they were within a foot&#x27;s distance.</li>
            <li> Definitely not my favorite</li>
            <li> I discovered this cologne years ago in a perfume store, but Amazon usually saves me about $20 on the store price.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ll usually still smell it at night when I go to bed unless I&#x27;ve showered.</li>
            <li> It is totally fake and it is not the actual product of Swiss Army.</li>
            <li> One does get a hint of Citrius mixed with a faint lavender with a woody type scent.</li>
            <li> I received this from my girl who thought I needed some new cologne to put in my current \\&quot;boring rotation\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding colognes I am not alergic to</li>
            <li> This cologne is hard to find, as it has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding it elsewhere.</li>
            <li> A bit subtle, not over powering, but yet</li>
            <li> I spray 2 or 3 pumps on my chest, one on a wrist and then rub my wrists together, and once behind each ear</li>
            <li> THAT I&#x27;m like my secret recipe of colognes I have.</li>
            <li> This new swiss army by vitromax is HORRIBLE</li>
            <li> You buy a phone in your store and get me flawed</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li> I would reccomend this product because is not as expensive as others.</li>
            <li> , ill order again soon!</li>
            <li> I had a woman randomly hug me just to smell my cologne!  </li>
            <li> So Sad :(</li>
            <li> but I think that stuff stinks so bad.  </li>
            <li> and I am somewhat disappointed with it.</li>
            <li> After using once or twice, I was really disappointed by this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I just hate that it&#x27;s out of stock now.</li>
            <li> has very bad quality.</li>
            <li> It is the worst cologne I ever spend money on.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Not as Strong as i remember but it is good still</li>
            <li> My friend bought this for me and she likes it. I wear it sometimes to mix things up, but for some reason she very much prefers the quite cheaper Halston 1-12. I like &#x27;em both, but I also think the Halston 1-12 smells a tad better. I&#x27;ve been wearing the Halston 1-12 since college. (I&#x27;m nearly 50 now.)</li>
            <li> excellent product very happy with everything and fast shipping thank you very much</li>
            <li> Excelent! I Like It...</li>
            <li> great product. five star. I recommend to buy this.</li>
            <li> After wearing colognes for a couple decades I had become burned-out on them. The popular, or fashionable, colognes are extremely overpriced. Additionally, it seems that they are too much like ladies perfume, or too musky, or too citrusy, etc. Rarely does one find a scent that is truly masculine. And if you were to ask my wifeâs opinion, she would say I am stating it too mildly. She hates the overpowering aromas worn by men these days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple months ago I saw this Victorinox Swiss Army Classic listed and I bought it on an impulse. I am certainly glad I did. I have seen it described in these reviews as an &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; scent or âtimeless.â The website describes it as âfresh and tangy notes of citrus, blended with lavender, sweet spice and woodsy notes.â Let me say first that it is masculine. Additionally, it is refreshing and complimentary, not overpowering like the expensive âstylishâ scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received quite a few compliments from women, but more importantly, my wife actually likes it â no complaints there. The Product Description points out that there âare several factors that can affect the natural smell of your skin and, in turn, the way a scent smells on you.  For instance, your mood, stress level, age, body chemistry, diet, and current medications may all alter the scents you wear.â Personally, I put one spray on my chest after showering and that will last me the rest of the day. Hopefully you will understand that I am not declaring Victorinox Swiss Army Classic to be the one and only cologne for all men. However, it is the one for me and I am certainly glad I found it.</li>
            <li> Good stuff,definitely worth buying, i will continue to buy once i run out</li>
            <li> The aroma is very pleasant and the article meets my expectations of quality and price! Thanks and regards from Colombia!</li>
            <li> excellent price, smell good!</li>
            <li> Great scent for what its worth. I got sever compliments and curiosities. Its a nice amount for what you pay for. I wish it would last a little longer but overall it seems to stay for a good amount of time. I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> I tried a couple of others before I stumbled on to this one. It smells fresh and not too over-powering. I use it everyday and received compliments from my friends. Recommend.</li>
            <li> i Buy it for a gift, it was perfect</li>
            <li> excellent fragrance for a gentleman.</li>
            <li> This was a great price on this cologne. I paid half of what I would have paid at a local department store.  I received it in a timely matter due to Amazon Prime.  Great purchase!</li>
            <li> Update: things have changed since 2007! This product may be Victorinox branded now, I haven&#x27;t bought recently. I don&#x27;t know what else may have changed with the rebranding, but I&#x27;d be surprised if the scent changed. When I purchased, it had the round Wenger logo, not the Shield Victorinox logo that is pictured now.&lt;br /&gt;Original 2007 review follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two different Swiss Army brands; Wenger, and Victorinox (though Victorinox recently bought Wenger, according to Wikipedia). The Wenger brand tends to cater more to the economy market, and I think it shows in this Eau De Toilette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a decent fragrance, but like another comment said, it doesn&#x27;t last very long. I&#x27;d also add that it&#x27;s not very distinctive. It reminds me somewhat of the old Brut cologne or an aftershave. Keep in mind that it&#x27;s an \\&quot;Eau De Toilette\\&quot;; it&#x27;s a little weaker than a \\&quot;Parfume\\&quot; -- which isn&#x27;t bad, it just means you have to use a little more to get the same level of scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not unhappy with it, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d get it again now that I&#x27;ve tried it out. Maybe my expectations were too high for a knife manufacturer&#x27;s venture into fragrance. :)</li>
            <li> Swiss Army By Swiss Army For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4 Ounces (Purchased on 02/26/2010)   by Swiss Army     excellent</li>
            <li> very happy. This perfume is the one I use daily. I love it.</li>
            <li> Really good product and good buy as well.</li>
            <li> Expected a bit more from the Swiss Army brand. Decent aroma which lasts a fairly long time. Lots of citrus-aroma in this.</li>
            <li> Not bad, but I like Swiss Unlimited better. The odor doesn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li> I look and smell good now :)</li>
            <li> I love this perfume has an amazing aroma and is very durable in the body and clothing</li>
            <li> I simply loved this cologne, its one of my favourite now. Highly recommended. The price quoted on amazon was much lower than that from department stores.</li>
            <li> Smells good but not overpowering and lasts throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Excellent care, very friendly and cordial, the purchase was made so easy and secure. Highly recommend them. They are excellent high-quality sellers.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son for Christmas. He loved it, said it smelled great on him! Thank you :)</li>
            <li> Article &#x27;s expected , good packaging and attention , I fulfilled my expectations</li>
            <li> excellent product, I recommend it without a doubt.</li>
            <li> Still the best perfume for meeee! Glad i ordered this item again, ill order again soon! Thanks swiss army!! More perfume like this pls</li>
            <li> I have used this fragrance for several years. I continually receive compliments and inquiries as to what it is and where it can be obtained. Engaging scent and not overpowering or offensive to people with allergies. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It was shipped prior to posted ETA. The product was quality and was shipped carefully.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  I like the smell</li>
            <li> great item for the price</li>
            <li> Perfume smell doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> This is most definitely one of Swiss Army&#x27;s greatest works in their line of male scents. Lasts all day and has the scent that brings you the compliments you look for in a great cologne with a good bargain price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would buy again.</li>
            <li> It was the perfect gift for my brother, 5 stars</li>
            <li> I just got my new bottle in the mail, a few days late, but that didn&#x27;t really bother me. The product was definitely new and not tampered with. I wore it the next day at the office and every girl there noticed it, and individually commented on how nice I smelled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am looking forward to how this cologne treats me in the college atmosphere. I love the way I smell with it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I have been using this for a month now. This cologne has gotten me ladies. I put it on, then the start getting kinky all of the sudden. Don&#x27;t steal my scent.</li>
            <li> My daughter bought this for my husband several years ago as a gift. He loves it! Everyone loves it! I have had nurses come out of pre-op to ask me what he&#x27;s wearing! It&#x27;s getting hard to find, great price!</li>
            <li> This is the second time I bought the Swiss Army from Amazon.  I bought it last year for Christmas and this year.  I think it smells very good.  You can&#x27;t find this in any store!  I&#x27;ve looked!  I could find it online, but this was the best deal I could find.  Thanks Amazon.com!</li>
            <li> Thank you very much for the excellent product</li>
            <li> The product met my expectations but it took 10 days from the day I ordered it to the day it was delivered.  Shipping can be greatly improved.</li>
            <li> This is not something I could wear every day, but it is a nice, clean fragrance.  Shipping was fast and I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Responsible seller, Article fulfilled the requirements. Greetings and thanks for everything.</li>
            <li> The product was in bad condition!!!&lt;br /&gt;It doesnt smell like a real Swiss Army.&lt;br /&gt;I have real doubts  about this product!!&lt;br /&gt;I think I will never buy again this kind of products by this way!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Please send my a REAL Swiss Army or give me back my money</li>
            <li> i will try to be neutral, the smells its simply ok a little alcoholic smell, the smells dissapear after 5 minutes, tried to use on another person just to check the smells and the others people sensation and i can tell it does not smell to anything after 10 minutes, buyed directly from amazon llc, the customer service its great but this product its not what i was thinking, i will try another.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this...now just hoping that special someone does as well!</li>
            <li> Great smell, but very light. After an hour, I&#x27;m not sure anyone would notice the scent unless they were within a foot&#x27;s distance.</li>
            <li> I got this product for my husbands birthday and he just loves it. Which is saying something because he is very picky. It doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering aroma. Whenever he wears it, he gets a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the hype on the tag or axe stuff is but I think that stuff stinks so bad.  This is a nice smell I enjoy smelling on my husband, its hard to find but at least Amazon.com still sells it or I would go crazy.. switch from stinky to this really good scent.</li>
            <li> Arrived at time and with all the features and I thank you for the excellent package. Wish you the best.</li>
            <li> The cologne smells the same as it did 10 years ago, but I think the great scent&#x27;s longevity is shorter now than it used to be.  Also the Bottle Holster is no longer made of aluminum with a red plastic bottom.  Now it is made of plastic which is made to look like brushed metal.  Thankfully I still have the old aluminum Bottle Holster to slide the new bottle into.  Great cologne with a nice clean scent.  I have a hard time finding colognes I am not alergic to and this is the best with a nice clean male scent!</li>
            <li> I initially started using this back in high school when I was looking for a light/fresh scent that wasn&#x27;t worn by every other guy in school.  Pretty quickly, I started noticing how many compliments I consistently received for this.  15 years later, still using this same scent and still receiving similar compliments, not to mention friends I haven&#x27;t seen in years still recognize it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, I was disappointed years back when I learned normal vendors no longer carried the product, so I began ordering on Amazon.  The scent is the exact same, the bottle altered slightly over time, and sometimes inconsistencies on the manufacturer listed on the packaging, but it&#x27;s still the same great product.  I continue to order a bottle or two a year through Amazon!</li>
            <li> Definitely not my favorite but I find different uses for it</li>
            <li> This perfume is awesome. Very pleasant smell!</li>
            <li> muy bueno, recomendado.</li>
            <li> exelelente y confiables</li>
            <li> Amazon has excellent customer service - I was really impressed by their returns system. Had a slight problem with my original order - Amazon rectified the situation promptly, and I am very pleased with the outcome. &lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t hesitate to purchase items from them again. thank you Amazon  &lt;br /&gt;Also the colonge smells awesome, I love it!!! and a great deal, too!</li>
            <li> Just as good as I expected for.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite colognes &amp; you just can&#x27;t beat this price for it! Must buy, you will not find this cheaper!</li>
            <li> The product fulfilled my expectations were on time without imperfections, recommended 100% for all purchases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with the purchase&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you very much for your attention</li>
            <li> Wore this in middle school, decided to try it again and boy is it still good! For twenty some dollars, this is a great cologne, even though its not &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; (eau de toilette, basically a weaker version of full blown perfume). It smells great. This is the type of cologne you would like if you prefer the mature smelling ones, not sporty, or sweet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final note: despite it being eau de toilette you don&#x27;t need more than 4 sprays to get people to smell it, you can put more to make it more potent but 4 is fine for a casual day to day basis.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is one of my husband&#x27;s favorites.  I&#x27;m so glad that Amazon carries this.</li>
            <li> I bought this item way back in 90&#x27;s for my hubby and he have insisted using it since then until now.  The scent is so unique that I could identify that its my hubby if he happens to walk past my office (working in the same company)..The scent last really long even after two washes...    great item and my hubby cannot live without it.    thanks Swiss Army    dee</li>
            <li> The product is similar to the picture. good quality and good price. I liked the cologne I am satisfied. the smell is ok</li>
            <li> Great addition to my stash of colognes.</li>
            <li> my boys loved it and said: we got our secret weapon, we all are very pleased and happy with the product</li>
            <li> Classic. Timeless. I have loved this scent for years and I always find myself purchasing it over and over again for my hubby. It never gets old.&lt;br /&gt;(I sometimes secretly spray it on my pillow, because I love it that much).</li>
            <li> For the price range I must say this is best.</li>
            <li> excellent product, excellent seller, recommend</li>
            <li> smooth product in perfect condition</li>
            <li> What can I say? Well, Amazon delivered the product in time and form and it smells good that is why I bought it. What I like the most about ordering stuff from Amazon is the speed that they put on every order.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> I like this fragrance as its not overpoweringly strong. Its light and refreshing, lasts for a short period of time and can be worn at all times, at work or play. I am very satisfied with this product and i use it all the time. I would recommend this hands down, although dont expect the fragrance to last for more than a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> This is really a great smelling cologne.  I just hate that it&#x27;s out of stock now. Glad there&#x27;s Amazon</li>
            <li> The product is good. The smell is not strong and good for everyday use. I just don&#x27;t think it will last that long. For the price it&#x27;s a good buy! no complaints!</li>
            <li> Very beautiful and smell beautiful, and long-term&lt;br /&gt;And adopted it on special occasions, and is characterized by the scarcity and quality with others</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really last so long. I really don&#x27;t like it that much</li>
            <li> I was really surprised when I realized it came both the spray and the shower gel, the information says it&#x27;s just only one! I bought it for my husband and he loves it, the smell it&#x27;s really great, just what we expected</li>
            <li> I discovered this cologne years ago in a perfume store, but Amazon usually saves me about $20 on the store price. So many women say \\&quot;oh, what&#x27;s your cologne\\&quot; or \\&quot;you smell so good\\&quot;. So, there y&#x27;are.</li>
            <li> It is not a Well-known perfume, but who uses it the first time become addict, a very rich aroma!</li>
            <li> Hello, I received this product in good conditions! It is certainly an original article and category. I highly recommend the essence and aroma of the perfume does not equal another.</li>
            <li> Awesome!Awesome!!Awesome!!!!!!! Probably the best long last men&#x27;s spray out there for the price!!!!!!!Would recommend to any guy!!!!</li>
            <li> original, great, smells so good, bought it for my boyfriend and i love when he uses it. you should try it out</li>
            <li> The form of presentation of the&lt;br /&gt;product is not shown in the picture&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance it is exquisite and it is smells very masculine.&lt;br /&gt;The package of delivery it is ideal size.&lt;br /&gt;My rating is four stars is:&lt;br /&gt;1-Product Quality&lt;br /&gt;2-Shipping costs.&lt;br /&gt;3-Time Delivery.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> This is not original brand, when I use the perfume smells good, but one hour late smells different, this is the last time I bought perfume on Amazon, the price is not to low compare with the original the difference is only $15 and smell better.</li>
            <li> in excellent conditions</li>
            <li> very good product is just what I expected, for the price I paid I am satisfied with the purchase, and would recommend to buy!</li>
            <li> Original product, smell nice, i like it so much</li>
            <li> Excellent product 100% recommend five star well deserved ....</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD, SERVICE EXCELENT</li>
            <li> This is an amazing smelling cologne. Very clean and crisp. Stays with you awhile as well. When the time comes i&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
            <li> Bought for the fragrance of it, not realizing also effective as insecticide effects also.Highly recommended with also buy again. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I really like this cologne. I was first introduced to it by a friend of mine, and I had to get it after. If you don&#x27;t like an overwhelming strong smell this cologne may not be for you. Its hard to spray it and keep it at a discrete smell because its so powerful. It does have a great smell though so I don&#x27;t mind. I&#x27;ve been complimented by girls on it, so I guess thats always good! I recommend you buy it!</li>
            <li> The scent is not too strong and yet it has a sweet masculine smell.  I gave this as gift to my husband and he loves it</li>
            <li> it starts with summer morning ,ending up with fall sunset.superb unique! I done  two bottles already. And got to ask a friend to bring one more back to Taiwan.</li>
            <li> This Eau the Toilette smells great and it&#x27;s the original, not fake. Very happy with my purchase. Will be getting again.</li>
            <li> Very good colonne, classic and never goes old. I think is one of those colonnes to wear on every day.</li>
            <li> I have a problem I&#x27;m from Venezuela and to remove my packages that are liberty express here in my country I need the traking of a sony xperia and a perfume</li>
            <li> ARRIVED IN GOOD CONDITION, YOU RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> THE BEST OF THE BEST SERVICE &amp; PRODUCT, THANKS 4 ALL</li>
            <li> Perfume Excelente, Se Puede USAR de diario, fresco y Muy suave, recibi el Producto en El Tiempo Estimado, lo recomiendo.</li>
            <li> I LOVED DE SMELL OF IT, THE PRESENTATION AND THE SIZE WAS JUST PERFECT... I REALLY LOVED IT... THANK YOU</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a classic scent that I have worn for years . Everyone loves it and I receive tons I complements on the days I use it</li>
            <li> What can be said about a product you are familiar with? No surprises. I bought it because I love it, so I knew what I was going to get. It came on timely manner, very well wrapped and a very reasonable price. A kind of indulgency with myself. I bought half a dozen of my favorite fragances from Amazon and are really satisfied with them.</li>
            <li> it works everytime.  I got this from a now ex-girlfriend back in 2001 or something and its been my go-to ever since.  I don&#x27;t wear cologne very much but just about every time I put this on some girl/woman will ask me what I&#x27;m wearing and if they can smell me.  It was amazing when I was single in college obviously, but now that I&#x27;m married my wife loves it and wants me to wear it when we go out on the town.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re on a budget this is one of the better affordable men&#x27;s fragrances. This juice smells very good, but it doesn&#x27;t last long. On my skin it lasts for 2 to 3 hours. Still, for the price it is a great deal. Women definitely  like this fragrance</li>
            <li> Product is exactly the same but seller provides one image, which does not represent what it delivers. This fancy cloth black bag does not come together with the perfume!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want my fancy cloth black bag!</li>
            <li> Smells really good, the girls really love this stuff. I get complements everywhere I go, even from dudes haha. It lasts really long, I can smell it on clothes the next day. I have paid 50 for this in a department store and it was still well worth it. This is a really good price.</li>
            <li> It is a good perfume, I recommend it because I really like, I arrive in time expected and as described by.</li>
            <li> This cologne is hard to find, as it has been discontinued. Amazon is the only place I&#x27;ve found it. It&#x27;s my husbands favorite.</li>
            <li> I had bought Swiss Army Classic twice before in brick and morter store.  What I received was Victronuix or Victronox Swiss Army.  Definetly not the same product.  Too much hastle for me to return especially after opening it and trying.  Not the original product I had purchased before.  Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> GOOD PRODUCT, GOOD SELLLER!!</li>
            <li> thanks a lot thanks to them is precisely what they offered me the article is very nice and is what I wanted thanks</li>
            <li> What can I say, Swiss Army is a very good brand and the cologne is very good as well.  It smells very good and as all colognes you got to find the right one for you and I have the boy that is just the right one for him.</li>
            <li> The right smell at the right price. The only thing better than looking good and smelling good is looking good and smelling good at a bargain price!</li>
            <li> It was the product acquired in compliance with espicificaciones I was looking for and also were very effective at the time of delivery and the good condition in which they arrived</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, packaged nicely, been a fave scent for awhile now.  No complaints:)</li>
            <li> excellent product recommended .</li>
            <li> The product fulfilled expectations. excellent</li>
            <li> Very good . my boyfriend loved it</li>
            <li> You buy a phone in your store and get me flawed</li>
            <li> I was expecting good projection, longevity and good silage but it seems to very watered down version. I&#x27;m not sure whether it is a real one. It disappears only after 1 hour and need at least 5-6 sprays to project. I don;t recommend it to anyone. The extra star I&#x27;m giving is due to bottle design.</li>
            <li> excelente producto recomendado</li>
            <li> A bit subtle, not over powering, but yet you know it&#x27;s there. For $20 this is better than anything you would find at a discount shelf at Ross or Marshall&#x27;s. It&#x27;s not over powering at all, I like to put a few sprays on my bed spread after the bed is made. I will buy more as soon as it runs out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cologne for a few days now and I am somewhat disappointed with it. Even though it&#x27;s an EDT cologne, I expected it to last a bit longer than it does. You really need to spray it on good to make it last for any measurable amount of time, and even then it will only stay on you long enough for two hours or so. The smell stays on your skin for most of the day but it doesn&#x27;t emanate into the room around you for very long at all. It&#x27;s one of the best smelling colognes I&#x27;ve ever had and I&#x27;ll probably keep buying it because of that, but it&#x27;s really disappointing that it doesn&#x27;t last longer than it does because it smells so great. It sort of reminds me of Old Spice however just a little bit different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good occasional-use cologne, meaning it&#x27;s good if you want to smell nice just for a few hours if you&#x27;re going to a party or something, but as for day-long wear, it&#x27;s a no-go. You should consider it as a short-term accessory to your persona and nothing more.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a new cologne for my boyfriend when I saw this. Turns out, he loves the smell, I love the smell and other people compliment him on it! Amazing! Comes in a neat box and the bottle looks cool too</li>
            <li> my favorite perfume ... love</li>
            <li> I wish it smelled more</li>
            <li> excellent product fulfills its purpose, service quality, timely and efficient. 100% reliable in addition to recommended by your quality and attention</li>
            <li> pierden la fragancia en un par de horas o menos!!</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this smell! I gave it to my boyfriend as a gift and he loved it as well. thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very particular about cologne. More often than not I find that fragances are too sweet or too musky or too citrusy and so on. So when I find a cologne that strikes a good balance for my personal taste, it gets a prominent spot in my fragrance rotation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Swiss Army Classic for probably ten years of so. I&#x27;m 27 years old at the time of this review. One of the things that I really like about this cologne is that it&#x27;s relatively timeless; although I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s appropriate for below high school age, I can easily see men of all ages wearing Swiss Army cologne. It&#x27;s a distinct, unique blend of citrus, musk, and a hint of warm spice that is sophisticated, understated, and yet bold, masculine, and inviting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has been my signature, go-to all-seasons fragrance since I first bought it a decade ago. And in all those years of wearing it, I still get compliments (especially from women) just about every time I leave the house. What&#x27;s really nice about this fragrance is that although it commands attention and draws much notice, it&#x27;s very inoffensive and versatile, appealing to both sexes and all ages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for performance, Swiss Army is better than average. I spray 2 or 3 pumps on my chest, one on a wrist and then rub my wrists together, and once behind each ear and it last all day, about 12 hours (give or take). And I&#x27;ll usually still smell it at night when I go to bed unless I&#x27;ve showered. It also projects quite well; I was about 8 people back in a Starbucks line when the cashier remarked that someone in the store &amp;#34;smells freaking amazing&amp;#34;, then identified me as the source when I (finally) made it to the register.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriends have always said this was the sexiest cologne I use, and even the guy I&#x27;m currently dating said Swiss Army Classic makes me smell incredibly sexy. Although I also like Lacoste Rouge (red bottle), CK Euphoria, Bleu de Chanel, L&#x27;Homme by YSL, and Jake by Hollister, Swiss Army is what I use most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My ideal scent is crisp, refreshing and somewhat citrusy with notes of musk and a touch of warm spice. If there&#x27;s a strong presence of bergamot and/or lemon, even bette.  Army Classic is described as consisting of notes of mint, bergamot, lavender, clary sage, musk, cardamom, coriander, and ginger. Initially it&#x27;s the ginger and bergamot that are most noticeable, followed by the cardamom and musk, and finally rounded out with sage and lavender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a truly enticing, sensual, sexy fragrance that&#x27;s not only pleasing to the man wearing it, but also to those nearby. It projects incredibly well, as I described, so if you want a refreshing, masculine cologne that smells of citrus and musk and will command attention without being imposing, I enthusiastically recommend Swiss Army Classic.hat I use most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My ideal scent is crisp, refreshing and somewhat citrusy with notes of musk and a touch of warm spice. If there&#x27;s a strong presence of bergamot and/or lemon, even bette.  Army Classic is described as consisting of notes of mint, bergamot, lavender, clary sage, musk, cardamom, coriander, and ginger. Initially it&#x27;s the ginger and bergamot that are most noticeable, followed by the cardamom and musk, and finally rounded out with sage and lavender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a truly enticing, sensual, sexy fragrance that&#x27;s not only pleasing to the man wearing it, but also to those nearby. It projects incredibly well, as I described, so if you want a refreshing, masculine cologne that smells of citrus and musk and will command attention without being imposing, I enthusiastically recommend Swiss Army Classic.</li>
            <li> One of the Best colognes ever, would recommend it to anyone.. lasts forever!</li>
            <li> I had my doubts in choosing which previously had a perfume of these, but the packaging was a little different, and did not know if the perfume changed too, but mostly excellent gone, the product comes in a kit with a corporral excellent lotion the same fragrance. special for the day to day ..</li>
            <li> A classic, nice and flashy, and practically for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I was brought up that a man and woman use cologne / perfume (and deodorant!) and that they should not be way overpowering everyone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used most of the top scents including Creed at one point (I like Creed, but IMHO they can be a bit strong for daily wear...they work really well if used under a suit jacket though; fortunately my days of suits are limited now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had women come up to me even when I am totally out of shape and a mess and ask &amp;#34;What [scent] are you wearing?&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s been all ages and all nationalities as well.  On planes, in malls, in restaurants.  I got this scent as a free sample with one of my orders for Fahrenheit by Christian Dior.  That bottle is still sitting only used until my first order of this cologne arrived a couple days later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At $22 for a 3.4 ounce bottle (THANKS AMAZON!) and how it lasts a long time and how I have not once heard any negative comments about this fragrance and in fact many have ordered it right in front of me once they found out about it, it&#x27;s a no-brainer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 15 year old began wearing it as well and his classmates like it too.  He is keeping it a secret though :)  I remember high school too everyone tends to wear the same stuff...in my day it was Dakkar and Polo mostly, there were a few others I don&#x27;t remember off the top of my head.  A little of CK One.  I wore Lagerfeld during those days and a different scent (if done right) helps you stand out in the crowd.</li>
            <li> It is a perfume which has always enjoyed its aroma. because it has a sweet but masculine scent.  Good product.</li>
            <li> I received exactly what I ordered so I give that rating because I am satisfied and happy with my product.</li>
            <li> just love the smell of it.</li>
            <li> Love the cologne and got it at a great price!</li>
            <li> Fragrance as we expected: Odor enduring in time. It does not vanish. Competitive price. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I love it.&lt;br /&gt;iÂ´ll buy it again!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Excellent perfumes. I have been used this product many from now. It great product</li>
            <li> excellent; responsible, very good handling of the goods, Everything arrived in order, I received it in the stipulated time, thanks</li>
            <li> I used to wear this cologne when I was a teenager and I had forgotten how great it smells. It is a very good fragance for men. The purchase price was very good</li>
            <li> Excelente perfume clasico</li>
            <li> nice product to diarie use, i like it because is a usefully and very good Price, thank a lot you</li>
            <li> I used this product for a few years here and there. I like to change up my smell, but always came back to this every couple of years or so. the bottle is no longer glass, which is fine, even good. There is no longer that separate bottom which fell off all the time, that is great. My issue is that it seems to smell different than it used to. Not bad, just a little different, and the scent does not last nearly as long. What happened?</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting the original formula of this cologne.  When I received it, I could see right away that it was not the original cologne, even though the picture represented it to be.  While the scent is pleasant, it is definitely not what I though I was getting.</li>
            <li> This is most definitely one of Swiss Army&#x27;s greatest works in their line of male scents. Lasts all day and has the scent that brings you the compliments you look for in a great cologne with a good bargain price.</li>
            <li> Great quality, 100% recommended! I love it &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> This cologne smells amazing. It has that strong musk smell fit for a man. My favorite so far. love it.</li>
            <li> Very nice perfume, masculine. Not too strong.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, arrived in good condition, meets all requirements widely recommended. thanks for everything.</li>
            <li> My huzzy uses it like soap, he loves the smell as do I. I would recommend it to any guy.</li>
            <li> Nice smell. Beats many $90 by miles.</li>
            <li> excellent and of course or recommend the whole community and the product amazom.com 100% new in box with no product details thanks</li>
            <li> I like this fragrance as its not overpoweringly strong. Its light and refreshing, lasts for a short period of time and can be worn at all times, at work or play. I am very satisfied with this product and i use it all the time.</li>
            <li> Been using this same scent for 4 years. This one wears out a little too quick, I&#x27;m thinking I may have gotten a counterfeit but it&#x27;s still one of the best scents on the market you can tell because the price hasn&#x27;t really dropped since it came out. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great smell, quick shipment, definitely recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Its a great cologne for men to give as a gift.</li>
            <li> excellent product I recommend</li>
            <li> Its really good for $25 , nice musty scent but not to strong. get a lot of compliments with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift and am very happy with it! It arrived exactly when they said it would and at a much better price than you would pay in a department store! Will order again! Thank you!</li>
            <li> This cologne has always been great to have and has that swiss look a lot of people ask WHAT IS THAT I&#x27;m like my secret recipe of colognes I have.</li>
            <li> Good and the perfume has excellent fragrance, exquisite odor. Product of very good quality under strict standards development. Thanx for it!</li>

            <li> of all the big name pricey colognes i&#x27;ve bought, i get the most compliments from my wife on this one. Big bottle, great price, great smell. It&#x27;s a light smell but &amp;#34;still a little man smell to it&amp;#34; as my wife said. She also said she could smell it abut 12hrs after I had put it on.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll most def buy again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume. Masculine smell but not too strong. Good for everyday or formal use. Received compliments while wearing it! Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is definitely great for lovers of good smell, quality highlights in the duration in the body and maintains its scent for many hours, recommended</li>
            <li> The product fulfilled the expectations, thanks</li>
            <li> I regret buying it. It is the worst cologne I ever spend money on. It is totally fake and it is not the actual product of Swiss Army. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> Excellent ! Quick delivery !!</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband.  He has worn this brand of years.  The price and the product better than what I could find in any store.  I will buy for this seller in the future.</li>
            <li> Messrs. very good morning thank you very much for this very good&lt;br /&gt;article and good to have good day soon.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a manly man smell and well worth every penny.  It lasts on my manly man for about 8 hours and lingers on his clothes a little bit more.  Definitely something to pick up for your manly man or your man that you want to smell manly. (^_^)v</li>
            <li> Smells so good everybody loves it and with just one spray, you can still smell it the next day.</li>
            <li> muy buen producto, es %100  original. Y el olor se mantiene mantiene por muchas horas, inclusive en la ropa despues de lavarse.</li>
            <li> Shipped on time and the product was exactly what I wanted.  I do recommend this cologne and store to anyone for their next purchase.</li>
            <li> Bought for my 20 yr. son. He loves it and it smells fantastic. Not too strong, but not weak either.</li>
            <li> Buen aroma excelente presentacion, duradero es el perfume y no muy comun, recomiendo que lo compren muy buen aroma, buen precio</li>
            <li> Great value for the amount of cologne you get! Family and friends love the smell, especially the ladies!</li>
            <li> I used this fragrance about 10 years ago, I stopped using cologne for 10 years. Decided to start using againg and it does not disapoint, just like I remember it, manly with a spice of sensitivity.</li>

            <li> My boyfriend used Swiss Army before I met him, but then he ran out.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased it as a Valentine&#x27;s gift this year. He loves it and I love smelling it on him.</li>

            <li> Very pleased with this purchase</li>
            <li> Excellent product and Seller</li>
            <li> Opinion (2nd cologne review of 4): everyday scent. This is a great scent that one can wear everyday to the office or work, or wherever. I&#x27;d consider it to be one of the top scents along with Perry Ellis 360 Red. This package also includes a shower wash which smells great and isn&#x27;t overbearing.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied and happy because the product arrived just in time, attention and speed was great, I highly recommend them. thanks</li>
            <li> excelent product. I will enjoy it a lot. Thanks. On time and it was protteccted. Thanks you very much. ok</li>
            <li> I think this product because it is very good product is of very good quality that I really liked is that the specified and published the seller made ââvery fast shipping and received my product in Venezuela recommend to all buyers and all users amazon because your purchase will be quick, secure and high quality</li>
            <li> It came quickly and had zero damage! Exactly what I needed and wanted.</li>
            <li> It smells different and the smell did not last for long time, will not order next time</li>
            <li> muy buena gracias espero volver a efectuar otra compra. muy buena aparte super responsables y la entrega super rapida y a tiempo</li>
            <li> agood perfum I Love it</li>
            <li> Surprisingly good fragrance.</li>
            <li> Good morning. 5 STARS FOR SELLER, THE PRODUCT IS EXCELLENT QUALITY. AND VERY GOOD CARE</li>
            <li> To start, the casing was plastic instead of metal like previous bottles I had purchased.  The scent itself was entirely different than what I was expecting, it seems like it&#x27;s almost...watered down.  Definitely not as strong and it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; to you like the last bottle I had purchased (in store).  Was not worth it.</li>
            <li> Recently purchased a couple of these. This is a really nice cologne which last for hours. It has a light smell, it&#x27;s a good cologne to wear everyday or for work or other occasion. The price is also reasonable, in stores a 3.4 ounce of this cost ~$50.</li>
            <li> Since this perfume came out, I have always lovedit so much. It is a must have in my bath, luggage , or everyhwerre i go!</li>
            <li> good seller good item</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband because we both love the smell.  You really can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
            <li> Good morning, I communicate with you because the day November 23, 2013 I made a purchase with you which was debited and I was not sent to me by my country express liberty, Thanks. Thanking answer my email zulexy.borrero@yahoo.com.ve</li>
            <li> I dont have any comments for this product. Is simple for me, Great Perfume, good Smell; good brand. Excellent presentation.</li>
            <li> good price i used every day, i was looking for this item time ago, a cheap price and i got it</li>
            <li> Very crisp smell. I&#x27;m very picky about my smells it&#x27;s priced 58 bucks in the stores, why pay that when you can get it on here for much cheaper</li>
            <li> This is one of the first times I&#x27;ve ever purchased scent online without smelling it first in person. But the reviews from other shoppers made this worth a gamble. Luckily Swiss Army products tend to be of a high quality, and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed by this product. One does get a hint of Citrius mixed with a faint lavender with a woody type scent. The result is a pleasing masculine scent. It is true that this is scent comes on strong and gets subtle as it&#x27;s worn, but quite frankly I like that it&#x27;s not overpowering and that one gets the hint of this scent with close contact. All in all, I&#x27;m leaning towards I&#x27;m glad I did, rather than I wish I hadn&#x27;t with this purchase decision. For the price I think it smells like something a lot more expensive.</li>
            <li> excellent product reached me in time</li>
            <li> Very mild smell -  for short time only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought many to gift before trying one. My bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I and whoever i gifted said the smell went of so soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy better product than this.</li>
            <li> excelente vendedor y producto llego en perfecto estado a venezuela</li>
            <li> Everything as expected.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance. I would buy it again!</li>

            <li> I like this odor for my Dad, well enough to have used the whole bottle on just Sunday sprays and repurchasing it.</li>
            <li> they dont sell these in stores much anymore and my dad loves the smell. great size. name/brand may be different but the smell is exactly as it was before.</li>
            <li> What a wonderful cologne!  I&#x27;ve never had so many positive comments on cologne!  Women and Men alike comment on how much they love the scent.  I had a woman randomly hug me just to smell my cologne!  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> My husband has been hinting about wanting this sent for a couple months so I bought it for him. He has been very happy since I gave it to him. He wears it almost every day now.</li>

            <li> the product was ok, it seems sealed but when I opened it was like used, I thought it was a parfum not a eau toillet&amp;#60;!!!!!!!!</li>

            <li> this Swiss Army By Swiss Army For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4 Ounces Its excellent... Thank you a lot...</li>
            <li> I received this cologne as a gift during my senior year in high school. Swiss Army cologne gave a \\&quot;clean scent\\&quot; it wasn&#x27;t an overpowering cologne as other colognes in the market. But it gave a nice touch I would use it as an everyday cologne as it was inexpensive cologne and different from using Axe like most high school students.</li>

            <li> I would reccomend this product because is not as expensive as others. The cologne is fresh and good. My brother liked it.</li>
            <li> Excellent! It is as the one i&#x27;ve purchased in 1999!</li>
            <li> responsible and quality</li>
            <li> I bought as a present for my dad and he loved it!!! pretty satisfied</li>

            <li> Smells good and came fast.. I will buy another one when I run out. Four stars. Would have gave it five, but what gets five starts?</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent. I received this from my girl who thought I needed some new cologne to put in my current \\&quot;boring rotation\\&quot;. A few sprays (1 or 2) easily lasts all day. Would buy this again.</li>
            <li> i can use this anywhere. scent stays around for about 3 to 4 hrs</li>
            <li> I hope excuse what I&#x27;ll say but it&#x27;s reality, it seems the original this perfume, in that I&#x27;m giving my opinion later, you do not use it when removing them, but to use the smell goes very fast, or is expired or imitation is not recommend to buy them ...</li>
            <li> Meets all my expectations, what I expected and I would recommend to those who are very fond of this fragrance.</li>
            <li> The surface is not metal, now it&#x27;s plastic, and doesn&#x27;t smell all day, I liked it as it was before...</li>
            <li> Excelente producto, la entrega fue inmediata. El producto esta en muy buenas condiciones. Buen trato con el vendedor. Gracias. AJ</li>
            <li> the product is of very good quality time I get to not present any kind of problem I&#x27;m very happy excellent condition recomeindo provider thanks</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS ONE TOO AS WELL, GREAT OLD TIMER ON THE MARKET. TRY THIS FRANGRANCE I THINK MOST WILL LOVE IT AS WELL</li>
            <li> Ok - I should have listened to other reviewers that said this isn&#x27;t the same formula as the old one. I have a bottle that&#x27;s about 6 years old that I needed to replace. The old formula was gold. This new formula smells soapy and is so disappointing. So Sad :(</li>
            <li> estoy muy insatisfecho xq nunca recibi este producto, lo enviaron y lo entregaron en la direccion equivocada porque nunca llego a la direccion de destino, favor exigo que me entregen mi producto o me devuelvan el dinero</li>
            <li> Excellent fragrance, I like it</li>
            <li> buy it! its worth more than what you will pay. i want to wear it everywhere, but wont in fear of overusing it. if you are looking for a simple clean citrus smell, look no further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. im an architecture student, so i know whats up ;)</li>
            <li> Such a great scent on my husband.</li>
            <li> I have recently bought this Eau De Toilette in Tokyo, Japan. After using once or twice, I was really disappointed by this product.&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend the costumer avoiding this  Eau De Toilette. The scent is very intolerable, resulting in sever headache.&lt;br /&gt;I think I threw away my precious money. I do not know why people in this place recommend this product to the respected costumers!&lt;br /&gt;The scent has very bad quality. Finally, I will certainly use it for my shoes.</li>
            <li> good product, good time to delivery</li>

            <li> This came in the mail today,it was suppose to be a christmas gift for my just turned 80 step father in law but i&#x27;m giving it to him early.I had to spray it into the air to see how it smells and love it.He had an imitation bottle of this on his dresser and it was empty so i figured it had to be a favorite of his,when i asked him he said it was so i decided to get him the real deal.How long the scent will last i won&#x27;t know til he&#x27;s wearin it and my mother in law tells me will write a update review,all i know is it smells GREAT!UPDATE;gAVE IT TO HIM TODAY AND HE WAS ELATED,he immediately spayed it on and and wore it all day,mother in law said it lasts for a long time and she liked it to,great cologne!</li>

            <li> This cologne comes in a nice size, and is really perfect for me.  I think the scent is perfect, but others might disagree.  I really suggest you check out the scent before buying it.  But that just makes scents.  :-)</li>

            <li> My husband loves this cologne....he should, it was on his Amazon wish list for a birthday present. He does smell good when he wears it!</li>
            <li> I have always used Swiss Army. Since Victorinox bought the brand I have the feeling that the scent and the time it gets fixed in your skin or clothes has decreased.  I bought this because the image shows the Old version (the case that does not say VICTORINOX). The one I got says VIctorinox. The case used to be some kind of metal , now it is plastic. The lid is different, before it had a little ring on top of the lid.&lt;br /&gt;As I said, the smell seems to be different but still is very similar. I can tell because I have compared both.&lt;br /&gt; The aroma stays for a while, but the older version lasted definitely longer.  It is a good EDT, for sure will get a lot of compliments.</li>
