            <li>I bought this product because my daughter noticed a nice tan on her friends mother and she knows how I worship the sun using baby oil (which she hates)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s spreads on SO nicely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not sticky and soaks in nicely.</li>
            <li>REAL Maui Babe skin oil is wonderful and smells like brown sugar and coffee.</li>
            <li>but i didn&#x27;t burn and i was nice and brown.  </li>
            <li>Excellent highly recommend</li>
            <li>The color achieved with the Maui Babe is a beautiful golden tan....</li>
            <li>Love the deal Love the product!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best Suntan lotion I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, and smells like coffee (really a good smell).  </li>
            <li>Maui Babe is by far the best tanning product that I have ever come across.</li>
            <li>This is the best stuff on the planet if you want to get a natural, brown tan.</li>
            <li>Best tanning product I have ever used by far.</li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love!  </li>
            <li>I saw all the great ratings and comments about this product and was super excited about finding something that would help me tan faster WITHOUT burning me!</li>
            <li>so that I tan more evenly.</li>
            <li>I love using this product with an spf30.</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this browner.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>I used to ask my brother to send me more.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>From the warmth of my skin it gets more liquidy</li>
            <li>Makes your skin shiny and glowy and I love the smell of it, too.</li>
            <li>I saw results within a 2 or 3 uses :]</li>
            <li>the price I love it.</li>
            <li>but I love the product</li>
            <li>I found the 4oz bottle in Target for $10.. works and feels better than any tanning oils and lotions..</li>
            <li>Others claiming a similar complexion claimed it works great!</li>
            <li>Enjoy! :)</li>
            <li>I am 100% pleased and I am recommending it to all my friends.</li>
            <li>Have used this for fourteen years and love it.</li>
            <li>This lotion felt more like oil.</li>
            <li>You will love this product.  </li>
            <li>This stuff smells great and really works.</li>
            <li>I love this tanning oil.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>:)  and works.</li>
            <li>You might be buying more of it each summer</li>
            <li>know I will be. :))</li>
            <li>the best browning lotion it not only helps ne tan better</li>
            <li>ok WE have a tanning bed because I do use it also</li>
            <li>This is my favorite suntan lotion.</li>
            <li>I love the smell (coffee).  </li>
            <li>I bought this in Maui and was the most tan I&#x27;ve ever been in my life.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I used it in Maui and glad I can get it in Indiana.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great except, it leaves you feeling really greasy.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it is made and found on hawaii.</li>
            <li>Love the scent and use it with sunscreen all the time.</li>
            <li>I have used this lotion before and its outstanding</li>
            <li>Yes its very nice and u can get fast tan</li>
            <li>Great stuff highly recommend it for a.dark tan and moisturizer as well but be sure to have your passport or you may be thought of as an immigrant .</li>
            <li>So much so, that people that meet me now, don&#x27;t think I have fair skin.    </li>
            <li>Tans fast, smells good</li>
            <li>I wanted to make sure it was worth the $15!</li>
            <li>I originally ordered a bottle from their website and fell in love with the stuff.</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s so easy to get.</li>
            <li>but easily washes out.</li>
            <li>Allows you to tan very quickly.</li>
            <li>Even for me who does not tan easily.  </li>
            <li>(australian Gold has some really good bronzers) and I get a nice tan by the end of the day without any burn.</li>
            <li>It browns the skin like no other product, and it smells great.  </li>
            <li>fair skinned person may want to use a high sunscreen along with this product.  </li>
            <li>it was quite funny to be honest.  </li>
            <li>Only improvement I would make is a more pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>I feel it&#x27;s a little pricy, but the results are great!</li>
            <li>It contains light mineral oil, kukui nut oil, vitamins E, C &amp; A, Kona coffee plant extract, aloe, and potassium iodide.</li>
            <li>Stains light clothes, towels, etc.</li>
            <li>and I hd some free time.  </li>
            <li>all oiled up reflecting any light that hit my body.  </li>
            <li>The REAL product is amazing, but whatever they are selling here is not.</li>
            <li>This browni g lotion is fantastic...</li>
            <li>I was introduced to it in Hawaii and loved the natural coffee smell and the tan gowing tan it gives you.</li>
            <li>Fast golden tan that lasts!!!</li>
            <li>It also came so fast!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m already dark-skinned but Maui Babe gives me a good brown/golden glow without looking orange and also leaves my skin super soft.</li>
            <li>Originally heard of this from the locals when we were in Hawaii.</li>
            <li>I wanted to make sure it was legit, theirs was a bit more expensive but is deff the real deal, love this stuff works great!</li>
            <li>you can tell its natural and I LOVE the coffee smell :)</li>
            <li>I have seen a huge difference in how quickly I tan.</li>
            <li>So the shower I go and clean this stuff off.  </li>
            <li>Love Maui Babe, Just got back from Maui and this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, it smells wonderful, moisturizes great, and this was the first trip that I didn&#x27;t burn at all</li>
            <li>and i have never turned brown before, always bright red like a lobster.</li>
            <li>The smell is good, I personally don&#x27;t mind it.</li>
            <li>I am almost through the second one now and am a good deal darker.  </li>
            <li>The only thing is, it won&#x27;t be good for you guys and girls who don&#x27;t like an oil based product.</li>
            <li>I have used this for 5 years and you get a better tan than with anyother product, I recommend that anyone that wants a glowing tan try this.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff I am very lite complected</li>
            <li>I bought this on the Big Island at the beginning of my trip after reading the great positive reviews here.</li>
            <li>It browns quickly</li>
            <li>quickly however, one of my bottles of lotion has a crack in it</li>
            <li>I have never used a suntan product that worked as well and as quickly at this one.  </li>
            <li>are better off buying it from a more established retailer such as bed bath and beyond, or Walgreen (in some locations)</li>
            <li>Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>If I go into very hot climates I use this with a sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>and I have gotten it all over the place it shoots out of the bottle when it&#x27;s very hot out</li>
            <li>The smell is something to get used to, while not unpleasant you just have to get used to smelling like a cup of coffee.  </li>
            <li>I clean our own pool and when I remove cartridges, there are definite brown spots that do not wash off.</li>
            <li>Great product &amp; it is less than what you would pay @</li>
            <li>(My arms &amp; upper body always seem to tan better)!  </li>
            <li>this is a great year round use product.</li>
            <li>I rarely use anything else.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money .</li>
            <li>well worth  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love the natural brown color it gives me.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Worth</li>
            <li>I read the reviews of other fair skinned people liking this product, and decided to buy a trial bottle.  </li>
            <li>I tanned right before I went to bed</li>
            <li>the results that it claims where right on.  </li>
            <li>Gives me a good dark tan.</li>
            <li>These products are great!&lt;br /&gt;Working on my amazing dark tan right now...in the bay area!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even know what half the ppl on here are talking about a good smell to me</li>
            <li>I liked it so much the first day (noticable difference in skin tone after just 3 hours) that I came back and ordered another 2 bottles.  </li>
            <li>Got it delivered very fast.</li>
            <li>But if you are Fair  skin it might take a little longer to get brown</li>
            <li>This is simply the best way to get a fast dark tan EVER!  </li>
            <li>Since I first bought it.</li>
            <li>This lotion is exactly as promised.</li>
            <li>The product I received was unfortunately not of the same quality as the lovely Maui Babe lotion purchased on the islands.  </li>
            <li>First time I used it was on a hot sunny day to mow the lawn.  </li>
            <li>I did get a tan though ;)  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff - I just never seem to buy enough when I am in Hawaii.   </li>
            <li>Used this for the first time in 2009 when we went to Hawaii.  </li>
            <li>i cant even believe how fast i tan!</li>
            <li>Used this on the first day of a week-long vacation at the jersey shore.  </li>
            <li>I love it and always order double...</li>
            <li>First tried this product while visiting Hawaii, one of the locals let me use theirs and have never used anything else since.</li>
            <li>Make sure that you have something to clean your hands with after application as it is dark and a bit oily and&lt;br /&gt;should be removed from ones hands after application.  </li>
            <li>it isn&#x27;t as oily, it just makes your skin super soft.</li>
            <li>If you have dry skin, then you will love it.</li>
            <li>and it takes only a few days to achieve the beautiful sun tan color on ones body.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little too messy to use in the tanning bed because it&#x27;s so oily, but great for a day in the sun!</li>
            <li>it keeps my skin very soft during the summer!!</li>
            <li>So just rub it in very well, and you&#x27;ll have no problems at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Now we are getting ready to go on a cruise in March 2015.  </li>
            <li>It works great , in about 3 -4 applications I had the same tan as back home exposed to several weeks on the beach .</li>
            <li>Well I received my order so thank you so much for getting it here</li>
            <li>Works really well doesn&#x27;t go on greasy like some tannig products</li>
            <li>You tan FAST</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t care what it is that makes it work...</li>
            <li>it was much darker and leaves your hands looking brown after you apply it.</li>
            <li>well it is straight out of the bottle</li>
            <li>This lotion really does speed up the tanning process, without burning.  </li>
            <li>It is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>This is fabulous for keeping skin moist and promoting a deep tan.</li>
            <li>really helps you get a darker tan</li>
            <li>Best tanning lotion out there, but remember to wear a suit that you don&#x27;t mind getting dirty.</li>
            <li>I was headed to the beach in 3 days so needed something capable of being overnighted.</li>
            <li>It is very oily and can stain your clothes.</li>
            <li>No stains , fast tan.</li>
            <li>but I can definitely vouch for the original product.</li>
            <li>I have fair Norwegian skin that doesn&#x27;t typically tan very well.</li>
            <li>and I still was able to get dark tan.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to all skin types, but be sure to lay down a coat of SPF below the Maui Babe, since it doesn&#x27;t contain any.  </li>
            <li>Lucky me, I work in a tanning salon so trying all different kinds of lotion has became a hobby of mine.</li>
            <li>It could possibly stain your towel or clothing, especially white, but should mostly come out in the wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and wow........I was nice and brown and has lasted for few days so far.  </li>
            <li>Im a guy that is a few shades darker than a normal fair skinned white boy</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Highly recommended..</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This company also has an after sun moisturizing cream and that works nicely too, but I have several other after sun products that I use.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff...very dark tan!</li>
            <li>I a beach lover and live in Florida</li>
            <li>and I new</li>
            <li>keeps my skin soft for days!</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell other then that we love it.</li>
            <li>Used it for only 2 days in the first sun rays of spring here</li>
            <li>first of all, it works in a really short amount of time.</li>
            <li>At the end of the summer, I was completely, unrecognizably tan!</li>
            <li>Went on smoothly and gave a even and dark tan.</li>
            <li>I put it on and the smell is a little strong</li>
            <li>This one did none of the such, I feel like its a watered down or cut with more oil in comparison maui babes that I have used in the past&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>tan last so much longer with Maui Babe.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>so this lotion is always with me, it leaves my skin soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>My boss ordered boxes and boxes of this stuff, he told me all about it, being from Hawaii, and how it is all natural.</li>
            <li>Remember this is a BROWNING lotion, all natural, no bronzers.</li>
            <li>although some lotions can turn you orange-y, this gives you BROWN natural looking color.</li>
            <li>the product really well, as the directions say, I can even stand the coffee aroma it emanates, but it is almost totally slimy from \\&quot;light\\&quot; mineral oil!.</li>
            <li>Only thing my husband wants to use.  </li>
            <li>Its made from natural products.</li>
            <li>Hasn&#x27;t been sunny enough to try it out too much though hopefully soon &amp;#34;/</li>
            <li>After it soaks in your skin is just really soft and silky...</li>
            <li>so this wasn&#x27;t fast enough for me.</li>
            <li>It kept my skin soft and no sunburns.</li>
            <li>Great tanning lotion, my friend who lives in Hawaii introduced this to me and i wont use anything else, worth the extra cost, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li>It is pretty greasy and smells a little like coffee, but if you want a nice tan in a short time, you&#x27;ll get past that.</li>
            <li>It does leave you a little greasy (not bad)</li>
            <li>I lived in Key Largo for 7 years &amp; had the entire summer off 2 years ago, and because it never rains down there, I was able to lay out, front and back, for 4-5 hours a day.</li>
            <li>This is definitely not a lotion that you would use at a tanning salon out in public unless you plan on going straight to your car to home</li>
            <li>The regular version leaves too much of a mess to clean up afterwards.    </li>
            <li>was like no other.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this tanning lotion to anyone who wants a dark tan as if they just left the islands.</li>
            <li>and so i expected this stuff to work really well.</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t help at all as far as I&#x27;m concerned - still blotchy and red,</li>
            <li>As another reviewer stated, this is not the same stuff you receive directly from Maui Babe.</li>
            <li>this is the same stuff you get directly from the company.</li>
            <li>(less solid) right in your hand.</li>
            <li>Just like other oils, this can leave scum on pool liners but even more so in the filter systems.</li>
            <li>This stuff is worth every single penny if you&#x27;re serious about getting a REAL TAN.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It&#x27;s spreads on SO nicely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky and soaks in nicely.</li>
            <li> REAL Maui Babe skin oil is wonderful and smells like brown sugar and coffee.</li>
            <li> but i didn&#x27;t burn and i was nice and brown.  </li>
            <li> Excellent highly recommend</li>
            <li> The color achieved with the Maui Babe is a beautiful golden tan....</li>
            <li> Love the deal Love the product!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best Suntan lotion I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, and smells like coffee (really a good smell).  </li>
            <li> Maui Babe is by far the best tanning product that I have ever come across.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff on the planet if you want to get a natural, brown tan.</li>
            <li> Best tanning product I have ever used by far.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love!  </li>
            <li> I saw all the great ratings and comments about this product and was super excited about finding something that would help me tan faster WITHOUT burning me!</li>
            <li> so that I tan more evenly.</li>
            <li> I love using this product with an spf30.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this browner.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> I used to ask my brother to send me more.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> From the warmth of my skin it gets more liquidy</li>
            <li> Makes your skin shiny and glowy and I love the smell of it, too.</li>
            <li> I saw results within a 2 or 3 uses :]</li>
            <li> the price I love it.</li>
            <li> but I love the product</li>
            <li> I found the 4oz bottle in Target for $10.. works and feels better than any tanning oils and lotions..</li>
            <li> Others claiming a similar complexion claimed it works great!</li>
            <li> Enjoy! :)</li>
            <li> I am 100% pleased and I am recommending it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> Have used this for fourteen years and love it.</li>
            <li> This lotion felt more like oil.</li>
            <li> You will love this product.  </li>
            <li> This stuff smells great and really works.</li>
            <li> I love this tanning oil.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> :)  and works.</li>
            <li> You might be buying more of it each summer</li>
            <li> know I will be. :))</li>
            <li> the best browning lotion it not only helps ne tan better</li>
            <li> ok WE have a tanning bed because I do use it also</li>
            <li> This is my favorite suntan lotion.</li>
            <li> I love the smell (coffee).  </li>
            <li> I bought this in Maui and was the most tan I&#x27;ve ever been in my life.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I used it in Maui and glad I can get it in Indiana.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great except, it leaves you feeling really greasy.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it is made and found on hawaii.</li>
            <li> Love the scent and use it with sunscreen all the time.</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion before and its outstanding</li>
            <li> Yes its very nice and u can get fast tan</li>
            <li> Great stuff highly recommend it for a.dark tan and moisturizer as well but be sure to have your passport or you may be thought of as an immigrant .</li>
            <li> So much so, that people that meet me now, don&#x27;t think I have fair skin.    </li>
            <li> Tans fast, smells good</li>
            <li> I wanted to make sure it was worth the $15!</li>
            <li> I originally ordered a bottle from their website and fell in love with the stuff.</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s so easy to get.</li>
            <li> but easily washes out.</li>
            <li> Allows you to tan very quickly.</li>
            <li> Even for me who does not tan easily.  </li>
            <li> (australian Gold has some really good bronzers) and I get a nice tan by the end of the day without any burn.</li>
            <li> It browns the skin like no other product, and it smells great.  </li>
            <li> fair skinned person may want to use a high sunscreen along with this product.  </li>
            <li> it was quite funny to be honest.  </li>
            <li> Only improvement I would make is a more pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> I feel it&#x27;s a little pricy, but the results are great!</li>
            <li> It contains light mineral oil, kukui nut oil, vitamins E, C &amp; A, Kona coffee plant extract, aloe, and potassium iodide.</li>
            <li> Stains light clothes, towels, etc.</li>
            <li> and I hd some free time.  </li>
            <li> all oiled up reflecting any light that hit my body.  </li>
            <li> The REAL product is amazing, but whatever they are selling here is not.</li>
            <li> This browni g lotion is fantastic...</li>
            <li> I was introduced to it in Hawaii and loved the natural coffee smell and the tan gowing tan it gives you.</li>
            <li> Fast golden tan that lasts!!!</li>
            <li> It also came so fast!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already dark-skinned but Maui Babe gives me a good brown/golden glow without looking orange and also leaves my skin super soft.</li>
            <li> Originally heard of this from the locals when we were in Hawaii.</li>
            <li> I wanted to make sure it was legit, theirs was a bit more expensive but is deff the real deal, love this stuff works great!</li>
            <li> you can tell its natural and I LOVE the coffee smell :)</li>
            <li> I have seen a huge difference in how quickly I tan.</li>
            <li> So the shower I go and clean this stuff off.  </li>
            <li> Love Maui Babe, Just got back from Maui and this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, it smells wonderful, moisturizes great, and this was the first trip that I didn&#x27;t burn at all</li>
            <li> and i have never turned brown before, always bright red like a lobster.</li>
            <li> The smell is good, I personally don&#x27;t mind it.</li>
            <li> I am almost through the second one now and am a good deal darker.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is, it won&#x27;t be good for you guys and girls who don&#x27;t like an oil based product.</li>
            <li> I have used this for 5 years and you get a better tan than with anyother product, I recommend that anyone that wants a glowing tan try this.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff I am very lite complected</li>
            <li> I bought this on the Big Island at the beginning of my trip after reading the great positive reviews here.</li>
            <li> It browns quickly</li>
            <li> quickly however, one of my bottles of lotion has a crack in it</li>
            <li> I have never used a suntan product that worked as well and as quickly at this one.  </li>
            <li> are better off buying it from a more established retailer such as bed bath and beyond, or Walgreen (in some locations)</li>
            <li> Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> If I go into very hot climates I use this with a sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> and I have gotten it all over the place it shoots out of the bottle when it&#x27;s very hot out</li>
            <li> The smell is something to get used to, while not unpleasant you just have to get used to smelling like a cup of coffee.  </li>
            <li> I clean our own pool and when I remove cartridges, there are definite brown spots that do not wash off.</li>
            <li> Great product &amp; it is less than what you would pay @</li>
            <li> (My arms &amp; upper body always seem to tan better)!  </li>
            <li> this is a great year round use product.</li>
            <li> I rarely use anything else.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money .</li>
            <li> well worth  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love the natural brown color it gives me.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Worth</li>
            <li> I read the reviews of other fair skinned people liking this product, and decided to buy a trial bottle.  </li>
            <li> I tanned right before I went to bed</li>
            <li> the results that it claims where right on.  </li>
            <li> Gives me a good dark tan.</li>
            <li> These products are great!&lt;br /&gt;Working on my amazing dark tan right now...in the bay area!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know what half the ppl on here are talking about a good smell to me</li>
            <li> I liked it so much the first day (noticable difference in skin tone after just 3 hours) that I came back and ordered another 2 bottles.  </li>
            <li> Got it delivered very fast.</li>
            <li> But if you are Fair  skin it might take a little longer to get brown</li>
            <li> This is simply the best way to get a fast dark tan EVER!  </li>
            <li> Since I first bought it.</li>
            <li> This lotion is exactly as promised.</li>
            <li> The product I received was unfortunately not of the same quality as the lovely Maui Babe lotion purchased on the islands.  </li>
            <li> First time I used it was on a hot sunny day to mow the lawn.  </li>
            <li> I did get a tan though ;)  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff - I just never seem to buy enough when I am in Hawaii.   </li>
            <li> Used this for the first time in 2009 when we went to Hawaii.  </li>
            <li> i cant even believe how fast i tan!</li>
            <li> Used this on the first day of a week-long vacation at the jersey shore.  </li>
            <li> I love it and always order double...</li>
            <li> First tried this product while visiting Hawaii, one of the locals let me use theirs and have never used anything else since.</li>
            <li> Make sure that you have something to clean your hands with after application as it is dark and a bit oily and&lt;br /&gt;should be removed from ones hands after application.  </li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t as oily, it just makes your skin super soft.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, then you will love it.</li>
            <li> and it takes only a few days to achieve the beautiful sun tan color on ones body.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too messy to use in the tanning bed because it&#x27;s so oily, but great for a day in the sun!</li>
            <li> it keeps my skin very soft during the summer!!</li>
            <li> So just rub it in very well, and you&#x27;ll have no problems at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Now we are getting ready to go on a cruise in March 2015.  </li>
            <li> It works great , in about 3 -4 applications I had the same tan as back home exposed to several weeks on the beach .</li>
            <li> Well I received my order so thank you so much for getting it here</li>
            <li> Works really well doesn&#x27;t go on greasy like some tannig products</li>
            <li> You tan FAST</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t care what it is that makes it work...</li>
            <li> it was much darker and leaves your hands looking brown after you apply it.</li>
            <li> well it is straight out of the bottle</li>
            <li> This lotion really does speed up the tanning process, without burning.  </li>
            <li> It is the real deal.  </li>
            <li> This is fabulous for keeping skin moist and promoting a deep tan.</li>
            <li> really helps you get a darker tan</li>
            <li> Best tanning lotion out there, but remember to wear a suit that you don&#x27;t mind getting dirty.</li>
            <li> I was headed to the beach in 3 days so needed something capable of being overnighted.</li>
            <li> It is very oily and can stain your clothes.</li>
            <li> No stains , fast tan.</li>
            <li> but I can definitely vouch for the original product.</li>
            <li> I have fair Norwegian skin that doesn&#x27;t typically tan very well.</li>
            <li> and I still was able to get dark tan.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to all skin types, but be sure to lay down a coat of SPF below the Maui Babe, since it doesn&#x27;t contain any.  </li>
            <li> Lucky me, I work in a tanning salon so trying all different kinds of lotion has became a hobby of mine.</li>
            <li> It could possibly stain your towel or clothing, especially white, but should mostly come out in the wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and wow........I was nice and brown and has lasted for few days so far.  </li>
            <li> Im a guy that is a few shades darker than a normal fair skinned white boy</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Highly recommended..</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This company also has an after sun moisturizing cream and that works nicely too, but I have several other after sun products that I use.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff...very dark tan!</li>
            <li> I a beach lover and live in Florida</li>
            <li> and I new</li>
            <li> keeps my skin soft for days!</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell other then that we love it.</li>
            <li> Used it for only 2 days in the first sun rays of spring here</li>
            <li> first of all, it works in a really short amount of time.</li>
            <li> At the end of the summer, I was completely, unrecognizably tan!</li>
            <li> Went on smoothly and gave a even and dark tan.</li>
            <li> I put it on and the smell is a little strong</li>
            <li> This one did none of the such, I feel like its a watered down or cut with more oil in comparison maui babes that I have used in the past&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> tan last so much longer with Maui Babe.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> so this lotion is always with me, it leaves my skin soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> My boss ordered boxes and boxes of this stuff, he told me all about it, being from Hawaii, and how it is all natural.</li>
            <li> Remember this is a BROWNING lotion, all natural, no bronzers.</li>
            <li> although some lotions can turn you orange-y, this gives you BROWN natural looking color.</li>
            <li> the product really well, as the directions say, I can even stand the coffee aroma it emanates, but it is almost totally slimy from \\&quot;light\\&quot; mineral oil!.</li>
            <li> Only thing my husband wants to use.  </li>
            <li> Its made from natural products.</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t been sunny enough to try it out too much though hopefully soon &amp;#34;/</li>
            <li> After it soaks in your skin is just really soft and silky...</li>
            <li> so this wasn&#x27;t fast enough for me.</li>
            <li> It kept my skin soft and no sunburns.</li>
            <li> Great tanning lotion, my friend who lives in Hawaii introduced this to me and i wont use anything else, worth the extra cost, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It is pretty greasy and smells a little like coffee, but if you want a nice tan in a short time, you&#x27;ll get past that.</li>
            <li> It does leave you a little greasy (not bad)</li>
            <li> I lived in Key Largo for 7 years &amp; had the entire summer off 2 years ago, and because it never rains down there, I was able to lay out, front and back, for 4-5 hours a day.</li>
            <li> This is definitely not a lotion that you would use at a tanning salon out in public unless you plan on going straight to your car to home</li>
            <li> The regular version leaves too much of a mess to clean up afterwards.    </li>
            <li> was like no other.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this tanning lotion to anyone who wants a dark tan as if they just left the islands.</li>
            <li> and so i expected this stuff to work really well.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t help at all as far as I&#x27;m concerned - still blotchy and red,</li>
            <li> As another reviewer stated, this is not the same stuff you receive directly from Maui Babe.</li>
            <li> this is the same stuff you get directly from the company.</li>
            <li> (less solid) right in your hand.</li>
            <li> Just like other oils, this can leave scum on pool liners but even more so in the filter systems.</li>
            <li> This stuff is worth every single penny if you&#x27;re serious about getting a REAL TAN.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin soft and turns your skin a deep dark brown.</li>
            <li> Target carries the smaller bottles, but they don&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> Would give 5 star for the unbelievable tan I get, but subtract 1 because you have to shower after use as it&#x27;s very greasy and doesn&#x27;t allow your skin to breathe.</li>
            <li> I could not stand it on my skin long enough to see if I tanned as well as my friend.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I actually found it in a tanning salon on Long Island [where I&#x27;m from].</li>
            <li> so be realllly careful as you can burn especially if you dont have an spf on under it.</li>
            <li> and know how long one can remain in the sun according to ones skin type.</li>
            <li> Grease monkey........</li>
            <li> Even my fingers, toes and tops of my feet were brown, with white skin in between where I had my fingers closed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why there is a difference, the labeling appears to be the same, but it is definitely not the same product I bought in Hawaii.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wear this product for the day and be active in regular clothes .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the only one active on Amazon</li>
            <li> and I get a deep, dark tan using Maui Brown Babe.</li>
            <li> But when it got here, I was kind of disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You have to be careful to really rub in it well if you put on clothes after applying, because Maui Babe is very slightly brown in color when it gets on your skin---so slightly that it&#x27;s really not noticeable (unlike a stain or self</li>
            <li> It also tingles on your skin, possibly from the coffee beans as well, so you feel slightly energized.    </li>
            <li> The stuff mailed to me from Amazon was way darker and smelled disgusting (the original stuff smells sweet).</li>
            <li> so you need only a little.</li>
            <li> These are not real.</li>
            <li> this product performed as expected and the star rating reflects that</li>
            <li> She had heard of it while vacationing in Mexico and saw the tannest old white man she had ever seen and asked his secret.</li>
            <li> I usually put some in my palms and mix it with my regular lotion.</li>
            <li> Bought in small surf shop on visit to Cali last year and got hooked.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I have seen on other people&#x27;s reviews they didn&#x27;t like the scent.</li>
            <li> I will never use any other tanning product.</li>
            <li> I use it as recommended and i get extremely burnt everytime..</li>
            <li> (looks like a self tanner) while the other stuff doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Smells like brown sugar and if you don&#x27;t watch yourself, can stain your swim-suit, so just be careful!</li>
            <li> And even though it was expensive for me for something that I don&#x27;t really need, I got it!</li>
            <li> It smells a little like coffee when you put it on, but that dissipates and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> But you WILL build up a base tan and be able to build up on it sooner than any other tanning lotion out there</li>
            <li> It has been hard to find in our local stores.  </li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t believe how dark you all are!&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> My only complaint would be that the packaging is somewhat faulty...</li>
            <li> It does have aloe, which helps if you do burn slightly.</li>
            <li> The less time you spend in the sun the less chance of getting skin cancer and a bunch of wrinkles...</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s giving me less of a tan than the drugstore tanning oil I bought.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend using this before, unless you don&#x27;t mind being a little oily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You will see results faster than any other product I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> In little time, i advise the all to use this product</li>
            <li> it does irritate my face and chest a little</li>
            <li> It is a little oily at 1st</li>
            <li> I do not believe it hurts the systems just a little disconcerting.    </li>
            <li> Other than that.....LOVE IT !!</li>
            <li> so be careful when opening it !!!</li>
            <li> I use a light sunscreen like an 8 under it until a base is established.</li>
            <li> Received this shipment within a few days and just in time for my vacation.  </li>
            <li> and it was a bit messy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years ever since a friend was using it at our pool.</li>
            <li> Just wipe your hands off with a paper towel when you&#x27;re done wiping it on because it will stain a few spots on your hands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as brown as it looks and is somewhat messy......</li>
            <li> I tried putting it in a baggie to save some of it cause it was pricey but its so messy now.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t like your typical tanning lotions, SO of course I HAD to try it!</li>
            <li> I have bought it in the past  (at Bed Bath and Beyond)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered it ever since for the past 10 years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s streaky and very heavy.</li>
            <li> I applied this product according to instructions and after a couple of hours of wearing, I had dripping brown down my legs from sweating behind my knees.</li>
            <li> Sorry for the long review!</li>
            <li> I have never&lt;br /&gt;gotten burnt when using this product, but one does have to have common sense</li>
            <li> and I have nothing negative to say about it at all.  </li>
            <li> I have been out in the sun for at least 30 minutes, each side every day.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is the kukui nut oil that slowly browns on your skin or the ground</li>
            <li> Initially I thought it was very expensive, but after using it, I changed my mind.</li>
            <li> yes it was expensive for a little bottle but darn.</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad batch, but I&#x27;ve been in the sun for several days at this point and all it seems to do is make me oily and smell like coffee.</li>
            <li> It is a very thick cream</li>
            <li> but once its on your body its really not that bad</li>
            <li> but when it arrived on of the bottles was broken at the bottom.</li>
            <li> They smell disgusting and they are not the actual brand.</li>
            <li> Silly me-</li>
            <li> I am convinced this is fake, you never know when you buy though Amazon.</li>
            <li> Expensive</li>
            <li> Disappointing after all of the \\&quot;testimonials\\</li>
            <li> it stinks</li>
            <li> Never again will I be unfaithful to Maui Babe.  </li>
            <li> The smell of the kona coffee content isn&#x27;t bad either.</li>
            <li> Bad idea.......</li>
            <li> Bad thing is again........</li>
            <li> Some say the smell is bad......</li>
            <li> This year, I cheated and used another product which burned me so badly</li>
            <li> I turned to Amazon and was shocked by the price difference ($22 for 1 8oz bottle on Maui Babes site, $18 for 2 8oz bottles here).</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed with this.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use sunscreen (stupid, i know)</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Its oily and nasty</li>
            <li> I felt disgusting every time I used it.</li>
            <li> The smell was awful also.</li>
            <li> I got a terrible reaction and  my face swelled when I used it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product.  Have used it for years and am very happy.</li>
            <li> Gives me a good dark tan. I use nothing but Maui Browning Lotion.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I&#x27;ve been using it for years on my legs &amp; middle so that I tan more evenly. (My arms &amp; upper body always seem to tan better)!  I don&#x27;t ever want to be in the sun without it!</li>
            <li> I love using this product with an spf30. Gives you a nice brown coloring</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this browner.&lt;br /&gt;My tan last so much longer with Maui Babe.&lt;br /&gt;Also keeps my skin soft for days!</li>
            <li> I found this in a five and dime in Hawaii about 15 hrs ago. The best sun lotion ever. Shared with all my friends. I  Can&#x27;t believe how well known it&#x27;s become. I like to think it&#x27;s because of me! However the price has gone up a bit   Since I first bought it. I used to ask my brother to send me more. He lives there. Now it&#x27;s so easy to get. On line, by phone.   Even some retail outlets. Beautiful tan, without the burn.</li>
            <li> *****&lt;br /&gt;I found out about Maui Babe during a recent vacation to Hawaii. Initially I thought it was very expensive, but after using it, I changed my mind. A little goes a long way, it smells wonderful, moisturizes great, and this was the first trip that I didn&#x27;t burn at all---just got a great tan. I used Maui Babe to moisturize my skin during the day and to help me tan instead of burn, and then one last time after a shower at night, even though I wouldn&#x27;t be going into the sun again, because it just feels so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maui Babe has to be shaken up to disperse all of the different ingredients. Then when it comes out it immediately starts to sort of \\&quot;melt\\&quot; or get liquidy (less solid) right in your hand. It contains light mineral oil, kukui nut oil, vitamins E, C &amp; A, Kona coffee plant extract, aloe, and potassium iodide. The dominant smell is coffee and nut butter---really wonderful smell for men or women. All ingredients are Hawaiian and the lotion is made in Wailuku, Maui.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The label on the back says that it is the aloe that helps prevent burning, and of course, it soothes the skin after being in the sun, too. The label says that it is \\&quot;water resistant\\&quot; (because of the oil, I&#x27;m guessing). The label also says that it can be used with all sunscreens and as a \\&quot;tan accelerant\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to be careful to really rub in it well if you put on clothes after applying, because Maui Babe is very slightly brown in color when it gets on your skin---so slightly that it&#x27;s really not noticeable (unlike a stain or self-tanner)---but enough so that it will get on your clothes. So just rub it in very well, and you&#x27;ll have no problems at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it and I will buy it again and again. Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;*****</li>
            <li> This suntan lotion is one of the best I have ever used. I used it in Hawaii 5 years ago during a visit and have used it ever since. The items I bought is at an excellent price. I am happy with my lotions and recommened the prices of this seller. Highly recommended.. Thank you again....Frank</li>
            <li> Been using this product since I visited Hawaii and found it there in a local shop.  It browns quickly and I can stay out in the sun for hours and not burn also.  I rarely use anything else.</li>
            <li> Great stuff highly recommend it for a.dark tan and moisturizer as well but be sure to have your passport or you may be thought of as an immigrant .</li>
            <li> Ordered it Friday got here on tues. Ordered from Maui babe inc. cause I wanted to make sure it was legit, theirs was a bit more expensive but is deff the real deal, love this stuff works great! Thanks</li>
            <li> When i ordered it, came very quickly, in time for my trip to The Caribbean islands!! Great service!! Will use them again!!</li>
            <li> These are not real. They smell disgusting and they are not the actual brand. They do not work as the actual brand does.</li>
            <li> Simply the best tanning lotion I have come across, great value for money and seemless delivery via Amazon. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Cant go to the beach without my Maui Babe!</li>
            <li> Great product &amp; it is less than what you would pay @ the store in Hawaii.</li>
            <li> Awesome lotion! I use it combined with my regular bronzer SPF 30 or 15 (australian Gold has some really good bronzers) and I get a nice tan by the end of the day without any burn. It is a very thick cream so you need only a little. I usually put some in my palms and mix it with my regular lotion. From the warmth of my skin it gets more liquidy so it is easier to spread it around. Stains light clothes, towels, etc. but easily washes out. Makes your skin shiny and glowy and I love the smell of it, too. I a beach lover and live in Florida so this lotion is always with me, it leaves my skin soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> this is a great year round use product.</li>
            <li> This is the best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. I have fair, freckled skin and I get a deep, dark tan using Maui Brown Babe. I use a light sunscreen like an 8 under it until a base is established. I have used this to tan in Hawaii and Mexico. It is pretty greasy and smells a little like coffee, but if you want a nice tan in a short time, you&#x27;ll get past that.</li>
            <li> I LOOOVVVEEE this amazing lotion. Bought in small surf shop on visit to Cali last year and got hooked.  Received this shipment within a few days and just in time for my vacation.  Everyone that tried it is now ordering it.  The tan is amazing on everyone and it lasts.  Try it.. You will be hooked too!</li>
            <li> It  tans real good.  We were in Las Vegas last September 2014 and my husband brought a bottle there and he loves it.  Then we went to Arbua for a week in October 2014 and we were at the beach every day.  Now we are getting ready to go on a cruise in March 2015.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell other then that we love it.</li>
            <li> i love maui babe! I first found out about it when I was in Hawaii and was so happy that i could get it online!  I use it both outside and in tanning beds....I saw results within a 2 or 3 uses :]</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! It works and its healthy!!! and it smells so good!!!! It also came so fast!!! Love it!!</li>
            <li> This lotion is exactly as promised. It is the best outdoor lotion I have ever used. Amazing results !</li>
            <li> Great great I love it! Used it for only 2 days in the first sun rays of spring here and I got a biiiiiig nice tan!!!! Got it delivered very fast. Thank you very much! More orders will follow!!!</li>
            <li> I was born and raised in a tropical climate and could never find anything in the USA that would give me the same tan as back home , After some research I came across this product and decided to give it a try . It works great , in about 3 -4 applications I had the same tan as back home exposed to several weeks on the beach . Well worth the money .</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion on the market and well worth  the price I love it.</li>
            <li> Im a guy that is a few shades darker than a normal fair skinned white boy and so i expected this stuff to work really well. After paying through the nose for 2 bottles and 1 day delivery of 60 bucks, i tried this over 4 days. After 4 days, i noticed no difference than if i were walking in the sun without sunscreen. A hint of brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Id ask for my money back but hack companies like this probably wouldnt honor it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy. Its oily and nasty and you will sweat uncontrollably.</li>
            <li> Hi. Well I received my order so thank you so much for getting it here quickly however, one of my bottles of lotion has a crack in it and it was a bit messy but I love the product</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wear this product for the day and be active in regular clothes . Can only be used to lay in the sun. I applied this product according to instructions and after a couple of hours of wearing, I had dripping brown down my legs from sweating behind my knees. I also had brown in neck wrinkles and elbow creases from bent arms while reading from sweating in sun. The smell is something to get used to, while not unpleasant you just have to get used to smelling like a cup of coffee.  I bought this product because my daughter noticed a nice tan on her friends mother and she knows how I worship the sun using baby oil (which she hates) so she asked and sent me link to where I could buy through Amazon. Silly me- I bought 2 bottles, trying to save a buck.</li>
            <li> Works really well doesn&#x27;t go on greasy like some tannig products</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any experience with this company but I can definitely vouch for the original product. I found the 4oz bottle in Target for $10.. works and feels better than any tanning oils and lotions.. you can tell its natural and I LOVE the coffee smell :)</li>
            <li> The product I received was unfortunately not of the same quality as the lovely Maui Babe lotion purchased on the islands.  I&#x27;m not sure why there is a difference, the labeling appears to be the same, but it is definitely not the same product I bought in Hawaii.  I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Was totally in awe of how tan I was after only one day in the sun  Only improvement I would make is a more pleasant scent. Other than that.....LOVE IT !!</li>
            <li> I bought this on the Big Island at the beginning of my trip after reading the great positive reviews here. I wanted to make sure it was worth the $15! Maybe I got a bad batch, but I&#x27;ve been in the sun for several days at this point and all it seems to do is make me oily and smell like coffee. I have fair Norwegian skin that doesn&#x27;t typically tan very well. This didn&#x27;t help at all as far as I&#x27;m concerned - still blotchy and red, just like I always am after being in the sun. I used sunscreen underneath this as well, as recommended. Others claiming a similar complexion claimed it works great! Disappointing after all of the \\&quot;testimonials\\&quot; I read here.</li>
            <li> Lucky me, I work in a tanning salon so trying all different kinds of lotion has became a hobby of mine.My boss ordered boxes and boxes of this stuff, he told me all about it, being from Hawaii, and how it is all natural.It isn&#x27;t like your typical tanning lotions, SO of course I HAD to try it! Remember this is a BROWNING lotion, all natural, no bronzers.I do like bronzers, although some lotions can turn you orange-y, this gives you BROWN natural looking color.For those of you who like instant gratification, it does just THAT! As soon as you put it on it browns you so well.I have got one of the best tans I have ever had from this lotion.The only thing I do NOT like about this product is how oily it is.It is a lotion-y oil though, not like baby oil.BUT I&#x27;ve found it you put on a lotion (recommend just an accelerator, no bronzers) it isn&#x27;t as oily, it just makes your skin super soft.No stick at all! I mixed mine with Designer Skin&#x27;s Phoenician, that I did purchase off of here for about $33.So if you&#x27;re tanning with this before you have to be somewhere, like work or running errands I don&#x27;t recommend using this before, unless you don&#x27;t mind being a little oily.A little bit goes a long way! It&#x27;s spreads on SO nicely.The smell is good, I personally don&#x27;t mind it.I have seen on other people&#x27;s reviews they didn&#x27;t like the scent.I like to compare the scent to Bit&#x27;O Honey candy.So I definitely give Maui Babe an A++ and recommend this product to anyone!! Great Tan,Good Texture,Good Scent.Sorry for the long review! Enjoy! :)</li>
            <li> This is without a doubt THE BEST tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.You tan FAST and you tan DARK.I cannot begin to tell you how well this works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a matter of fact ,I think I&#x27;ll reorder while I&#x27;m here.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great Stuff!!</li>
            <li> Great tanning lotion, my friend who lives in Hawaii introduced this to me and i wont use anything else, worth the extra cost, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best Suntan lotion I have ever used.  I am a red head, and I turn red or if I use tanner I turn orange.  With Maui Babe I do get brown.  It must be the Kona coffee.  I really don&#x27;t care what it is that makes it work...IT JUST WORKS....</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  I read the reviews of other fair skinned people liking this product, and decided to buy a trial bottle.  I waited until it arrived and then until a day when the sun was out and I hd some free time.  I put it on and headed upstairs for some tanning on my roof.      This stuff works.  I don&#x27;t know if it is the kukui nut oil that slowly browns on your skin or the ground Kona coffee beans that do it, but something about this formula works.  It also tingles on your skin, possibly from the coffee beans as well, so you feel slightly energized.    It does have a faint coffee smell and despite being labled a lotion -- it contains some mineral oil -- will feel more like an oil once it warms up in the sun.    I liked it so much the first day (noticable difference in skin tone after just 3 hours) that I came back and ordered another 2 bottles.  I am almost through the second one now and am a good deal darker.  So much so, that people that meet me now, don&#x27;t think I have fair skin.    I do all my tanning in the sun, but if you want to use the tanning beds, I would suggest you use the version of Maui Babe that is designed for that.  The regular version leaves too much of a mess to clean up afterwards.    I would recommend this product to all skin types, but be sure to lay down a coat of SPF below the Maui Babe, since it doesn&#x27;t contain any.  It does have aloe, which helps if you do burn slightly.</li>
            <li> The best stuff I have ever used.  Highly recommend this tanning lotion to anyone who wants a dark tan as if they just left the islands.</li>
            <li> this stuff is AWESOME. first of all, it works in a really short amount of time. so be realllly careful as you can burn especially if you dont have an spf on under it. it makes you BROWN and i have never turned brown before, always bright red like a lobster. also since it has coffee in it i swear it gives me a buzz! like my skin feels awake. i love this stuff and i am a repeat customer! remember be safe in the sun!</li>
            <li> The best tanning lotion I have ever had, and I know how to get a good tan.  This product is the best!!!  Goes on smooth, and smells like coffee (really a good smell).  Hope you get as tan as I do with this.  You won&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li> This is the best tanning lotion on the market. it gives the best color I have ever seen, and it&#x27;s not greasy at all. Good bang for your buck!!</li>
            <li> Maui Babe is an essential for any beach trip.  It browns the skin like no other product, and it smells great.  It&#x27;s a little too messy to use in the tanning bed because it&#x27;s so oily, but great for a day in the sun!</li>
            <li> I have never used a suntan product that worked as well and as quickly at this one.  I am 100% pleased and I am recommending it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t actually used this in the sun yet, but I&#x27;ve opened it and put some on my skin just to try it, and it is greasy and smells like soy sauce.  I may post another review after I&#x27;ve used it in the sun.</li>
            <li> Great tanning lotion! Smells amazing like Hawaii and it works like a charm!</li>
            <li> Best sun tanning lotion on the market!!!</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion is absolutely wonderful.   The darkest I have ever been. It does leave you a little greasy (not bad) but some so keep this in mind.  This lotion is so great its like you can tan without even being in the sun.  Your tan will be brown like the ole copperton commercials. Try it you will like it!</li>
            <li> Have used this for fourteen years and love it.</li>
            <li> This lotion felt more like oil.I felt disgusting every time I used it. The smell was awful also. I will never purchase this lotion again.</li>
            <li> This product is one that I have used for several years. It was recommended to me by an airline stewardess  who travels the world.  She told me that&lt;br /&gt;the tan I would get from this product was like no other. She was correct.  If I go into very hot climates I use this with a sunscreen.  I have never&lt;br /&gt;gotten burnt when using this product, but one does have to have common sense and know how long one can remain in the sun according to ones skin type. The color achieved with the Maui Babe is a beautiful golden tan....and it takes only a few days to achieve the beautiful sun tan color on ones body.  You will love this product.  Make sure that you have something to clean your hands with after application as it is dark and a bit oily and&lt;br /&gt;should be removed from ones hands after application.  This company also has an after sun moisturizing cream and that works nicely too, but I have several other after sun products that I use.  Also I have never peeled when using this product, but then again everyone skins tones are different.&lt;br /&gt;A fair skinned person may want to use a high sunscreen along with this product.  I do that but only an eight and then a four then a two and then&lt;br /&gt;none.  Gradually going off of the sunscreen and just using the Maui Babe.  I use this all summer and could not go a summer without it.</li>
            <li> Best tan out there - use it - have tried many products, this one works….and I had fair skin, now I look native…</li>
            <li> great tanning product.</li>
            <li> i bought the product after seeing a friend with an amazing tan. I ordered it because it said the product was a lotion. I have an \\&quot;oil\\&quot; phobia, so lotion is the way to go for me.&lt;br /&gt;I shhok the product really well, as the directions say, I can even stand the coffee aroma it emanates, but it is almost totally slimy from \\&quot;light\\&quot; mineral oil!. I could not stand it on my skin long enough to see if I tanned as well as my friend.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t mind oil, you won&#x27;t mind this product!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great and really works. I have seen a huge difference in how quickly I tan. Can&#x27;t get enough of it!</li>
            <li> Maui Babe is by far the best tanning product that I have ever come across. I actually found it in a tanning salon on Long Island [where I&#x27;m from]. It was alittle pricey, but I thought I&#x27;d give it a whirl. I will never use any other tanning product. The only thing is, it won&#x27;t be good for you guys and girls who don&#x27;t like an oil based product. The smell of the kona coffee content isn&#x27;t bad either. It even keeps you from burning [like it says on the package]. Just take note-that even though it says it&#x27;s a browning LOTION, it does CONTAIN some mineral oil, like I mentioned earlier. Also, do yourself a favor and buy it through AMAZON, you can&#x27;t beat the price. Happy Tanning !</li>
            <li> I have used this stuff for years and I found the 2 pack online so I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I have bought it in the past  (at Bed Bath and Beyond) it was much darker and leaves your hands looking brown after you apply it. This one did none of the such, I feel like its a watered down or cut with more oil in comparison maui babes that I have used in the past&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are better off buying it from a more established retailer such as bed bath and beyond, or Walgreen (in some locations) also Target online store has the product..</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff in earth! Thank you for bringing this amazing lotion in my world</li>
            <li> Love Maui Babe products!  We had to cancel our trip to Hawaii so had to purchase on line...These products are great!&lt;br /&gt;Working on my amazing dark tan right now...in the bay area!</li>
            <li> I love this tanning oil.  It is the best on all types of skin and color.  I visted Maui years ago and it is still use it.  This company shipped this with care and on time.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite tanning lotion. Whenever I use it, everyone steals it, and also fall in love with it!</li>
            <li> Only thing my husband wants to use.  The smell i&lt;br /&gt;s amazing and the results are too!</li>
            <li> My brother brought this back from Hawaii and so the addiction began........I am hooked.  Absolutely love the natural brown color it gives me. I will not use anything else, point blank period!!  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years ever since a friend was using it at our pool. She had heard of it while vacationing in Mexico and saw the tannest old white man she had ever seen and asked his secret. *Maui Babe* Its made from natural products. You will need to wipe your hands after application. It could possibly stain your towel or clothing, especially white, but should mostly come out in the wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will see results faster than any other product I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> Smelllllllls sooooo good! Just like coffee. Hasn&#x27;t been sunny enough to try it out too much though hopefully soon &amp;#34;/</li>
            <li> best ever tanning lotion  will buy again and again</li>
            <li> Maui babe -&lt;br /&gt;I went to Hawaii n bought this in the abc stores yes it was expensive for a little bottle but darn. It works so good&lt;br /&gt;I was out in the sun today 2 hours and I&#x27;m a toasted red pepper. But tomorrow I&#x27;ll turn in to a brown pepper. This is the only suntan browning lotion I&#x27;ll use  Yes it stinks but what doesn&#x27;t  stink these days. :)  and works. It&#x27;s works great for me. But if you are Fair  skin it might take a little longer to get brown&lt;br /&gt;Come on try it  You might be buying more of it each summer&lt;br /&gt;I know I will be. :))</li>
            <li> Found it in Hawaii, and have been using it since.</li>
            <li> the best browning lotion it not only helps ne tan better it keeps my skin very soft during the summer!!</li>
            <li> Yes its very nice and u can get fast tan In little time, i advise the all to use this product</li>
            <li> Loved the service loved the product</li>
            <li> My wife told me about this product and wanted me to look into it for herself.  I&#x27;m the only one active on Amazon so I ordered this two pack and see if this product is any good.  First time I used it was on a hot sunny day to mow the lawn.  Bad idea.......this stuff is mega greasy and any and all dirt or grass will stick to you like fly paper.  I looked like a dirt monster after mowing......it was quite funny to be honest.  I did get a tan though ;)  My wife has a tanning bed.......ok WE have a tanning bed because I do use it also I guess.  I used the maui babe and wow........I was nice and brown and has lasted for few days so far.  Bad thing is again........its dang greasy.  I tanned right before I went to bed and personally I take a shower in the mornings but there was not way I was going to bed all oiled up reflecting any light that hit my body.  So the shower I go and clean this stuff off.  Next morning the results that it claims where right on.  Some say the smell is bad......well it is straight out of the bottle but once its on your body its really not that bad or maybe I just got used to it.  It smells like burnt coffee and butter.  This is definitely not a lotion that you would use at a tanning salon out in public unless you plan on going straight to your car to home I guess.  Grease monkey........but I have to say IT DOES WORK.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff - I just never seem to buy enough when I am in Hawaii.   It is great for outdoors and tanning beds!!</li>
            <li> This lotion really does speed up the tanning process, without burning.  I recommend!</li>
            <li> This product does what it says......it browns you.  It is the real deal.  Even if you are fair skinned,&lt;br /&gt;you will brown with this product.  Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Used this for the first time in 2009 when we went to Hawaii.  It has been hard to find in our local stores.  Target carries the smaller bottles, but they don&#x27;t last long.  We bought this for our Florida vacation and my husband and I both have great tans.  My daughter said three times, &amp;#34;Wow mom, I can&#x27;t believe how dark you all are!&amp;#34;  I feel it&#x27;s a little pricy, but the results are great!</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff on the planet if you want to get a natural, brown tan. I&#x27;ve lived in Florida all my life and have always had some form of a tan. I lived in Key Largo for 7 years &amp; had the entire summer off 2 years ago, and because it never rains down there, I was able to lay out, front and back, for 4-5 hours a day. It&#x27;s not a skin colorant or dye; it just makes your tan brown, which is&lt;br /&gt;what you want it to be. At the end of the summer, I was completely, unrecognizably tan! Even my fingers, toes and tops of my feet were brown, with white skin in between where I had my fingers closed. It smells a little like coffee when you put it on, but that dissipates and a little goes a long way. I put it on my face, neck, ears, back of neck, entire body, etc. There was not one inch&lt;br /&gt;outside my bathing suit lines that was not brown. Happiest summer of my life. This stuff is worth every single penny if you&#x27;re serious about getting a REAL TAN. Don&#x27;t expect it in one day. But you WILL build up a base tan and be able to build up on it sooner than any other tanning lotion out there and I&#x27;ve used them all. It&#x27;s not sticky and soaks in nicely. Just wipe your hands off with a paper towel when you&#x27;re done wiping it on because it will stain a few spots on your hands. I&#x27;d give this stuff 10 STARS if I could!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best tanning lotion I have ever used. I will never used anything else.</li>
            <li> This is fabulous for keeping skin moist and promoting a deep tan.</li>
            <li> Went on smoothly and gave a even and dark tan. Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite suntan lotion. It works great and gives a smooth tan.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff I feel like I got a lot darker faster than ever sitting in the dun !!! I put it on and the smell is a little strong but it wears off doesn&#x27;t stain towels and I have gotten it all over the place it shoots out of the bottle when it&#x27;s very hot out so be careful when opening it !!!</li>
            <li> I use it as recommended and i get extremely burnt everytime..</li>
            <li> i cant even believe how fast i tan! it does irritate my face and chest a little but i will continue to use its that amazing!</li>
            <li> I found this lotion in Florida and loved it. But this year  I bought it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> this product performed as expected and the star rating reflects that</li>
            <li> I was introduced to it in Hawaii and loved the natural coffee smell and the tan gowing tan it gives you. I have used this for 5 years and you get a better tan than with anyother product, I recommend that anyone that wants a glowing tan try this.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it. Use it as recommended with sunscreen and you will get good results.</li>
            <li> REAL Maui Babe skin oil is wonderful and smells like brown sugar and coffee. I ordered this on Amazon and it smells like soy sauce and does not feel or protect like Maui Babe. This stuff is not sold by Maui Babe and I new I was taking a gamble ordering online. I am convinced this is fake, you never know when you buy though Amazon. I have seen this online and in-store at Ulta so I guess I will buy it there from now on.</li>
            <li> Used this on the first day of a week-long vacation at the jersey shore.  LOVED IT.  I didn&#x27;t use sunscreen (stupid, i know) but i didn&#x27;t burn and i was nice and brown.  I have medium skin tone.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like this at all! It&#x27;s streaky and very heavy.</li>
            <li> I found this product while in maui.  I love it!  It makes your skin soft and turns your skin a deep dark brown.</li>
            <li> This is simply the best way to get a fast dark tan EVER!  The less time you spend in the sun the less chance of getting skin cancer and a bunch of wrinkles...so the faster I can \\&quot;cop a tan\\&quot; the better!  In addition some research indicates that caffeine (an ingredient of this product) may help prevent skin cancer.  It is a little oily at 1st but it makes you look darker instantly!  After it soaks in your skin is just really soft and silky...and it doesn&#x27;t have all the chemicals of commercial products.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine turned me onto this and it is the best suntan lotion on the market!It really helps you get a darker tan if that is what you&#x27;re after.</li>
            <li> This product is great.</li>
            <li> Would give 5 star for the unbelievable tan I get, but subtract 1 because you have to shower after use as it&#x27;s very greasy and doesn&#x27;t allow your skin to breathe. On a hot day, you sweat a lot wearing it, and it doesn&#x27;t have the best scent. Worth it considering the end result.  It is not a bronzer or sunless tanner, but does have a browning color that I think enhances your tan.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love!  I have used this for years and I have nothing negative to say about it at all.  I love the smell (coffee).  This year, I cheated and used another product which burned me so badly I had blisters on my skin.  Never again will I be unfaithful to Maui Babe.  Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  Allows you to tan very quickly.</li>
            <li> The best! Smells like coffee. Gives skin beautiful color!</li>
            <li> Folks without question this is the best tanning product out there.     One thing to keep in mind is if you have a pool wipe off before entering. Just like other oils, this can leave scum on pool liners but even more so in the filter systems. I clean our own pool and when I remove cartridges, there are definite brown spots that do not wash off. Waterfalls and spas may create chocolate foam. I do not believe it hurts the systems just a little disconcerting.    \\&quot;MAUI-BABE\\&quot; keeps the bugs away...I kid you not it works.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.  Even for me who does not tan easily.  Since I tend to burn instead it gives me a great glow.</li>
            <li> Best tanning lotion out there, but remember to wear a suit that you don&#x27;t mind getting dirty. It&#x27;s as brown as it looks and is somewhat messy......tanning results are good though.</li>
            <li> As another reviewer stated, this is not the same stuff you receive directly from Maui Babe. I originally ordered a bottle from their website and fell in love with the stuff. I was headed to the beach in 3 days so needed something capable of being overnighted. MauiBabe ships via USPS so this wasn&#x27;t fast enough for me. I turned to Amazon and was shocked by the price difference ($22 for 1 8oz bottle on Maui Babes site, $18 for 2 8oz bottles here). I ordered the stuff off here and immediately noticed the difference. The labeling is the same, but the product in the bottle is definitely not. The stuff mailed to me from Amazon was way darker and smelled disgusting (the original stuff smells sweet). This stuff had a chemical smell to it. I emailed Amazon questioning why the discrepancy and they just issued me a refund. I didn&#x27;t ask for one I was just wondering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no way this is the same stuff you get directly from the company. This stuff stains your skin (looks like a self tanner) while the other stuff doesn&#x27;t. The REAL product is amazing, but whatever they are selling here is not. Do NOT order it from SellThrifty, or any company not Maui Babe Inc. The product is not authentic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do credit Amazon for refunding me, however they shouldn&#x27;t sell impostor products on here.</li>
            <li> I bought this in Maui and was the most tan I&#x27;ve ever been in my life. I&#x27;ve ordered it ever since for the past 10 years. I love it.</li>
            <li> I had bought some in Maui years ago and it was alot darker than this is.  I haven&#x27;t tried it yet.  It&#x27;s always raining.  But I will try it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome bought some in Hawaii loved it so much I was glad I found some online and cheaper than anywhere !!!</li>
            <li> Best tanning product I have ever used by far.</li>
            <li> Tans fast, smells good and I will order again.  Hey any promo codes to reorder? Now there is an idea to have current customers get a discount to order again!  Where is my coupon? I will order again!</li>
            <li> Love it! I used it in Maui and glad I can get it in Indiana. It&#x27;s great except, it leaves you feeling really greasy. If you have dry skin, then you will love it. It doesn&#x27;t turn you Orange either!</li>
            <li> Originally heard of this from the locals when we were in Hawaii. I used it to tan prior to going to Hawaii because I knew I would be about 10 feet from the sun and didn&#x27;t want to fry. So, I got my tan on. It works great, smells like Hawaii and makes me want to go again.</li>
            <li> This does give you a tanned look, but use it sparingly. It is very oily and can stain your clothes.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it is made and found on hawaii. maui babe is an awesome tanning cream. but I think that it&#x27;s over priced.</li>
            <li> Love Maui Babe, Just got back from Maui and this stuff is amazing. Expensive but it works no sunscreen though.</li>
            <li> Been using it every-time I lay out. I&#x27;m already dark-skinned but Maui Babe gives me a good brown/golden glow without looking orange and also leaves my skin super soft. Smells like brown sugar and if you don&#x27;t watch yourself, can stain your swim-suit, so just be careful! Otherwise, this is an awesome purchase.</li>
            <li> iI like the product but the seal on the bottom of one bottle leaked. I set it on the counter and came back awhile later and it was all over the place. I tried putting it in a baggie to save some of it cause it was pricey but its so messy now.</li>
            <li> Love my Maui babe lotion! But one of the bottles that came exploded in the box and after telling you this I never did receive another bottle..??</li>
            <li> Love the deal Love the product!</li>
            <li> Amazing tanning lotion</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> The products is great...but when it arrived on of the bottles was broken at the bottom.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!!! Fast golden tan that lasts!!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff...very dark tan!</li>
            <li> I got a terrible reaction and  my face swelled when I used it.</li>
            <li> Great !  No stains , fast tan. Lessons the need for extended stays in the sun.  Used it for 4 years, and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> It works!!! I love this stuff I am very lite complected and I&#x27;ve only used it twice this year and I on my way to a very good tan.</li>
            <li> So I ordered thi stuff after reading reviews I only tried it on once so I guess once it&#x27;s on your body it makes u look tanner cuz of the stuff inside it but not yet fully tried and see the difference as for the smell I don&#x27;t even know what half the ppl on here are talking about a good smell to me it smells like soy sauce prob in a week or so I&#x27;ll put in another review</li>
            <li> Not the same stuff I bought in Maui.That stuff worked great!  I just finished that bottle when I found this.Lighter in color, and does not work. I am very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> This browni g lotion is fantastic... I love it and always order double... My only complaint would be that the packaging is somewhat faulty... Even though it was &amp;#34;shrink wrapped&amp;#34; both containers had spewed done if the contents out of both bottles!!!</li>
            <li> Really disappointed with this. I saw all the great ratings and comments about this product and was super excited about finding something that would help me tan faster WITHOUT burning me! And even though it was expensive for me for something that I don&#x27;t really need, I got it! But when it got here, I was kind of disappointed. It got here 4 days ago, and I have used it every day since. I have been out in the sun for at least 30 minutes, each side every day. And it&#x27;s giving me less of a tan than the drugstore tanning oil I bought. I went out for 30 minutes each side using the drugstore tanning oil and have gotten tanner than using this browning lotion for 4 days 30 minutes each side. I will definitely not be buying anymore, will be saving my money and getting the drugstore oil for 5 dollars next time.</li>
            <li> Excellent highly recommend</li>
            <li> I love it! I like the smell and I tanned a lot quicker.</li>
            <li> My friend convinced me to try this product. I wear SPF 30 and I still was able to get dark tan. Don&#x27;t be put off by color and smell. It works.</li>
            <li> First tried this product while visiting Hawaii, one of the locals let me use theirs and have never used anything else since.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Everyone should use it for regular tanning and in a standup tanning booth.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly! Love the scent and use it with sunscreen all the time.</li>
            <li> I love this product, this browning lotion gave me a wonderful tan. It kept my skin soft and no sunburns.</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion before and its outstanding</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT, BEST WE&#x27;VE EVER USED.</li>
