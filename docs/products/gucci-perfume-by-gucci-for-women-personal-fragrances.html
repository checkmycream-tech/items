            <li>the scent is sophisticated, strong and memorable yet isnt intoxicating.</li>
            <li>I recommended that fragrance for my friends because it is very special</li>
            <li>I recieved the perfume sooner than it was expected &amp; the packaging of it was beyond EXCEPTIONAL!!!</li>
            <li>Light, not heavy, just great.  </li>
            <li>I just love the way it doesn&#x27;t smack you when you first smell it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s classy and elegant; sophisticated.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to totally bash the product because it does smell good</li>
            <li>Heavy strong oriental but great.</li>
            <li>This parfum is very, very strong and not for a 20-something year old like myself!</li>
            <li>The allure this perfume creates, and a catalyst for the lucky lady who receives this of you; boosts confidence, well-being, and vitality.</li>
            <li>This is a super price.</li>
            <li>It is such a nice subtle scent that requires a secound delightful sniff.</li>
            <li>Gucci done right by me.</li>
            <li>My favorite perfume--light but with a lasting scent.  </li>
            <li>and i am so PLEASED with the entire experience!!!</li>
            <li>Hot hot</li>
            <li>This scent is so hot that they named it twice.</li>
            <li>Thanx so much!</li>
            <li>It is my favorite perfume since it is subtle and sexy.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s just way too strong for my personal preference.</li>
            <li>Chanel and Angel are strong but obviously feminine, this isnt.</li>
            <li>Worth the price and the bottle is so classy!</li>
            <li>A real grown up woman fragrance for a woman who&#x27;s in touch.</li>
            <li>It it like you smell it in sections till you smell the whole</li>
            <li>The smell is nice but it dissappears after a few minutes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not your typical floral scent which is why I love this so much!</li>
            <li>I would not buy this for a young person or anyone that does not want the whole room to know what she&#x27;s wearing.</li>
            <li>It was probably repackaged and sold as new?</li>
            <li>the bottle and box are very fancy and definitely give it a great and expensive flair.  </li>
            <li>The delightful aroma created is caught in brief moments with a casual breeze onto that passing gentleman or by your partner when he is busy cuddling up next to you, creating those moments for distraction.</li>
            <li>It is not too heavy, but not too light either.</li>
            <li>I have had Gucci perfume before, purchased in stores and the quality of this one is far too low.</li>
            <li>Once it has been on for a little bit it does have a more soft feminine smell, but I&#x27;m still not sure if I&#x27;m going to try to wear it or just give it to my fiance!</li>
            <li>I literally had to come back on here and make sure I didn&#x27;t order mens cologne because I really thought I ordered the wrong item!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My favorite perfume--light but with a lasting scent.  I gave this bottle to my daughter in law who loves it as well.  I hope they bring it back on the market.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my mother and sister I know they are going to love it</li>
            <li> The bottle is beautiful and the scent is nice, but very, very strong. I would not buy this for a young person or anyone that does not want the whole room to know what she&#x27;s wearing. I don&#x27;t want to totally bash the product because it does smell good, it&#x27;s just way too strong for my personal preference.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume.  I&#x27;ve been wearing it for years now.  Amazon is my constant supplier of it.  It&#x27;s classy and elegant; sophisticated.  A real grown up woman fragrance for a woman who&#x27;s in touch.</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife who has been using chanel #5 or Angel for over 20 years. Took a chance on this and she loves it.It is such a nice subtle scent that requires a secound delightful sniff.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and it was just what she had ask me for Christmas. It has been a good year.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my mother for mothers day. she is in her 40s and loves to dress up/go out etc. she (and i) absolutely loved the scent of this perfume. the bottle and box are very fancy and definitely give it a great and expensive flair.  the scent is sophisticated, strong and memorable yet isnt intoxicating. i dont know if its because of who i got this for, but i dont think i would recommend this for younger women (20s?).</li>
            <li> I love the scent but it doesn&#x27;t last very long. I will continue to look around and find something I really like AND that lasts at least a few hours.</li>
            <li> I literally had to come back on here and make sure I didn&#x27;t order mens cologne because I really thought I ordered the wrong item! This parfum is very, very strong and not for a 20-something year old like myself! My nose is a little irritated now because I took too much of a deep sniff! LoL (exaggerating!) But really, initially I believed it was for men not women! I don&#x27;t like it. Another reviewer said his wife uses Chanel #5 and Angel and compared it to this Gucci, well those are a couple scents that I love and have used for years but I couldn&#x27;t stand this one nor could I compare it. Chanel and Angel are strong but obviously feminine, this isnt. I want people to KNOW its MY, A WOMANS, PARFUM! lol. It&#x27;s wayyyy too overbearing. I passed it around and everyone agreed that it smells like a mans cologone! Once it has been on for a little bit it does have a more soft feminine smell, but I&#x27;m still not sure if I&#x27;m going to try to wear it or just give it to my fiance! Now I&#x27;m concerned if whether or not I bought a real bottle or a fake (in regards to what one reviewer said)! I would just take your butt to Neiman Marcus, Macy&#x27;s, etc. and smell it for yourself. Plus that way you KNOW it&#x27;s legit!</li>
            <li> Always love this perfume and get so many compliments when wearing it too! It&#x27;s not your typical floral scent which is why I love this so much!</li>
            <li> I love it,Love it,Love it,Did I tell you I love it.....Great price, nice size will order more!!!!!!! It&#x27;s a must.</li>
            <li> Good choice . Bought it for myself. Very satisfied by the beautiful fragrance. Worth the price and the bottle is so classy!</li>
            <li> As my &amp;#34;title&amp;#34; says ...Gucci by Gucci is my FAVORITE perfume &amp; I have a lot of nice perfumes!!! For some reason they do not carry it in Macy&#x60;s or Dilliards anymore ...which is where I used to buy this!!! Thankfully ...I found it here on Amazon and i am so PLEASED with the entire experience!!! I recieved the perfume sooner than it was expected &amp; the packaging of it was beyond EXCEPTIONAL!!! My only regret is that I didn&#x60;t order another bottle for a back-up in case they run out!!! I might do that SOON!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Blessings :)</li>
            <li> It is my favorite perfume since it is subtle and sexy. I can&#x27;t stand those flowery perfumes with that baby powder undertone that seem to be so popular. It is hard to find however so I tend to order it here since it has to be shipped to me anyway. I just love the way it doesn&#x27;t smack you when you first smell it. It it like you smell it in sections till you smell the whole and then it is warm and welcoming throughout. it is definitely a mature perfume and not for the faint of heart.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, wife loves it</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY!! Totally not what I expected. The smell is nice but it dissappears after a few minutes. I have had Gucci perfume before, purchased in stores and the quality of this one is far too low. I chose the one sold by amazon itself, but still very DISAPPOINTING!!!</li>
            <li> When I received merchandise, it was expired...smell was bad and not what was expected! It was probably repackaged and sold as new? This product was long over its shelf life and should have never been sold!!! Company said they would look into it but I never got a favorable response and eventually after a month was able to send in bottle to merchant! Still waiting for refund...</li>
            <li> Amazing strong fragrance I&#x27;m forever fan</li>
            <li> Bad deal ordered parfum and received toilette water it&#x27;s a scam don&#x27;t order it</li>
            <li> Heavy strong oriental but great.</li>
            <li> I received this product and I was very impressed. Evey time I wear this perfume I always get compliments on how nice I smell. I will order from them again.</li>
            <li> Hot hot The House of Gucci knows when to stamp their name on a product. This scent is so hot that they named it twice. The allure this perfume creates, and a catalyst for the lucky lady who receives this of you; boosts confidence, well-being, and vitality. The freshness of Gucci by Gucci enhances with the application onto the female body. The delightful aroma created is caught in brief moments with a casual breeze onto that passing gentleman or by your partner when he is busy cuddling up next to you, creating those moments for distraction. Sensational price, great customer service, and fast safe delivery, thoroughly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a super price. I totally disagree with the other reviewers who suggested it was fake. I&#x27;ve bought this before from department stores &amp; paid double. This is a great fragrance. Great price</li>
            <li> This is my signature scent now.  Just love it.  Always loved Gucci, but this one is phenomenal!  Light, not heavy, just great.  I get lots of compliments on this!</li>
            <li> This perfume does not have a heavy flowery scent which always made my sinuses swell.  It is not too heavy, but not too light either. I have gotten many compliments when I wear this.  I will always buy this perfume in the future.</li>
            <li> Gucci done right by me.</li>
            <li> I recommended that fragrance for my friends because it is very special parfum.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Gucci company for that type of fragrance .</li>
            <li> Yes I was totally satisfied with my purchase, and please at its time of delivery! Thanx so much!</li>
