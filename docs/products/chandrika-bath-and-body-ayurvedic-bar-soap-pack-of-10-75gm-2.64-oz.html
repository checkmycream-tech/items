            <li> I have used Dr. Bronners Castile soap for a long while.</li>
            <li> I have been using this from long time when I was in India; its been almost 20 years.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have used Dr. Bronners Castile soap for a long while. Up until I realized that the majority of his formulations contained estrogen like compounds such as Lavender and Tea Tree. I am a bodybuilder and the last thing I need is water retention and emotions. This Soap Blows Dr. Bs out of the water. The smell is fantastic. You can even use it in your hair if your in a pinch. You will absolutely love this soap.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and feeling of this all natural soap and how both myself and my boyfriend can use it.</li>
            <li> wonderful smell, shipped fine</li>
            <li> I love the pictured soap.  What I received was something altogether different.  Yellow not green and a similar but sort of sickening smell.  Not even the same box, but it does have the same name on it.  I&#x27;ll be donating this to the nearest shelter.</li>
            <li> The product we received is NOT the same as pictured.  My husband buys this soap (as pictured) at our local store.  The product that actually came is a different packaging and size.  It&#x27;s not the same.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> What can I say? I LOVE this stuff! I buy it by the caseload so I&#x27;ll always have it on-hand. I&#x27;ve never been into mainstream soaps like Dove or Ivory. Nor do I use mainstream colognes. Yeccch! I&#x27;m an essential oil kind of a guy and this soap is perfect for me</li>
            <li> What I received was NOT the product described...These were oval and brown bars not the green and square one I expected!!!</li>
            <li> LEAVES A  SMELL  ON YOU - THE OIL LEFT BEHIND</li>
            <li> I love this soap!&lt;br /&gt;Never stop making it and I will never stop buying it!</li>
            <li> I bought this soap and I liked it. However, it doesn&#x27;t list the ingredients on the packaging. It foams a lot, like it contains SLS or something, but I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s in it. I asked twice, and both times they told me to look online and deleted my question. The list of ingredients on Chandrika&#x27;s website is not complete, because it obviously contains more than oil. Seems shady to me, so I won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I love Chandrika soap I used it for a long time then there were no local suppliers it does wonders for your skin and even your hair,I bo it mainly this time to use for shaving but I know it will end up in the shower as well thank you so much</li>
            <li> This soap has a lovely scent and does a great job of cleansing my skin without overdyring. My skin never feels tight or itchy after using it, even in the middle of a cold, dry winter.</li>
            <li> Like having aromatherapy in a bar. Gentle enough to use on all body parts. This 10 pkg. is a great value.</li>
            <li> Bathing with this product, has been heavenly, fresh!! It leaves it&#x27;s aroma, on the body, forever!&lt;br /&gt;Such a clean fresh feeling,that lasts and lasts, and lasts!</li>
            <li> nice vegetable-based soap; foams up pretty well if lather is a concern; interesting mix of fragrances/spices; have used this stuff for probably 9-10 years now--along with Bronner&#x27;s, this is my standard soap, though Chandrika is usually a lot mote affordable than Bronner&#x27;s</li>
            <li> This is the best soap as its not been tested on animals and has no animal things in it. I have been using this from long time when I was in India; its been almost 20 years.</li>
            <li> Chandrika soap is available in local stores. This soap has been around for some 70 years! It is an Ayuevedic soap, made of herbs and oils, and NO animal products. Very popular in India for many years, now it is popular throughout the world, especially among animal rights activists. It is well-liked for the luxurious lather, gentle cleansing, herbal aroma, and the general feel of the skin after cleansing. It is preventive therapy for certain skin problems.</li>
            <li> I love this soap so much!  My best friend uses it and told me to try it so I did and it is wonderful! Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Great product in every way. There is a very healthy feeling and a pureness in the Ayurvedic formulation that seems to be perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have used it for a long time and am very happy with it.  It did take a long time to get here.</li>
