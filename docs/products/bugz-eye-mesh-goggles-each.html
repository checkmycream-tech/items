    <ol>
            <li>perfect for chainsaw work</li>
            <li>The best part, they never fog up</li>
            <li>Probably some of the best goggles I have ever worn!</li>
            <li>These goggles are the best safety eyewear a sawyer can wear.</li>
            <li>These goggles are very good.  </li>
            <li>I work out in the woods and wear contacts, these work great for keeping twigs out of my eyes.</li>
            <li>Great for wood working</li>
            <li>I use these when using the weed eater and my chainsaws... though I wear glasses which always fog, these goggles allow good airflow and keep the specks out..</li>
            <li>They work great, are very comfortable, and are durable.  </li>
            <li>Love them!  </li>
            <li>Works great though if you work with a chipper you should probably invest in the fine mesh.</li>
            <li>Look I was always looking for our protection that wouldn&#x27;t get all sweaty these absolutely fit the bill with great protection and a lot of comfort</li>
            <li>nice goggles that will not fog up</li>
            <li>I worry that the wire mesh is easier to compromise then plastic eyewear, but when training vigorously, not having to worry about your eyes fogging up is really, really nice.</li>
            <li>Adjustable elastic is nice.</li>
            <li>in all, color me a very impressed, very satisfied owner thus far.  </li>
            <li>Still does the trick though and better than any safety glasses I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I believe they have saved on many eye injuries.</li>
            <li>In addition, I LOVE the foam backing/seal on the googles.  </li>
            <li>That discovery was almost as wonderful as simply being able to see what I was doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love these goggles.</li>
            <li>These are awesome if you fog up your regular goggles!</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;ve put them in a case to keep them safe to/from woods.</li>
            <li>This worked GREAT at keeping the sweat out of my eyes altogether, so my eyes weren&#x27;t burning/stinging like they normally do after a couple hours.  </li>
            <li>I decided to give them a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used them for the first time yesterday, and I am SUPER happy with them.  </li>
            <li>but I adjusted to it fairly quickly!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re great, I&#x27;ll nevet go back to anything else.</li>
            <li>Mice will go after the foam cushion, though, so store them securely.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to expect from these, but based on the positive reviews (and some googling at arboristsite)</li>
            <li>my bigger colleagues loved them, too.  </li>
            <li>SO much better than your standard safety glasses - no sweat, no fog, and safe eyes.</li>
            <li>They look pretty well made.</li>
            <li>As a wild land firefighter, I ran a saw professionally for years, and I LOVE the bugz-eye mesh</li>
            <li>Comfortable, no fogging and no slipping off my face.  </li>
            <li>They allowed my vision to stay clear (unlike sweat running down the inside of glasses), they were very comfortable, and I didn&#x27;t get ANYTHING in my eyes all day (even though I was spitting stuff out of my mouth on occasion!).  </li>
            <li>Visibility isn&#x27;t 100% and they hold in a little bit of heat, but still better than regular glasses that get scratched up and foggy / fall off or don&#x27;t sit right on your ears.</li>
            <li>They are a bit dark when you first put them on, but I got used to that quickly.  </li>
            <li>My only concern is how long that foam seal is going to last, with all the sweat/skin exposure, but I think I&#x27;ll be ok.</li>
            <li>Its a little hard to see out of them for more precise stuff.  </li>
            <li>Their great for cutting fire wood and playing airsoft.</li>
            <li>I have been a sawyer for 5 years and have experienced a whole lot of crap flying into my eyes, until I bought these.</li>
            <li>I love my pair, and whenever I know things are going to flying a my head with any power behind them, I&#x27;m switching to a fencing mask anyway.</li>
            <li>Not very useful in daylight outdoors, too much glare.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love them!  Comfortable, no fogging and no slipping off my face.  Bought 2 pair 2 seasons ago thinking I&#x27;d probably end up tearing up the mesh or something.  Didn&#x27;t happen - still have a never-used pair in the shop.  I cut about 6 chords of wood per year and will never go back to regular safety glasses when running a chainsaw.</li>
            <li> Works great though if you work with a chipper you should probably invest in the fine mesh. Still does the trick though and better than any safety glasses I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> As a wild land firefighter, I ran a saw professionally for years, and I LOVE the bugz-eye mesh goggles!&lt;br /&gt;As a girl with a small face, I found that regular safety goggles fit poorly, and fog up/get dirty/collect pools of sweat, in addition to irritating the sh** out of me.&lt;br /&gt;The bugz hug my face, breathe, don&#x27;t collect sweat, and don&#x27;t let sawdust or chips in.  Occasionally, flying dust is a problem, but not more than it would be with regular safety glasses.&lt;br /&gt;All my bigger colleagues loved them, too.  They&#x27;re great, I&#x27;ll nevet go back to anything else.</li>
            <li> nice goggles that will not fog up</li>
            <li> They look pretty well made. They do stop big stuff from weedwacking.  It says not to be used for weedwacking.  Its a little hard to see out of them for more precise stuff.  They won&#x27;t fog so it&#x27;s a give and take.</li>
            <li> I worry that the wire mesh is easier to compromise then plastic eyewear, but when training vigorously, not having to worry about your eyes fogging up is really, really nice. I love my pair, and whenever I know things are going to flying a my head with any power behind them, I&#x27;m switching to a fencing mask anyway.</li>
            <li> Guys use them for work and have not heard one complaint. I believe they have saved on many eye injuries.</li>
            <li> As a bald guy who tends to sweat a lot, glasses become a big PITA when using a chainsaw, weed eating, etc.  They fog up, the water drops on the lens and distorts vision, etc.  However, due to the $$ I&#x27;ve put into my eyes (corrective laser surgery), I&#x27;m a big safety glasses nazi.  I&#x27;m still going to wear them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d used a mesh face cover before when cutting brush, and it worked well.  This was 20+ years ago.  I was actually looking for something similar when I found these.  I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to expect from these, but based on the positive reviews (and some googling at arboristsite) I decided to give them a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used them for the first time yesterday, and I am SUPER happy with them.  They are a bit dark when you first put them on, but I got used to that quickly.  They allowed my vision to stay clear (unlike sweat running down the inside of glasses), they were very comfortable, and I didn&#x27;t get ANYTHING in my eyes all day (even though I was spitting stuff out of my mouth on occasion!).

            <li> I love these goggles. Their great for cutting fire wood and playing airsoft.</li>
            <li> I work out in the woods and wear contacts, these work great for keeping twigs out of my eyes. I&#x27;ve lost a couple contacts with sticks finding their way underneath regular safety glasses. I have a small face but these still get a decent seal on me. Visibility isn&#x27;t 100% and they hold in a little bit of heat, but still better than regular glasses that get scratched up and foggy / fall off or don&#x27;t sit right on your ears. Adjustable elastic is nice.</li>
            <li> perfect for chainsaw work</li>
            <li> They work great, are very comfortable, and are durable.  Mice will go after the foam cushion, though, so store them securely.</li>
            <li> Not very useful in daylight outdoors, too much glare.</li>
            <li> No fogging, or scratched up lenses.</li>
            <li> These goggles are very good.  The best part, they never fog up, that is why I bought them.</li>
            <li> Great for wood working</li>
            <li> These are awesome if you fog up your regular goggles!</li>
            <li> Look I was always looking for our protection that wouldn&#x27;t get all sweaty these absolutely fit the bill with great protection and a lot of comfort</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a heavy sweater who&#x27;s bald.  Which means not only do my safety glasses (even non-fog versions) fog up within minutes, I have constant drips running down my head, to my face and leaving streaks of \more foggyness over my glasses.  But no more!  When first putting these on it feels like you&#x27;re wearing very dark sunglasses, and I almost didn&#x27;t bother to use them when cutting firewood.  But after about a minute I forgot I even had them on.  I cut for several hours, and never once had to stop to wipe fog and sweat off!  I&#x27;m sold, I may never wear a set of safety glasses again when cutting firewood or using a weed trimmer.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my husband.  He loves them!</li>
            <li> Probably some of the best goggles I have ever worn! Its weird seeing through the screen at first but I adjusted to it fairly quickly!</li>
            <li> These goggles are the best safety eyewear a sawyer can wear. Hands down. I have been a sawyer for 5 years and have experienced a whole lot of crap flying into my eyes, until I bought these.</li>
            <li> SO much better than your standard safety glasses - no sweat, no fog, and safe eyes. Now, you KNOW if you have kids they will want to put them on but the screening is not built to stand up to pokey kid fingers so have a care. Also, I&#x27;ve put them in a case to keep them safe to/from woods. Wish I&#x27;d had them ages ago!!</li>
            <li> I use these when using the weed eater and my chainsaws... though I wear glasses which always fog, these goggles allow good airflow and keep the specks out.. now the glasses stay in my pocket and I wear these... also does not interfere with my helmet..</li>
