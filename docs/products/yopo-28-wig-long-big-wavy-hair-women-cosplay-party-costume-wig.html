            <li>It looks really nice</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend wearing this wig without some kind of hat because the weft is very easy to see on the top.</li>

            <li>and I am in love.</li>
            <li>I love this wig...great for cosplay</li>

            <li>and I love the color.</li>
            <li>I wish there had been more hair in that area.</li>
            <li>Oh well, I&#x27;m in love with it &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>That night I went to brush it out and try to see if I could style it better to hid the netting.</li>
            <li>Seriously in love with these YOPO wigs.</li>
            <li>The netting is not visible at the top, I haven&#x27;t curled it so i&#x27;ll have to see how that turns out.</li>
            <li>This is a top dollar wig.</li>
            <li>bought this for anime convention, wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li>Gorgeous for comic con</li>
            <li>This wig came early and it was beautifully put together.</li>
            <li>And the shipping was fast and a good price.</li>
            <li>Everyone loved it and someone even thought it was my real hair.</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li>Good for the price, tangles easy, sheds decently, would buy another</li>
            <li>great wig and will buy more colors in the future!!</li>
            <li>Super high quality hair, great diversity and richness in color.</li>
            <li>If you have a hat on or something, it&#x27;s perfectly fine, but it can be a bit of a pain.</li>
            <li>so I could layer them for more volume, and they were both very soft and nicely packaged.</li>
            <li>It did shed a bit when I attempted to gently smooth out some tangles and hairs out of place.</li>
            <li>but i got it to fit with a wig cap and bobby pins.</li>
            <li>I think the wig would have been perfect if hair wasn&#x27;t missing all over.</li>
            <li>I love it so much!</li>
            <li>This is absolutely beautiful, I have one other wig made of cheap acrylic</li>
            <li>Well worth your money!</li>
            <li>It almost looks like real hair! :)</li>
            <li>i got the light pink and it looks and feels great.</li>
            <li>but in person my wig looks nice and full yet still natural looking.</li>
            <li>Wig is good quality, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so full and s</li>
            <li>The pink one was gorgeous, the color is great and the hair is super soft and pretty.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that the bangs are so long, but with clips it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be buying it in more colors!</li>
            <li>Wig came in cute packaging, was soft and color was exactly like picture!</li>
            <li>The length is perfect too making it more realistic than my other super long wig.</li>
            <li>the quality is very nice, and the wig arrived very quickly, but it was so small!</li>
            <li>Its so pretty and soft and cute</li>
            <li>It also knots very easily in the back.</li>
            <li>I bought it to wear for fun on the weekend, but loved it so much I&#x27;m now going to take the plunge with dying my hair pink.</li>
            <li>The wig is very well made, it also has no bad odors.</li>
            <li>I mean for the price its great, but it&#x27;s better for costume wearing and not everyday use.</li>
            <li>It is very soft and looks real, it also doesn&#x27;t tangle much and when it does its very easy to take care of with a brush(brushing does not pull much out of it, probably one or two strands if at all)</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s natural looking, not shiny like cheap synthetic wigs.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>I wore it out today and people thought it was my real hair!</li>
            <li>I used it not only for days when I didn&#x27;t want to do my real hair but also for cosplay and the color was so on point!!!!</li>
            <li>will update my review once I have worn this wig for a few hours on Halloween, but as of right now I love it and am looking forward to wearing it as part of my costume!</li>
            <li>Nice quality wig, though bit of an odd smell when I first opened it up.</li>
            <li>I ended up using some bobby pins to secure the bangs out of my face, they&#x27;re super long!</li>
            <li>Colors are cute and this is going to be a first time for me wearing pink on my hair.</li>
            <li>Only issue is because of its thickness and length it tangles easily.</li>
            <li>Super cute, very soft, occasionally sheds, knots if you&#x27;re not careful</li>
            <li>This is a very well made wig for its price.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t worn it for s whole day yet, as I got it for Halloween, so I will update my review once I have worn it for Halloween.</li>
            <li>Very shiny, shapely and packaged well.</li>
            <li>This wig is fantastic and the pink color is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>thats to be expected and the rats are easy to get out.it</li>
            <li>Other than that it looked fine.</li>
            <li>Very thick, looks real, I get so many compliments!</li>
            <li>They were a little curlier than expected, but looked good.</li>
            <li>My favorite part of this wig is the color, very nice dusty dark pink.</li>
            <li>Just for reference, I am 5&#x27;4&amp;#34; and it lands just at the lower of my mid back, which is exactly what I was wanting.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The hair is soft, supple and it appears that on low heat it could be styled.</li>
            <li>The color is exactly what it looks like in the picture, and there was very little hair falling out.</li>

            <li> Very shiny, shapely and packaged well.</li>
            <li> This wig is fantastic and the pink color is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> thats to be expected and the rats are easy to get out.it</li>

            <li> Very thick, looks real, I get so many compliments!</li>
            <li> They were a little curlier than expected, but looked good.</li>
            <li> My favorite part of this wig is the color, very nice dusty dark pink.</li>
            <li> Just for reference, I am 5&#x27;4&amp;#34; and it lands just at the lower of my mid back, which is exactly what I was wanting.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The hair is soft, supple and it appears that on low heat it could be styled.</li>
            <li> The color is exactly what it looks like in the picture, and there was very little hair falling out.</li>
            <li> it is more like dusty rose.  &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> Very thick and full.</li>
            <li> The pink is not pink at all.......</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a bit thin on the top in some spots, but it&#x27;s not a huge problem.</li>
            <li> It is thin in some areas but as this is just a base wig for a larger wig build I am doing it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> The bangs were alittle difficult to manage but after playing with them for a little bit I was able to keep them in place with some hair spray.</li>
            <li> very dry an tangled have to use barbie pins keep on granddaughter head..</li>
            <li> I ordered this wig in pink.</li>
            <li> it also sheds a bit when you comb it, but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> Bangs were a little bit long, but nothing a hair clip can&#x27;t fix!</li>
            <li> Which I was kinda upset about being that I wear wigs because of my extreme hair loss.</li>
            <li> Competes with other 80-100 dollar wigs I&#x27;ve put on.</li>
            <li> I cut the bangs on mine to make it look less like a wig</li>
            <li> It does have a slight sheen to it</li>
            <li> Wig is exactly s expected, but the one I received came with someone elses hair in it :\</li>
            <li> When I got the wig I noticed when I put it on that the underneath bangs a little clump of them were kinda glued to together.</li>
            <li> And also the front hair line where it&#x27;s parted had which looked like someone cut a choppy chunk from the bangs area.</li>
            <li> I just wish chunks weren&#x27;t missing through out it.</li>
            <li> Well I wore it out the one day and my boyfriend was walking behind me and said that he can see the netting pretty bad in several spots.</li>
            <li> its a little small</li>
            <li> does shead a little but not a bunch at all!</li>
            <li> my head usually fits wigs, but this one was about the sizeof a child&#x27;s wig.</li>
            <li> i baught it not sure about how well made it would be but for the price i thought why not.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I had to return them because they were too long and wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for for my cosplay, but I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing the wig(s) for about an hour now and they are surprisingly not itchy at all.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look at all poorly put together</li>
            <li> I also really like how this wig isn&#x27;t annoyingly shiny!</li>
            <li> The only thing that was annoying was that the bangs were difficult to work with and if you moved them one way you saw the wig cap underneath.</li>
            <li> The bangs are abut difficult to work with</li>
            <li> Obsessed with this wig - color, quality, everything.</li>
            <li> I noticed all the pieces of hair that looked like someone just started cutting random chunks all over it.</li>

            <li> Colors are cute and this is going to be a first time for me wearing pink on my hair. this is too good !an the price is unbeatable. It doesn&#x27;t look at all poorly put together this is totally on point!</li>
            <li> This is a very well made wig for its price. The hair is soft, supple and it appears that on low heat it could be styled. It is thin in some areas but as this is just a base wig for a larger wig build I am doing it works perfectly. I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> worked well for the wig party we went to</li>
            <li> I love it so much! I used it not only for days when I didn&#x27;t want to do my real hair but also for cosplay and the color was so on point!!!!</li>
            <li> This wig is amazing for being so inexpensive. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying it in more colors! I cut the bangs on mine to make it look less like a wig and I am in love.</li>
            <li> I love this wig...great for cosplay</li>
            <li> Love it ! The bangs are abut difficult to work with but it&#x27;s manageable.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely beautiful, I have one other wig made of cheap acrylic and I can say this wig is nothing like it! It is very soft and looks real, it also doesn&#x27;t tangle much and when it does its very easy to take care of with a brush(brushing does not pull much out of it, probably one or two strands if at all) I wear this wig whenever I go out and it is very comfortable. The only downside is that the bangs are so long, but with clips it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Obsessed with this wig - color, quality, everything. I bought it to wear for fun on the weekend, but loved it so much I&#x27;m now going to take the plunge with dying my hair pink. Super high quality hair, great diversity and richness in color.</li>
            <li> I ordered this wig in pink. It arrived promptly and was well packaged. I tried it on and immediately fell in love! This wig is fantastic and the pink color is exactly what I was looking for. It does have a slight sheen to it but it&#x27;s natural looking, not shiny like cheap synthetic wigs. It did shed a bit when I attempted to gently smooth out some tangles and hairs out of place. I haven&#x27;t worn it for s whole day yet, as I got it for Halloween, so I will update my review once I have worn it for Halloween. But just from trying it on for a few minutes I can say it seems like it will be comfortable to wear for a longer period of time, and not too heavy. Also, I find that it&#x27;s quite a bit thicker at the ends than what the Amazon picture makes it look like, which I am happy about. The Amazon picture looks a bit straggly at the the ends but in person my wig looks nice and full yet still natural looking. Just for reference, I am 5&#x27;4&amp;#34; and it lands just at the lower of my mid back, which is exactly what I was wanting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update my review once I have worn this wig for a few hours on Halloween, but as of right now I love it and am looking forward to wearing it as part of my costume!</li>
            <li> Its so pretty and soft and cute and I love it and I love the seller and the sellers kids</li>
            <li> the quality is very nice, and the wig arrived very quickly, but it was so small! my head usually fits wigs, but this one was about the sizeof a child&#x27;s wig. if you have a lot of hair or a big head, i would not suggest this.</li>
            <li> very dry an tangled have to use barbie pins keep on granddaughter head..her play wig..tired of brushing out</li>
            <li> Wig is good quality, especially for the price. Looks great on! Can&#x27;t wait to wear it:)</li>
            <li> this is  great wig for the money. i got the light pink and it looks and feels great.</li>
            <li> Nice quality wig, though bit of an odd smell when I first opened it up.</li>
            <li> I bought two wigs so I could layer them for more volume, and they were both very soft and nicely packaged. I&#x27;ve been wearing the wig(s) for about an hour now and they are surprisingly not itchy at all. The bangs were alittle difficult to manage but after playing with them for a little bit I was able to keep them in place with some hair spray. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend wearing this wig without some kind of hat because the weft is very easy to see on the top. I also really like how this wig isn&#x27;t annoyingly shiny! I think I&#x27;ll be wearing this wig quite often.</li>
            <li> Good for the price, tangles easy, sheds decently, would buy another</li>
            <li> ive been looking for a wig this color forever! i baught it not sure about how well made it would be but for the price i thought why not. i gotit WAY before the delivery date! i opened the nicely packaged box and my wig was beautiful! its a little small but i got it to fit with a wig cap and bobby pins. the igzact color shown in the picture! it does get ratted up but thats to be expected and the rats are easy to get out.it does shead a little but not a bunch at all! great wig and will buy more colors in the future!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy! It came way earlier than I thought! It looks really nice and I love the color. it&#x27;s a bit thin on the top in some spots, but it&#x27;s not a huge problem. it also sheds a bit when you comb it, but that&#x27;s to be expected. Other than that it&#x27;s perfect! Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> The pink one was gorgeous, the color is great and the hair is super soft and pretty. The only thing that was annoying was that the bangs were difficult to work with and if you moved them one way you saw the wig cap underneath. I wish there had been more hair in that area. I ended up using some bobby pins to secure the bangs out of my face, they&#x27;re super long! Once I got it in the perfect position it looked great, but it took a decent amount of effort. I mean for the price its great, but it&#x27;s better for costume wearing and not everyday use.</li>
            <li> I give this 4/5 because this is an AMAZING wig. Very thick, looks real, I get so many compliments! Only issue is because of its thickness and length it tangles easily. Oh well, I&#x27;m in love with it &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> The pink is not pink at all.......it is more like dusty rose.  &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> Gorgeous for comic con</li>
            <li> This wig looks great on and is very comfortable</li>
            <li> Wig came in cute packaging, was soft and color was exactly like picture! The wig kept its waviness without tangling, just brush every once in awhile. Bangs were a little bit long, but nothing a hair clip can&#x27;t fix! Perfect for my Luka cosplay:)</li>
            <li> My favorite part of this wig is the color, very nice dusty dark pink. The length is perfect too making it more realistic than my other super long wig. When I got the wig I noticed when I put it on that the underneath bangs a little clump of them were kinda glued to together. And also the front hair line where it&#x27;s parted had which looked like someone cut a choppy chunk from the bangs area. Other than that it looked fine. Well I wore it out the one day and my boyfriend was walking behind me and said that he can see the netting pretty bad in several spots. Which I was kinda upset about being that I wear wigs because of my extreme hair loss. That night I went to brush it out and try to see if I could style it better to hid the netting. But once I started parting it into sections and brushing it. I noticed all the pieces of hair that looked like someone just started cutting random chunks all over it. Which I hadn&#x27;t even seen before.  I think the wig would have been perfect if hair wasn&#x27;t missing all over. The style is cute and the color awesome. And the shipping was fast and a good price. I just wish chunks weren&#x27;t missing through out it.</li>
            <li> Seriously in love with these YOPO wigs. Wanting to get one in every color. They&#x27;re so full and s</li>
            <li> Wig is exactly s expected, but the one I received came with someone elses hair in it :\</li>
            <li> Ordered this wig for a Lightning Farron Cosplay. The wig is very well made, it also has no bad odors. For the cheap price it is a very good wig to have. This is my second wig. The netting is not visible at the top, I haven&#x27;t curled it so i&#x27;ll have to see how that turns out. But I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Great! Very shiny, shapely and packaged well.</li>
            <li> This is a top dollar wig. It looks so realistical. I wore it out today and people thought it was my real hair! Beautiful color. Very thick and full. Competes with other 80-100 dollar wigs I&#x27;ve put on. Well worth your money!</li>
            <li> Great wigs. They were a little curlier than expected, but looked good. Sadly, I had to return them because they were too long and wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for for my cosplay, but I would recommend. It almost looks like real hair! :)</li>
            <li> bought this for anime convention, wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. It is just what I was looking for. good quality and inexpensive. excellent value</li>
            <li> This wig came early and it was beautifully put together. Everyone loved it and someone even thought it was my real hair. The color is exactly what it looks like in the picture, and there was very little hair falling out. All in all I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase and managed to get my sister to buy one of her own.</li>
            <li> Super cute, very soft, occasionally sheds, knots if you&#x27;re not careful and you can see the cap. If you have a hat on or something, it&#x27;s perfectly fine, but it can be a bit of a pain. It also knots very easily in the back.</li>
