            <li>This stuff sprays very evenly and it&#x27;s not messy at all.  </li>

            <li>The first time I used it, I put enough on to make my skin oily...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stain, it protects all the family and smells great, what&#x27;s not to love? I re-buy this every year.</li>
            <li> I recommend not using this product. This caused a major rash to appear on my arms and knees where I applied the product. I thought it was due to contaminated water at the beach, however the rash continued weeks afterwards until I finally stopped using this sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are similar reports from users of the Dry-Touch version of this Neutrogena product, may be related to SPF 70 strength.</li>
            <li> worked very well and shipped quickly. they say anything over 45 is a waste but they don&#x27;t know my wife&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> Wish I had splurged and bought this again rather than the Target brand spray that I decided to purchase to be more economical. This doesn&#x27;t have the sticky residue that many other brands do</li>
            <li> easy to apply, nice fragrance &amp; seems to be doing the job.</li>
            <li> I am a redhead and I love to be out in the sun. Ths product is what allows me to spend day after day in the sun for hours on end without getting burnd. Don&#x27;t for get to reup at least once maybe twice!</li>
            <li> Finally, a screen that works for readheads  in the Arizona sun!  I can use this spray without feeling that my skin can&#x27;t breathe.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It feels great on your skin. Not a heavy wet look or feel. Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Strong Fragrance. Should be fragrance free</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best sunblock I&#x27;ve ever used...and I&#x27;ve used plenty! I&#x27;m a redhead (not at all compatable with sun) and enjoy scuba diving in Cozumel (where there&#x27;s LOTS of sun). I apply it in the morning before diving and it lasts all day...I don&#x27;t even reapply between dives.    Another thing I like about this product is that because it&#x27;s a mist, I can apply this sunblock in about 15 seconds. The first time I used it, I put enough on to make my skin oily...don&#x27;t do this! First of all, this product is not oily and you&#x27;ll think you don&#x27;t have enough, so you put on more...don&#x27;t! It&#x27;s a mist and you just lightly go over your skin.     Finally, another plus is that most sunscreens make you feel hot...they seem to keep your body heat in...this one doesn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> I bought mist for quick and easy application. However, I found that this sunblock cannot be the only sunblock I use. It useful to spray on the areas I cannot easily reach with my hands, like the back. But I found it unpleasant to use on my face. I did not like the slightly greesy feel, the make-up does apply evenly on top of it. I did not like that I can accidentally get it in my eyes or breath in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In July 2011 Food and Drug administration stated that they are investigating the safety of sunblock mists, especially on use with kids, which can get sun block in their mouth or breath in while the sun block is being applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) I can put sun block on the areas I cannot reach by hand&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Spray can get into eyes, mouth, be inhaled&lt;br /&gt;2) I do not like that it has an odor , I prefer unscented products&lt;br /&gt;3) Slightly greasy feel and make-up does not apply evenly on top of it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall &#x27;ok&#x27; rating for this sunblock . It has both positive and negative aspects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
            <li> My Husband is very picky about sunblock and we were wanting a sunblock we could use for the whole family that wouldn&#x27;t be all sticky and gross like the majority of sunblocks out there.  This is the answer! It goes on easily and it really is very light weight and sheer!  We love it!</li>
            <li> I really did not like this Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Sunblock Mist.  I have extremely fair skin that is very sensitive so I have to use sunscreen whenever I&#x27;m outside for an extended period of time otherwise I will look like an angry lobster. I have used Neutrogena sunscreen in the past and have either been happy or disappointed.  This time I was very disappointed.  The sunscreen application was very messy. I found the spray to be too wide- it went everywhere but my legs.  Additionally, the consistency of the lotion itself was uncomfortable- it was surprisingly oily and did not soak into my skin well at all.  It just sort of stayed on the top of my skin and was extremely oily.  It came off rather quickly and transferred onto my chair. Not surprisingly, I did get a sunburn.  I would not recommend this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I think it blocks well. faefed dfaesfasefa&lt;br /&gt;good when you go to beach. no sticky after and no rub needed.</li>
            <li> This stuff sprays very evenly and it&#x27;s not messy at all.  Just use your hands to rub it in.  No white streaks or sticky lotion-y feeling.  It&#x27;s especially great for spraying on hair if you&#x27;re wearing it parted or if you&#x27;re losing your hair (I&#x27;m guessing on that last one).  Nothing worse than a burnt scalp!</li>
            <li> I play soccer on the weekend, and my sunscreen kept coming off. I ordered this because of the reviews, and I have to say it stays on great. Also, it has a nice light scent that&#x27;s not like regular sunscreen. will definately reorder!</li>
            <li> I ordered 4 sunblocks, and the arrived with no top cap (as clearly shown in the picture). I can´t carry them around at all with no cap, as it spreads everywhere.</li>
            <li> So much cheaper here than the pharmacy. Excellent product, love the smell and it works well. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I used this product before during my holidy, and it works. This one should also be good, but haven&#x27;t use it yet.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells pretty good and it doesn&#x27;t leave you with a greasy feeling like other sunblocks do. I like it.</li>
            <li> I love how easy this sunblock applies and I never have to worry about getting burnt again with its SPF rating!  Love that it is dollars cheaper here on amazon too.</li>
