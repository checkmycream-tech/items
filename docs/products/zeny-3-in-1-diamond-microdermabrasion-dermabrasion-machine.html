            <li>Good investment</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any good results</li>
            <li>It works good.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m very pleased with the suction.</li>
            <li>I am a licensed esthetician and love this machine!</li>
            <li>But I liked the machine</li>
            <li>It has a vacuum with very good suction, the sprayer is very nice too, specially after doing the dermabrasion treatment.</li>
            <li>Love it, helps me reduce scares from bug bites on my face</li>
            <li>isn&#x27;t that why most people use these things ?</li>
            <li>It was OK.</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>For more information, you can look it up on youtube: how to use diamond tip  microdermabrasion.</li>
            <li>It would be better if the seller would give more information in the instruction manual and even label the size of cotton filters just for buyer information and most importantly, the tips to be used in corresponding body/face parts.</li>
            <li>The machine is not bad considering the cost but it would be a good steal if adequate needed information is provided.</li>
            <li>Easy set up.</li>
            <li>Super satisfied.</li>
            <li>But now that I have this, I can do my own facial more often and save!</li>
            <li>I am starting my own mobile facial business and this is perfect!</li>
            <li>It seems to be doing a good job so far.</li>
            <li>But so far so good</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t come with detailed manual, but easy to use and pretty self explanatory.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face smooth and fresh.</li>
            <li>, i would say it pretty strong, you don&#x27;t want it stronger than that.</li>
            <li>I love my new machine!</li>
            <li>little machine has strong vacuuming power that left me quite impressed.</li>
            <li>ok, two treatments so far an</li>
            <li>I have not used the machine on clients yet, only on my own face since I want to try it and experience it for myself first.</li>
            <li>So far, I really like using my machine and my clients love their results.</li>
            <li>First of all I don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>After just a month my complexion has improved substantially and my stretch marks are fading more than I thought was possible!</li>
            <li>Dermabrasion also left my skin very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>This product was already assembled ready to use when it arrived.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>, i have used it couple times so far, will see how much it will improve my skin.</li>
            <li>This machine surprised me by far!</li>
            <li>So far its been working</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve had dermabrasion and cleaned out your pores during facial in the past, you&#x27;d be able to figure this out with no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But i do feel like it got a professional facial done.</li>
            <li>I have too crank it all the way to high, to get the same effect I would normally get on any other micro machine</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive oily &amp; dry combination skin that leaves my nose skin peeling all the time, but this machine took care of it in the first try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The salon spa place that used to do dermabrasion and pore cleaning charged over $100 per session, which is about the same price as this machine, so I only had facial one a year or less.</li>

            <li> Im a little disappointed with this machine, it doesn&#x27;t have the power I was expecting, in fact it lacks power. I have too crank it all the way to high, to get the same effect I would normally get on any other micro machine, that would be on medium. I do like that eveything came together with the machine. I will be sending machine back to exchange for another to see if it does the same thing.</li>
            <li> Product was delivered when specified and as described. I love my new machine!</li>
            <li> Not enough instructions on tips and other parts. So far its been working ok, two treatments so far an I can already see the difference. Good investment</li>
            <li> Love it, helps me reduce scares from bug bites on my face</li>
            <li> First of all I don&#x27;t k is if I got a knock off or something but this thing came with NO directions . Also it&#x27;s too harsh on the face . Me and my friend bought this and used on our face and we have a bunch of scratches ! And trust me I didn&#x27;t go that hard on my face either . The last thing that&#x27;s confusing is after researching this thing on the Internet , i found a video of a estitician working on a client showing u how to use it . And she said that if u have acne then u shouldn&#x27;t use this . WTF! isn&#x27;t that why most people use these things ? To get rid of acne blemishes ! I&#x27;m so confused and appealed and this thing is a waste of money</li>
            <li> I am an Esthetician and I purchased this machine to use in my practice. This machine works very good. It has a vacuum with very good suction, the sprayer is very nice too, specially after doing the dermabrasion treatment. The diamond dermabrasion works well too. I have not used the machine on clients yet, only on my own face since I want to try it and experience it for myself first. It seems to be doing a good job so far.</li>
            <li> Great for home use. Easy set up. It arrived on time. All pieces came with.</li>
            <li> It was OK. I didn&#x27;t have any good results</li>
            <li> I like this machine, i have used it couple times so far, will see how much it will improve my skin. But i do feel like it got a professional facial done. I like the suction, i would say it pretty strong, you don&#x27;t want it stronger than that. looks exactly like the picture. So i do recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love the product. Works well and gets the job done. Thanks!</li>
            <li> when I went to buy the site reported it was bivolt only came in 110v and 220v I needed . But I liked the machine</li>
            <li> Excellent,  good time,  and good time</li>
            <li> Just recently received this as a gift. The package only comes with 1 ring, inadequate instruction manual and unlabeled wand tips specification. It would be better if the seller would give more information in the instruction manual and even label the size of cotton filters just for buyer information and most importantly, the tips to be used in corresponding body/face parts. The machine is not bad considering the cost but it would be a good steal if adequate needed information is provided. For more information, you can look it up on youtube: how to use diamond tip  microdermabrasion. Although the tip information is not provided there too, basically just about the set up.</li>
            <li> This was a birthday gift for my daughter. She has used it several times and claims she is getting results. She has some brown spots and they are fading with the use of this machine.</li>
            <li> After just a month my complexion has improved substantially and my stretch marks are fading more than I thought was possible! It&#x27;s easy to use and a great buy!</li>
            <li> Thank you for this machine. It works good. I like it.</li>

But now that I have this, I can do my own facial more often and save! What a great deal! So happy with this buy!</li>
            <li> Great machine for a great price. Super satisfied. Best investment I&#x27;ve made all year!</li>
            <li> I am a licensed esthetician and love this machine! I am starting my own mobile facial business and this is perfect! It is very quiet and although it isn&#x27;t as expensive as other machines, it definitely gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Works really well. Leaves my face smooth and fresh.</li>
            <li> This machine surprised me by far! After a month of research I decided to buy this rather than the handheld machine for reasons of personal preference. I have only used this twice but I&#x27;m very pleased with the suction. I know it&#x27;s doing something because brown dust is in the cotton filter as well. I will update this again in 2 wks. But so far so good</li>
            <li> I really like it. Is it a space saver and though I do not use the sprays one could use it as a toner spray. So far, I really like using my machine and my clients love their results.</li>
