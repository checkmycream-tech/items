            <li>I brought this to Asia and my friends all started to ask to use it as it was the best product to fight both the sunburns and the Mosquitos!</li>
            <li>I immediately ordered, and I am very excited about my purchase.!!!!!</li>

            <li>Great-</li>
            <li>It works great for repelling mosquitos.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard how great Avon Skin</li>
            <li>I put this on and was in a tank top at the beach (Costa Rica) hiking in and out of the sun and did not get burned, bit or any rash!!</li>
            <li>Very effective product.</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant.  </li>
            <li>It smells pleasant and it works.</li>
            <li>PROS:&lt;br /&gt;It smells really good.</li>
            <li>This lotion smells good and it works.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smells good, and repels.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product!  </li>
            <li>This is absolutely the best sunscreen I have found in ages, and no bugs to bother you!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s kind of greasy.</li>
            <li>So Soft is the best thing for bugs.  </li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I wiped it off the best I could and applied a different sunscreen, however I could smell the remnants of this product for the rest of the day..</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>then get this product and smother yourself in it. :)</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li>After the synthetic top I was wearing showed &amp;#34;melted spots&amp;#34;, I found the disclaimer.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I don&#x27;t have to put deet on him.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t leave it home</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they could have found a dealer closer to me, but they didn&#x27;t even try.</li>
            <li>I thought this product would be a better alternative b/c it contains sunscreen.</li>
            <li>The perfume smell is too strong for me.  </li>
            <li>He finely checked Amazon, and there it was.  </li>
            <li>Smelled fine but did nothing to keep Mosquitos away</li>
            <li>6 huge bites on his face and 4 on his legs.  </li>
            <li>My friends got eaten up, I was bite free and unburnt.</li>
            <li>So I bought 3 bottles at $6.95 each (free shipping).</li>
            <li>and I was happy knowing someone local would get credit for the order, but that did not happen.</li>
            <li>Product has a pleasant scent and pretty much keeps the bugs at bay.</li>
            <li>what I was getting was the ORIGINAL Skin</li>
            <li>The chemical in this product is called IR3535 and this chemical is NOT in the original Skin</li>
            <li>Most importantly, it really works - no bug bites, no sunburn, and no irritated skin!  </li>
            <li>Instead I spray around his crib with OffFamily Clean</li>
            <li>I love the scent and even though I was taking an anti-malaria drug that makes people more sensitive to sunburn, I never got burned at all.</li>
            <li>My toddler has very sensitive skin that burns easily and is a delicious treat for all blood sucking creatures, so we are constantly having to cover her in sunscreen AND bug spray on hot Texas summer days.  </li>
            <li>But you apply it too many times, it gets really greasy.</li>
            <li>so I really can&#x27;t say if the bug guard works or not, but the sunscreen sure does.</li>
            <li>Hawaii is full of mosquitoes</li>
            <li>It may be good for sunscreen but definitely will not protect you from bugs.</li>
            <li>Deceptive because the original Skin So Soft, using the original formula, was the product so many people raved about for years.</li>
            <li>Deceptive because the original Skin So Soft, using the original formula, was the product so many people raved about for years.</li>
            <li>I used it when pregnant, and I use it now for my daughter.</li>
            <li>I now have super protection to &#x27;skeeters&#x27; and sun.  </li>
            <li>Smells great works very well against the mosquitoes and watery enough to put on my daughter without too much of a struggle.</li>
            <li>success.  </li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ve tried every product AND every myth to repell any of the many biting bugs that have clearly deemed me an official &amp;#34;Happy Meal&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>After many orders via Amazon taking forever in shipping, I&#x27;ll be buying it directly through Avon from now on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth a try for you if you get lots of bites.</li>
            <li>Avon knows this is not the original formula, is not the product that made Skin So Soft famous as a bug repellant, and this should be made clear on the label and in advertising - NOT THE ORIGINAL SKIN SO SOFT PRODUCT OUTDOORSMEN DISCOVERED AND RAVED ABOUT FOR YEARS!!!!</li>
            <li>did I NEVER get sunburned, even going to the beach everyday, but I was never bothered by a bug of any kind!  </li>
            <li>Avon knows this is not the original formula, is not the product that made Skin So Soft famous as a bug repellant, and this should be made clear on the label and in advertising - NOT THE ORIGINAL SKIN SO SOFT PRODUCT OUTDOORSMEN DISCOVERED AND RAVED ABOUT FOR YEARS!!!!IR3535 and this chemical is NOT in the original Skin</li>
            <li>I do wish they sold it in larger containers though. :)</li>
            <li>This stuff actually seems to be working and has not caused any irritation when lightly used on her face!</li>
            <li>We recently went for a walk in a different neighborhood from our own (to escape the buggies) and as soon as we got out of the car we were bombarded with mosquitoes!</li>
            <li>had to reapply.... but smells good and has lasted quite a few months now..</li>
            <li>So Soft (the stuff people have raved about for years) packaged as a bug repellant, but in fact what I got is NOT the original Skin</li>
            <li>This new product, which they are calling Skin So Soft, is not the same product, is not the product or formula outdoorsmen and women loved as a bug repellant.</li>
            <li>This new product, which they are calling Skin So Soft, is not the same product, is not the product or formula outdoorsmen and women loved as a bug repellant.</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent, has SPF and keeps the bugs off when we&#x27;re out walking early in the morning and outside in the evenings..  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, I highly recommend this product for anyone looking to protect themselves or their children from bugs and sun with a single solution that is gentle but effective.</li>
            <li>Manufacturer claim: Effectively repels mosquitoes, deer ticks, black flies, sand flies, gnats, no-seeums and biting midges.</li>
            <li>It is very watery and it felt like it was going to drip into my eyes the minute I started sweating.  </li>
            <li>C&#x27;mon really?</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, a product with deet is much, much more effective.</li>
            <li>If I had, I&#x27;d have been able to try it out first, and I would have known it was not for me, not worth the price I paid, or any price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>good  #3-Goes on really easy and fast (no white residue or weird feeling</li>
            <li>This was my most used item on my recent trip to Big Island.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>and I gave the product one hell of a test -- just a normal day for me.</li>
            <li>Also I rarely tan in the sun, being one that turns red then peels.  </li>
            <li>no more bug bites :)</li>
            <li>I have had a melanoma and try to be super careful about sun exposure.  </li>
            <li>My 8 month old son got bitten by mosquitos in his sleep-</li>
            <li>I got this for my son who is 14 months old now, we&#x27;ve been using it since he was 9 months.</li>
            <li>I needed to get something gentle on her skin and face and as non smelly as possible.</li>
            <li>So Soft Bug Guard off and on for years.  </li>
            <li>Not greasy, no heavy odor.  </li>
            <li>So Soft is for repelling mosquitos and how all kinds of outdoorsmen and women swear by it.</li>
            <li>So Soft.</li>
            <li>So Soft name</li>
            <li>So Soft.</li>
            <li>So Soft.</li>
            <li>Far from it.</li>
            <li>Mosquitoes ate my toddler alive the day I applied bug guard on him for his camp activities in his school.</li>
            <li>it was long enough to cause me to get a face full of pimples.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its not to greasy either, a little bit but not bad.</li>
            <li>However, since I have been using Skin-so-soft (about 10 years) I have been able to enjoy the outdoors without worrying about how badly I will be bitten.</li>
            <li>/&gt;NOTE: Feeling ripped off and lied to I did further research about Skin So Soft and this product.</li>
            <li>It has a nice, subtle smell, and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky mess.  </li>
            <li>- clearly it is not Skin So Soft lotion, which I find deceptive on the part of Avon.</li>

            <li> Trust me, not sure why, but this stuff really works for me.</li>
            <li> It does repel bugs but not sure how much sunscreen this has.</li>
            <li> Unless you&#x27;re wearing cotton, be extra careful when applying to avoid potentially ruining a piece of clothing.  </li>
            <li> For years I used the standard sprays, ointments, etc with sporadic and limited.</li>

            <li> I actually tanned a little and have only suffered two or three bites from bugs in three weeks.  YAY!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it comes in a pretty small container, so you might want to order a couple</li>
            <li> It gave me zits all over my face (clearly not noncomediagenic as I expected it would be since it claims to be \\&quot;nongreasy\\&quot;).&lt;br</li>

            <li> My 8 month old son got bitten by mosquitos in his sleep- 6 huge bites on his face and 4 on his legs.  Needless to say I have gone on an all out warpath against all blood sucking mosquitos.  Crib net?  Check. Bug zapper machine?  Check.  Citronella stuff?  Yup (although now our house smells like a campground).  I then remembered that skin-so-soft worked well against mosquitos. When I looked for that item, I discovered Avon makes this Bug Guard PLUS sunscreen!  yay!  One application of lotion to protect him in two different ways!  The scent is pleasant.  The product is a winner in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, at night, I don&#x27;t apply this on him as I feel the sunscreen isn&#x27;t necessary.  Instead I spray around his crib with OffFamily Clean Scent- virtually no scent at all.  Man, I can&#x27;t wait for mosquito season to be over!!!</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;It smells really good. That&#x27;s the only reason it didn&#x27;t get one star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;It works for like ten minutes before you have to reapply. But you apply it too many times, it gets really greasy. Catch-22.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was completely miserable trying to keep mosquitoes away from me while I was in the Vienna airport. It makes for a better lotion than insect repellent. I should have bought DEET or stuff that actually works. But it smells really good!</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best sunscreen I have found in ages, and no bugs to bother you!  We went for an island vacation this year, (yes, beach too!) and not only !did I NEVER get sunburned, even going to the beach everyday, but I was never bothered by a bug of any kind!  And the island we visited is notorious for have mosquitos and other flying critters!  I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> I love this. I used it when pregnant, and I use it now for my daughter. Smells great works very well against the mosquitoes and watery enough to put on my daughter without too much of a struggle. I brought this to Asia and my friends all started to ask to use it as it was the best product to fight both the sunburns and the Mosquitos! I&#x27;ll never go to another product now. I&#x27;m so happy it doesn&#x27;t have deet in it.</li>
            <li> Years ago, my husband purchased this product and could not remember,, where he purchased it from.  He finely checked Amazon, and there it was.  I immediately ordered, and I am very excited about my purchase.!!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this in the hopes to use it during a day-long hiking trip.  I applied it to my face and immediately tried to get it off.  The product smells really weird (not like normal bug repellent.. just weird).  It is very watery and it felt like it was going to drip into my eyes the minute I started sweating.  I wiped it off the best I could and applied a different sunscreen, however I could smell the remnants of this product for the rest of the day.. yuck!</li>
            <li> I love the scent and even though I was taking an anti-malaria drug that makes people more sensitive to sunburn, I never got burned at all. The mosquitos weren&#x27;t flying around anyway so I really can&#x27;t say if the bug guard works or not, but the sunscreen sure does.</li>
            <li> On me one mosquito bite can swell to the size of a grapefruit.  For years I used the standard sprays, ointments, etc with sporadic and limited. success.  However, since I have been using Skin-so-soft (about 10 years) I have been able to enjoy the outdoors without worrying about how badly I will be bitten.</li>
            <li> We were plagued all summer by little biting black flies to the point where we didn&#x27;t want to go outside and work in the garden anymore. Then we tried this and the little basta... leave us alone.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t keep the No See Em&#x27;s Away.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve tried every product AND every myth to repell any of the many biting bugs that have clearly deemed me an official &amp;#34;Happy Meal&amp;#34;. And nothing ever worked. Ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few years ago a friend suggested I look into Avon Skin-so-Soft Bug Guard. So I bought a bottle and I gave the product one hell of a test -- just a normal day for me. And not a single bite after having been in a heavy bug infested area for an afternoon! Also, the product doesn&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;I&#x27;m Pretty&amp;#34; scent which I was curious about being an Avon product. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its not to greasy either, a little bit but not bad. Though at the end of a day I do shower to remove it all. I do wish they sold it in larger containers though. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you, or your children, have any issues with mosquitoes, no-see-ums, etc. then get this product and smother yourself in it. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: After many orders via Amazon taking forever in shipping, I&#x27;ll be buying it directly through Avon from now on.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a lifesaver for me.  Being a pale Englishman now living in the USA, I am a prefect meal for mosquitoes and other bugs.  Also I rarely tan in the sun, being one that turns red then peels.  I now have super protection to &#x27;skeeters&#x27; and sun.  I actually tanned a little and have only suffered two or three bites from bugs in three weeks.  YAY!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!  I travel to a lot of tropical locales.  I have been selling travel (to tropical locales) for 14 years.  I have always heard Skin So Soft is the best thing for bugs.  I have issues with my skin (cutaneous lupus) + tend to get random rashes, so have to be careful what I use.  I always forget about bug repellant until I&#x27;ve gotten bit up, then am stuck with whatever I can find.  This product is a God-send!!  #1-No rashes or creepy feeling skin  #2-Smells good  #3-Goes on really easy and fast (no white residue or weird feeling skin  #4-Great to have in combo form with sunscreen, plus is waterproof  #5-Seems to have worked.  I have had a melanoma and try to be super careful about sun exposure.  I put this on and was in a tank top at the beach (Costa Rica) hiking in and out of the sun and did not get burned, bit or any rash!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It smells pleasant and it works. I was being eaten alive in the Dominican Republic a few weeks ago but when I applied this stuff my collection of itchy-bites was drastically reduced. I play flag football and put this stuff on during practices and games and it stays on well.</li>
            <li> Great- No bug bites while on vacation!!</li>
            <li> Bug repellent and sun screen in one. This lotion smells good and it works. Can&#x27;t ask for more. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I use this on my toddler who goes outside a couple times a day at daycare. Wanted to limit the amount of \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; we were putting on her but the Houston sun/bug combo makes it impossible to do without. Product has a pleasant scent and pretty much keeps the bugs at bay. Remember to apply every 2 hours or so for the bug repellant to work. Slightly greasy but I&#x27;ll deal with that over using products with Deet on her! 3 stars is due to my disappointment with the seller charging double shipping when both of my SSS items were shipped in the same package. C&#x27;mon really? Besides that...four stars.</li>
            <li> Common sense is to NOT PUT IT ON YOUR FACE! PLEASE...</li>
            <li> Hawaii is full of mosquitoes so this is wonderful! Sun and bug protection!</li>
            <li> Caution: There is a disclaimer on the product &amp;#34;Avoid contact with plastics, costume jewelry, leather and synthetic fibers&amp;#34;.  After the synthetic top I was wearing showed &amp;#34;melted spots&amp;#34;, I found the disclaimer.  Unless you&#x27;re wearing cotton, be extra careful when applying to avoid potentially ruining a piece of clothing.  Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I got this for my son who is 14 months old now, we&#x27;ve been using it since he was 9 months. It works great for repelling mosquitos. We live in an area where mosquitos are bad and when he has this on they don&#x27;t touch him. I am so glad I don&#x27;t have to put deet on him. I have tried other non-deet products and none work like this one. Also a little bit covers a big area. It works so well I&#x27;ve been using it on me. I also like that you don&#x27;t have to wash it off. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about...it&#x27;s kind of greasy. But I would take greasy over deet any day. I don&#x27;t know how it works as a sunscreen...I don&#x27;t rely on it for that since it is only 30spf.</li>
            <li> I purchased this repellent for my infant because it didn&#x27;t have deet (Eww, deet is smelly!). I absolutely HATE seeing mosquito bites on her, including her face!! I needed to get something gentle on her skin and face and as non smelly as possible. This stuff actually seems to be working and has not caused any irritation when lightly used on her face! We recently went for a walk in a different neighborhood from our own (to escape the buggies) and as soon as we got out of the car we were bombarded with mosquitoes! I quickly applied the repellent on the baby first and you could see the mosquitoes flying around her and the stroller, never landing on her skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells good, and repels. I&#x27;d say it works!</li>
            <li> We have used Avon Skin So Soft Bug Guard off and on for years.  It has a nice scent, has SPF and keeps the bugs off when we&#x27;re out walking early in the morning and outside in the evenings..  Recommend it.</li>
            <li> My grandson is terrified of bugs, particularly yellow jackets.  I was looking for an insect repellant for him.  Skin-So-Soft Bug Guard not only repels insects but has the added benefit of a sun screen.  When we plan outdoor activities I always carry Skin-So-Soft Bug Guard. Very effective product.</li>
            <li> used this for my baby daughter.. worked well but only protects for 2 hours so had to reapply.... but smells good and has lasted quite a few months now.. a little goes along way...</li>
            <li> I get bitten if there&#x27;s a mosquito in the same zip code....but if I apply this stuff, they actually stay away. Trust me, not sure why, but this stuff really works for me. It&#x27;s definitely worth a try for you if you get lots of bites.</li>
            <li> 95% fewer insect bites.  Not greasy, no heavy odor.  Won&#x27;t go hiking without it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. Smells like sunscreen and a bit watery. It does repel bugs but not sure how much sunscreen this has. It&#x27;s greasy too.</li>
            <li> I swear by this! It&#x27;s the only thing that keeps the mosquito&#x27;s away.</li>
            <li> This was my most used item on my recent trip to Big Island. TSA let me carry it on in my plastic baggie with my other liquids and gels. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t leave it home and just but it in Hawaii because I couldn&#x27;t find combo sunscreen/bug repellent ANYWHERE on Big Island. All the stores carried bug repellent. All the stores carried sunscreen. But NO two-in-one. This was helpful not only for the beach with biting flies, ants, etc. but at our condo at night when the mosquitoes were SWARMING. My friends got eaten up, I was bite free and unburnt.</li>
            <li> The perfume smell is too strong for me.  It was of some help with mosquitoes.  Unfortunately, a product with deet is much, much more effective.</li>
            <li> Use this for my little guy. .. no more bug bites :)</li>
            <li> This is a review for the 4 ounce Avon SKIN-SO-SOFT Bug Guard PLUS IR3535® Insect Repellent Moisturizing Lotion - Clearance SPF 30 Gentle Breeze scent. Manufacturer claim: Effectively repels mosquitoes, deer ticks, black flies, sand flies, gnats, no-seeums and biting midges. PABA-free. Nongreasy. With vitamin E and aloe. Keep out of reach of children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years I&#x27;ve heard how great Avon Skin So Soft is for repelling mosquitos and how all kinds of outdoorsmen and women swear by it. So I bought 3 bottles at $6.95 each (free shipping). Wish I&#x27;d only bought one, wish I had gone to a local Avon dealer. If I had, I&#x27;d have been able to try it out first, and I would have known it was not for me, not worth the price I paid, or any price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it one star because I&#x27;m not able to give it zero stars. It gave me zits all over my face (clearly not noncomediagenic as I expected it would be since it claims to be \\&quot;nongreasy\\&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the smell/scent was so strong it gave me a horrible headache. I eventually had to wash it off because I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, even though I only had it on my skin for about 30 minutes it was long enough to cause me to get a face full of pimples. I&#x27;m in my 50s and haven&#x27;t had to deal with zits for years, until putting this crapola on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The headache lasted for hours, until I took sinus meds that made me sleepy so I had to take a nap. The entire day was ruined, had to sleep off the headache. Took several days to get rid of the pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adding to this mess, even worse than the smell, the headache, and the zits - I got a mosquito bite while wearing it! I know because I watched the mosquito land on my arm and felt it bite me. Skeeter must have loved this stinky crap. Seems it attracts them - it does NOT repel them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the following two issues were not included in deciding my star rating, but some consumers might find it helpful...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt; The message \\&quot;Please note that in your shipping confirmation you will be asked to let us know if you are currently receiving service from an Avon Representative. If you are, please follow the link provided in the confirmation so that s/he can receive proper credit for your Avon order placed through Amazon.com.\\&quot; was posted on Amazon&#x27;s website when I ordered this item and I was happy knowing someone local would get credit for the order, but that did not happen. I was not asked anything during shipping confirmation and the seller is in Texas. My billing address is currently NY and it was shipped to me in WA. Not even close to TX. I&#x27;m sure they could have found a dealer closer to me, but they didn&#x27;t even try. This is another reason I wish I had dealt with a local Avon dealer in person. I was expecting a local Avon dealer to get credit for the sale, but they did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt; The Amazon seller who sent me the item was Moshya Home Furnishings. The items (3 bottles of this useless stuff) were shipped later than expected and received after the July 4th weekend. I was sent an email saying the shipment would be late, but not until it was too late to cancel the order and find it locally. Had I known it would be late when I ordered it I would not have placed the order from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: After I made the purchase and posted the above review I noticed the title of the item has the word \\&quot;clearance\\&quot; in it. Maybe it&#x27;s discontinued because they know it does not work well?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: Feeling ripped off and lied to I did further research about Skin So Soft and this product. I was under the impression what I was getting was the ORIGINAL Skin So Soft (the stuff people have raved about for years) packaged as a bug repellant, but in fact what I got is NOT the original Skin So Soft. What I got was a smelly lotion with a chemical added to it with the Skin So Soft name - clearly it is not Skin So Soft lotion, which I find deceptive on the part of Avon. The chemical in this product is called IR3535 and this chemical is NOT in the original Skin So Soft. Deceptive because the original Skin So Soft, using the original formula, was the product so many people raved about for years. This new product, which they are calling Skin So Soft, is not the same product, is not the product or formula outdoorsmen and women loved as a bug repellant. Avon knows this is not the original formula, is not the product that made Skin So Soft famous as a bug repellant, and this should be made clear on the label and in advertising - NOT THE ORIGINAL SKIN SO SOFT PRODUCT OUTDOORSMEN DISCOVERED AND RAVED ABOUT FOR YEARS!!!!IR3535 and this chemical is NOT in the original Skin So Soft.

            <li> Bug guard? Far from it. This product does not meet my expectation.  Mosquitoes ate my toddler alive the day I applied bug guard on him for his camp activities in his school. I usually spray him with the insect repellent, OFF, without any bug bites. I thought this product would be a better alternative b/c it contains sunscreen. I am very disappointed. It may be good for sunscreen but definitely will not protect you from bugs.</li>
            <li> My toddler has very sensitive skin that burns easily and is a delicious treat for all blood sucking creatures, so we are constantly having to cover her in sunscreen AND bug spray on hot Texas summer days.  Some of that stuff really stinks, and leaves a sticky mess on everything.  We got 2 bottles of this Avon Skin-So-Foft Bug Guard Plus (one for home and one for school), and it works like a charm! A little bit goes a long way, as you just need to cover the skin with a thin layer.  It has a nice, subtle smell, and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky mess.  Most importantly, it really works - no bug bites, no sunburn, and no irritated skin!  My only complaint is that it comes in a pretty small container, so you might want to order a couple (I ordered a 3rd bottle to keep in the car).  Otherwise, I highly recommend this product for anyone looking to protect themselves or their children from bugs and sun with a single solution that is gentle but effective.</li>
            <li> Smelled fine but did nothing to keep Mosquitos away</li>
            <li> This is amazing stuff, sunscreen with bug repellent and lotion all in one. This is like a Swiss army knife of skin products for living in Arizona.  I remembered the brand name from 30 years ago growing up in Alaska because the ladies didn&#x27;t like using Off or Repel to keep the Alaska State Bird - the Mosquito - from biting them.  Those products are like pouring jet fuel on your skin... so they would buy from the Avon sales rep a similar product.  When my wife complained about bug bites in our back yard I immediately thought of this and placed an order.  Now she&#x27;s happy and you know the saying, happy wife &#x3D; happy life.</li>
