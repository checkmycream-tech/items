            <li>(Its a 10 is GREAT stuff too!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s best to place it close to but not on the scalp.</li>
            <li>As the product is for hair and not hands (and even specifically talks about being used on the hair shaft), I decided it would be best to wash the lotion off my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Controls, repairs and adds life to your hair beautifully.</li>
            <li>Frizz Ease products have been around for years and have always been great products ..</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be happy to know this one is a cream, but you&#x27;ll need some patience with this one -</li>
            <li>However, if you have hair that is frizzy at the ends, it may be great for you</li>
            <li>Smells great and works even</li>
            <li>Their products are a great quality and one that I don&#x27;t hesitate to recommend.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Final opinion - good stuff that is great for</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a good product, I think.</li>
            <li>Among hair serums, this doesn&#x27;t stand out--which is a good thing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
            <li>The very first time I used it I had to say I was impressed with the softness of my hair as I was blow drying.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleased to try this product.</li>
            <li>This works best on freshly washed hair.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>It also has a pleasant scent that isn&#x27;t overwhelming and doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li>Smells nice .</li>
            <li>For me, it&#x27;s kind of a trade off.  </li>
            <li>When I run out, I would be happy to get this product again, at the full price here.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Final opinion - good stuff that is great for straight or curly hair.</li>
            <li>have used this Beyond Smooth when straightening my hair with good results, too.</li>
            <li>It has a lovely coconut smell and keeps your hair in tip top condition for more than one day--you are going to look gorgeous.</li>
            <li>cream is very light with no greasy residue.</li>
            <li>The cream is virtually scentless and very light feeling in my hair.</li>
            <li>The product is very light and not oily, so it doesn&#x27;t add heaviness or greasiness to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Frizz Ease does not have a strong smell, and the pump container is handy.</li>
            <li>I like it better than the oil based serums because it does not leave a greasy look or feel on the hair.</li>
            <li>When I use this, I have no fly-aways, no frizz and my curls look more defined and healthy.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m leery about using more, though) or, as the product states &#x27;combats the porosity problem of frizzy hair by gradually building up hair&#x27;s frizz immunity with each use&#x27; and my hair is just more porous or something.</li>
            <li>I did not put any creme at the top of my hair as sometimes I feel like I can get a greasy looking hair</li>
            <li>so I ALWAYS avoid the top with any product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am fairly pleased with  the results of the Frizz Ease.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s interesting how it gets better and better with use.</li>
            <li>The curls are more defined and they don&#x27;t frizz out when I&#x27;m in a heated environment.</li>
            <li>, I think I like this even more.</li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>and works better, I see no reason to use it.</li>
            <li>I was hoping that this product would be able to help with that.</li>
            <li>However, most people I know have frizz at the top of their heads.</li>
            <li>I think my hair is actually more frizzy than it would have been without the application of the product</li>
            <li>the pump on top is Frizz-Ease purple.  </li>
            <li>It has a light scent and the pump bottle makes it very easy to dispense.</li>
            <li>Beyond Smooth primer is really light but effective.</li>
            <li>my incredibly frizzy, slightly-longer-than-shoulder-length hair, five pumps creates a no-shampoo sort of look, without actually being greasy.</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant and doesn&#x27;t really last for people who prefer to add their own fragrance.  </li>
            <li>The product has a cream-like consistency that is easy to dispense from the pump.</li>
            <li>so I got amounts that were easy to work with.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going for a curly style, without a strong scent or a lot of slip, this may be the way to go.</li>
            <li>I have soft, silky, straight hair that gets incredibly frizzy around my part at the top of my head.</li>
            <li>I have tried the John Frieda Frizz Easy Beyond Smooth Immunity Primer.  </li>
            <li>often have used serums in my hair, I feel they do great jobs and have not found a cream that can replicate the same smooth feeling as the serums until now.  </li>
            <li>Applied closer to the ends, it does smooth the frizz like the OGX does.</li>
            <li>Beyond Smooth is a lotion type anti frizz product.</li>
            <li>I had been a keratin leave-in treatment and as much as I have really liked that</li>
            <li>/&gt;Three strokes, and my hair goes smooth as a straightener.</li>
            <li>Get the original sulfate free if you&#x27;re going to try</li>
            <li>My hair has been particularly frizzy this winter (admittedly, at part my own fault), but this product has stopped the issues.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s that light and dissipates that quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good way to create that particular trendy hairstyle without, um, actually not washing your hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and straight, but as I get older, it is getting more and more frizzy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to keep an eye out for better daily use brands and try to keep this for more important days.</li>
            <li>lotion had a nice soft floral fragrance and afterwards my hands felt as if I had used lotion on them.  </li>
            <li>No bad effects on the hair afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No bad effects on the hair afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The primer is easily pumped out of the bottle and is thin, like a light hand cream and has a very light and pleasant fruity odor.  </li>
            <li>JF Frizz Ease helped for a while, but my hair quickly became frizzy again.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the light, nice scent when I apply this (it goes away quickly), and throughout the day can feel a bit of extra lightness in my hair, even after the first application.</li>
            <li>the first time I used it, fortunately on a day off from work).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You hair will be smooth and pretty.</li>
            <li>I saw results the very first time I used it, and I have been using it 3-4 times per week</li>
            <li>It gives me good results and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel damaged or dry after using it.</li>
            <li>It truly knocked the frizz out of my hair; within the first use I noticed a difference, and after four uses or so the difference was quite significant.  </li>
            <li>The Frizz Ease Beyond Smooth hair product really tamed my frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>The John Frieda Frizz Ease has worked better than anything I&#x27;ve tried so far.  </li>
            <li>After the first try, I found it easy to control how much I got per pump</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works good even under other products.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s that no one product is going to be right for everyone.</li>
            <li>My recent favorite product is [[ASIN:B000N758A2</li>
            <li>Overall, we probably wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again because she&#x27;s had better luck with leave-in conditioners.</li>
            <li>with a big side helping of frizz most of the rest of the time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit, the first time I tried it, nada.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s pretty</li>
            <li>it works better and the effects last longer.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty noticeable improvement.  </li>
            <li>My hair also looks better when I wear it down; this primer makesnit look smooth and</li>
            <li>I have only used this a few times, but it is amazing!!</li>
            <li>John Frieda Frizz Ease Beyond Smooth Immunity Primer, 3.1 Fluid Ounce, is a super treat.</li>
            <li>have used other products by this company before and have liked them all.  </li>
            <li>product comes in an attractive silver-gray, 3.1 ounce bottle, with Frizz Ease&#x27;s trademark white on purple logo and some pink highlights.  </li>
            <li>Works better on dry hair but don&#x27;t put too much of anything because it will look oily .</li>
            <li>I have been pleased with Frizz Ease products in the past, so I was excited to try this</li>
            <li>I felt like I had NO heavy product in my hair after my blow dry and at the end of the say my hair still remained smooth and frizz free.</li>
            <li>scent of the product is really light, so much so that after almost a month using it on a daily basis, I couldn&#x27;t even tell you what it smells like--</li>
            <li>Nourishing Coconut Milk, 4oz]], but too much of it can make my hair feel too oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this product and will continue to incorporate it into my wash day routine.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really notice any scent with this</li>
            <li>straight or curly hair.you used it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the smell, and haven&#x27;t used it much because I felt it wasn&#x27;t really doing anything for my hair.</li>
            <li>Still didn&#x27;t see much of a difference.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really understand how it works from the inside out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have straight hair that tends to be frizzy and tangled up.</li>
            <li>Really like what it did for my hair.</li>
            <li>I love John Frieda&#x27;s Secret Weapon and this product seems to be a step more, even.</li>
            <li>primer definitely gets rid of the frizz, making hair far more manageable.  </li>
            <li>This product smells nice, is a cream not an oil, and, used sparingly, it did control the frizz and tame my hair.</li>
            <li>My results were as good as I get with my other &amp;#34;favorite products&amp;#34; so I would definitely add this one to my arsenal.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and thin enough to get good coverage throughout your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I am more likely to use it only when needed as my hair is frizzy in certain weather.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve long, fine hair but a decent amount of it,</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve seen my hair get softer, more manageable and way less frizzy.</li>
            <li>If I make sure that I don&#x27;t apply the product to the roots (like the directions say), it does make it look less oily.  </li>
            <li>Use more or less depending on hair length and thickness.</li>
            <li>I find this version extremely easy to use, since you just pump the bottle and use on your wet hair.  </li>
            <li>It is easily applied to wet hair.  </li>
            <li>So, it does work, although its effectiveness will vary with your particular hair type and circumstances.</li>
            <li>It has a decent and not undesirable scent.</li>
            <li>In fact, this product states that, with regular use, frizz will decrease overall, and that DID happen for me!  :-)  </li>
            <li>For short hair, a dime-sized amount is more than enough for coverage.  </li>
            <li>least at first, it worked best for me to use this daily or every other day.</li>
            <li>I have a basic \\&quot;long, straight hair\\&quot; style, but this product claims to work with curly and wavy styles as well and is ok to use on hair styled with heat tools.</li>
            <li>Even on high humidity days.</li>
            <li>However, it definitely makes a big difference in terms of managing your hair, especially given the dryness of the winter weather and is a great starting point for adding additional hair products to change.  </li>
            <li>have very wavy hair that changes over to curls near the ends.</li>
            <li>I have to be careful with hair products so that they give me a smooth look without looking  or feeling greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You apply it to damp hair (do not rinse out) and style your hair as you normally would.</li>
            <li>just washed my hair and conditioned like normal and then used this product.  </li>
            <li>Ever since then I have tried multiple products to tame the frizz with some success and many misses.</li>
            <li>The directions indicate you put one pump (more for very long hair) and rub into hair mid shaft.</li>
            <li>(ok, is always frizzy unless I flat-iron my hair) and this product helped to tame some of the frizzies.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several John Frieda products in the past and have had mixed results - his shampoos and conditioners are usually great, but his frizz products are iffy</li>
            <li>So be aware that everyone&#x27;s hair might react a bit differently.</li>
            <li>only drawback is that it does leave my hair feeling and looking pretty greasy by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>The product doesn&#x27;t have a smell and is clear in your hands.  </li>
            <li>and I was pleasantly surprised .</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair under control so that the old frizzies are tamed into looking like body instead of frizz.</li>
            <li>and I felt like I didn&#x27;t have to use my round barrel brush as much to smooth my hair out.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly/wavy hair)  </li>
            <li>But at nearly $22, it is rather pricey.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you use too much, it can feel a little sticky or make your hair sort of clump together, but when you use the right amount it gives really good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have slightly thin curly hair and if I let it air dry with no product in it, it will have frizz and fly-aways.</li>
            <li>In a less harsh climate (warm, 60% humidity)</li>
            <li>I use very expensive products but can&#x27;t always afford the great stuff</li>
            <li>I got this for my girlfriend to use on her long, waist-length, straight hair.  </li>
            <li>I have long, fluffy curls, with little fly aways being blonde and living in missouri.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not until the third application that I&#x27;m finally seeing some real results.</li>
            <li>If you were alive in the eighties, you&#x27;ll remember the old Frizz-Ease serum, which was silicone in a tiny, sticky bottle.</li>
            <li>There are NO other styling products in my hair in this photo EXCEPT the Frizz Ease.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks smooth and in control...which is hard to do in Florida.</li>
            <li>That being said, I see a lot of other positive reviews here</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not careful though, it can make hair look unwashed</li>
            <li>, I applied the John Frieda Frizz Ease Beyond Smooth as directed, a small amount from &amp;#34;mid-shaft&amp;#34; to the end of my hair right after shampooing and am not pleased.  </li>
            <li>very well battling that frizz, especially on those dry winter days.</li>
            <li>The frizz really is bothersome and I would rather wash my hair daily than have it look dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li>It says to apply to wet hair, but I towel dry it first.  </li>
            <li>It is not an all in one hair care solution, but is an excellent base for your other hair care products.</li>
            <li>so I only know this product for about 12 hours, it doesn&#x27;t say any large lasting amount of time like other brands.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Normally I&#x27;d add hair spray and some other things</li>
            <li>You almost need a tiny bit less than a whole pump.</li>

            <li> my incredibly frizzy, slightly-longer-than-shoulder-length hair, five pumps creates a no-shampoo sort of look, without actually being greasy.</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant and doesn&#x27;t really last for people who prefer to add their own fragrance.  </li>
            <li> The product has a cream-like consistency that is easy to dispense from the pump.</li>
            <li> so I got amounts that were easy to work with.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going for a curly style, without a strong scent or a lot of slip, this may be the way to go.</li>
            <li> I have soft, silky, straight hair that gets incredibly frizzy around my part at the top of my head.</li>
            <li> I have tried the John Frieda Frizz Easy Beyond Smooth Immunity Primer.  </li>
            <li> often have used serums in my hair, I feel they do great jobs and have not found a cream that can replicate the same smooth feeling as the serums until now.  </li>
            <li> Applied closer to the ends, it does smooth the frizz like the OGX does.</li>
            <li> Beyond Smooth is a lotion type anti frizz product.</li>
            <li> I had been a keratin leave-in treatment and as much as I have really liked that</li>
            <li> /&gt;Three strokes, and my hair goes smooth as a straightener.</li>
            <li> Get the original sulfate free if you&#x27;re going to try</li>
            <li> My hair has been particularly frizzy this winter (admittedly, at part my own fault), but this product has stopped the issues.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s that light and dissipates that quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good way to create that particular trendy hairstyle without, um, actually not washing your hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and straight, but as I get older, it is getting more and more frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to keep an eye out for better daily use brands and try to keep this for more important days.</li>
            <li> lotion had a nice soft floral fragrance and afterwards my hands felt as if I had used lotion on them.  </li>
            <li> No bad effects on the hair afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No bad effects on the hair afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The primer is easily pumped out of the bottle and is thin, like a light hand cream and has a very light and pleasant fruity odor.  </li>
            <li> JF Frizz Ease helped for a while, but my hair quickly became frizzy again.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the light, nice scent when I apply this (it goes away quickly), and throughout the day can feel a bit of extra lightness in my hair, even after the first application.</li>
            <li> the first time I used it, fortunately on a day off from work).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You hair will be smooth and pretty.</li>
            <li> I saw results the very first time I used it, and I have been using it 3-4 times per week</li>
            <li> It gives me good results and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel damaged or dry after using it.</li>
            <li> It truly knocked the frizz out of my hair; within the first use I noticed a difference, and after four uses or so the difference was quite significant.  </li>
            <li> The Frizz Ease Beyond Smooth hair product really tamed my frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> The John Frieda Frizz Ease has worked better than anything I&#x27;ve tried so far.  </li>
            <li> After the first try, I found it easy to control how much I got per pump</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works good even under other products.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s that no one product is going to be right for everyone.</li>
            <li> My recent favorite product is [[ASIN:B000N758A2</li>
            <li> Overall, we probably wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again because she&#x27;s had better luck with leave-in conditioners.</li>
            <li> with a big side helping of frizz most of the rest of the time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit, the first time I tried it, nada.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s pretty</li>
            <li> it works better and the effects last longer.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty noticeable improvement.  </li>
            <li> My hair also looks better when I wear it down; this primer makesnit look smooth and</li>
            <li> I have only used this a few times, but it is amazing!!</li>
            <li> John Frieda Frizz Ease Beyond Smooth Immunity Primer, 3.1 Fluid Ounce, is a super treat.</li>
            <li> have used other products by this company before and have liked them all.  </li>
            <li> product comes in an attractive silver-gray, 3.1 ounce bottle, with Frizz Ease&#x27;s trademark white on purple logo and some pink highlights.  </li>
            <li> Works better on dry hair but don&#x27;t put too much of anything because it will look oily .</li>
            <li> I have been pleased with Frizz Ease products in the past, so I was excited to try this</li>
            <li> I felt like I had NO heavy product in my hair after my blow dry and at the end of the say my hair still remained smooth and frizz free.</li>
            <li> scent of the product is really light, so much so that after almost a month using it on a daily basis, I couldn&#x27;t even tell you what it smells like--</li>
            <li> Nourishing Coconut Milk, 4oz]], but too much of it can make my hair feel too oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this product and will continue to incorporate it into my wash day routine.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really notice any scent with this</li>
            <li> straight or curly hair.you used it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell, and haven&#x27;t used it much because I felt it wasn&#x27;t really doing anything for my hair.</li>
            <li> Still didn&#x27;t see much of a difference.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really understand how it works from the inside out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have straight hair that tends to be frizzy and tangled up.</li>
            <li> Really like what it did for my hair.</li>
            <li> I love John Frieda&#x27;s Secret Weapon and this product seems to be a step more, even.</li>
            <li> primer definitely gets rid of the frizz, making hair far more manageable.  </li>
            <li> This product smells nice, is a cream not an oil, and, used sparingly, it did control the frizz and tame my hair.</li>
            <li> My results were as good as I get with my other &amp;#34;favorite products&amp;#34; so I would definitely add this one to my arsenal.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and thin enough to get good coverage throughout your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I am more likely to use it only when needed as my hair is frizzy in certain weather.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve long, fine hair but a decent amount of it,</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve seen my hair get softer, more manageable and way less frizzy.</li>
            <li> If I make sure that I don&#x27;t apply the product to the roots (like the directions say), it does make it look less oily.  </li>
            <li> Use more or less depending on hair length and thickness.</li>
            <li> I find this version extremely easy to use, since you just pump the bottle and use on your wet hair.  </li>
            <li> It is easily applied to wet hair.  </li>
            <li> So, it does work, although its effectiveness will vary with your particular hair type and circumstances.</li>
            <li> It has a decent and not undesirable scent.</li>
            <li> In fact, this product states that, with regular use, frizz will decrease overall, and that DID happen for me!  :-)  </li>
            <li> For short hair, a dime-sized amount is more than enough for coverage.  </li>
            <li> least at first, it worked best for me to use this daily or every other day.</li>
            <li> I have a basic \\&quot;long, straight hair\\&quot; style, but this product claims to work with curly and wavy styles as well and is ok to use on hair styled with heat tools.</li>
            <li> Even on high humidity days.</li>
            <li> However, it definitely makes a big difference in terms of managing your hair, especially given the dryness of the winter weather and is a great starting point for adding additional hair products to change.  </li>
            <li> have very wavy hair that changes over to curls near the ends.</li>
            <li> I have to be careful with hair products so that they give me a smooth look without looking  or feeling greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You apply it to damp hair (do not rinse out) and style your hair as you normally would.</li>
            <li> just washed my hair and conditioned like normal and then used this product.  </li>
            <li> Ever since then I have tried multiple products to tame the frizz with some success and many misses.</li>
            <li> The directions indicate you put one pump (more for very long hair) and rub into hair mid shaft.</li>
            <li> (ok, is always frizzy unless I flat-iron my hair) and this product helped to tame some of the frizzies.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several John Frieda products in the past and have had mixed results - his shampoos and conditioners are usually great, but his frizz products are iffy</li>
            <li> So be aware that everyone&#x27;s hair might react a bit differently.</li>
            <li> only drawback is that it does leave my hair feeling and looking pretty greasy by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t have a smell and is clear in your hands.  </li>
            <li> and I was pleasantly surprised .</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair under control so that the old frizzies are tamed into looking like body instead of frizz.</li>
            <li> and I felt like I didn&#x27;t have to use my round barrel brush as much to smooth my hair out.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly/wavy hair)  </li>
            <li> But at nearly $22, it is rather pricey.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you use too much, it can feel a little sticky or make your hair sort of clump together, but when you use the right amount it gives really good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have slightly thin curly hair and if I let it air dry with no product in it, it will have frizz and fly-aways.</li>
            <li> In a less harsh climate (warm, 60% humidity)</li>
            <li> I use very expensive products but can&#x27;t always afford the great stuff</li>
            <li> I got this for my girlfriend to use on her long, waist-length, straight hair.  </li>
            <li> I have long, fluffy curls, with little fly aways being blonde and living in missouri.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not until the third application that I&#x27;m finally seeing some real results.</li>
            <li> If you were alive in the eighties, you&#x27;ll remember the old Frizz-Ease serum, which was silicone in a tiny, sticky bottle.</li>
            <li> There are NO other styling products in my hair in this photo EXCEPT the Frizz Ease.  </li>
            <li> My hair looks smooth and in control...which is hard to do in Florida.</li>
            <li> That being said, I see a lot of other positive reviews here</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not careful though, it can make hair look unwashed</li>
            <li> , I applied the John Frieda Frizz Ease Beyond Smooth as directed, a small amount from &amp;#34;mid-shaft&amp;#34; to the end of my hair right after shampooing and am not pleased.  </li>
            <li> very well battling that frizz, especially on those dry winter days.</li>
            <li> The frizz really is bothersome and I would rather wash my hair daily than have it look dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> It says to apply to wet hair, but I towel dry it first.  </li>
            <li> It is not an all in one hair care solution, but is an excellent base for your other hair care products.</li>
            <li> so I only know this product for about 12 hours, it doesn&#x27;t say any large lasting amount of time like other brands.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Normally I&#x27;d add hair spray and some other things</li>
            <li> You almost need a tiny bit less than a whole pump.</li>
            <li> John Frieda&#x27;s Beyond Smooth Frizz-Immunity Primer does what it purports to do--it serves as a base for other hair products, by decreasing frizz and making hair more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got naturally wavy/curly hair, and despite trying just about every other product on the market, I go back to the serum.</li>
            <li> I have used a number of conditioners and styling products to try and tame the frizz, but none seem to do the job very well.  </li>
            <li> (I work it through wet hair and then wrap in a hair towel until ready to style), but it didn&#x27;t really have the same effect on my long, thick, curly/wavy hair.</li>
            <li> size of the bottle is small but for people who travel on planes they will like that the size is under 3.4 oz, and really it doesn&#x27;t take that much to do your hair so this small bottle will last awhile.</li>
            <li> I even added another styling product before I applied the flat iron because it was still a bit frizzy</li>
            <li> Even though I have long hair, my current shampoo leaves me with fly-away hair.</li>
            <li> Yet it appears to be only a minor ingredient.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is definitely a useful item in the anti frizz battle - used with care, it rivals all the other products I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I use different gels and mousse when I blow dry and never had a problem when using this before either of them.</li>
            <li> I use the Frizz Ease first and let it air dry as usual, and then after its dry I apply the Fekkai and straighten it.</li>
            <li> Since the serum is about 1/3 the price of this (seriously, I can&#x27;t believe how much they&#x27;re charging for this!</li>
            <li> Even a simple ponytail can be less than simple because I get really short gray hairs that want to stick up all over my head.</li>
            <li> There are some products that you can tell when you wash it out that it makes your hair feel rough or otherwise different than before you used it.</li>
            <li> use two pumps since my hair is long, work it in from mid-shaft to the roots and...</li>
            <li> The product says that it will long term control frizzy hair with continued use</li>
            <li> apply this by &amp;#34;combing&amp;#34; it through my hair with my fingers, starting at the middle of my hair in the bulk and then working down to the ends.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised at the small amount of creme that I put in my hair</li>
            <li> Used on naturally curly, wet hair with a little bit of a blow-dry, it creates piece-y, but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also intensely dry.</li>
            <li> I never blow dry before straightening, so I can&#x27;t say how it works out if you do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> blow dry went well</li>
            <li> The directions say to apply from the middle of the hair down to the ends and rub through.</li>
            <li> Upon receiving this product I thought that it was an oil but was shocked that it was a cream, which was better for</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got hair that likes to be very curly one day and merely wavy the next...</li>
            <li> a generous application followed by brushing and drying made a minimal difference.  </li>
            <li> As a bit of background before I get started:  I am middle aged, have coarse thick hair which I color.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;Apply to wet hair.</li>
            <li> For my daughter&#x27;s longer hair (half way down her back), she required about a quarters worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On a recent trip to the southeastern US, the cold, dry air had my hair very frizzy.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> Then I use just the tiniest bit at the crown/roots - usually just the remainder or residue that is left over after applying it everywhere</li>
            <li> It basically just didn&#x27;t do what the other product does (i.e. prevent frizz).</li>
            <li> I usually use a generic moroccan oil on my hair after washing it.  </li>
            <li> My hair has a tendency to be frizzy, hot or cold, dry or humid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> I live in New England and it is very cold and dry here.  </li>
            <li> only disappointment was my impression from the advertising that coconut oil was the main ingredient of this product.</li>
            <li> The temporary shine is not worth the dryness.</li>
            <li> She said that she has a lot of breaks, and her hair would often get frizzy looking, so she wanted a product that would keep the fly-aways down and make her hair appear smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is not greasy or does not weight your hair down if used as directed.</li>
            <li> and I had to slap another product on my hair to keep the frizz down.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally oily anyway, but on the days when I don&#x27;t use the Frizz Ease, my hair stays cleaner, longer, but the frizz is a little worse on those days, too.  </li>
            <li> I have long and fairly thick and wavy hair</li>
            <li> I use a little less Fekkai Glossing Creme when I use this Frizz Ease.</li>
            <li> Some products leave hair feeling heavy and nearly limp.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it since I have seen some difference to my hair but doesn&#x27;t leave that brittle heavy feel.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions and applied it to my just washed and towel dried</li>
            <li> &quot; I knew it was time to tame the hair.</li>
            <li> This is suppose to tame your frizz and provide shine which I saw after using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does tame my frizz and flyaways but also leaves a greasy look that makes my hair appear</li>
            <li> It does tame the frizz and flyaways.</li>
            <li> It immediately helped to tame my fly-away hair without leaving any residue on my hair (that I noticed, anyway).</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s that I still need to tweak the amount I use</li>
            <li> (I am including a picture of the top my flat-ironed styled hair which is always the worst area for frizz for me....</li>
            <li> I have noticed no static in my hair either.</li>
            <li> I am growing out my thick, gray hair, and have trouble with some frizz and fly-away hair.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I realized shortly after receiving the product that it would not work for me.</li>
            <li> It says to put a small amount into your palm, then distribute evenly from mid-shaft to tips.  </li>
            <li> I subbed it in for my usual</li>
            <li> at least all the ones I have tried.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it seems to build up and, at least for me, not produce immediate results.</li>
            <li> It says you&#x27;ll see improvement in a week, and I&#x27;ve been using it for at least two weeks.</li>
            <li> Not effective for my hair type.</li>
            <li> Only bad thing I have to say is the amount for the price, I usually have to use two-three pumps a morning</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and curly and fairly difficult to tame.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect, since my hair is temperamental and I&#x27;m impatient but it works</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know the science behind the product, but the proof for me has been in my hair.</li>
            <li> (I had that unfortunate experience</li>
            <li> Sadly, this product is just another product on the market--I&#x27;ll stick with my serum.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it also leaves my hair appear greasy and unwashed.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ll be using it again sadly</li>
            <li> My hair just LOOKED awkward because of the product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to say that this is a bad product because it does what it says it&#x27;ll do; it gets rid of frizz.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s especially bad on my bangs, so</li>

            <li> I use very expensive products but can&#x27;t always afford the great stuff so I look for in between alternatives and I was pleasantly surprised . Smells nice . Works better on dry hair but don&#x27;t put too much of anything because it will look oily .</li>
            <li> I have been pleased with Frizz Ease products in the past, so I was excited to try this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very wavy hair that changes over to curls near the ends. It&#x27;s also intensely dry. Anyway, my hair has never wanted to just lay there and behave itself, especially when it&#x27;s humid. When someone referred to me several years ago as \\&quot;Mary with the big hair\\&quot; I knew it was time to tame the hair. Ever since then I have tried multiple products to tame the frizz with some success and many misses. Some products leave hair feeling heavy and nearly limp. My recent favorite product is [[ASIN:B000N758A2 OGX  Anti-Breakage Serum, Nourishing Coconut Milk, 4oz]], but too much of it can make my hair feel too oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I was very pleased to try this product. It behaves very similarly to the OGX coconut oil. This product smells nice, is a cream not an oil, and, used sparingly, it did control the frizz and tame my hair. You almost need a tiny bit less than a whole pump. Applied closer to the ends, it does smooth the frizz like the OGX does. If you&#x27;re not careful though, it can make hair look unwashed (I had that unfortunate experience the first time I used it, fortunately on a day off from work).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely a useful item in the anti frizz battle - used with care, it rivals all the other products I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Upon receiving this product I thought that it was an oil but was shocked that it was a cream, which was better for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is very light with no greasy residue. You apply it to damp hair (do not rinse out) and style your hair as you normally would. This works best on freshly washed hair. It has a light scent and the pump bottle makes it very easy to dispense. This is suppose to tame your frizz and provide shine which I saw after using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I really like this product and will continue to incorporate it into my wash day routine.</li>
            <li> I got this for my girlfriend to use on her long, waist-length, straight hair.  She said that she has a lot of breaks, and her hair would often get frizzy looking, so she wanted a product that would keep the fly-aways down and make her hair appear smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even a generous application followed by brushing and drying made a minimal difference.  Her hair stays just as frizzy, although it does feel smoother to the touch.  Overall, we probably wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again because she&#x27;s had better luck with leave-in conditioners.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and curly and fairly difficult to tame. Even a simple ponytail can be less than simple because I get really short gray hairs that want to stick up all over my head. I have to be careful with hair products so that they give me a smooth look without looking  or feeling greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Beyond Smooth primer is really light but effective. It keeps my hair under control so that the old frizzies are tamed into looking like body instead of frizz. My hair also looks better when I wear it down; this primer makesnit look smooth and hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of the product is really light, so much so that after almost a month using it on a daily basis, I couldn&#x27;t even tell you what it smells like--it&#x27;s that light and dissipates that quickly.</li>
            <li> This product works well. I have long, fluffy curls, with little fly aways being blonde and living in missouri. I do wash my hair daily so I only know this product for about 12 hours, it doesn&#x27;t say any large lasting amount of time like other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Only bad thing I have to say is the amount for the price, I usually have to use two-three pumps a morning (my layers go from the end of my boobs to my belly button length). I&#x27;m going to keep an eye out for better daily use brands and try to keep this for more important days.</li>
            <li> John Frieda Frizz Ease worked wonders for me.  It truly knocked the frizz out of my hair; within the first use I noticed a difference, and after four uses or so the difference was quite significant.  I used this product and let my hair air-dry and it still worked.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this products and will personally continue to use it going forward.</li>
            <li> Beyond Smooth is a lotion type anti frizz product. I like it better than the oil based serums because it does not leave a greasy look or feel on the hair. If you use too much, it can feel a little sticky or make your hair sort of clump together, but when you use the right amount it gives really good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have slightly thin curly hair and if I let it air dry with no product in it, it will have frizz and fly-aways. When I use this, I have no fly-aways, no frizz and my curls look more defined and healthy. Frizz Ease products have been around for years and have always been great products .. at least all the ones I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply this by &amp;#34;combing&amp;#34; it through my hair with my fingers, starting at the middle of my hair in the bulk and then working down to the ends. Then I use just the tiniest bit at the crown/roots - usually just the remainder or residue that is left over after applying it everywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works good even under other products. I use different gels and mousse when I blow dry and never had a problem when using this before either of them. I use it with Its a 10 leave in conditioner as well. (Its a 10 is GREAT stuff too! Controls, repairs and adds life to your hair beautifully. Get the original sulfate free if you&#x27;re going to try it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this Beyond Smooth when straightening my hair with good results, too. I use a little less Fekkai Glossing Creme when I use this Frizz Ease. I use the Frizz Ease first and let it air dry as usual, and then after its dry I apply the Fekkai and straighten it. I never blow dry before straightening, so I can&#x27;t say how it works out if you do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really notice any scent with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a good product, I think. It gives me good results and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel damaged or dry after using it. There are some products that you can tell when you wash it out that it makes your hair feel rough or otherwise different than before you used it. I don&#x27;t notice any difference in my hair after using it, except for when it is in my hair and doing what it is supposed to. No bad effects on the hair afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final opinion - good stuff that is great for straight or curly hair.you used it. I don&#x27;t notice any difference in my hair after using it, except for when it is in my hair and doing what it is supposed to. No bad effects on the hair afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final opinion - good stuff that is great for straight or curly hair.</li>
            <li> I think it might be the infusion of coconut oil that makes this product work so well. I&#x27;ve got hair that likes to be very curly one day and merely wavy the next...with a big side helping of frizz most of the rest of the time. I love John Frieda&#x27;s Secret Weapon and this product seems to be a step more, even. It&#x27;s not perfect, since my hair is temperamental and I&#x27;m impatient but it works very well battling that frizz, especially on those dry winter days.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell, and haven&#x27;t used it much because I felt it wasn&#x27;t really doing anything for my hair. I used the Shampoo that goes with it as well, and don&#x27;t like those either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several John Frieda products in the past and have had mixed results - his shampoos and conditioners are usually great, but his frizz products are iffy (some are a bit too oily). You&#x27;ll be happy to know this one is a cream, but you&#x27;ll need some patience with this one - it seems to build up and, at least for me, not produce immediate results. I&#x27;ve long, fine hair but a decent amount of it, colored and use heat tools, so I can definitely use something that supposedly forms a &#x27;protective lock&#x27; on hair and works with heat styled hair.&lt;br /&gt;I use two pumps since my hair is long, work it in from mid-shaft to the roots and... I&#x27;ll admit, the first time I tried it, nada. I even added another styling product before I applied the flat iron because it was still a bit frizzy and I was worried about my hair. Second wash? Still didn&#x27;t see much of a difference. It&#x27;s not until the third application that I&#x27;m finally seeing some real results. Not sure if it&#x27;s that I still need to tweak the amount I use (I&#x27;m leery about using more, though) or, as the product states &#x27;combats the porosity problem of frizzy hair by gradually building up hair&#x27;s frizz immunity with each use&#x27; and my hair is just more porous or something. So be aware that everyone&#x27;s hair might react a bit differently.</li>
            <li> John Frieda Frizz Ease Beyond Smooth Immunity Primer, 3.1 Fluid Ounce, is a super treat. I have been using John Frieda products for a while now, and this is one of my faves. It has a lovely coconut smell and keeps your hair in tip top condition for more than one day--you are going to look gorgeous. You hair will be smooth and pretty. Try it! I love it!</li>
            <li> I have tried the John Frieda Frizz Easy Beyond Smooth Immunity Primer.  The very first time I used it I had to say I was impressed with the softness of my hair as I was blow drying.  There was no doubt that it smoothed the shaft of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I often have used serums in my hair, I feel they do great jobs and have not found a cream that can replicate the same smooth feeling as the serums until now.  I was very surprised at the small amount of creme that I put in my hair actually did something.  The directions indicate you put one pump (more for very long hair) and rub into hair mid shaft. I did not put any creme at the top of my hair as sometimes I feel like I can get a greasy looking hair so I ALWAYS avoid the top with any product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My blow dry went well and I felt like I didn&#x27;t have to use my round barrel brush as much to smooth my hair out. (I have chin length bob)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very please with this product.  I felt like I had NO heavy product in my hair after my blow dry and at the end of the say my hair still remained smooth and frizz free.</li>
            <li> I am fairly pleased with  the results of the Frizz Ease.  I followed the directions and added to washed still damp hair and then styled.  (I am including a picture of the top my flat-ironed styled hair which is always the worst area for frizz for me.... I have naturally curly/wavy hair)  My results were as good as I get with my other &amp;#34;favorite products&amp;#34; so I would definitely add this one to my arsenal.  There are NO other styling products in my hair in this photo EXCEPT the Frizz Ease.  Normally I&#x27;d add hair spray and some other things but I wanted to see what would happen just using the one product, so knowing that... I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s pretty impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size of the bottle is small but for people who travel on planes they will like that the size is under 3.4 oz, and really it doesn&#x27;t take that much to do your hair so this small bottle will last awhile.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a week now and I&#x27;ve seen my hair get softer, more manageable and way less frizzy. Even on high humidity days. The cream is virtually scentless and very light feeling in my hair. I think it&#x27;s interesting how it gets better and better with use. I don&#x27;t know the science behind the product, but the proof for me has been in my hair. The curls are more defined and they don&#x27;t frizz out when I&#x27;m in a heated environment. I have noticed no static in my hair either. I had been a keratin leave-in treatment and as much as I have really liked that, I think I like this even more.</li>
            <li> I am growing out my thick, gray hair, and have trouble with some frizz and fly-away hair. On a recent trip to the southeastern US, the cold, dry air had my hair very frizzy. JF Frizz Ease helped for a while, but my hair quickly became frizzy again. In a less harsh climate (warm, 60% humidity) it works better and the effects last longer. So, it does work, although its effectiveness will vary with your particular hair type and circumstances. Frizz Ease does not have a strong smell, and the pump container is handy. But at nearly $22, it is rather pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Frizz-Ease serum forever--maybe 20-25 years? I just love it. I&#x27;ve got naturally wavy/curly hair, and despite trying just about every other product on the market, I go back to the serum. Sadly, this product is just another product on the market--I&#x27;ll stick with my serum. My hair was just as frizzy using this as not. It says you&#x27;ll see improvement in a week, and I&#x27;ve been using it for at least two weeks. No sign of improvement here. Since the serum is about 1/3 the price of this (seriously, I can&#x27;t believe how much they&#x27;re charging for this! $20+!) and works better, I see no reason to use it.</li>
            <li> I have soft, silky, straight hair that gets incredibly frizzy around my part at the top of my head. I was hoping that this product would be able to help with that. Unfortunately, I realized shortly after receiving the product that it would not work for me. The directions say to apply from the middle of the hair down to the ends and rub through. I guess if your frizz issue is at the bottom of your hair, then this would work for you. However, most people I know have frizz at the top of their heads. I wish it had given me this information on the Amazin page and I wouldn&#x27;t have ordered this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, I applied the product as instructed. It did not make my hair feel any different. It is not greasy or does not weight your hair down if used as directed. I can not attest to whether or not it helps with frizz since my hair isn&#x27;t frizzy at the ends. I would not recommend this product for people with hair like mine. However, if you have hair that is frizzy at the ends, it may be great for you</li>
            <li> I have thinning coarse wavy hair which often is frizzy (ok, is always frizzy unless I flat-iron my hair) and this product helped to tame some of the frizzies. I don&#x27;t really understand how it works from the inside out. It has a decent and not undesirable scent. A little bit goes a long way and it&#x27;s best to place it close to but not on the scalp. I will continue to use it since I have seen some difference to my hair but doesn&#x27;t leave that brittle heavy feel.</li>
            <li> I have mixed results with this product. It does tame my frizz and flyaways but also leaves a greasy look that makes my hair appear unwashed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have straight hair that tends to be frizzy and tangled up. The product has a cream-like consistency that is easy to dispense from the pump. It also has a pleasant scent that isn&#x27;t overwhelming and doesn&#x27;t linger. I followed the instructions and applied it to my just washed and towel dried (damp) hair, starting from the mid-shaft to the tips. It does tame the frizz and flyaways. Unfortunately, it also leaves my hair appear greasy and unwashed. I don&#x27;t like the greasy feel. This product is not for me.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and straight, but as I get older, it is getting more and more frizzy.  I have used a number of conditioners and styling products to try and tame the frizz, but none seem to do the job very well.  The John Frieda Frizz Ease has worked better than anything I&#x27;ve tried so far.  It says to put a small amount into your palm, then distribute evenly from mid-shaft to tips.  It says to apply to wet hair, but I towel dry it first.  I saw results the very first time I used it, and I have been using it 3-4 times per week and I can see a definite improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is that it does leave my hair feeling and looking pretty greasy by the end of the day.  My hair is naturally oily anyway, but on the days when I don&#x27;t use the Frizz Ease, my hair stays cleaner, longer, but the frizz is a little worse on those days, too.  If I make sure that I don&#x27;t apply the product to the roots (like the directions say), it does make it look less oily.  For me, it&#x27;s kind of a trade off.  The frizz really is bothersome and I would rather wash my hair daily than have it look dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> Not effective for my hair type. The silicone just sits on my hair and it seems drier after use. The temporary shine is not worth the dryness.</li>
            <li> John Frieda&#x27;s Frizz Ease Hair Serum is one of the items I&#x27;d want with me on a desert island (I&#x27;ve been using it for years and years and years and even subscribe to it here on Amazon so I never run out), but my hair stylist is always yelling at me about putting silicone in my hair (I forget why) so I jumped at the chance to try this non-silicone primer. I subbed it in for my usual Frizz Ease for about a week (I work it through wet hair and then wrap in a hair towel until ready to style), but it didn&#x27;t really have the same effect on my long, thick, curly/wavy hair. It basically just didn&#x27;t do what the other product does (i.e. prevent frizz). That being said, I see a lot of other positive reviews here and if there&#x27;s one thing I know about hair it&#x27;s that no one product is going to be right for everyone. So if you&#x27;re looking for an anti-frizz product, I&#x27;d definitely take this for a spin (and also the Frizz Ease Hair Serum).</li>
            <li> As a bit of background before I get started:  I am middle aged, have coarse thick hair which I color.  I live in New England and it is very cold and dry here.  I usually use a generic moroccan oil on my hair after washing it.  Also, I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day in this weather because it is just too drying.  My hair has a tendency to be frizzy, hot or cold, dry or humid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I applied the John Frieda Frizz Ease Beyond Smooth as directed, a small amount from &amp;#34;mid-shaft&amp;#34; to the end of my hair right after shampooing and am not pleased.  I think my hair is actually more frizzy than it would have been without the application of the product and I had to slap another product on my hair to keep the frizz down.</li>
            <li> If you were alive in the eighties, you&#x27;ll remember the old Frizz-Ease serum, which was silicone in a tiny, sticky bottle. This is a pretty noticeable improvement.  Used on naturally curly, wet hair with a little bit of a blow-dry, it creates piece-y, but not frizzy curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my incredibly frizzy, slightly-longer-than-shoulder-length hair, five pumps creates a no-shampoo sort of look, without actually being greasy. It&#x27;s a good way to create that particular trendy hairstyle without, um, actually not washing your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent isn&#x27;t offensive, either. Among hair serums, this doesn&#x27;t stand out--which is a good thing. It provides some curl control, without changing the texture of your hair. If you&#x27;re going for a curly style, without a strong scent or a lot of slip, this may be the way to go.</li>
            <li> Even though I have long hair, my current shampoo leaves me with fly-away hair. It&#x27;s especially bad on my bangs, so I though this \\&quot;frizz ease\\&quot; might help. I have a basic \\&quot;long, straight hair\\&quot; style, but this product claims to work with curly and wavy styles as well and is ok to use on hair styled with heat tools. I encountered nothing that made me doubt those claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use: \\&quot;Apply to wet hair. Dispense 1 pump into palm. Distribute evenly through hair from mid-shaft to tips. Use more or less depending on hair length and thickness. Do not rinse out. Style as desired.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least at first, it worked best for me to use this daily or every other day. It immediately helped to tame my fly-away hair without leaving any residue on my hair (that I noticed, anyway). After the first try, I found it easy to control how much I got per pump so I got amounts that were easy to work with. I applied it to the ends of my hair and my bangs. It reduced tangles and tamed my fly-away hair. I found it easiest to apply to damp rather than \\&quot;dripping wet\\&quot; hair. The fragrance is noticeable but not overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only disappointment was my impression from the advertising that coconut oil was the main ingredient of this product. Yet it appears to be only a minor ingredient. INGREDIENTS: Water, tricaprylin, cetearyl alcohol, glyceryl dilaurate, cetearet-20, behentrimonium chloride, diazolidinyl urea, propylene glycol, fragrance, disodium edta, cocos nucifera (coconut) oil, sodium hydroxide, iodopropynyl butylcarbamate.</li>
            <li> I have only used this a few times, but it is amazing!! Definetly recommend the shampoo &amp; conditioner</li>
            <li> It doeswhat you want a &amp;#34;Frizz Ease Smooth&amp;#34; product to do.  It makes your hair appear smoother and tamer after just one use. The product doesn&#x27;t have a smell and is clear in your hands.  It&#x27;s easy to apply and thin enough to get good coverage throughout your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just washed my hair and conditioned like normal and then used this product.  You do rinse it out.  It&#x27;s good stuff. Really like what it did for my hair. My hair looks smooth and in control...which is hard to do in Florida.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to say that this is a bad product because it does what it says it&#x27;ll do; it gets rid of frizz. But I really didn&#x27;t like the texture of my hair or how it curled after it dried. My hair just LOOKED awkward because of the product so I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ll be using it again sadly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Frizz Ease for years, as frizz is my number one hair problem.  I find this version extremely easy to use, since you just pump the bottle and use on your wet hair.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my hands feeling greasy either.  The smell is pleasant and doesn&#x27;t really last for people who prefer to add their own fragrance.  Thus, this product could also be used for men who have frizz.    My hair has been particularly frizzy this winter (admittedly, at part my own fault), but this product has stopped the issues.  In fact, this product states that, with regular use, frizz will decrease overall, and that DID happen for me!  :-)  When I run out, I would be happy to get this product again, at the full price here.</li>
            <li> John Frieda&#x27;s Beyond Smooth Frizz-Immunity Primer does what it purports to do--it serves as a base for other hair products, by decreasing frizz and making hair more manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product comes in an attractive silver-gray, 3.1 ounce bottle, with Frizz Ease&#x27;s trademark white on purple logo and some pink highlights.  The  cap is chromed plastic and the pump on top is Frizz-Ease purple.  The primer is easily pumped out of the bottle and is thin, like a light hand cream and has a very light and pleasant fruity odor.  It is easily applied to wet hair.  For short hair, a dime-sized amount is more than enough for coverage.  For my daughter&#x27;s longer hair (half way down her back), she required about a quarters worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The primer definitely gets rid of the frizz, making hair far more manageable.  As this product is meant to be a primer only, it does not add body to your hair, add shine, or aid in styling.  However, it definitely makes a big difference in terms of managing your hair, especially given the dryness of the winter weather and is a great starting point for adding additional hair products to change.  The product is very light and not oily, so it doesn&#x27;t add heaviness or greasiness to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the performs as promised.  It is not an all in one hair care solution, but is an excellent base for your other hair care products.</li>
            <li> Smells great and works even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it also on my bristle brush, to combat static,and it worked about as well as hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three strokes, and my hair goes smooth as a straightener. (without the heat)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great!</li>
            <li> The Frizz Ease Beyond Smooth hair product really tamed my frizzy hair.  I have long and fairly thick and wavy hair so I started with one squirt as directed.  I had to use a second one but I do suggest that you start with one as directed.  The product says that it will long term control frizzy hair with continued use but I am more likely to use it only when needed as my hair is frizzy in certain weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion had a nice soft floral fragrance and afterwards my hands felt as if I had used lotion on them.  As the product is for hair and not hands (and even specifically talks about being used on the hair shaft), I decided it would be best to wash the lotion off my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used other products by this company before and have liked them all.  Their products are a great quality and one that I don&#x27;t hesitate to recommend.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the light, nice scent when I apply this (it goes away quickly), and throughout the day can feel a bit of extra lightness in my hair, even after the first application.</li>
