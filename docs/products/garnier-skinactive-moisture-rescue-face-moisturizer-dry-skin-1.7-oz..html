            <li>This is a very nice product that I would have probably not bought had I not received a sample in the store.</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>but as of now I have found my perfect &amp;#34;no more acne&amp;#34; system.  </li>
            <li>this is a wonderful product and love the price too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s advertised as a &amp;#34;fruit water&amp;#34; and it smells pleasant.</li>
            <li>I also find the smell pleasant - it is not too perfumy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m one of the people who&#x27;s skin reacts really good to Garnier.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be fair.</li>
            <li>This is comparable to the Clinique Moisture Surge moisturizer but not quite as good.  </li>
            <li>I often get comments how good it</li>
            <li>and it smells good...</li>
            <li>And I loved it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I saw no moisture rescue or anything good about this product.</li>
            <li>A good value for a good product that does what it says--keeps my skin refreshed, and isn&#x27;t sticky.  </li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>Now if I can only find the perfect make up, I would have perfect skin lol</li>
            <li>Ladies, are you looking for that one exhilarating moisturizer you&#x27;ve been trying to get?</li>
            <li>it smells good works</li>
            <li>It works good, but not as close that I&#x27;d call it a dupe.</li>
            <li>good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>love the smell and it feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li>And I have to tell you this Garnier Skincare Moisture Gel is as good as many of them at a really fair Price.</li>
            <li>I dislike fragrance very much, so this is perfect for me and works well.</li>
            <li>Glad I found it again!</li>
            <li>I love keeping this in my fridge though!  </li>
            <li>and GEL much better than CREAM!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>No complaints, Love this product!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>first I wasn&#x27;t too impressed by this product, but I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks</li>
            <li>It has a light pleasant smell and feels so good on skin.</li>
            <li>It is very light and smells good.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>The price is just amazing when you are use to paying department store beauty counter prices.  </li>
            <li>It goes on light, is cooling, smells great and is not oily.  </li>
            <li>amazing</li>
            <li>Anyway, this product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Simply amazing.</li>
            <li>jelly and transparant, smells nice.</li>
            <li>My skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good in many years.</li>
            <li>This is also nice.</li>
            <li>They make my combination skin feel oily and kind of sticky, and they often break me out.</li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>Very nice.&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic seller.&lt;br /&gt;Everything is great!</li>
            <li>It feels nice going on</li>
            <li>kind of rolls off my face.</li>
            <li>Granted, Clinique Moisture Surge is the king of all moisturizers in my opinion, but this is a nice product in comparison to price.</li>
            <li>Contains many good ingredients for skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why there were so many people saying it smelled good.  </li>
            <li>It smells kind of fake-apple-y...</li>
            <li>I decided to purchase this gel based on another customers recommendation on another product and it was sooo worth trying out!!!</li>
            <li>which is good if you&#x27;re putting it under make up, has a strong floral smell.</li>
            <li>I loved the light gel consistency</li>
            <li>My old faithful cetaphil moisturizer is still perfect during the winter months, but leaves my skin shiny and oily during the warmer climate.  </li>
            <li>The gel leaves my skin feeling much more moisturized and the gel feels nice and refreshing.</li>
            <li>this one is the best so far :)</li>
            <li>At first, maybe wishful thinking, I thought this gel was great.</li>
            <li>This is the first product I&#x27;ve found that rivals the great moisturizing gels</li>
            <li>A very light texture.</li>
            <li>it helps wonderful for making my makup not dry an crack</li>
            <li>It did feel very nice the first use, so</li>
            <li>Love the gel feels very smooth.</li>
            <li>Of the different moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried, this is the one I like best.</li>
            <li>It is like a gel, so nice and light.  </li>
            <li>If I feel I need something heavier, I use Cetaphil on top of it.</li>
            <li>My skin is more suptle, glowing and healthier looking than it ever has been.</li>
            <li>The cream is more gel like, cooling and non scented</li>
            <li>when I opened I want sure if it was used or not.not sure</li>
            <li>love this face cream.</li>
            <li>But, it is refreshing.</li>
            <li>used to love it</li>
            <li>The first day I used this product my face felt amazing!</li>
            <li>, it give our skin more moisture for longer time.</li>
            <li>we have been using it more than 3 yrs.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>i bought this product to try out after using clinique&#x27;s moisture surge for many years.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff..</li>
            <li>and I really do love it.  </li>
            <li>I went from paying $100 every three months to about $10 and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>My favorite moisture regime for my face.</li>
            <li>love its  refreshing touch.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It is so refreshing.</li>
            <li>I am glad that I did.</li>
            <li>... and it does what it says it does: moisture rescue :)</li>
            <li>will buy more</li>
            <li>I love to use this every morning before I put my make up on.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>And you perceive a refreshing sensation after the application.</li>
            <li>I want to start by saying that I don&#x27;t think this product is entirely accurate in its own description.</li>
            <li>It really is refreshing.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m glad that Amazon carries it now.</li>
            <li>I love how it&#x27;s a gel</li>
            <li>within days i can see my face clearing up the touch of it to my skin feels like moisture bursting without that oily feel which i love.</li>
            <li>If you have facial skin problem this is one of the best i ever used.</li>
            <li>This is the best facial moisturizer I have ever used!</li>
            <li>This is so silky smooth!</li>
            <li>but I use it every night after washing my face and my face feels so much more hydrated.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer and hope it never discontinues.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Better price than in the store (get free shipping!)</li>
            <li>I love the feel of this when applying to my skin.</li>
            <li>It is very refreshing, almost like a cool splash of water.</li>
            <li>love garnier.</li>
            <li>love the gel feel.</li>
            <li>will be buying more of this brand from now on.</li>
            <li>The longer I use it the more I love it.</li>
            <li>Product is okay but leaves a yucky film on the skin.</li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t feel much more moisturized than I did before using it.</li>
            <li>:) I got the Timeless hyaluronic acid solution.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the most hydrating</li>
            <li>My skin is glowing and I don&#x27;t have as many breakouts.</li>
            <li>I love Garnier products.</li>
            <li>Love the cream.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I read something online that said this was a dupe of Clinique, so I thought it was a better price</li>
            <li>Nice light moisturizer for summer, smells like citrus.</li>
            <li>I have been using Garnier Skincare Moisture Rescue Refreshing Gel-Cream for about a week</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to have to pay X amount of money to be able to purchase this.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this will be minimized with makeup on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>, it is refreshing.</li>
            <li>I have terribly dry skin and that lotion was almost perfect.</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;d be perfect for people who just have slightly dry skin.</li>
            <li>paying a bit more is fine, 3) no SPF at all, and 4) the TYPE of container.</li>
            <li>It feels wonderful right as you put it on, but doesn&#x27;t last more than 10 minutes, so you may have to reapply once more depending on your skin type.</li>
            <li>It soaks up nicely and makes your skin feel so fresh and clean!</li>
            <li>Let me first say that this product is by far the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I love this product It feels so light on your face</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not used to using gel moisturizers but from what I&#x27;ve experienced so far</li>
            <li>I use this gel on top of my Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder Advanced Night Serum II at night, and then again by itself in the morning under all of my make up</li>
            <li>It is so light and feels so refreshing.</li>
            <li>This product sinks into my skin and feels great!</li>
            <li>It feels great on a hot day or right before bed.</li>
            <li>Easy, non greasy application and doesn&#x27;t itch or peel.</li>
            <li>Absorbs very quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue.</li>
            <li>I like that it is lightweight and absorbs easily into my skin.</li>
            <li>good moisturizer for dry skin; too light to handle winter dryness, but it&#x27;s good for summer.</li>
            <li>But I can&#x27;t find it in any stores around me, so ordering from Amazon works just fine for me.</li>
            <li>This feels light and airy and is so, so easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It applies really smoothly and sat under my makeup easily.</li>
            <li>love the way it makes my face feel smooth, moisturized, and cool</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cool and refreshing and so light.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all (more like gelly water) and soaks in relatively quickly.</li>
            <li>makes my face feel very nice, not dry.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the pink one moisturizes any better - both are great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, non greasy, and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I tend to have oily skin, but I use a really great deep cleansing face wash bar that requires me to use a really good moisturizer to stay clear</li>
            <li>But this cream-gel isn&#x27;t greasy, and can be used after you wash with acne cleanser and still leave your skin smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s light on the skin, yet leaves it smooth and silky, locking in moisture.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to have finally found something I can use for daytime.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy, fella light on my face.</li>
            <li>Really love the lightweight feel and fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>Skin feels fresh, healthy, and not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>Either works well for me, though neither is my primary moisturizer, but for one reason or another I&#x27;ll use one of them \\&quot;instead of \\&quot; or \\&quot;as</li>
            <li>The gel is light, and it moistures my face well.</li>
            <li>but so far I concur with all the good reviews.</li>
            <li>Very refreshing and perfect to use on hot nights when I don&#x27;t feel like using a thick moisturizer or night cream on my face.  </li>
            <li>I have to note that I haven&#x27;t found quite the right cleanser yet, so I&#x27;m sure that doesn&#x27;t help.  </li>
            <li>non grease cream gives skin fresh and cool especially on hot season.</li>
            <li>I use this stuff now whenever I need it;  I like it because it has almost no scent, and the little there is is very pleasant, not flowery or perfumey.  </li>
            <li>The best non-sticky/non-greasy moisturizer I&#x27;ve found for so little cost!</li>
            <li>Just received it and can say that it&#x27;s very good for dry skin, I put it on in the morning and my skin was still fresh looking in the evening.</li>
            <li>My new favorite moisturizer!</li>
            <li>This Gel-Cream is very soothing, melts into the skin quickly and smells nice too.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be fooled by the &amp;#34;for dry skin&amp;#34; label- this oil free moisturizer is great for oily skin too.</li>
            <li>shipping and came in original box.  </li>
            <li>Light, gel moisturizer quickly absorbed and feels great, especially under makeup.</li>
            <li>Love the light feel of this effective facial gel cream.</li>
            <li>Overall, this product with such a nice price has done a good job for me!</li>
            <li>Have sensitive skin and have tried all different kinds over the years; and this is the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>Great product for dry skin and works all day</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a clean smell but not too over powering.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, not sticky, absorbs quickly...</li>
            <li>Great for my dry oily skin</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>But it goes away pretty quickly after you apply it, and if you like the way their shampoo smells (I do :) ), it probably won&#x27;t bother you.</li>
            <li>The smell is very delish and it has a very light texture to it.</li>
            <li>I like this gel-cream, keep moisture and very comfortable , highly cost-effective product, I will buy again!</li>
            <li>Great for dry skin!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really moisturize at all was very sticky and even though I put a lot on it soaked in really fast and didn&#x27;t make my skin happy broke out from it</li>
            <li>Whatever is in this moisturizer is amazing, I might even go as far as to say this is a miracle product.</li>
            <li>It’s light on the skin with a fresh scent.</li>
            <li>( use Michael Todd&#x27;s true organic cleanser).</li>
            <li>It is light and quickly absorbed with no sticky feel.</li>
            <li>I loved that lotion, especially in the summer.</li>
            <li>This gel has a very cooling feel on the face, love that.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good buy, especially since it doesn&#x27;t contain parabens.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can feel the skin getting moisturized just like drinking cool water when thirsty.</li>
            <li>It is not a bad product, but I won&#x27;t switch any time soon.</li>
            <li>I even use it on areas that have been sunburned by accident and it helps tremendously.</li>
            <li>It has a light scent and it really makes my face so smooth and refreshed day and night.  </li>
            <li>In the hot climate, I feel like my skin dehydrates, and this refreshes, replenishes, and goes on light, COOL, and feels like it absorbs in a minute.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy and as it absorbs quickly you can use make-up inmediatly.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I found one.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and does not leave a sticky feeling.</li>
            <li>The gel absorbs quickly into the skin</li>
            <li>Non-greasy, and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>It goes on nice and cool and absorbs in completely and pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>So I have super sensitive skin that easily breaks out and flares up because I have systemic lupus, and this gel is so easy for my skin to tolerate.</li>
            <li>This is a first rate oil free antidote and a must have for anyone who needs to treat and cure skin depletions and replelish even levels of moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty light and doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate my skin</li>
            <li>It is a good product, but I am already spoiled by the other more intense moisturizing effect of the Ultra-Life.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and most products</li>
            <li>Garnier has another moisturizing gel very similar to this one (the green one) and if that one wasn&#x27;t quite enough moisture for you, but you liked that it felt nice and light, this is a great upgrade.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice, it feels very light but works really well with my dry skin.</li>
            <li>it is not expensive!</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t be a miracle worker on your first time, but with every day use, your dryness will disappear!</li>
            <li>The packaging is adorable and it&#x27;s the perfect size for on the go - not too big, not too small.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin, and i&#x27;ve been looking for good cream for a loong time ..</li>
            <li>Excellent buy for someone with sensitive skin and for little money.</li>
            <li>It goes on light yet makes my skin very supple.</li>
            <li>The green one was great</li>
            <li>It goes on light and spreads fast without a sticky feel.</li>
            <li>The product doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy on your skin, which I find especially important in the summertime.  </li>
            <li>I have an allergy to almost everything made for your face even the most sensitive products are an issue.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Anything that can save me a doctors visit is worth its weight in gold to me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>I like the fresh fruit scent.</li>
            <li>This is no where worth the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I finally found something (and cheap) that stopped my face from peeling.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about it having double the moisturizing of the other, but it&#x27;s certainly as good for sure!</li>
            <li>It has a light, fresh scent and is a great alternative to a much more expensive Olay Fresh Dew</li>
            <li>it even makes my makeup look fresh on my face.  </li>
            <li>has just the right amount of moisture for my skin.</li>
            <li>For a while I thought that my skin was just out of control until I realized I was not using the right product.  </li>
            <li>Definitely refreshing and effective during the past winter.</li>
            <li>(I have very sensitive, combination skin - Lucky me!).</li>
            <li>The gel is unique because it easily goes on wet but quickly dries and is absorbed.</li>
            <li>acne ingredients to avoid&amp;#34; and it great for my troubled skin.&lt;br /&gt;Cool, refreshing and lightweight.</li>
            <li>I really think if I remembered to put it on more frequently, it would solve my problem.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not thick and absorbs completely leaving my skin soft and surprisingly moisturized without a greasy feel.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gel-based formula goes on super light and refreshing, and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy in the summer heat.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Garnier!</li>
            <li>, we put serum first then this product and lotion</li>
            <li>I love it and wish I would become instantly younger again</li>
            <li>Be aware that this is a non-retunable product.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a moisturizer that wasn&#x27;t exactly a lotion</li>
            <li>My face looks radient, feels incredibly soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many differents and expensives brands for my facial care.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>So the extra bit of coldness is lovely.</li>
            <li>and you can really tell the difference!</li>
            <li>And it comes in a pretty glass jar.</li>
            <li>Threw it straight into the garbage!</li>
            <li>In addition, your moisturized complexion will show a healthy glow after several days of repeated applications.</li>
            <li>but I like to use it more like a calming lotion before my standard moisturizer.</li>
            <li>and I felt it was pretty pricey at almost $30.  </li>
            <li>I finally feel like I am able to glow instead of shine.  </li>
            <li>Ever since my skin changed from dry to combination a few years ago I have been struggling to find the perfect amount of moisture during the spring and summer months.  </li>
            <li>Inexpensive and a good moisturizer for my dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I used the other (normal skin) and loved it.</li>
            <li>It is exactly the way that rich hydration should feel- it noticeably enhances my skin&#x27;s moisture barrier without leaving a film, and it doesn&#x27;t clog or irritate my ridiculously sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The cucumber extracts are one of the main ingredients that make this moisturizer special because you&#x27;d feel a gentle and cooling effects once it&#x27;s applied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other versions of Garnier moisturizers before, and liked them, so</li>
            <li>After reading the review of this product, I finally made the purchase and for the most part, I really like this gel-creme moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I recently have started using on other places besides my face and it works great.</li>
            <li>The first time I applied it I thought that I must have used too much, and that was why it was sticky.  </li>
            <li>my skin is way more dry now.</li>
            <li>love this moisturizer i have dry skin</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant delicate floral (lily-of-the-valley, I think) scent.</li>
            <li>Has a nice light texture, wasn&#x27;t worried at all about it breaking me out, it is pretty thin and watery</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to receiving this product because it is amazing and works well on my sensitive and dry skin, leaving it moist.</li>
            <li>They responded very quickly to my comment above and sent me a new one (not broken this time) within 2 days!</li>
            <li>I was already a huge fan of the regular strength gel, and gave this a try.</li>
            <li>This gel is light and has a much lighter sent than the blue moisturizing gel from Garnier.</li>
            <li>I really like this face moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I was ready to go to the doctor for to get help.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s very lightweight, watery</li>
            <li>i REALLY like this rescue remedy.</li>
            <li>Will keep buying it, feel clear and fresh after using.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much to apply over your face and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m a straight guy.</li>
            <li>I am ordering something else that really works.</li>
            <li>and it absorbs really well.  </li>
            <li>Not only that, this product is oil free and non-comedogenic</li>
            <li>It really soaks into ur skin the moment u put it on ur face</li>
            <li>this might be too much for you</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing without being greasy or sticky.  </li>
            <li>I really, REALLY wish that these was zero fragrance</li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I really like this moisturizer and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>soaks in fast and has improved my skin since I started using this line a month ago.</li>
            <li>I did so very sparingly</li>
            <li>only issue I can think of is that this isn&#x27;t the most hygienic way to package a product like this since you have to put your fingers directly into it.</li>
            <li>absorb instantly and make my skin soft, smells lovely</li>
            <li>have normal skin, but the winter completely destroys it, leaving it super, super, super dry.</li>
            <li>Gets rid of my dark circles under my eyes absolute love.</li>
            <li>The first time I received the other ones, they arrived just fine.</li>
            <li>Ok, i am 36yo with dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s by far my favorite drugstore moisturizer, and close to my all-time favorite just behind Clinique&#x27;s gel.</li>
            <li>None of my regular moisturizers had any effect on my peeling skin but after only one use of this gel I could tell a huge difference!</li>
            <li>This is also great all year round and in the summer time once this sinks in it will not &amp;#34;sweat out&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Love this product and you can&#x27;t beat the amazon price of less than 6$.This</li>
            <li>This is so calming and comfortable on my dry, irritated skin.</li>
            <li>and I felt it provided decent moisture.</li>
            <li>I even just touched my cheek and found it to be so soft and smooth even though I haven&#x27;t applied this since last night.  </li>
            <li>but I definitely had to buy double pack better.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t think I even got enough on to adequately cover my face</li>
            <li>I highly recomend trying this out.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>but if you apply a bit more than a little drop it gets sticky and feels like a film on your face.</li>
            <li>This is the only moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever loved, and the only one I will ever use for as long as they keep making it (please don&#x27;t ever stop making it!!).</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin and thought this would be great as an add on to my usual creams</li>
            <li>This is a light moisturizer, it is not what I expected.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that this was very inexpensive, seeing as though it&#x27;s garnier.</li>
            <li>This gel is very soothing on sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more penetrating than the green gel-cream from what I remember plus</li>
            <li>Its normal with an oily t zone</li>
            <li>I like their green formula better.</li>
            <li>normally use Clinique Moisture Surge and someone recommended this moisturizer as an inexpensive alternative.</li>
            <li>I have normal skin</li>
            <li>Will try this one once I finish using the cream for normal skin.</li>
            <li>The scent was very mild, and the gel texture did make it feel refreshing, but it was useless to me as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I put multiple drops right into my Garnier gel cream and it enhanced it&#x27;s effectiveness 10 fold.</li>
            <li>Not for me but price cheap than other cause</li>
            <li>/&gt;*Received a new one.</li>
            <li>It sinks in deep into the skin and your face stays hydrated most of the day.</li>
            <li>But if anybody has very sensitive skin like me, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have no issues with this.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>or you can put lotion first or later</li>
            <li>I went through an entire package of the regular Refreshing Gel-Cream earlier this month.</li>
            <li>My face feels so soft!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so so light, not greasy in the least, and after you apply it, it almost feels like you didn&#x27;t use any product at all, like your skin is just naturally hydrated and fresh, if that makes sense.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how it got so many</li>
            <li>product feels like spreading cool water on your face, except it sinks in and stays with you.</li>
            <li>Very soothing in the hot dry Arizona air!</li>
            <li>I think are the most common \\&quot;light\\&quot; facial lotions, and this is much lighter and feels much cleaner.</li>
            <li>Not sticky or heavy and goes on smooth and feels dry quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since purchased Aveeno Positively Radient Skin Daily Moisturizer</li>
            <li>In my opinion, this version has more staying power than the normal (green version) of the same.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly, which is great if you hate a lotion feel.</li>
            <li>Your inner pores will get the healthy benefits of receiving natural nutrients and your overall facial lines will be barely noticable.</li>
            <li>helpful please feel free to click that little button.</li>
            <li>Something transparent and clear works for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have no idea if it really works as I haven&#x27;t noticed that I look 10 or 20 years younger.</li>
            <li>Nivea Soft</li>
            <li>Oh and it burns when applying after washing the face with gentle regular cleanser</li>
            <li>really can&#x27;t recommend this highly enough</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>so I as surprised by this.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and I did not have any irritation.</li>
            <li>but what i do know is it makes my face and hands incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This does not have a burning sensation like some do on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Plus it conquers winter dryness and early signs of wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how well it worked without leaving my skin greasy.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how well this cream moisturizes, you won&#x27;t find anything close for the money....</li>
            <li>I find that it is a light moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t go on feeling thick or heavy as so many moisturizers do.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s way more moisturing than the green one which is for regular skin.</li>
            <li>Worth trying for the price, but I think I will buy something different next time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this exciting product to anyone who needs extra extra moisturizing and protection to mend all blemished and unbalanced skin types.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t take long to dry.  </li>
            <li>I can tell you in so many words how this tiny jar has saved and spared my face from skin deterioration and other infractions related to unkind outdoor impurites.</li>
            <li>but it can get pretty dry in the summer</li>
            <li>It really did not do much for my dry skin either, even when I tried applying multiple times per day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also noted that it&#x27;s so safe you can even apply small amounts of gel under your eyes to ease puffiness and deep linings.</li>
            <li>1.7oz. will last a long time, as only a small dab is needed to cover a good sized area.</li>
            <li>gel feels a bit different than creams, but it sinks in quickly.</li>
            <li>I am very particular on what products I use as my skin is sensitive and very dry.</li>
            <li>Garnier also makes a green gel cream like this that is for normal skin - the pink is formulated for dry skin, but to be honest I can&#x27;t tell the difference -</li>
            <li>but i wanted something new ( who doesnt from time to time), so i decided to give it a try , especially  because of its gel formula.</li>
            <li>It really fights the dry skin</li>
            <li>The skin on my face is so dry, but this stuff really works for me.</li>
            <li>I GAVE THIS TO A FRIEND ,SHE REALLY HAS DRY SKIN .SEEMS</li>
            <li>This product works very well for extremely dry skin.  </li>
            <li>bought both dry skin and normal/combo skin and dont see much difference.</li>
            <li>and my dry skin stays moisturized for the whole day.  </li>
            <li>It is a gel which I like because I am not fond of heavy creams that do not absorb quickly.</li>
            <li>Redness, major flaking, etc</li>
            <li>it fits very well for dry skin!</li>
            <li>I generally don&#x27;t leave feedback, but I felt I needed to speak my mind.  </li>
            <li>is that this product is fast drying (which I like) but not all that moisturizing like I expected.</li>
            <li>I purchased this mainly because of some severely dry skin I have been having.</li>
            <li>I changed up the routine, applying this gel directly out of the shower, prepare for work, then applying another layer before I applied my makeup –- an hour later –– DULL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>mostly, i was tired of paying 50 dollars a jar for clinique&#x27;s product.</li>
            <li>It is ok, but not great.  </li>
            <li>Works OKAY, but this tiny little tub didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>This did not last very long, and it didn&#x27;t really help my skin...</li>
            <li>I always have such dry skin in the winter, and this truly kept my face moisturized though out the whole day.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend for very dry skin, but this works for all skin types as well because it is not greasy.</li>
            <li>I keep a jar of the regular \\&quot;Moisture Renew\\&quot; (green gel) around as it does what it says and is so economical.</li>
            <li>I normally do not write reviews on here but for this particular product I felt it was necessary.</li>
            <li>In my family, my two daughter and I all using this product, I have dry skin 50 yrs old and one of my daughter 21 yrs old has dry skin and younger daughter 18 yrs old</li>
            <li>(african black soap...no really).  </li>
            <li>As far as the purpose of this gel, I didn&#x27;t think it moisturized my very dry skin at all.</li>
            <li>I have very dry sensitive skin in the winter.  </li>
            <li>No matter how little or how much I use it leaves a sticky film on he skin.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;m one of the people who&#x27;s skin reacts really good to Garnier.</li>

            <li> This is comparable to the Clinique Moisture Surge moisturizer but not quite as good.  </li>
            <li> I often get comments how good it</li>
            <li> and it smells good...</li>
            <li> And I loved it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I saw no moisture rescue or anything good about this product.</li>
            <li> A good value for a good product that does what it says--keeps my skin refreshed, and isn&#x27;t sticky.  </li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Good price.</li>
            <li> Now if I can only find the perfect make up, I would have perfect skin lol</li>
            <li> Ladies, are you looking for that one exhilarating moisturizer you&#x27;ve been trying to get?</li>
            <li> it smells good works</li>
            <li> It works good, but not as close that I&#x27;d call it a dupe.</li>
            <li> good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> love the smell and it feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li> And I have to tell you this Garnier Skincare Moisture Gel is as good as many of them at a really fair Price.</li>
            <li> I dislike fragrance very much, so this is perfect for me and works well.</li>
            <li> Glad I found it again!</li>
            <li> I love keeping this in my fridge though!  </li>
            <li> and GEL much better than CREAM!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> No complaints, Love this product!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> first I wasn&#x27;t too impressed by this product, but I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks</li>
            <li> It has a light pleasant smell and feels so good on skin.</li>
            <li> It is very light and smells good.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> The price is just amazing when you are use to paying department store beauty counter prices.  </li>
            <li> It goes on light, is cooling, smells great and is not oily.  </li>
            <li> amazing</li>
            <li> Anyway, this product is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Simply amazing.</li>
            <li> jelly and transparant, smells nice.</li>
            <li> My skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good in many years.</li>
            <li> This is also nice.</li>
            <li> They make my combination skin feel oily and kind of sticky, and they often break me out.</li>
            <li> Nice.</li>
            <li> Very nice.&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic seller.&lt;br /&gt;Everything is great!</li>
            <li> It feels nice going on</li>
            <li> kind of rolls off my face.</li>
            <li> Granted, Clinique Moisture Surge is the king of all moisturizers in my opinion, but this is a nice product in comparison to price.</li>
            <li> Contains many good ingredients for skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why there were so many people saying it smelled good.  </li>
            <li> It smells kind of fake-apple-y...</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this gel based on another customers recommendation on another product and it was sooo worth trying out!!!</li>
            <li> which is good if you&#x27;re putting it under make up, has a strong floral smell.</li>
            <li> I loved the light gel consistency</li>
            <li> My old faithful cetaphil moisturizer is still perfect during the winter months, but leaves my skin shiny and oily during the warmer climate.  </li>
            <li> The gel leaves my skin feeling much more moisturized and the gel feels nice and refreshing.</li>
            <li> this one is the best so far :)</li>
            <li> At first, maybe wishful thinking, I thought this gel was great.</li>
            <li> This is the first product I&#x27;ve found that rivals the great moisturizing gels</li>
            <li> A very light texture.</li>
            <li> it helps wonderful for making my makup not dry an crack</li>
            <li> It did feel very nice the first use, so</li>
            <li> Love the gel feels very smooth.</li>
            <li> Of the different moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried, this is the one I like best.</li>
            <li> It is like a gel, so nice and light.  </li>
            <li> If I feel I need something heavier, I use Cetaphil on top of it.</li>
            <li> My skin is more suptle, glowing and healthier looking than it ever has been.</li>
            <li> The cream is more gel like, cooling and non scented</li>
            <li> when I opened I want sure if it was used or not.not sure</li>
            <li> love this face cream.</li>
            <li> But, it is refreshing.</li>
            <li> used to love it</li>
            <li> The first day I used this product my face felt amazing!</li>
            <li> , it give our skin more moisture for longer time.</li>
            <li> we have been using it more than 3 yrs.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> i bought this product to try out after using clinique&#x27;s moisture surge for many years.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff..</li>
            <li> and I really do love it.  </li>
            <li> I went from paying $100 every three months to about $10 and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> My favorite moisture regime for my face.</li>
            <li> love its  refreshing touch.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It is so refreshing.</li>
            <li> I am glad that I did.</li>
            <li> ... and it does what it says it does: moisture rescue :)</li>
            <li> will buy more</li>
            <li> I love to use this every morning before I put my make up on.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> And you perceive a refreshing sensation after the application.</li>
            <li> I want to start by saying that I don&#x27;t think this product is entirely accurate in its own description.</li>
            <li> It really is refreshing.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m glad that Amazon carries it now.</li>
            <li> I love how it&#x27;s a gel</li>
            <li> within days i can see my face clearing up the touch of it to my skin feels like moisture bursting without that oily feel which i love.</li>
            <li> If you have facial skin problem this is one of the best i ever used.</li>
            <li> This is the best facial moisturizer I have ever used!</li>
            <li> This is so silky smooth!</li>
            <li> but I use it every night after washing my face and my face feels so much more hydrated.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer and hope it never discontinues.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Better price than in the store (get free shipping!)</li>
            <li> I love the feel of this when applying to my skin.</li>
            <li> It is very refreshing, almost like a cool splash of water.</li>
            <li> love garnier.</li>
            <li> love the gel feel.</li>
            <li> will be buying more of this brand from now on.</li>
            <li> The longer I use it the more I love it.</li>
            <li> Product is okay but leaves a yucky film on the skin.</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t feel much more moisturized than I did before using it.</li>
            <li> :) I got the Timeless hyaluronic acid solution.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the most hydrating</li>
            <li> My skin is glowing and I don&#x27;t have as many breakouts.</li>
            <li> I love Garnier products.</li>
            <li> Love the cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I read something online that said this was a dupe of Clinique, so I thought it was a better price</li>
            <li> Nice light moisturizer for summer, smells like citrus.</li>
            <li> I have been using Garnier Skincare Moisture Rescue Refreshing Gel-Cream for about a week</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to have to pay X amount of money to be able to purchase this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this will be minimized with makeup on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.</li>
            <li> , it is refreshing.</li>
            <li> I have terribly dry skin and that lotion was almost perfect.</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;d be perfect for people who just have slightly dry skin.</li>
            <li> paying a bit more is fine, 3) no SPF at all, and 4) the TYPE of container.</li>
            <li> It feels wonderful right as you put it on, but doesn&#x27;t last more than 10 minutes, so you may have to reapply once more depending on your skin type.</li>
            <li> It soaks up nicely and makes your skin feel so fresh and clean!</li>
            <li> Let me first say that this product is by far the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I love this product It feels so light on your face</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not used to using gel moisturizers but from what I&#x27;ve experienced so far</li>
            <li> I use this gel on top of my Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder Advanced Night Serum II at night, and then again by itself in the morning under all of my make up</li>
            <li> It is so light and feels so refreshing.</li>
            <li> This product sinks into my skin and feels great!</li>
            <li> It feels great on a hot day or right before bed.</li>
            <li> Easy, non greasy application and doesn&#x27;t itch or peel.</li>
            <li> Absorbs very quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue.</li>
            <li> I like that it is lightweight and absorbs easily into my skin.</li>
            <li> good moisturizer for dry skin; too light to handle winter dryness, but it&#x27;s good for summer.</li>
            <li> But I can&#x27;t find it in any stores around me, so ordering from Amazon works just fine for me.</li>
            <li> This feels light and airy and is so, so easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It applies really smoothly and sat under my makeup easily.</li>
            <li> love the way it makes my face feel smooth, moisturized, and cool</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cool and refreshing and so light.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all (more like gelly water) and soaks in relatively quickly.</li>
            <li> makes my face feel very nice, not dry.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the pink one moisturizes any better - both are great.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, non greasy, and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I tend to have oily skin, but I use a really great deep cleansing face wash bar that requires me to use a really good moisturizer to stay clear</li>
            <li> But this cream-gel isn&#x27;t greasy, and can be used after you wash with acne cleanser and still leave your skin smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s light on the skin, yet leaves it smooth and silky, locking in moisture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to have finally found something I can use for daytime.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy, fella light on my face.</li>
            <li> Really love the lightweight feel and fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> Skin feels fresh, healthy, and not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> Either works well for me, though neither is my primary moisturizer, but for one reason or another I&#x27;ll use one of them \\&quot;instead of \\&quot; or \\&quot;as</li>
            <li> The gel is light, and it moistures my face well.</li>
            <li> but so far I concur with all the good reviews.</li>
            <li> Very refreshing and perfect to use on hot nights when I don&#x27;t feel like using a thick moisturizer or night cream on my face.  </li>
            <li> I have to note that I haven&#x27;t found quite the right cleanser yet, so I&#x27;m sure that doesn&#x27;t help.  </li>
            <li> non grease cream gives skin fresh and cool especially on hot season.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff now whenever I need it;  I like it because it has almost no scent, and the little there is is very pleasant, not flowery or perfumey.  </li>
            <li> The best non-sticky/non-greasy moisturizer I&#x27;ve found for so little cost!</li>
            <li> Just received it and can say that it&#x27;s very good for dry skin, I put it on in the morning and my skin was still fresh looking in the evening.</li>
            <li> My new favorite moisturizer!</li>
            <li> This Gel-Cream is very soothing, melts into the skin quickly and smells nice too.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the &amp;#34;for dry skin&amp;#34; label- this oil free moisturizer is great for oily skin too.</li>
            <li> shipping and came in original box.  </li>
            <li> Light, gel moisturizer quickly absorbed and feels great, especially under makeup.</li>
            <li> Love the light feel of this effective facial gel cream.</li>
            <li> Overall, this product with such a nice price has done a good job for me!</li>
            <li> Have sensitive skin and have tried all different kinds over the years; and this is the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Great product for dry skin and works all day</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a clean smell but not too over powering.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, not sticky, absorbs quickly...</li>
            <li> Great for my dry oily skin</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li> But it goes away pretty quickly after you apply it, and if you like the way their shampoo smells (I do :) ), it probably won&#x27;t bother you.</li>
            <li> The smell is very delish and it has a very light texture to it.</li>
            <li> I like this gel-cream, keep moisture and very comfortable , highly cost-effective product, I will buy again!</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really moisturize at all was very sticky and even though I put a lot on it soaked in really fast and didn&#x27;t make my skin happy broke out from it</li>
            <li> Whatever is in this moisturizer is amazing, I might even go as far as to say this is a miracle product.</li>
            <li> It’s light on the skin with a fresh scent.</li>
            <li> ( use Michael Todd&#x27;s true organic cleanser).</li>
            <li> It is light and quickly absorbed with no sticky feel.</li>
            <li> I loved that lotion, especially in the summer.</li>
            <li> This gel has a very cooling feel on the face, love that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good buy, especially since it doesn&#x27;t contain parabens.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can feel the skin getting moisturized just like drinking cool water when thirsty.</li>
            <li> It is not a bad product, but I won&#x27;t switch any time soon.</li>
            <li> I even use it on areas that have been sunburned by accident and it helps tremendously.</li>
            <li> It has a light scent and it really makes my face so smooth and refreshed day and night.  </li>
            <li> In the hot climate, I feel like my skin dehydrates, and this refreshes, replenishes, and goes on light, COOL, and feels like it absorbs in a minute.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy and as it absorbs quickly you can use make-up inmediatly.</li>
            <li> Luckily, I found one.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly and does not leave a sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> The gel absorbs quickly into the skin</li>
            <li> Non-greasy, and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> It goes on nice and cool and absorbs in completely and pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> So I have super sensitive skin that easily breaks out and flares up because I have systemic lupus, and this gel is so easy for my skin to tolerate.</li>
            <li> This is a first rate oil free antidote and a must have for anyone who needs to treat and cure skin depletions and replelish even levels of moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty light and doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate my skin</li>
            <li> It is a good product, but I am already spoiled by the other more intense moisturizing effect of the Ultra-Life.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and most products</li>
            <li> Garnier has another moisturizing gel very similar to this one (the green one) and if that one wasn&#x27;t quite enough moisture for you, but you liked that it felt nice and light, this is a great upgrade.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice, it feels very light but works really well with my dry skin.</li>
            <li> it is not expensive!</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t be a miracle worker on your first time, but with every day use, your dryness will disappear!</li>
            <li> The packaging is adorable and it&#x27;s the perfect size for on the go - not too big, not too small.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, and i&#x27;ve been looking for good cream for a loong time ..</li>
            <li> Excellent buy for someone with sensitive skin and for little money.</li>
            <li> It goes on light yet makes my skin very supple.</li>
            <li> The green one was great</li>
            <li> It goes on light and spreads fast without a sticky feel.</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy on your skin, which I find especially important in the summertime.  </li>
            <li> I have an allergy to almost everything made for your face even the most sensitive products are an issue.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Anything that can save me a doctors visit is worth its weight in gold to me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> I like the fresh fruit scent.</li>
            <li> This is no where worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I finally found something (and cheap) that stopped my face from peeling.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about it having double the moisturizing of the other, but it&#x27;s certainly as good for sure!</li>
            <li> It has a light, fresh scent and is a great alternative to a much more expensive Olay Fresh Dew</li>
            <li> it even makes my makeup look fresh on my face.  </li>
            <li> has just the right amount of moisture for my skin.</li>
            <li> For a while I thought that my skin was just out of control until I realized I was not using the right product.  </li>
            <li> Definitely refreshing and effective during the past winter.</li>
            <li> (I have very sensitive, combination skin - Lucky me!).</li>
            <li> The gel is unique because it easily goes on wet but quickly dries and is absorbed.</li>
            <li> acne ingredients to avoid&amp;#34; and it great for my troubled skin.&lt;br /&gt;Cool, refreshing and lightweight.</li>
            <li> I really think if I remembered to put it on more frequently, it would solve my problem.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not thick and absorbs completely leaving my skin soft and surprisingly moisturized without a greasy feel.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gel-based formula goes on super light and refreshing, and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy in the summer heat.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Garnier!</li>
            <li> , we put serum first then this product and lotion</li>
            <li> I love it and wish I would become instantly younger again</li>
            <li> Be aware that this is a non-retunable product.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a moisturizer that wasn&#x27;t exactly a lotion</li>
            <li> My face looks radient, feels incredibly soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many differents and expensives brands for my facial care.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> So the extra bit of coldness is lovely.</li>
            <li> and you can really tell the difference!</li>
            <li> And it comes in a pretty glass jar.</li>
            <li> Threw it straight into the garbage!</li>
            <li> In addition, your moisturized complexion will show a healthy glow after several days of repeated applications.</li>
            <li> but I like to use it more like a calming lotion before my standard moisturizer.</li>
            <li> and I felt it was pretty pricey at almost $30.  </li>
            <li> I finally feel like I am able to glow instead of shine.  </li>
            <li> Ever since my skin changed from dry to combination a few years ago I have been struggling to find the perfect amount of moisture during the spring and summer months.  </li>
            <li> Inexpensive and a good moisturizer for my dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I used the other (normal skin) and loved it.</li>
            <li> It is exactly the way that rich hydration should feel- it noticeably enhances my skin&#x27;s moisture barrier without leaving a film, and it doesn&#x27;t clog or irritate my ridiculously sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The cucumber extracts are one of the main ingredients that make this moisturizer special because you&#x27;d feel a gentle and cooling effects once it&#x27;s applied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other versions of Garnier moisturizers before, and liked them, so</li>
            <li> After reading the review of this product, I finally made the purchase and for the most part, I really like this gel-creme moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I recently have started using on other places besides my face and it works great.</li>
            <li> The first time I applied it I thought that I must have used too much, and that was why it was sticky.  </li>
            <li> my skin is way more dry now.</li>
            <li> love this moisturizer i have dry skin</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant delicate floral (lily-of-the-valley, I think) scent.</li>
            <li> Has a nice light texture, wasn&#x27;t worried at all about it breaking me out, it is pretty thin and watery</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to receiving this product because it is amazing and works well on my sensitive and dry skin, leaving it moist.</li>
            <li> They responded very quickly to my comment above and sent me a new one (not broken this time) within 2 days!</li>
            <li> I was already a huge fan of the regular strength gel, and gave this a try.</li>
            <li> This gel is light and has a much lighter sent than the blue moisturizing gel from Garnier.</li>
            <li> I really like this face moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I was ready to go to the doctor for to get help.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s very lightweight, watery</li>
            <li> i REALLY like this rescue remedy.</li>
            <li> Will keep buying it, feel clear and fresh after using.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much to apply over your face and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a straight guy.</li>
            <li> I am ordering something else that really works.</li>
            <li> and it absorbs really well.  </li>
            <li> Not only that, this product is oil free and non-comedogenic</li>
            <li> It really soaks into ur skin the moment u put it on ur face</li>
            <li> this might be too much for you</li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing without being greasy or sticky.  </li>
            <li> I really, REALLY wish that these was zero fragrance</li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I really like this moisturizer and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> soaks in fast and has improved my skin since I started using this line a month ago.</li>
            <li> I did so very sparingly</li>
            <li> only issue I can think of is that this isn&#x27;t the most hygienic way to package a product like this since you have to put your fingers directly into it.</li>
            <li> absorb instantly and make my skin soft, smells lovely</li>
            <li> have normal skin, but the winter completely destroys it, leaving it super, super, super dry.</li>
            <li> Gets rid of my dark circles under my eyes absolute love.</li>
            <li> The first time I received the other ones, they arrived just fine.</li>
            <li> Ok, i am 36yo with dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s by far my favorite drugstore moisturizer, and close to my all-time favorite just behind Clinique&#x27;s gel.</li>
            <li> None of my regular moisturizers had any effect on my peeling skin but after only one use of this gel I could tell a huge difference!</li>
            <li> This is also great all year round and in the summer time once this sinks in it will not &amp;#34;sweat out&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Love this product and you can&#x27;t beat the amazon price of less than 6$.This</li>
            <li> This is so calming and comfortable on my dry, irritated skin.</li>
            <li> and I felt it provided decent moisture.</li>
            <li> I even just touched my cheek and found it to be so soft and smooth even though I haven&#x27;t applied this since last night.  </li>
            <li> but I definitely had to buy double pack better.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t think I even got enough on to adequately cover my face</li>
            <li> I highly recomend trying this out.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> but if you apply a bit more than a little drop it gets sticky and feels like a film on your face.</li>
            <li> This is the only moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever loved, and the only one I will ever use for as long as they keep making it (please don&#x27;t ever stop making it!!).</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and thought this would be great as an add on to my usual creams</li>
            <li> This is a light moisturizer, it is not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that this was very inexpensive, seeing as though it&#x27;s garnier.</li>
            <li> This gel is very soothing on sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more penetrating than the green gel-cream from what I remember plus</li>
            <li> Its normal with an oily t zone</li>
            <li> I like their green formula better.</li>
            <li> normally use Clinique Moisture Surge and someone recommended this moisturizer as an inexpensive alternative.</li>
            <li> I have normal skin</li>
            <li> Will try this one once I finish using the cream for normal skin.</li>
            <li> The scent was very mild, and the gel texture did make it feel refreshing, but it was useless to me as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I put multiple drops right into my Garnier gel cream and it enhanced it&#x27;s effectiveness 10 fold.</li>
            <li> Not for me but price cheap than other cause</li>
            <li> /&gt;*Received a new one.</li>
            <li> It sinks in deep into the skin and your face stays hydrated most of the day.</li>
            <li> But if anybody has very sensitive skin like me, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have no issues with this.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> or you can put lotion first or later</li>
            <li> I went through an entire package of the regular Refreshing Gel-Cream earlier this month.</li>
            <li> My face feels so soft!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so so light, not greasy in the least, and after you apply it, it almost feels like you didn&#x27;t use any product at all, like your skin is just naturally hydrated and fresh, if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it got so many</li>
            <li> product feels like spreading cool water on your face, except it sinks in and stays with you.</li>
            <li> Very soothing in the hot dry Arizona air!</li>
            <li> I think are the most common \\&quot;light\\&quot; facial lotions, and this is much lighter and feels much cleaner.</li>
            <li> Not sticky or heavy and goes on smooth and feels dry quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since purchased Aveeno Positively Radient Skin Daily Moisturizer</li>
            <li> In my opinion, this version has more staying power than the normal (green version) of the same.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly, which is great if you hate a lotion feel.</li>
            <li> Your inner pores will get the healthy benefits of receiving natural nutrients and your overall facial lines will be barely noticable.</li>
            <li> helpful please feel free to click that little button.</li>
            <li> Something transparent and clear works for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have no idea if it really works as I haven&#x27;t noticed that I look 10 or 20 years younger.</li>
            <li> Nivea Soft</li>
            <li> Oh and it burns when applying after washing the face with gentle regular cleanser</li>
            <li> really can&#x27;t recommend this highly enough</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> so I as surprised by this.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and I did not have any irritation.</li>
            <li> but what i do know is it makes my face and hands incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This does not have a burning sensation like some do on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Plus it conquers winter dryness and early signs of wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how well it worked without leaving my skin greasy.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how well this cream moisturizes, you won&#x27;t find anything close for the money....</li>
            <li> I find that it is a light moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t go on feeling thick or heavy as so many moisturizers do.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s way more moisturing than the green one which is for regular skin.</li>
            <li> Worth trying for the price, but I think I will buy something different next time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this exciting product to anyone who needs extra extra moisturizing and protection to mend all blemished and unbalanced skin types.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t take long to dry.  </li>
            <li> I can tell you in so many words how this tiny jar has saved and spared my face from skin deterioration and other infractions related to unkind outdoor impurites.</li>
            <li> but it can get pretty dry in the summer</li>
            <li> It really did not do much for my dry skin either, even when I tried applying multiple times per day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also noted that it&#x27;s so safe you can even apply small amounts of gel under your eyes to ease puffiness and deep linings.</li>
            <li> 1.7oz. will last a long time, as only a small dab is needed to cover a good sized area.</li>
            <li> gel feels a bit different than creams, but it sinks in quickly.</li>
            <li> I am very particular on what products I use as my skin is sensitive and very dry.</li>
            <li> Garnier also makes a green gel cream like this that is for normal skin - the pink is formulated for dry skin, but to be honest I can&#x27;t tell the difference -</li>
            <li> but i wanted something new ( who doesnt from time to time), so i decided to give it a try , especially  because of its gel formula.</li>
            <li> It really fights the dry skin</li>
            <li> The skin on my face is so dry, but this stuff really works for me.</li>
            <li> I GAVE THIS TO A FRIEND ,SHE REALLY HAS DRY SKIN .SEEMS</li>
            <li> This product works very well for extremely dry skin.  </li>
            <li> bought both dry skin and normal/combo skin and dont see much difference.</li>
            <li> and my dry skin stays moisturized for the whole day.  </li>
            <li> It is a gel which I like because I am not fond of heavy creams that do not absorb quickly.</li>
            <li> Redness, major flaking, etc</li>
            <li> it fits very well for dry skin!</li>
            <li> I generally don&#x27;t leave feedback, but I felt I needed to speak my mind.  </li>
            <li> is that this product is fast drying (which I like) but not all that moisturizing like I expected.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mainly because of some severely dry skin I have been having.</li>
            <li> I changed up the routine, applying this gel directly out of the shower, prepare for work, then applying another layer before I applied my makeup –- an hour later –– DULL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> mostly, i was tired of paying 50 dollars a jar for clinique&#x27;s product.</li>
            <li> It is ok, but not great.  </li>
            <li> Works OKAY, but this tiny little tub didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> This did not last very long, and it didn&#x27;t really help my skin...</li>
            <li> I always have such dry skin in the winter, and this truly kept my face moisturized though out the whole day.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend for very dry skin, but this works for all skin types as well because it is not greasy.</li>
            <li> I keep a jar of the regular \\&quot;Moisture Renew\\&quot; (green gel) around as it does what it says and is so economical.</li>
            <li> I normally do not write reviews on here but for this particular product I felt it was necessary.</li>
            <li> In my family, my two daughter and I all using this product, I have dry skin 50 yrs old and one of my daughter 21 yrs old has dry skin and younger daughter 18 yrs old</li>
            <li> (african black soap...no really).  </li>
            <li> As far as the purpose of this gel, I didn&#x27;t think it moisturized my very dry skin at all.</li>
            <li> I have very dry sensitive skin in the winter.  </li>
            <li> No matter how little or how much I use it leaves a sticky film on he skin.</li>
            <li> In fact, this product is best for people with combination or even oily skin, or people like me who just hate how heavy and gross creams or lotions feel on their faces.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have skin that actually does run dry, this probably won&#x27;t be enough for you.</li>
            <li> I like how almost weightless this is and just a tiny dab where needed goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It is a lightweight lotion and it does moisturize, but I felt it didn&#x27;t last as long</li>
            <li> I have several areas on my face that get dry and flaky during the winter months and was using a cream which was greasy and made my face shiny.  </li>
            <li> That may be because my skin has been extra dry though so take that into consideration.</li>
            <li> but once it&#x27;s dry it definitely makes a difference.</li>
            <li> Did not work well on extra dry skin--dried face out</li>
            <li> I recently was prescribed Differin (a retinoid) by my dermatologist and my skin was unbelievably dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as lotion in the moisturizing aspect (my face still gets dry), but I only put this on once a day</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t feel the different between dry skin and oil skin product.</li>
            <li> can dry out my skin, so I tried this and have re-purchased this several times.</li>
            <li> My facial skin is dry and oily.</li>
            <li> I am a man and my facial skin sometimes gets very dry.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very dry, especially in the winter after washing it.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t enough for my very dry skin</li>
            <li> My skin feels moisturized all day long without breaking me out.</li>
            <li> Plus, the scent doesn&#x27;t hang around that long.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this in addition to any other skin regime you have...</li>
            <li> Now my skin is so dry from the rash that it hurts to the touch and burns if I try to put anything on it to sooth it.</li>
            <li> Not greasy or slippery, and makes those dry cracks go away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every day for about 2-3 days now, and it has helped my dry skin issues, I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say my skin is is dry .</li>
            <li> I got dry patches and flakes just in a hour after applying the gel.</li>
            <li> I have in my 30&#x27;s acne prone skin but dry in some areas, so</li>
            <li> I keep one at work to chase away dry spots.</li>
            <li> However, after switching to this lotion, I think I&#x27;ve found my holy grail lotion for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Within one use my skin was noticeably smoother and not as dry.</li>
            <li> My skin never have dry spots anymore.</li>
            <li> I have generally dry skin</li>
            <li> My face used to be so dry that it would peel.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and dry skin.</li>
            <li> i have vary dry skin on my cheeks an nose an</li>
            <li> One single application of this soothing almost liquidfying gel you can feel immediately</li>
            <li> Secondly, you only need very little as it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for anyone with Very dry skin as it isn&#x27;t as moisturizing as a cream.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and summer is here.</li>
            <li> you have very dry skin, like myself, I can&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product hoping it would help with my very dry, flaky skin.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin in the winter but</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve used Clinique&#x27;s moisturizing gel, this is quite similar in consistency except that it has a little bit of a fruity (apple?)</li>
            <li> and it left my face a little shiny.</li>
            <li> I have Dry skin and my face had alot of acne cause other than being in the sun alot and with work and sweat nothing wasn&#x27;t working on my face.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long, long way and it lasts a while.</li>
            <li> Will use it but what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I used this for a few days, and my skin was actually feeling flakier.</li>
            <li> I only used it a few times then threw it out.</li>
            <li> I do not feel it moisturizes as I expected.  </li>
            <li> I used to use the green gel-cream when I was younger and somehow moved on to other creams (didn&#x27;t it disappear for a while?)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought numerous creams, lotions, and cleansers over the past few years and it&#x27;s always the same.</li>
            <li> I am sold and I highly recommend this product to anyone whom has tried other creams or facial gels and they have failed.</li>
            <li> A little goes a LONG way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid to use this product as it came with the original box tapped together and the jar is half empty.  </li>
            <li> I do believe this moisturizer works for other people.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face, but I&#x27;m guessing it will work on other problem areas also.</li>
            <li> I will try other products from this line.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll make some comparisons to other products just in case that helps anyone.</li>
            <li> I use this every day after my shower and it&#x27;s easier to put on than other face things</li>
            <li> I use other acne treatments</li>
            <li> (ran out of the other one).</li>
            <li> It was extremely overpowering.</li>
            <li> I like other Garnier products and decided to give this one a try.  </li>
            <li> This winter has been extremely damaging to my skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found in other countries.</li>
            <li> and i like the gel,better than white cream as usual.</li>
            <li> I also felt like my subsequent makeup application was very uneven.</li>
            <li> would recommend this over the green version as it is not for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Deep hard acne which takes weeks to go away.</li>
            <li> Also, dark spots and blotchy-ness is reduced.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I got it because I have dry skin on my face but pretty much all lotions make me break out horribly.</li>
            <li> I just walked down to rite</li>
            <li> so not sure how it would be for people with dry skins.</li>
            <li> other heavy lotions were making my face break out.</li>
            <li> The consistency is lighter and there is a slight tackiness as if soaks into your skin.</li>
            <li> I have dry-combo skin with a slight T-zone-y feel.</li>
            <li> and the jar is designed to take up less space in your cabinet.  </li>
            <li> more-Garnier should never have changed the formula previously used; prompt delivery though.</li>
            <li> My gripe with it is that it burns pretty bad on the areas with really dry skin, and makes your face feel a little sticky for about a half hour after use.</li>
            <li> It feels like a tight, sticky mask on my face.</li>
            <li> It was really hard to explain, but it did not in any way moisturize my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Just a little dab with my finger and massage it into my face.</li>
            <li> I am so used to Cliniques Moisture surge and without this little trick I employ, Garnier gel cream wouldn&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> I like that it is a little on the thicker side</li>
            <li> After I would apply it, it almost rolled off of my face in little pieces.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, and this cream moisturizes ridiculously well for this price point.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The acne washes dried my face out, and then the lotions made it too oily.</li>
            <li> Heavily fragranced.</li>
            <li> For starters, it smells like a heavy perfume.</li>
            <li> This is a waste of money, and I do not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this here because the one I bought at WalMart was missing the security seal sticker....</li>
            <li> The oil in the lotion moisturized me all day, but also left me with a greasy, broken out face.</li>
            <li> Now I am not having to search for over-drying and irritating acne facial wash products.  </li>
            <li> This keeps it hydrated without being greasy or too heavy.</li>
            <li> And at least ONE of the containers in the store seemed to have been opened and tested by other customers, making me have to hunt for what seemed like unopened containers.</li>
            <li> I mix it with my BB cream during the day if I have somewhere to go, and plain if I&#x27;m just bopping around, doing errands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather be a little dry than oily and broken out.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a bad scent, it&#x27;s just overpowering at first.</li>
            <li> I just bought this after having used the green one for the past two weeks.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, especially in the cold of  the Northern Ohio winter.</li>
            <li> I use this at night, and it usually causes me to wake up with oily skin.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a try this past winter and it improved the look of my skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Don&#x27;t be fooled by how small the container is.</li>
            <li> the fragrance (what&#x27;s in it), 2) the small container --</li>
            <li> At 1/8 of the price of my usual moisturizer, though, I would consider using it when I&#x27;m out of my moisture surge, need to save or want something to take with me while traveling without worrying about losing or breaking the container.</li>
            <li> This usually means the product is about to disappear</li>
            <li> I am not sure how this happened.</li>
            <li> The chemical/ alcohol smell was hard for me to get past, as well as the sticky texture.</li>
            <li> This is so hard to find in the drug stores</li>
            <li> But not even an HOUR would go by and my skin would just look so dull.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing with some combination skin lately and it looks flaky when I wear makeup</li>
            <li> Have had difficulty finding in stores lately for some reason.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this moisturizer after getting sick of my old one.  </li>
            <li> My skin is so dry that I feel guilty washing it because it just gets worse.</li>
            <li> Like I started to say before, I hate heavy lotion moisturizers in anything less than bitter cold weather.</li>
            <li> and I had a tough time finding ANYTHING I could wear let alone something that worked.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t hurt it either but ultimately not great, and overpriced.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect this can reduce the wrinkle, but it can stop it getting worse.</li>
            <li> My skin can look just awful in dry heat.</li>
            <li> I like the smell not too bad, and that is it.</li>
            <li> I wanted this to work so badly.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not so bad</li>
            <li> I must have received a bad batch.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m shocked.</li>
            <li> I usually hate using moisturizers because of the oiliness.</li>
            <li> I hate having to dip my fingers into the bottle.</li>
            <li> but I hate floral scents.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awful.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of the people who&#x27;s skin reacts really good to Garnier. I used to use the green gel-cream when I was younger and somehow moved on to other creams (didn&#x27;t it disappear for a while?) when I spotted this one on Amazon recently. Just received it and can say that it&#x27;s very good for dry skin, I put it on in the morning and my skin was still fresh looking in the evening. I had a day off so I didn&#x27;t use any makeup. It&#x27;s more penetrating than the green gel-cream from what I remember plus my skin is way more dry now. Glad I found it again!</li>
            <li> good moisturizer for dry skin; too light to handle winter dryness, but it&#x27;s good for summer.</li>
            <li> Best skincare for the money.</li>
            <li> I use this at night, and it usually causes me to wake up with oily skin. Also, it bleached spots in my towel/washcloth washer I wiped my hands.</li>
            <li> This moisturizing gel is well-named. I have very dry skin, especially in the cold of  the Northern Ohio winter. Garnier Skincare Moisture Rescue has become my go-to moisturizer.  I find that it is a light moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t go on feeling thick or heavy as so many moisturizers do. It has a pleasant delicate floral (lily-of-the-valley, I think) scent. Of the different moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried, this is the one I like best. And it doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg!  I do wish it came in a larger size.</li>
            <li> One of the reasons I like this product is it&#x27;s floral fragrance. I have no idea if it really works as I haven&#x27;t noticed that I look 10 or 20 years younger. It does seem to moisturize my face, which is the reason I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I really like this face moisturizer. It is like a gel, so nice and light.  I  order it  through Subscribe and Save, so the price is very good.  If I feel I need something heavier, I use Cetaphil on top of it.</li>
            <li> Not greasy - Use at night and lasts all through till the morning.  I order 6 at a time so I don&#x27;t run out!&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> I am very particular on what products I use as my skin is sensitive and very dry. Let me first say that this product is by far the best I have ever used. My skin is more suptle, glowing and healthier looking than it ever has been. The cream is more gel like, cooling and non scented so you dont have to worry about any off putting smells. Secondly, you only need very little as it goes a long way. Easy, non greasy application and doesn&#x27;t itch or peel. I am sold and I highly recommend this product to anyone whom has tried other creams or facial gels and they have failed. Thanks Garnier!</li>
            <li> It came with the box all messed up and when I opened I want sure if it was used or not.not sure if I can even return it.</li>
            <li> love this face cream. Have sensitive skin and have tried all different kinds over the years; and this is the best I&#x27;ve found. Maybe because it a &amp;#34;gel/combo.. Just wish it came in a bigger size; the packaging is twice the size of the jar, so it is deceptive if you see it on a store shelf.</li>
            <li> This is a light moisturizer, it is not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I love this product It feels so light on your face</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is definitely one I recommend.  I have several areas on my face that get dry and flaky during the winter months and was using a cream which was greasy and made my face shiny.  I decided to give this a try this past winter and it improved the look of my skin.  I put it on just once in the morning.  I no longer have flaky skin.  My only concern is I like to use products with SPF, but this doesn&#x27;t have.  They do have one with SPF in it that is a lotion, so I will try that next.  I had doubts about what the gel cream would feel like.  But, it is refreshing.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.  It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t take long to dry.  I probably won&#x27;t buy it online again because I can get it cheaper at Walmart.</li>
            <li> used to love it but they changed the formular and this one doesn&#x27;t work for me. It smells &amp;#34;plasticy&amp;#34; and gives me a rash</li>
            <li> The first day I used this product my face felt amazing! But the next time I used it, my face started burning and became swollen with red sores all over it. Now my skin is so dry from the rash that it hurts to the touch and burns if I try to put anything on it to sooth it. I think I am allergic to something in the cream. I have a tendency to have reactions to things like this, so I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m shocked. It did feel very nice the first use, so I do believe this moisturizer works for other people. But if anybody has very sensitive skin like me, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Am i the only one that feels that this gel burns? It really fights the dry skin but i feel like my face burns everytime i use it</li>
            <li> The skin on my face is so dry, but this stuff really works for me. But I can&#x27;t find it in any stores around me, so ordering from Amazon works just fine for me.</li>
            <li> The gel is unique because it easily goes on wet but quickly dries and is absorbed. Not greasy or slippery, and makes those dry cracks go away.</li>
            <li> Great product for dry skin and works all day</li>
            <li> In my family, my two daughter and I all using this product, I have dry skin 50 yrs old and one of my daughter 21 yrs old has dry skin and younger daughter 18 yrs old has combination skin, we like it, after washing our face, we put serum first then this product and lotion or you can put lotion first or later, it give our skin more moisture for longer time.It is not oily product. we have been using it more than 3 yrs. we still using it. give it a try. it is not expensive! hopefully you like it!</li>
            <li> Love the gel feels very smooth.</li>
            <li> It’s light on the skin with a fresh scent. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for anyone with Very dry skin as it isn&#x27;t as moisturizing as a cream. I used this during the summer months and I felt it provided decent moisture. It is very light and smells good. So I&#x27;ll recommend this for summer use.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I have an allergy to almost everything made for your face even the most sensitive products are an issue. So couple that with combo skin and living in the desert where summer temps are 100+ and I had a tough time finding ANYTHING I could wear let alone something that worked. But this is perfect. It&#x27;s light, non greasy, and moisturizing. Imagine a drug store product that actually works well. I even use it on areas that have been sunburned by accident and it helps tremendously. Also you don&#x27;t have to use a lot so not only is it inexpensive and works but it lasts.</li>
            <li> I love it and wish I would become instantly younger again</li>
            <li> Great product that compares to Clinique&#x27;s moisture surge. i bought this product to try out after using clinique&#x27;s moisture surge for many years. mostly, i was tired of paying 50 dollars a jar for clinique&#x27;s product. this product is definitely comparable and way cheaper! definitely recommend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not used to using gel moisturizers but from what I&#x27;ve experienced so far is that this product is fast drying (which I like) but not all that moisturizing like I expected. That may be because my skin has been extra dry though so take that into consideration.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid to use this product as it came with the original box tapped together and the jar is half empty.  Be aware that this is a non-retunable product.  I wasted my money on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair. I got my money back after couple email exchanges and pics.</li>
            <li> Wonderful moisture gel-cream. Not sticky or heavy and goes on smooth and feels dry quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.. I am a man and my facial skin sometimes gets very dry.  I use this stuff now whenever I need it;  I like it because it has almost no scent, and the little there is is very pleasant, not flowery or perfumey.  I dislike fragrance very much, so this is perfect for me and works well.</li>
            <li> I tend to have oily skin, but I use a really great deep cleansing face wash bar that requires me to use a really good moisturizer to stay clear (african black soap...no really).  I have used Clinique&#x27;s gell moisturizer for several years and I still needed to add a drop of organic jojoba oil to it.  Yet I cannot use lotion moisturizers without having acne problems no matter what brand I bought.  This stuff is amazing.  It has a light scent and it really makes my face so smooth and refreshed day and night.  It doesn&#x27;t cause my acne prone skin to break out and I really do love it.  The price is just amazing when you are use to paying department store beauty counter prices.  I hope it continues to work wonders on my skin but as of now I have found my perfect &amp;#34;no more acne&amp;#34; system.  I went from paying $100 every three months to about $10 and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> I GAVE THIS TO A FRIEND ,SHE REALLY HAS DRY SKIN .SEEMS TO HELP A LOTY</li>
            <li> My favorite moisture regime for my face. It goes on light yet makes my skin very supple. This will always be part of my skin routine. LOVE,LOVE,LOVE this product!!</li>
            <li> jelly and transparant, smells nice. love its  refreshing touch.</li>
            <li> Very soothing in the hot dry Arizona air!</li>
            <li> This is comparable to the Clinique Moisture Surge moisturizer but not quite as good.  I love keeping this in my fridge though!  It feels great on a hot day or right before bed.</li>
            <li> I had some of the driest facial skin one can imagine. Redness, major flaking, etc.... I was ready to go to the doctor for to get help. Thought I would try this Garnier stuff. To put it bluntly, it worked a miracle on my skin. I now have a perfect complexion once again. My skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good in many years. I often get comments how good it looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be fooled by how small the container is. 1.7oz. will last a long time, as only a small dab is needed to cover a good sized area. I&#x27;m guessing I&#x27;ll get 2 months from this using it twice a day. Well worth the money. I use it on my face, but I&#x27;m guessing it will work on other problem areas also. Anything that can save me a doctors visit is worth its weight in gold to me.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It is so refreshing. I use it 1-2 a day. It leaves my skin moisturized but also refreshed. It&#x27;s got a clean smell but not too over powering. I will never go back to using the &amp;#34;typical&amp;#34; facial moisturizer. The gel leaves my skin feeling much more moisturized and the gel feels nice and refreshing.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mainly because of some severely dry skin I have been having. I am glad that I did. I&#x27;ve been using this every day for about 2-3 days now, and it has helped my dry skin issues, I would buy this again. This also has a real nice fruity fragrance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing with some combination skin lately and it looks flaky when I wear makeup but yet it&#x27;s always oily. I was looking for a moisturizer that wasn&#x27;t exactly a lotion and I think I&#x27;ve found it. I was surprised that this was very inexpensive, seeing as though it&#x27;s garnier. I bought some today and even in just 2 uses, I notice smoother skin already. I&#x27;ve bought numerous creams, lotions, and cleansers over the past few years and it&#x27;s always the same. The acne washes dried my face out, and then the lotions made it too oily. You&#x27;d think it would have balanced out. But this cream-gel isn&#x27;t greasy, and can be used after you wash with acne cleanser and still leave your skin smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> ... and it does what it says it does: moisture rescue :) I like it, it&#x27;s light on the skin, yet leaves it smooth and silky, locking in moisture. It&#x27;s definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Moisturized well. Watery but once it&#x27;s dry it definitely makes a difference.</li>
            <li> i dont know if they changed package or what. The item i received seems it has been used and looks totally different from picture.</li>
            <li> Will use it but what I expected.  Face cream not body lotion</li>
            <li> Love this product and you can&#x27;t beat the amazon price of less than 6$.This has just the right amount of moisture for my skin. I wouldn&#x27;t say my skin is is dry . Its normal with an oily t zone so not sure how it would be for people with dry skins.</li>
            <li> Not for me but price cheap than other cause i buy lot so help me save some money. will buy more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to have finally found something I can use for daytime. I love to use this every morning before I put my make up on. My face looks radient, feels incredibly soft and smooth. I like the fresh fruit scent. I have very sensitive skin and have no issues with this. My skin is also on the driest end of combination - this seems to help keep thing in balance. I like how almost weightless this is and just a tiny dab where needed goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Ok, i am 36yo with dry sensitive skin. My every day moisturizer is proven by time Nivea Soft but i wanted something new ( who doesnt from time to time), so i decided to give it a try , especially  because of its gel formula. Yes, it&#x27;s very lightweight, watery but if you apply a bit more than a little drop it gets sticky and feels like a film on your face. I got dry patches and flakes just in a hour after applying the gel. Oh and it burns when applying after washing the face with gentle regular cleanser ( use Michael Todd&#x27;s true organic cleanser). I like the smell not too bad, and that is it.</li>
            <li> i REALLY like this rescue remedy. In the hot climate, I feel like my skin dehydrates, and this refreshes, replenishes, and goes on light, COOL, and feels like it absorbs in a minute. I use under makeup, and after makeup, and in between. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice product that I would have probably not bought had I not received a sample in the store. It is a gel which I like because I am not fond of heavy creams that do not absorb quickly. It is light and quickly absorbed with no sticky feel.</li>
            <li> The chemical/ alcohol smell was hard for me to get past, as well as the sticky texture. It really did not do much for my dry skin either, even when I tried applying multiple times per day.</li>
            <li> like Garnier Non-greasy products! Will keep buying it, feel clear and fresh after using. although not about the effects yet..</li>
            <li> Love this product. I recently have started using on other places besides my face and it works great. It&#x27;s not greasy, fella light on my face.</li>
            <li> Tried this because it caught my eye when buying Garnier Ultra-Lift Anti-Wrinkle Firming Night Cream. This is also nice. The consistency is lighter and there is a slight tackiness as if soaks into your skin. It is a good product, but I am already spoiled by the other more intense moisturizing effect of the Ultra-Life.</li>
            <li> it fits very well for dry skin! and GEL much better than CREAM!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many differents and expensives brands for my facial care. And I have to tell you this Garnier Skincare Moisture Gel is as good as many of them at a really fair Price. I have in my 30&#x27;s acne prone skin but dry in some areas, so i was looking for something that could balance my problem. My skin feels moisturized all day long without breaking me out. And you perceive a refreshing sensation after the application. It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy and as it absorbs quickly you can use make-up inmediatly. I will try other products from this line.</li>
            <li> I want to start by saying that I don&#x27;t think this product is entirely accurate in its own description. If you have skin that actually does run dry, this probably won&#x27;t be enough for you. In fact, this product is best for people with combination or even oily skin, or people like me who just hate how heavy and gross creams or lotions feel on their faces.&lt;br /&gt;This product feels like spreading cool water on your face, except it sinks in and stays with you. Like I started to say before, I hate heavy lotion moisturizers in anything less than bitter cold weather. They make my combination skin feel oily and kind of sticky, and they often break me out. This product doesn&#x27;t do any of that. That&#x27;s about all I can give you if you&#x27;re considering trying it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll make some comparisons to other products just in case that helps anyone. Cetaphil and CeraVe I think are the most common \\&quot;light\\&quot; facial lotions, and this is much lighter and feels much cleaner. Garnier has another moisturizing gel very similar to this one (the green one) and if that one wasn&#x27;t quite enough moisture for you, but you liked that it felt nice and light, this is a great upgrade. If you&#x27;ve used Clinique&#x27;s moisturizing gel, this is quite similar in consistency except that it has a little bit of a fruity (apple?) scent.&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I can think of is that this isn&#x27;t the most hygienic way to package a product like this since you have to put your fingers directly into it. If you wash your hands before using it, though, you should be fine.&lt;br /&gt;I really can&#x27;t recommend this highly enough and I wish I could give it six or seven stars. It&#x27;s by far my favorite drugstore moisturizer, and close to my all-time favorite just behind Clinique&#x27;s gel.</li>
            <li> I usually hate using moisturizers because of the oiliness. This stuff is great. You don&#x27;t need much to apply over your face and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all.</li>
            <li> This Gel-Cream is very soothing, melts into the skin quickly and smells nice too.  I keep one at work to chase away dry spots.</li>
            <li> I went through an entire package of the regular Refreshing Gel-Cream earlier this month. I loved that lotion, especially in the summer. It really is refreshing. I have terribly dry skin and that lotion was almost perfect. However, after switching to this lotion, I think I&#x27;ve found my holy grail lotion for dry skin. The smell is nice, it feels very light but works really well with my dry skin. Definitely recommended!</li>
            <li> This is great if you want to moisturize your skin but not make it to look oily. I use this every day after my shower and it&#x27;s easier to put on than other face things and it smells good...and I&#x27;m a straight guy.</li>
            <li> Definitely refreshing and effective during the past winter. It&#x27;s a cooling gel and not at all greasy. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is so hard to find in the drug stores so I&#x27;m glad that Amazon carries it now. it&#x27;s way more moisturing than the green one which is for regular skin. It is perfect for the winter months. Hope they don&#x27;t discontinue the item.</li>
            <li> And I loved it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have normal skin, but the winter completely destroys it, leaving it super, super, super dry. My skin is so dry that I feel guilty washing it because it just gets worse. I found this product on amazon and decided to try it out based on the reviews. I don&#x27;t regret it! I love how it&#x27;s a gel... It makes me feel like I&#x27;m not just plastering cream on my skin. It soaks up nicely and makes your skin feel so fresh and clean! Within one use my skin was noticeably smoother and not as dry. It won&#x27;t be a miracle worker on your first time, but with every day use, your dryness will disappear! I definitely recommend this in addition to any other skin regime you have... I use other acne treatments and I had no problem adding this to my routine!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really moisturize at all was very sticky and even though I put a lot on it soaked in really fast and didn&#x27;t make my skin happy broke out from it</li>
            <li> I just bought this after having used the green one for the past two weeks. I have dry-combo skin with a slight T-zone-y feel. The green one was great but I bought this because I can&#x27;t find that one in the nearest Rite Aid and I was in a hurry (ran out of the other one). I&#x27;ll write another review later next month but so far I concur with all the good reviews. This feels light and airy and is so, so easy to apply. It goes on light and spreads fast without a sticky feel. My only concerns would be 1) the fragrance (what&#x27;s in it), 2) the small container -- I wish Garnier would make a bigger container for these two creams... paying a bit more is fine, 3) no SPF at all, and 4) the TYPE of container. I hate having to dip my fingers into the bottle. And at least ONE of the containers in the store seemed to have been opened and tested by other customers, making me have to hunt for what seemed like unopened containers. Luckily, I found one. Garnier, please put these in pump bottles if you can. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Not at all moisturizing. Heavily fragranced. Has SD alcohol as the third ingredient. This stuff is gross. No matter how little or how much I use it leaves a sticky film on he skin. Then it balls up and rubs off in clumps if you try to use makeup on it.</li>
            <li> I have Dry skin and my face had alot of acne cause other than being in the sun alot and with work and sweat nothing wasn&#x27;t working on my face. The smell is very delish and it has a very light texture to it. Just a little dab with my finger and massage it into my face. within days i can see my face clearing up the touch of it to my skin feels like moisture bursting without that oily feel which i love. If you have facial skin problem this is one of the best i ever used.</li>
            <li> This is no where worth the price. I saw no moisture rescue or anything good about this product. I am ordering something else that really works.</li>
            <li> This is the best facial moisturizer I have ever used! My skin never have dry spots anymore. I use it twice each day - at night after using my clarisonic and in the morning before applying makeup. It dries quickly and does not leave a sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> I wanted this to work so badly. I have very dry skin and summer is here. My skin can look just awful in dry heat. This gel has a very cooling feel on the face, love that. In the morning it gives a bit of a wake me up, like all my gels I keep this in the fridge. So the extra bit of coldness is lovely. At first, maybe wishful thinking, I thought this gel was great. It applies really smoothly and sat under my makeup easily. But not even an HOUR would go by and my skin would just look so dull. I changed up the routine, applying this gel directly out of the shower, prepare for work, then applying another layer before I applied my makeup –- an hour later –– DULL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have very dry skin, like myself, I can&#x27;t recommend this product. I am still on the hunt.</li>
            <li> I like this gel-cream, keep moisture and very comfortable , highly cost-effective product, I will buy again!</li>
            <li> This is so silky smooth! I haven&#x27;t tried it under make up but I use it every night after washing my face and my face feels so much more hydrated.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer and hope it never discontinues.  It has non of the&amp;#34; acne ingredients to avoid&amp;#34; and it great for my troubled skin.&lt;br /&gt;Cool, refreshing and lightweight. Works well under makeup or alone.&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping and came in original box.  All was sealed for safety</li>
            <li> It drives me nuts but this seems to be the only moisturizer that works for me!  I have oily skin but it&#x27;s also flaky in the winter .. this stuff does the trick.. no flakes and it absorbs really well.  I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It feels wonderful right as you put it on, but doesn&#x27;t last more than 10 minutes, so you may have to reapply once more depending on your skin type.</li>
            <li> A good value for a good product that does what it says--keeps my skin refreshed, and isn&#x27;t sticky.  Better price than in the store (get free shipping!) and the jar is designed to take up less space in your cabinet.  Nice.</li>
            <li> Save your money; this product made me break out all over.  I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin so I as surprised by this.  Deep hard acne which takes weeks to go away.</li>
            <li> Did not work well on extra dry skin--dried face out more-Garnier should never have changed the formula previously used; prompt delivery though.</li>
            <li> This product works very well for extremely dry skin.  It does what it says on holding moisture in and the pricing is great.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of this when applying to my skin. It is very refreshing, almost like a cool splash of water. My skin feels soft and I did not have any irritation. The gel absorbs quickly into the skin and I do not feel any residue. I will definitely purchase this again!</li>
            <li> My new favorite moisturizer! It&#x27;s light, not sticky, absorbs quickly...I made all the women in my family try it.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Good price. Great for my dry oily skin</li>
            <li> I recently was prescribed Differin (a retinoid) by my dermatologist and my skin was unbelievably dry and flaky. None of my regular moisturizers had any effect on my peeling skin but after only one use of this gel I could tell a huge difference! My skin felt moisturized all day and the flakiness was totally gone by the next day. Not only that, this product is oil free and non-comedogenic so it&#x27;s perfect for acne prone skin. Whatever is in this moisturizer is amazing, I might even go as far as to say this is a miracle product. I highly recommend for very dry skin, but this works for all skin types as well because it is not greasy.</li>
            <li> Light, gel moisturizer quickly absorbed and feels great, especially under makeup.</li>
            <li> I like their green formula better.</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizer.</li>
            <li> bought both dry skin and normal/combo skin and dont see much difference. but what i do know is it makes my face and hands incredibly soft. love garnier.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, and this cream moisturizes ridiculously well for this price point. It also doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. It&#x27;s a good buy, especially since it doesn&#x27;t contain parabens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel feels a bit different than creams, but it sinks in quickly. A happy customer!</li>
            <li> I bought this product hoping it would help with my very dry, flaky skin. For starters, it smells like a heavy perfume. It was extremely overpowering. I used this for a few days, and my skin was actually feeling flakier. I read the ingredients and #3 on the list is denatured alcohol, which explains why it was drying out my skin. This is a waste of money, and I do not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this gel based on another customers recommendation on another product and it was sooo worth trying out!!! So I have super sensitive skin that easily breaks out and flares up because I have systemic lupus, and this gel is so easy for my skin to tolerate. I use this gel on top of my Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder Advanced Night Serum II at night, and then again by itself in the morning under all of my make up and it keeps my skin hydrated without feeling greasy. It really soaks into ur skin the moment u put it on ur face and I haven&#x27;t seen any break outs when I use this gel by itself. Now if I can only find the perfect make up, I would have perfect skin lol</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It goes on light, is cooling, smells great and is not oily.  I have very sensitive skin and this moisturizer does not affect my skin.</li>
            <li> love this moisturizer i have dry skin and this is one of the only products i have found that helps! love the gel feel. would recommend this over the green version as it is not for dry skin. AWESOME product. will be buying more of this brand from now on.</li>
            <li> I bought this here because the one I bought at WalMart was missing the security seal sticker.... Gross! Anyway, I got it because I have dry skin on my face but pretty much all lotions make me break out horribly. I was avoiding them to the point that my face was flaking. I wanted to find an oil-free moisturizer in the hopes that I wouldn&#x27;t break out. It&#x27;s advertised as a &amp;#34;fruit water&amp;#34; and it smells pleasant. A little goes a long, long way and it lasts a while. It doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as lotion in the moisturizing aspect (my face still gets dry), but I only put this on once a day and there&#x27;s no oil. The oil in the lotion moisturized me all day, but also left me with a greasy, broken out face. Anyway, give it a try. For the price, it&#x27;s a great option. I&#x27;d rather be a little dry than oily and broken out. I really think if I remembered to put it on more frequently, it would solve my problem.</li>
            <li> Have been a big fan of Garnier&#x27;s products for years, and this is the third jar of the gel cream I&#x27;ve purchased.  Really love the lightweight feel and fresh scent.  The product doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy on your skin, which I find especially important in the summertime.  Garnier also makes a green gel cream like this that is for normal skin - the pink is formulated for dry skin, but to be honest I can&#x27;t tell the difference - I don&#x27;t think the pink one moisturizes any better - both are great.  I have generally dry skin and I find this to be enough to keep wintertime dryness and flakiness at bay.</li>
            <li> My face used to be so dry that it would peel. I tried everything and nothing worked, until this product!!!!! I&#x27;m so glad that I finally found something (and cheap) that stopped my face from peeling. It almost worked immediately. VERY HAPPY.</li>
            <li> I was already a huge fan of the regular strength gel, and gave this a try. I always have such dry skin in the winter, and this truly kept my face moisturized though out the whole day.</li>
            <li> My face feels so soft!</li>
            <li> Very nice.&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic seller.&lt;br /&gt;Everything is great!</li>
            <li> One time using this and you can really tell the difference! this is a wonderful product and love the price too. The longer I use it the more I love it. Skin feels fresh, healthy, and not greasy at all.It absorbs quickly, which is great if you hate a lotion feel. Feels like your skin is getting a drink of water.   No complaints, Love this product!</li>
            <li> Very refreshing and perfect to use on hot nights when I don&#x27;t feel like using a thick moisturizer or night cream on my face.  Absorbs very quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and dry skin. I wear this under my BB cream. It feels cooling and leaves my skin looking hydrated. No complaints!</li>
            <li> So unimpressed by this! It feels nice going on but it doesn&#x27;t absorb at all and kind of rolls off my face. It left a sticky residue as well. I only used it a few times then threw it out. I have very dry skin and thought this would be great as an add on to my usual creams but it was a dud for me.</li>
            <li> did nothing after 60 days of use. Even found a discount place nearby that carried and it did not work.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, and i&#x27;ve been looking for good cream for a loong time ..this one is the best so far :)</li>
            <li> very good! absorb instantly and make my skin soft, smells lovely</li>
            <li> Over rated name.  Product is okay but leaves a yucky film on the skin.</li>
            <li> love the way it makes my face feel smooth, moisturized, and cool</li>
            <li> Has a nice light texture, wasn&#x27;t worried at all about it breaking me out, it is pretty thin and watery which is good if you&#x27;re putting it under make up, has a strong floral smell. And it comes in a pretty glass jar. My gripe with it is that it burns pretty bad on the areas with really dry skin, and makes your face feel a little sticky for about a half hour after use. And I don&#x27;t feel much more moisturized than I did before using it. Worth trying for the price, but I think I will buy something different next time.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to receiving this product because it is amazing and works well on my sensitive and dry skin, leaving it moist. However, when I got the package, the seal to the product was tampered with. It was obvious that the product had been opened before. I recommend spending the extra dollar or two and buying it from the store.</li>
            <li> with hyaluronic acid which you can buy on Amazon. :) I got the Timeless hyaluronic acid solution. I put multiple drops right into my Garnier gel cream and it enhanced it&#x27;s effectiveness 10 fold. Otherwise, I probably wouldn&#x27;t use this stuff. I am so used to Cliniques Moisture surge and without this little trick I employ, Garnier gel cream wouldn&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> non grease cream gives skin fresh and cool especially on hot season. but I don&#x27;t feel the different between dry skin and oil skin product.</li>
            <li> Review written by my daughter:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally use Clinique Moisture Surge and someone recommended this moisturizer as an inexpensive alternative. It is not a bad product, but I won&#x27;t switch any time soon. It is a lightweight lotion and it does moisturize, but I felt it didn&#x27;t last as long and it left my face a little shiny. Also, I did not enjoy the floral scent too much. At 1/8 of the price of my usual moisturizer, though, I would consider using it when I&#x27;m out of my moisture surge, need to save or want something to take with me while traveling without worrying about losing or breaking the container.</li>
            <li> I keep a jar of the regular \\&quot;Moisture Renew\\&quot; (green gel) around as it does what it says and is so economical. Didn&#x27;t know about this one until recently. I don&#x27;t know about it having double the moisturizing of the other, but it&#x27;s certainly as good for sure! Either works well for me, though neither is my primary moisturizer, but for one reason or another I&#x27;ll use one of them \\&quot;instead of \\&quot; or \\&quot;as well as\\&quot;! The best non-sticky/non-greasy moisturizer I&#x27;ve found for so little cost!</li>
            <li> Absolutely my favorite moisturizer!! No oily feeling!</li>
            <li> I like other Garnier products and decided to give this one a try.  I do not like this one at all.  I do not feel it moisturizes as I expected.  It is ok, but not great.  I personally would not buy again</li>
            <li> This stuff is awful. It feels like a tight, sticky mask on my face. Threw it straight into the garbage!</li>
            <li> I use it every morning and it keeps my skin moisturized till evening. A very good product. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin! This does not have a burning sensation like some do on sensitive skin.It is a must have for winter but I bet it will feel great in the summer.</li>
            <li> Ladies, are you looking for that one exhilarating moisturizer you&#x27;ve been trying to get? Look no further and reach for this &amp;#34;food from the nutrient gods&amp;#34; non greasy facial treatment by Garnier. I can tell you in so many words how this tiny jar has saved and spared my face from skin deterioration and other infractions related to unkind outdoor impurites. This is a first rate oil free antidote and a must have for anyone who needs to treat and cure skin depletions and replelish even levels of moisturizing. Plus it conquers winter dryness and early signs of wrinkles. One single application of this soothing almost liquidfying gel you can feel immediately your unenergised face is getting an uplift pampering and healing like a therapeutic clay mask. Your inner pores will get the healthy benefits of receiving natural nutrients and your overall facial lines will be barely noticable. In addition, your moisturized complexion will show a healthy glow after several days of repeated applications. The cucumber extracts are one of the main ingredients that make this moisturizer special because you&#x27;d feel a gentle and cooling effects once it&#x27;s applied. It&#x27;s the ultimate regimen exclusively made to protect your skin from unspared winter weather elements. It&#x27;s also noted that it&#x27;s so safe you can even apply small amounts of gel under your eyes to ease puffiness and deep linings. I&#x27;d recommend this exciting product to anyone who needs extra extra moisturizing and protection to mend all blemished and unbalanced skin types.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin. My skin is very dry, especially in the winter after washing it. I loved the light gel consistency but I often had to apply it twice.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It is so light and feels so refreshing. It&#x27;s not thick and absorbs completely leaving my skin soft and surprisingly moisturized without a greasy feel.</li>
            <li> makes my face feel very nice, not dry.  price is great too</li>
            <li> I love this product. I ran out one day and went back to another face moisturizer and immediately noticed the difference. Have had difficulty finding in stores lately for some reason. This usually means the product is about to disappear but I hope not.</li>
            <li> This gel is very soothing on sensitive skin.  I was surprised how well it worked without leaving my skin greasy.</li>
            <li> This is so calming and comfortable on my dry, irritated skin. It&#x27;s not the most hydrating but I like to use it more like a calming lotion before my standard moisturizer. If you have &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;-oily skin this might be too much for you but I think it&#x27;d be perfect for people who just have slightly dry skin. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all (more like gelly water) and soaks in relatively quickly.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Lightweight, do not have to use a lot of product to cover one area&lt;br /&gt;-Non oily and won&#x27;t make you break out&lt;br /&gt;-Evens out complexion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Heavy floral scent. It isn&#x27;t a bad scent, it&#x27;s just overpowering at first. I got use to it and it&#x27;s not so bad now.&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t wash off well, but I ended up liking that so it moisturizes all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I wasn&#x27;t too impressed by this product, but I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks and I&#x27;m starting to see my complexion even out. My skin is glowing and I don&#x27;t have as many breakouts. Also, dark spots and blotchy-ness is reduced. Granted, Clinique Moisture Surge is the king of all moisturizers in my opinion, but this is a nice product in comparison to price. It does take a bit of time for it to take effect and moisturize your face. If you want something lightweight, that won&#x27;t make you breakout then this is your product!</li>
            <li> I just walked down to rite an got it for 9$ but omg it smells good works amazing i have vary dry skin on my cheeks an nose an it helps wonderful for making my makup not dry an crack</li>
            <li> I love Garnier products. This skin gel -cream feels wonderful on my skin. I will continue to order this great product.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how well this cream moisturizes, you won&#x27;t find anything close for the money.... I will be buying again!</li>
            <li> Love the cream. You can feel the skin getting moisturized just like drinking cool water when thirsty.</li>
            <li> I like it! The packaging is adorable and it&#x27;s the perfect size for on the go - not too big, not too small. I like that it is lightweight and absorbs easily into my skin. However, at times, it stings my face (I have very sensitive, combination skin - Lucky me!). I also find the smell pleasant - it is not too perfumy.</li>
            <li> This gel moisturizer is perfect for oily/combination skin. It goes on nice and cool and absorbs in completely and pretty quickly. It sinks in deep into the skin and your face stays hydrated most of the day. In my opinion, this version has more staying power than the normal (green version) of the same. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the &amp;#34;for dry skin&amp;#34; label- this oil free moisturizer is great for oily skin too. I have oily skin and some of the products I use to fight break-outs can dry out my skin, so I tried this and have re-purchased this several times. It has a light, fresh scent and is a great alternative to a much more expensive Olay Fresh Dew Over. I highly recomend trying this out. If you happen to find my review helpful please feel free to click that little button. Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;PS. This is also great all year round and in the summer time once this sinks in it will not &amp;#34;sweat out&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This did not last very long, and it didn&#x27;t really help my skin...didn&#x27;t hurt it either but ultimately not great, and overpriced. I&#x27;d recommend the Alba Botanica moisturizer instead. Plus they don&#x27;t test on animals!</li>
            <li> This product sinks into my skin and feels great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. I read something online that said this was a dupe of Clinique, so I thought it was a better price then what I pay. It works good, but not as close that I&#x27;d call it a dupe. I don&#x27;t know that I would buy it again</li>
            <li> Gets rid of my dark circles under my eyes absolute love.</li>
            <li> Nice light moisturizer for summer, smells like citrus.</li>
            <li> This smells wonderful.  It goes on smoothly and dries quickly.  It is very moisturizing without being greasy or sticky.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I normally do not write reviews on here but for this particular product I felt it was necessary. For my skin this product works wonders. I use in at night and in the morning after I wash my face. It&#x27;s so great it even makes my makeup look fresh on my face.  It&#x27;s awesome and I will keep buying this forever and ever.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and this works like a charm. I layer it under Alba Botanical&#x27;s Acnedote oil control lotion. Non-greasy, and absorbs quickly. Great for layering under makeup.</li>
            <li> Reminds me of Clinique Moisture Surge but I prefer the smell and the price of this product.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer for the summer time.  It&#x27;s gel-based formula goes on super light and refreshing, and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy in the summer heat.  I have normal skin but it can get pretty dry in the summer so I use this day and night.</li>
            <li> After reading the review of this product, I finally made the purchase and for the most part, I really like this gel-creme moisturizer.  This winter has been extremely damaging to my skin and I found that no matter what I purchased, I still had flaking occurring on my forehead, nose, and the apples of my cheeks.  I have to note that I haven&#x27;t found quite the right cleanser yet, so I&#x27;m sure that doesn&#x27;t help.  Anyway, this product is amazing.  I even just touched my cheek and found it to be so soft and smooth even though I haven&#x27;t applied this since last night.  When I was skimming through the reviews on my search for the &amp;#34;Review this Product&amp;#34; button, I saw someone mention that using this product feels like slathering water on your skin and I have to agree.  It&#x27;s cool and refreshing and so light.  A little goes a LONG way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My ONLY drawback is the scent.  I really, REALLY wish that these was zero fragrance but I guess I&#x27;m stuck with it.  It&#x27;s pretty light and doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate my skin but I hate floral scents.</li>
            <li> I used the other (normal skin) and loved it. I wanted to try this one so ordered. The product arrived on time.&lt;br /&gt;However, the glass was all shattered and I almost cut myself. The first time I received the other ones, they arrived just fine. I am not sure how this happened. I hope they replace it as soon as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Received a new one. They responded very quickly to my comment above and sent me a new one (not broken this time) within 2 days! Amazing! Will try this one once I finish using the cream for normal skin.</li>
            <li> Contains many good ingredients for skin. Does not cause irritation or break outs.  Their Grape Water version did not work on me but this one is great.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave  your face greasy. I put this on every am before I put on my foundation. Does not make my face sweaty.</li>
            <li> The best. Perfect for people who tend to break out with oily products. I started using gel from Germany, and my brother would bring it over to me whenever he visited, but I could never find any here in the states. This is the first product I&#x27;ve found that rivals the great moisturizing gels I&#x27;ve found in other countries. YAY!</li>
            <li> My facial skin is dry and oily. I use this product in summer. It&#x27;s perfect for my face. The gel is light, and it moistures my face well. Don&#x27;t expect this can reduce the wrinkle, but it can stop it getting worse. Overall, this product with such a nice price has done a good job for me!</li>
            <li> I decided to try this moisturizer after getting sick of my old one.  I had been using an Origins moisturizer but it wasn&#x27;t enough for my very dry skin and I felt it was pretty pricey at almost $30.  I have been using Garnier Skincare Moisture Rescue Refreshing Gel-Cream for about a week and I really like it.  I have very sensitive skin and most products make me break out but this one hasn&#x27;t which is impressive.  I like that it is a little on the thicker side so I only need to put it on once and my dry skin stays moisturized for the whole day.  The downsides, I dislike that this is an &amp;#34;Add on&amp;#34; item, I don&#x27;t want to have to pay X amount of money to be able to purchase this.  I ended up buying it at a local CVS for the same price as advertised on Amazon.  Second downside, it tends to make my skin shiny.  Not oily, but shiny.  I&#x27;m sure this will be minimized with makeup on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really like this moisturizer and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Love the light feel of this effective facial gel cream. I mix it with my BB cream during the day if I have somewhere to go, and plain if I&#x27;m just bopping around, doing errands. It is the best lightweight moisturizer that I&#x27;ve ever tried, and is especially nice for summer.</li>
            <li> A very light texture. It has a light pleasant smell and feels so good on skin. NOT oily nor sticky. Simply amazing. I&#x27;ve bought one just to try but I definitely had to buy double pack better.</li>
            <li> This gel is light and has a much lighter sent than the blue moisturizing gel from Garnier. soaks in fast and has improved my skin since I started using this line a month ago. Excellent buy for someone with sensitive skin and for little money.</li>
            <li> Ever since my skin changed from dry to combination a few years ago I have been struggling to find the perfect amount of moisture during the spring and summer months.  My old faithful cetaphil moisturizer is still perfect during the winter months, but leaves my skin shiny and oily during the warmer climate.  For a while I thought that my skin was just out of control until I realized I was not using the right product.  This gel cream has done wonders.  It is exactly the way that rich hydration should feel- it noticeably enhances my skin&#x27;s moisture barrier without leaving a film, and it doesn&#x27;t clog or irritate my ridiculously sensitive skin.  I have noticed fewer breakouts as well.  I finally feel like I am able to glow instead of shine.  My skin has been transformed.  Now I am not having to search for over-drying and irritating acne facial wash products.  As always, it will not produce those same results for everyone, but it did the trick for me!  I hope they do not discontinue this.</li>
            <li> I generally don&#x27;t leave feedback, but I felt I needed to speak my mind.  After I gave this gel a chance (used it for a week), I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell anymore and tossed it in the trash. I don&#x27;t know why there were so many people saying it smelled good.  I must have received a bad batch.  As far as the purpose of this gel, I didn&#x27;t think it moisturized my very dry skin at all.</li>
            <li> Works OKAY, but this tiny little tub didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> This is the only moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever loved, and the only one I will ever use for as long as they keep making it (please don&#x27;t ever stop making it!!). It&#x27;s so so light, not greasy in the least, and after you apply it, it almost feels like you didn&#x27;t use any product at all, like your skin is just naturally hydrated and fresh, if that makes sense. The only thing that could be considered a downside is the fragrance, if you don&#x27;t care for it. It smells kind of fake-apple-y...But it goes away pretty quickly after you apply it, and if you like the way their shampoo smells (I do :) ), it probably won&#x27;t bother you.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer did nothing for me. The scent was very mild, and the gel texture did make it feel refreshing, but it was useless to me as a moisturizer. After I would apply it, it almost rolled off of my face in little pieces. It was really hard to explain, but it did not in any way moisturize my dry skin. I also felt like my subsequent makeup application was very uneven. I would not recommend this to anyone. I&#x27;ve since purchased Aveeno Positively Radient Skin Daily Moisturizer and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I have very dry sensitive skin in the winter.  I&#x27;ve used other versions of Garnier moisturizers before, and liked them, so I thought I&#x27;d try this one for my winter moisturizer.  I have never used a moisturizer that is so sticky.  The first time I applied it I thought that I must have used too much, and that was why it was sticky.  So the second time I used it I did so very sparingly, I don&#x27;t think I even got enough on to adequately cover my face I put it on so thinly and lightly.  However, my face was just as sticky.  I tried to wash it off with Cetaphil face wash, and after washing my face two times it was still sticky!  I will never use this product again.  I&#x27;m not sure how it got so many good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I wanted to mention something I didn&#x27;t know before I bought this product: Garnier tests on animals.</li>
            <li> I just used this today and i like the gel,better than white cream as usual. Something transparent and clear works for me.&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell and it feels great on my skin. It cost $8.99 at Wallgreens. Inexpensive and a good moisturizer for my dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. I have very dry skin in the winter but other heavy lotions were making my face break out. This keeps it hydrated without being greasy or too heavy. I like the scent, it is refreshing. Plus, the scent doesn&#x27;t hang around that long.</li>
