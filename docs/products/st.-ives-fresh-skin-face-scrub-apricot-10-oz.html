            <li>ONE OF THE BEST FACIAL SCRUBS.</li>
            <li>I love this scrub...</li>
            <li>These two jars arrive extremely full, all the way to the top!</li>
            <li>you would have to use a moisturizer afterwards and you&#x27;ll feel nice and clean.</li>
            <li>The scrub has a very clean scent.</li>
            <li>Exfoliation is wonderful and it doesn&#x27;t leave my face all dry.</li>
            <li>This scrub is great for exfoliating and makes my skin very soft.  </li>
            <li>She says it has a great texture, decent smell, and makes her face look &amp; feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li>It is cheap, highly reviewed and does a great job.</li>
            <li>your skin will&lt;br /&gt;feel soft and look great.</li>
            <li>This product has a great texture and smell and has helped clear my skin.  </li>
            <li>It is great at keeping skin clear and preventing breakouts.  </li>
            <li>Good scrub, great scent, wish it was a little creamier though</li>
            <li>Love how clean I feel after using this.  </li>
            <li>Strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I did order 4 more tubs at slightly more than the first 2 but still cheaper than in-store.</li>
            <li>When I ran out of it and didn&#x27;t replace it quickly, I noticed an immediate change in the texture of my skin, as well as more break outs and blackheads.</li>
            <li>Feels good, smells good, keeps blemishes down.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well priced, and lasts a long time, and does a good job exfoliating your skin and leaving it nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>Your skin feel fresh and healthy.</li>
            <li>More economical to purchase the jar over the tubs.  </li>
            <li>St Ives is reasonably priced and has a nice grainy feel to the scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Use a light circular motion to scrub.</li>
            <li>I also find that any ointments or creams are better absorbed after I have washed my face with this scrub.</li>
            <li>what and blemish free.</li>
            <li>Between the scrubbing grains and the salicylic acid it gives skin a smooth surface and controls breakouts.</li>
            <li>and my skin did not feel as smooth as it once did</li>
            <li>It helped cut the breakouts but my skin still did not feel as smooth as before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li>Finally I got it here on Amazon and for a great price.  </li>
            <li>This product is great for those that are wishing to get a deep exfoliation when washing their face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The amount of product that you get for the price is also fantastic.</li>
            <li>I thought it was good for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Even though I&#x27;m no where near as oily now, it&#x27;s still good for a pick-me up.</li>
            <li>It smells very fresh</li>
            <li>/&gt;After rinsing off the scrub, it leaves your skin feeling clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li>people highly recommended this and honestly my blackheads are still there.</li>
            <li>My skin feel so fresh and clean after using it!</li>
            <li>my first exfoliater and it cleared most of my skin.</li>
            <li>Cheaper than all other scrubs in the drug stores yet more effective than all of them combined!</li>
            <li>Great for backs after a long day in the sun too.  </li>
            <li>The scrub leaves your face clean and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>The scrub doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin  and great for all skin type.</li>
            <li>Use this before my shaving oil to properly clean my face of dirt and blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not, but I like a &#x27;clean palette&#x27; for some blush etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>keeps skin clean.</li>
            <li>My face feels clean after I use this</li>

            <li>It exfoliates in just the right amount, and this jar packaging is perfect for the shower - just grab as much (or as little) as you need</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s the right weight!</li>
            <li>Makes my face so smooth, fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>but this is the one I am sticking with because its the only one that makes my skin feel good.</li>
            <li>I always loved St. Ive&#x27;s beauty products, especially thier lotions and creams.</li>
            <li>These will last longer than the tube ones I buy at the store and at the time I purchased them,  they were a good price.</li>
            <li>I also love the idea that I can order two tubs at a time much cheaper than getting it at a store.</li>
            <li>One quarter size dab applied in shower with fingertips as your &#x27;scrubber&#x27; for a full minute</li>
            <li>Makes your face feel nice and soft after each wash.</li>
            <li>I love this scrub and it really does work to control acne outbreaks.  </li>
            <li>This product is the real truth when it comes to maintaining a healthy face..</li>
            <li>and it was really very kind to my very dry areas and oily zone.</li>
            <li>I bought these recently after looking thru many face wash products and these seemed to be the most reasonably priced with the best reviews from other users.</li>
            <li>Anything under $5/tub is a great deal (as far as I can find so far) and I&#x27;ve been keeping an eye on this for the good price to come back.</li>
            <li>and it maintains my skin clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>For a fresh clean face look.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face clean, exfoliated and fresh.  </li>
            <li>But it does a great job of exfoliating and deep, gentle cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Yes it does clean up well and smells quite good, but it does and will dry your skin out.</li>
            <li>My husband and I have used this product since high school, and still love it.  </li>
            <li>I really leaves you clean smooth skin.</li>
            <li>Try not to use it every day unless you have a good face lotion to put on afterwards, because it will dry your face out with its Salicylic Acid content.</li>
            <li>I have used a LOT of different brands and types and I experienced variety of side effects like super dry skin, more pimples and irritation.</li>
            <li>But I suppose it&#x27;s fine to wash your face with, just do not expect it to do much.</li>
            <li>a day.&lt;br /&gt;I use this every morning after I work out, first I clean with the &#x27;Fresh Face&#x27; cream cleanser then exfoliate with this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The apricot smells amazing and the tiny beads in the the scrub is not abrasive on my skin.</li>
            <li>Got this 2-pack for just under $8 (as an addon-item) and was well worth it.</li>
            <li>gets my face clan and fresh.</li>
            <li>I have tried a myriad of soaps and other facial cleansers, but this stuff has been the best.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very effective, for removing blackheads and dead skin cells.</li>
            <li>I have very oily hair and skin, this helps keep my skin clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>But St Ives has got the mix right.</li>
            <li>, you get those oil/dry patches and wind up searching for the right night cream...</li>
            <li>I swear, if you treat your skin right before you get wrinkles, it keeps them at bay.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with it the first time I used it, clear your face without drying it.</li>
            <li>I usually break out when I am stressed and this works GREAT to help with breakouts.</li>
            <li>It is gentle and leaves skin soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>It was an okay buy, it really didn&#x27;t work for me though, but i would recommend it still for those who have non sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have always used this stuff and loved it for black heads</li>
            <li>Super good value for such a big jar!</li>
            <li>we actually don&#x27;t run out any more.</li>
            <li>I get carded quite often ;)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m willing to forego.</li>
            <li>Wow, my face feels really smooth after one application.</li>
            <li>Damp face first then use circular motion.  </li>
            <li>This scrub does exactly as the description states.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>scrub as Meijer sells yet much cheaper!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m willing to put up with that risk</li>
            <li>It has a light natural scent, You can find this product in tubes or tubs.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin so smooth and clear.</li>
            <li>I have always enjoyed St. Ives&#x27; facial scrub as I feel it really cleans out my pores and gives my face a really fresh feel.  </li>
            <li>this is way better deal for your money and same exact product.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re ready to go!</li>
            <li>This tub will last me 6 months or more..</li>

            <li>I have suffered from acne and have used many different products including a large number of scrubs.  </li>
            <li>The tub, on the other hand, will keep things sealed nicely inside.</li>
            <li>My skin feels truly clean and smooth afterwards and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li>I feel so clean and soft after I use this.</li>
            <li>I was using the tube version and it would run out pretty fast.</li>
            <li>It is better than any other scrub out there, and I love the big container.</li>

            <li>gently around pimples or acne, it can irritate them.&lt;br /&gt;There are no animal products in this scrub</li>
            <li>Thanks amazon.  </li>
            <li>I have had 5 zits in my whole life and NEVER never had acne.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re ready to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had very oily skin before purchasing this product.</li>
            <li>It was much smoother and softer.</li>
            <li>Extremely fast shipping, shipped in two days.</li>
            <li>It is much easier to take the scrub.</li>
            <li>My skin feels much smoother and clearer than before I had used it.</li>
            <li>a side note, I also use it for keratosis pilaris on my arms and it seems to work really well.</li>
            <li>My daughter absolutely loves this scrub.</li>
            <li>After just one try of this apricot scrub, I immediately noticed how much softer and plump my face was.</li>
            <li>Really cleanses the skin and after one use I saw a difference.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have to use a whole bunch</li>
            <li>and if I have it in the shower, it&#x27;ll fill with water, yet for the much lower cost</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used St. Ives Apricot Scrub on my face for years and it has helped me keep a blemish free face that makes me look younger than my years.</li>
            <li>this is just smooth and goopy, nothing extra.</li>
            <li>However, it hasn&#x27;t really gotten rid of my blackhead woes at all.</li>
            <li>oh my...this really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product really dries out the skin.</li>
            <li>There are lots of the silica beads, so I can really feel it exfoliating my skin well.</li>
            <li>and then it will be kind of messy.</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent, and moisturizers--does not leave my face or body dried out.</li>
            <li>The granules in most products are not large enough to really clean your pores.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many other scrubs</li>
            <li>The only problem is that this did not cure the issue I had originally bought it for.</li>
            <li>This set is great for the price and definitely will last you a long time.</li>
            <li>It was a little odd to me how it didn&#x27;t come with some kind of seal on the top of the jar but</li>
            <li>and I feel like I&#x27;m getting a really deep clean when I use it.</li>
            <li>Great product... comes in clear plastic bag, yet upon opening bag, oddly the actual tubs have no \\&quot;safety\\&quot;</li>
            <li>My daughters loved it and even caught my 10 year old son using it a few times!</li>
            <li>This is the only scrub I use since it is not too harsh nor too mild for my skin and it leaves my face feeling smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>The only real downside is trying to make sure you get all the gritty pieces washed away.</li>
            <li>and I have to say my skin looks healthy and the dark spots have been reduced</li>
            <li>After the first use you can already feel how soft your skin is</li>
            <li>it works or not until next full eczema attack.</li>
            <li>Although I did not purchase mine here on Amazon, I am an Avid Amazon shopper and do review&#x27;s frequently.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s so interesting is how all those beauty editors, magazines bypass this simply amazing cleanser or suggest that apricot kernels might be too rough on the face-the same face they encourage us to use acid peels etc, chemical injections and other stuff when a good cleansing should be a woman&#x27;s priority, especially if you&#x27;re a heavy make up</li>
            <li>hmmmm I am slightly worried that if I don&#x27;t seal the top on the tub</li>
            <li>A lot of &amp;#34;scrubs&amp;#34; have way to few beads - they don&#x27;t feel like much of a scrub, more like a cleansing cream.</li>
            <li>Sure enough, people were on there with the same problem!  </li>
            <li>I started using this product 1 month back and fell in love with this scrub instantly.</li>
            <li>i recommend this to everyone who has oily skin and wants clear skin!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this face scrub because you get a lot of apricot scrub for your money and it works.</li>
            <li>Been using it since jr. high school.</li>
            <li>I  highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t seem harsh at all in terms of chemicals, so many members of my family can use it without reactions.</li>
            <li>I bought this same product and it lasted for 5 months before I had to purchase more and that was with near daily use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am not sure if I would really recommend it as a blemish/blackhead control, as I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference in my skin, but that was not the primary reason I bought it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Be careful not to use it on fresh sunburn though!  </li>
            <li>Well after trying it I gotta say it does live up to its reputation.</li>
            <li>i need something new</li>
            <li>After using this for a week, I noticed some blackheads just coming out in the rinse water, which had never happened before, And the new ones just aren&#x27;t coming up like they used to.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have very sensitive but acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>I really like this product, but it came almost half full...</li>
            <li>It IS a great exfoliator and my face feels very soft after I use it, but it doesn&#x27;t do much other than that, at least not for me.</li>
            <li>I love the scrubbing feel of this on my skin, the scent is there but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Not sure Amazon has a better price than Target or Meijer.</li>
            <li>This stuff works wonders and even makes your skin soft!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say this scrub is better than other big brand babies.</li>
            <li>It has a pretty creamy, thick texture and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Besides, it was hard to squeeze out the last bit I am so glad I found this !</li>
            <li>The actual jar, honestly it would last you a solid year-year and a half depending on how often and how much you use.</li>
            <li>This works very well with oily-combination skin, I am 40 years old and people are constantly complimenting me on my skin!!!</li>
            <li>I swear by it, and so does my clear skin.</li>
            <li>I use it before every shower,  and my face is clear.</li>
            <li>It takes the dead skin of my face, while leaving it feeling smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Does exfoliate and helps keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li>I SO wanted this to really clear a number of my blackheads, as it says on the label.</li>
            <li>Naturally Clear Blemish and Blackhead Control, 10 Ounce</li>
            <li>I swear by it, and so does my clear skin.</li>
            <li>She must use all natural face cleaner.</li>
            <li>Although the container states &amp;#34;100% Natural Exfoliants&amp;#34; do not confuse this for a 100% natural face wash.</li>
            <li>oh so soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost 60, been using this since my forties, my skin is soft as a baby&#x27;s uknow</li>
            <li>St Ives makes a version for &#x27;sensitive skin&#x27; should you want to proceed with caution.</li>
            <li>It is the only one that really controls my skin.  </li>
            <li>Stri-Dex Medicated Pads, Sensitive, 90-Count Boxes (Pack of 3)]]&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>My boyfriend asked me how I got my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>- I use it four times a week because my skin is sensitive, but some people use it every day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 53 years old, and a man.</li>
            <li>People with sensitive skin aren&#x27;t going to be bothered by using it.</li>
            <li>I tried it myself as a woman with mature skin</li>
            <li>It has a slight fragrance too it, not offensive nor strong enough to be a bother for people who don&#x27;t like that sort of thing in my opinion but it doesn&#x27;t linger after I rinse it off my face.</li>
            <li>This large jar lasts a long time, even when used every day...</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and after using my face looks a little more refreshed.</li>
            <li>My face tends to get oily throughout the day, after using this its clean and not completely dried out.(I also use cotton balls with a little bit of rubbing alcohol at night to stop pimples from forming further, yes it does work, just don&#x27;t touch it)  </li>
            <li>I have naturally oily skin and will occasionally get breakouts, but this product helps me maintain a clear complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My formerly rough skin is now soft and smooth--I really can&#x27;t believe this is MY skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Words of warning, the significant other cannot use this due to very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I got this 2-pack almost a year ago and been using it consistently every other day.</li>
            <li>I now use it 2-3 times per week and have seen a major difference in acne control.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found any other facial scrub that has the right consistency of scrub material.  </li>
            <li>The acne on my back has already started to clear up and the pores on my face have shrunken.</li>
            <li>I am 30 years old and have oily skin with a lot of white heads on my nose and under my lips.</li>
            <li>This scrub is not rough unless you over massage it into your skin.</li>
            <li>I am 21 years old and finally decided to take care of my skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have acne, which went away in my early 30s, but I do have a lot of blackheads on my back and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We have used so many acne products that have failed to clear her face as well as they are so over drying for her 13 year old baby skin.</li>
            <li>While the tub style packaging may seem less useful than the tube packaging, I actually prefer it for use/storage of this product in the shower.  </li>
            <li>but the only bad thing is that it kind of drys your face a little more.</li>
            <li>product is thick, with the right amount of grittiness--enough to clean, not enough to damage (at least for this old goat!).</li>
            <li>Unlike potato chips, this product can&#x27;t really settle, so there&#x27;s not really an excuse for filling half the container with air.</li>

            <li> This product has a great texture and smell and has helped clear my skin.  </li>
            <li> It is great at keeping skin clear and preventing breakouts.  </li>
            <li> Good scrub, great scent, wish it was a little creamier though</li>
            <li> Love how clean I feel after using this.  </li>
            <li> Strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I did order 4 more tubs at slightly more than the first 2 but still cheaper than in-store.</li>
            <li> When I ran out of it and didn&#x27;t replace it quickly, I noticed an immediate change in the texture of my skin, as well as more break outs and blackheads.</li>
            <li> Feels good, smells good, keeps blemishes down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well priced, and lasts a long time, and does a good job exfoliating your skin and leaving it nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Your skin feel fresh and healthy.</li>
            <li> More economical to purchase the jar over the tubs.  </li>
            <li> St Ives is reasonably priced and has a nice grainy feel to the scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use a light circular motion to scrub.</li>
            <li> I also find that any ointments or creams are better absorbed after I have washed my face with this scrub.</li>
            <li> what and blemish free.</li>
            <li> Between the scrubbing grains and the salicylic acid it gives skin a smooth surface and controls breakouts.</li>
            <li> and my skin did not feel as smooth as it once did</li>
            <li> It helped cut the breakouts but my skin still did not feel as smooth as before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li> Finally I got it here on Amazon and for a great price.  </li>
            <li> This product is great for those that are wishing to get a deep exfoliation when washing their face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The amount of product that you get for the price is also fantastic.</li>
            <li> I thought it was good for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Even though I&#x27;m no where near as oily now, it&#x27;s still good for a pick-me up.</li>
            <li> It smells very fresh</li>
            <li> /&gt;After rinsing off the scrub, it leaves your skin feeling clean and smooth.  </li>

            <li> Cheaper than all other scrubs in the drug stores yet more effective than all of them combined!</li>
            <li> Great for backs after a long day in the sun too.  </li>
            <li> The scrub leaves your face clean and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> The scrub doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin  and great for all skin type.</li>
            <li> Use this before my shaving oil to properly clean my face of dirt and blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not, but I like a &#x27;clean palette&#x27; for some blush etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> keeps skin clean.</li>
            <li> My face feels clean after I use this</li>
            <li> Thats why it works great for my dry skin.</li>

            <li> It exfoliates in just the right amount, and this jar packaging is perfect for the shower - just grab as much (or as little) as you need</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s the right weight!</li>
            <li> Makes my face so smooth, fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> but this is the one I am sticking with because its the only one that makes my skin feel good.</li>
            <li> I always loved St. Ive&#x27;s beauty products, especially thier lotions and creams.</li>
            <li> These will last longer than the tube ones I buy at the store and at the time I purchased them,  they were a good price.</li>
            <li> I also love the idea that I can order two tubs at a time much cheaper than getting it at a store.</li>
            <li> One quarter size dab applied in shower with fingertips as your &#x27;scrubber&#x27; for a full minute</li>
            <li> Makes your face feel nice and soft after each wash.</li>
            <li> I love this scrub and it really does work to control acne outbreaks.  </li>
            <li> This product is the real truth when it comes to maintaining a healthy face..</li>
            <li> and it was really very kind to my very dry areas and oily zone.</li>
            <li> I bought these recently after looking thru many face wash products and these seemed to be the most reasonably priced with the best reviews from other users.</li>
            <li> Anything under $5/tub is a great deal (as far as I can find so far) and I&#x27;ve been keeping an eye on this for the good price to come back.</li>
            <li> and it maintains my skin clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> For a fresh clean face look.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face clean, exfoliated and fresh.  </li>
            <li> But it does a great job of exfoliating and deep, gentle cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Yes it does clean up well and smells quite good, but it does and will dry your skin out.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have used this product since high school, and still love it.  </li>
            <li> I really leaves you clean smooth skin.</li>
            <li> Try not to use it every day unless you have a good face lotion to put on afterwards, because it will dry your face out with its Salicylic Acid content.</li>
            <li> I have used a LOT of different brands and types and I experienced variety of side effects like super dry skin, more pimples and irritation.</li>
            <li> But I suppose it&#x27;s fine to wash your face with, just do not expect it to do much.</li>
            <li> a day.&lt;br /&gt;I use this every morning after I work out, first I clean with the &#x27;Fresh Face&#x27; cream cleanser then exfoliate with this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The apricot smells amazing and the tiny beads in the the scrub is not abrasive on my skin.</li>
            <li> Got this 2-pack for just under $8 (as an addon-item) and was well worth it.</li>
            <li> gets my face clan and fresh.</li>
            <li> I have tried a myriad of soaps and other facial cleansers, but this stuff has been the best.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very effective, for removing blackheads and dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> I have very oily hair and skin, this helps keep my skin clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> But St Ives has got the mix right.</li>
            <li> , you get those oil/dry patches and wind up searching for the right night cream...</li>
            <li> I swear, if you treat your skin right before you get wrinkles, it keeps them at bay.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with it the first time I used it, clear your face without drying it.</li>
            <li> I usually break out when I am stressed and this works GREAT to help with breakouts.</li>
            <li> It is gentle and leaves skin soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> It was an okay buy, it really didn&#x27;t work for me though, but i would recommend it still for those who have non sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have always used this stuff and loved it for black heads</li>
            <li> Super good value for such a big jar!</li>
            <li> we actually don&#x27;t run out any more.</li>
            <li> I get carded quite often ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to forego.</li>
            <li> Wow, my face feels really smooth after one application.</li>
            <li> Damp face first then use circular motion.  </li>
            <li> This scrub does exactly as the description states.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> scrub as Meijer sells yet much cheaper!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to put up with that risk</li>
            <li> It has a light natural scent, You can find this product in tubes or tubs.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin so smooth and clear.</li>
            <li> I have always enjoyed St. Ives&#x27; facial scrub as I feel it really cleans out my pores and gives my face a really fresh feel.  </li>
            <li> this is way better deal for your money and same exact product.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re ready to go!</li>
            <li> This tub will last me 6 months or more..</li>
            <li> item arrived quickly and was very good bargain if you buy same product in tubes usually,  </li>
            <li> This scrub cleanses your face squeaky clean, it clears acne and leaves your face SO refreshed and soft!</li>
            <li> none the less it was filled to the top</li>
            <li> i use this product for my face and back, it really help my acne, and i love this product very much</li>
            <li> I have suffered from acne and have used many different products including a large number of scrubs.  </li>
            <li> The tub, on the other hand, will keep things sealed nicely inside.</li>
            <li> My skin feels truly clean and smooth afterwards and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> I feel so clean and soft after I use this.</li>
            <li> I was using the tube version and it would run out pretty fast.</li>
            <li> It is better than any other scrub out there, and I love the big container.</li>
            <li> But on my body, it&#x27;s pure genius for getting rid of ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> The grained are large</li>
            <li> Also, the canister is huge, and will last a while.  </li>
            <li> gently around pimples or acne, it can irritate them.&lt;br /&gt;There are no animal products in this scrub</li>
            <li> Thanks amazon.  </li>
            <li> I have had 5 zits in my whole life and NEVER never had acne.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re ready to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had very oily skin before purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> It was much smoother and softer.</li>
            <li> Extremely fast shipping, shipped in two days.</li>
            <li> It is much easier to take the scrub.</li>
            <li> My skin feels much smoother and clearer than before I had used it.</li>
            <li> a side note, I also use it for keratosis pilaris on my arms and it seems to work really well.</li>
            <li> My daughter absolutely loves this scrub.</li>
            <li> After just one try of this apricot scrub, I immediately noticed how much softer and plump my face was.</li>
            <li> Really cleanses the skin and after one use I saw a difference.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to use a whole bunch</li>
            <li> and if I have it in the shower, it&#x27;ll fill with water, yet for the much lower cost</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used St. Ives Apricot Scrub on my face for years and it has helped me keep a blemish free face that makes me look younger than my years.</li>
            <li> this is just smooth and goopy, nothing extra.</li>
            <li> However, it hasn&#x27;t really gotten rid of my blackhead woes at all.</li>
            <li> oh my...this really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product really dries out the skin.</li>
            <li> There are lots of the silica beads, so I can really feel it exfoliating my skin well.</li>
            <li> and then it will be kind of messy.</li>
            <li> It has a nice scent, and moisturizers--does not leave my face or body dried out.</li>
            <li> The granules in most products are not large enough to really clean your pores.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many other scrubs</li>
            <li> The only problem is that this did not cure the issue I had originally bought it for.</li>
            <li> This set is great for the price and definitely will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> It was a little odd to me how it didn&#x27;t come with some kind of seal on the top of the jar but</li>
            <li> and I feel like I&#x27;m getting a really deep clean when I use it.</li>
            <li> Great product... comes in clear plastic bag, yet upon opening bag, oddly the actual tubs have no \\&quot;safety\\&quot;</li>
            <li> My daughters loved it and even caught my 10 year old son using it a few times!</li>
            <li> This is the only scrub I use since it is not too harsh nor too mild for my skin and it leaves my face feeling smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> The only real downside is trying to make sure you get all the gritty pieces washed away.</li>
            <li> and I have to say my skin looks healthy and the dark spots have been reduced</li>
            <li> After the first use you can already feel how soft your skin is</li>
            <li> it works or not until next full eczema attack.</li>
            <li> Although I did not purchase mine here on Amazon, I am an Avid Amazon shopper and do review&#x27;s frequently.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s so interesting is how all those beauty editors, magazines bypass this simply amazing cleanser or suggest that apricot kernels might be too rough on the face-the same face they encourage us to use acid peels etc, chemical injections and other stuff when a good cleansing should be a woman&#x27;s priority, especially if you&#x27;re a heavy make up</li>
            <li> hmmmm I am slightly worried that if I don&#x27;t seal the top on the tub</li>
            <li> A lot of &amp;#34;scrubs&amp;#34; have way to few beads - they don&#x27;t feel like much of a scrub, more like a cleansing cream.</li>
            <li> Sure enough, people were on there with the same problem!  </li>
            <li> I started using this product 1 month back and fell in love with this scrub instantly.</li>
            <li> i recommend this to everyone who has oily skin and wants clear skin!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this face scrub because you get a lot of apricot scrub for your money and it works.</li>
            <li> Been using it since jr. high school.</li>
            <li> I  highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t seem harsh at all in terms of chemicals, so many members of my family can use it without reactions.</li>
            <li> I bought this same product and it lasted for 5 months before I had to purchase more and that was with near daily use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I would really recommend it as a blemish/blackhead control, as I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference in my skin, but that was not the primary reason I bought it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be careful not to use it on fresh sunburn though!  </li>
            <li> Well after trying it I gotta say it does live up to its reputation.</li>
            <li> i need something new</li>
            <li> After using this for a week, I noticed some blackheads just coming out in the rinse water, which had never happened before, And the new ones just aren&#x27;t coming up like they used to.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have very sensitive but acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, but it came almost half full...</li>
            <li> It IS a great exfoliator and my face feels very soft after I use it, but it doesn&#x27;t do much other than that, at least not for me.</li>
            <li> I love the scrubbing feel of this on my skin, the scent is there but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Not sure Amazon has a better price than Target or Meijer.</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonders and even makes your skin soft!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say this scrub is better than other big brand babies.</li>
            <li> It has a pretty creamy, thick texture and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Besides, it was hard to squeeze out the last bit I am so glad I found this !</li>
            <li> The actual jar, honestly it would last you a solid year-year and a half depending on how often and how much you use.</li>
            <li> This works very well with oily-combination skin, I am 40 years old and people are constantly complimenting me on my skin!!!</li>
            <li> I swear by it, and so does my clear skin.</li>
            <li> I use it before every shower,  and my face is clear.</li>
            <li> It takes the dead skin of my face, while leaving it feeling smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Does exfoliate and helps keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li> I SO wanted this to really clear a number of my blackheads, as it says on the label.</li>
            <li> Naturally Clear Blemish and Blackhead Control, 10 Ounce</li>
            <li> I swear by it, and so does my clear skin.</li>
            <li> She must use all natural face cleaner.</li>
            <li> Although the container states &amp;#34;100% Natural Exfoliants&amp;#34; do not confuse this for a 100% natural face wash.</li>
            <li> oh so soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost 60, been using this since my forties, my skin is soft as a baby&#x27;s uknow</li>
            <li> St Ives makes a version for &#x27;sensitive skin&#x27; should you want to proceed with caution.</li>
            <li> It is the only one that really controls my skin.  </li>
            <li> Stri-Dex Medicated Pads, Sensitive, 90-Count Boxes (Pack of 3)]]&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> My boyfriend asked me how I got my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> - I use it four times a week because my skin is sensitive, but some people use it every day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 53 years old, and a man.</li>
            <li> People with sensitive skin aren&#x27;t going to be bothered by using it.</li>
            <li> I tried it myself as a woman with mature skin</li>
            <li> It has a slight fragrance too it, not offensive nor strong enough to be a bother for people who don&#x27;t like that sort of thing in my opinion but it doesn&#x27;t linger after I rinse it off my face.</li>
            <li> This large jar lasts a long time, even when used every day...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and after using my face looks a little more refreshed.</li>
            <li> My face tends to get oily throughout the day, after using this its clean and not completely dried out.(I also use cotton balls with a little bit of rubbing alcohol at night to stop pimples from forming further, yes it does work, just don&#x27;t touch it)  </li>
            <li> I have naturally oily skin and will occasionally get breakouts, but this product helps me maintain a clear complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My formerly rough skin is now soft and smooth--I really can&#x27;t believe this is MY skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Words of warning, the significant other cannot use this due to very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I got this 2-pack almost a year ago and been using it consistently every other day.</li>
            <li> I now use it 2-3 times per week and have seen a major difference in acne control.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found any other facial scrub that has the right consistency of scrub material.  </li>
            <li> The acne on my back has already started to clear up and the pores on my face have shrunken.</li>
            <li> I am 30 years old and have oily skin with a lot of white heads on my nose and under my lips.</li>
            <li> This scrub is not rough unless you over massage it into your skin.</li>
            <li> I am 21 years old and finally decided to take care of my skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have acne, which went away in my early 30s, but I do have a lot of blackheads on my back and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We have used so many acne products that have failed to clear her face as well as they are so over drying for her 13 year old baby skin.</li>
            <li> While the tub style packaging may seem less useful than the tube packaging, I actually prefer it for use/storage of this product in the shower.  </li>
            <li> but the only bad thing is that it kind of drys your face a little more.</li>
            <li> product is thick, with the right amount of grittiness--enough to clean, not enough to damage (at least for this old goat!).</li>
            <li> Unlike potato chips, this product can&#x27;t really settle, so there&#x27;s not really an excuse for filling half the container with air.</li>
            <li> The container does not lie though as the walnuts used as exfoliants are 100% natural; not the plastic exfoliating beads found in other face washes (which are banned in my local).</li>
            <li> I typically use a foaming wash on my face and body after using this apricot scrub, especially on my face and the combination always leaves my skin baby-butt soft.</li>
            <li> Her skin has cleared up so much in just a week&#x27;s use as well as it isn&#x27;t dried out! .</li>
            <li> This will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I have no major skin allergies, it is a sensible product for me.</li>
            <li> I have problems with dry skin on my face, especially during the fall/winter time.  </li>
            <li> I generally use this one because I tend to break out, and it seems to have a grittier texture than their other scrubs.</li>
            <li> This product does not dry out his skin like other acne face wash that have stronger ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Simply taking a small amount and applying it to your face softly massaging does all the exfoliating you will need.</li>
            <li> I have been using St. Ives Apricot scrub for a long time.  </li>
            <li> We have used it for a long time.</li>
            <li> However, if you have a big breakout already present, I know my dermatologist tells me that you should not use a harsh scrub when you have a bunch of pimples already present.</li>
            <li> been using it for a long while now</li>
            <li> Wish I had known about it a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for a long time now and never had anything to complain.</li>
            <li> lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> but its so bad my face is filled with pimple and before ot was clear</li>
            <li> Its not creamy but doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li> I scrub this stuff on my face every single day.</li>
            <li> Its is not harsh on my skin and keeps my acne under control (I use it interchangeably with proactiv-which is a little harsh for me to use daily).</li>
            <li> Usually, it&#x27;s 5-6 bucks from a chain drug store for one small tube, as opposed to two large tubs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The texture of the scrub IS a little on the rough side and might be harsh on those with sensitive skin, but if you have combination skin, this might work for you.</li>
            <li> we got a &amp;#34;similar&amp;#34; product - the house brand of a major drugstore which cost a little less - and</li>
            <li> would just mention to be careful when using the scrub to not let any get in your eyes (like what the label says...).</li>
            <li> Not too rough.</li>
            <li> No need to scrub it into your skin because then, it will become too rough.</li>
            <li> I also like the green tea scrub by this same brand.</li>
            <li> After all, you are scrubbing off dead skin cells and cleansing away oil and dirt--all of the essential blackhead ingredients.</li>
            <li> You may not want to use this daily, but a few times a week leaves your face feeling rejuvinated and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Other salicylic acid containing face washes leave my skin very dry; Noxzema is the biggest offender.</li>
            <li> A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY</li>
            <li> After buying this I sought out to buy other St.Ives products</li>
            <li> I use it every other day!&lt;br /&gt;Tea</li>
            <li> I am a 24 y/o caucasian with combination oily skin, and I use this product about once a day (maybe every other day).</li>
            <li> either so a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars if the smell wasn&#x27;t so sickly sweet and artificial.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I recommend it.</li>
            <li> and I never found it being worse than other more expensive drug store face scrubs.</li>
            <li> Awesome...Use it all over the body, works off the dry skin, heavy dirt, etc.</li>
            <li> I mean scrubbbbb, its pretty hard core pumice!</li>
            <li> Obviously, the apricot shells are hard, so any vigorous rubbing will cause damage.</li>
            <li> tree oil and sesame on the dark spots</li>
            <li> And it leaves behind a residue that makes your skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> I also scrub down the rest of my body from time to time.</li>
            <li> i still have blackheads on my forehead but less than before.</li>
            <li> His face is clearing up and a lot less breakouts.  </li>
            <li> It has helped the black heads on her nose I&#x27;ve noticed.</li>
            <li> Without it, my face turns into a mess.  </li>
            <li> and  any place skin needs a little &amp;#34;boost&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li> I purchased this scrub at my local walgreens for my daughter who suffers from moderate acne.</li>
            <li> It feels like there are grains of sand in the paste that help scrub away dead skin when you use</li>
            <li> Aster a few times that i have used this</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> I use this in the shower (it&#x27;s a bit messy otherwise).</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is heavily fragranced, which is not a problem for me, but might be for some people.</li>
            <li> It can irritate them and actually make them worse.  </li>
            <li> It removes dead skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a scrubbing product so please do not use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I only wish I could use it every day, but apparently exfoliating that often is bad for you.</li>
            <li> Dry flaky skin on my face is no longer and issue in the dry, cold weather.</li>
            <li> I usually use it once a week</li>
            <li> My boyfriend and I both use it and the two pack usually lasts us about 2-3 months.</li>
            <li> St. Ives has been my go-to brand for the past year.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if i prefer the tubs or tubes...</li>
            <li> I have been using St. Ives apricot face scrub for past 8 years</li>
            <li> I use it in the morning and at night for the past 3 months and my acne scars have cleared a lot .</li>
            <li> This usually means I have flaky skin on my face towards the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> The tube will collect water in the lid, giving you old and cold water along with your face scrub when you use it.  </li>
            <li> I had very bad acne as a youth, in large part due to my oily skin, which is still oily to this day.</li>
            <li> and if your using scrubs, don&#x27;t scrub too hard or you will cut your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this scrub for almost 6 months, and it is just decent. :(</li>
            <li> This size Tub is kinda hard to find at stores, so I had my wife order it on amazon.</li>
            <li> and I believe in exfoliating your face at least once</li>
            <li> so if you have delicate skin or a lot of acne blemishes, you shouldn&#x27;t use this because it&#x27;ll irritate your skin and may cause scaring.</li>
            <li> It leaves skin feeling clean and gets rid of nasty oil/debri that could clog pores.</li>
            <li> I had something scratch my eye once and needless to say, it was not a good feeling.</li>
            <li> I could not find this product in stores anymore and got a little frustrated with changing.  </li>
            <li> unfortunately i cannot prove 100%</li>
            <li> Dont gunk your face with soap, it drives the PH crazy</li>
            <li> She loves this stuff and gets mad when I sneak some.</li>
            <li> It broke me out really bad</li>
            <li> I would recommend with people with bad acne to try separate products at a time</li>
            <li> i use to hate the bottle.</li>
            <li> All my friends have bought this product and none have a bad thing to say about this!</li>
            <li> Horrible!  </li>
            <li> This gave me horrible acne, weeping blisters and scabs on my face.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this is fantastic! not just for face and neck...also great for thighs and  any place skin needs a little &amp;#34;boost&amp;#34;...&lt;br /&gt;just keep away from your eyes. This large jar lasts a long time, even when used every day...your skin will&lt;br /&gt;feel soft and look great.</li>
            <li> Even jerks like me wash their faces from time to time. I feel this is the best value out there for acid wash. It is cheap, highly reviewed and does a great job. So buy some you jerkface.</li>
            <li> I have been using St. Ives Apricot scrub for a long time.  The scrub leaves your face clean and refreshed.  I usually use it once a week and it maintains my skin clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this at CVS in smaller tubes until I realized I could buy them in bulk on Amazon.  I haven&#x27;t found any other facial scrub that has the right consistency of scrub material.  My skin feels truly clean and smooth afterwards and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  I have tried many other scrubs but this is the one I am sticking with because its the only one that makes my skin feel good.</li>
            <li> Awesome...Use it all over the body, works off the dry skin, heavy dirt, etc. without over drying.  Even my husband loves it, it doesn&#x27;t have that girly smell to it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product at an excellent price.  Arrived in good shape.  Very happy!  Since I need to write more words that&#x27;s what this is for.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS. Makes my face so smooth, fresh and clean. Been using this for close to 7 years and have been VERY pleased. Exfoliation is wonderful and it doesn&#x27;t leave my face all dry. Other salicylic acid containing face washes leave my skin very dry; Noxzema is the biggest offender. I use this about 3 times a week and one tub will last me a couple of months. This is an unbeatable value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Words of warning, the significant other cannot use this due to very sensitive skin. She must use all natural face cleaner. Although the container states &amp;#34;100% Natural Exfoliants&amp;#34; do not confuse this for a 100% natural face wash. The container does not lie though as the walnuts used as exfoliants are 100% natural; not the plastic exfoliating beads found in other face washes (which are banned in my local).</li>
            <li> St Ives Scrub has been a must for me for 20+ years.  A lot of &amp;#34;scrubs&amp;#34; have way to few beads - they don&#x27;t feel like much of a scrub, more like a cleansing cream. But St Ives has got the mix right.</li>
            <li> This is the best cleanser I ever had. I always look forward on washing my face. I really leaves you clean smooth skin. Even if I toner after I wash you will see there is no dirt left after washing with this product. It is like home facial every time. Your skin feel fresh and healthy.</li>
            <li> The best face scrub available on the market.  With a chef and two teenagers in the house, the subscription service is a lifesaver as well...we actually don&#x27;t run out any more.</li>
            <li> This is the only scrub I use since it is not too harsh nor too mild for my skin and it leaves my face feeling smooth and clean. It has a slight fragrance too it, not offensive nor strong enough to be a bother for people who don&#x27;t like that sort of thing in my opinion but it doesn&#x27;t linger after I rinse it off my face.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to daily skincare product.  I have naturally oily skin and will occasionally get breakouts, but this product helps me maintain a clear complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a paste that exfoliates and helps get dirt and gunk out of your pores and off of your face.  It feels like there are grains of sand in the paste that help scrub away dead skin when you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After rinsing off the scrub, it leaves your skin feeling clean and smooth.  I have never had issues with redness or swelling after exfoliating with this product.  It even smells nice and does not feel like you&#x27;re rubbing chemicals all over your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone needing a go-to facial scrub for daily use.  Hope this review helps!</li>
            <li> I love the scrubbing feel of this on my skin, the scent is there but not overwhelming. The only real downside is trying to make sure you get all the gritty pieces washed away. This doesn&#x27;t seem harsh at all in terms of chemicals, so many members of my family can use it without reactions. I buy this in bulk just so I can use it as often as I want!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years!! It has always cleaned my face well. I usually break out when I am stressed and this works GREAT to help with breakouts. My face tends to get oily throughout the day, after using this its clean and not completely dried out.(I also use cotton balls with a little bit of rubbing alcohol at night to stop pimples from forming further, yes it does work, just don&#x27;t touch it)  The smell is amazing. I mostly struggle with blemishes on my arms and it works just well! I use to buy the smaller one from the store for the same price as this one. I now continue to buy this on amazon instead, since its  (2) 10oz  jars compared to (1) 6oz tube. After buying this I sought out to buy other St.Ives products and I DO NOT regret it.</li>
            <li> I always loved St. Ive&#x27;s beauty products, especially thier lotions and creams. This avocado scrub is the best. It smells very fresh and it&#x27;s very effective, for removing blackheads and dead skin cells. I use this scrub every day and my skin is always glowing. I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have used this product since high school, and still love it.  The consistency and scent are good, and it is a great basic scrub.  With Subscribe and Save, it is also an awesome deal.</li>
            <li> my first exfoliater and it cleared most of my skin. i still have blackheads on my forehead but less than before. lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> ***ST IVES HAS BEEN BOUGHT BY UNILEVER SO THEY NOW TEST ON ANIMALS****&lt;br /&gt;I am 32 and have been using this scrub since I was a teenager. I get carded quite often ;)&lt;br /&gt;This scrub is great, I like my face to feel clean and I believe in exfoliating your face at least once a day.&lt;br /&gt;I use this every morning after I work out, first I clean with the &#x27;Fresh Face&#x27; cream cleanser then exfoliate with this.&lt;br /&gt;Use gently around pimples or acne, it can irritate them.&lt;br /&gt;There are no animal products in this scrub and it is not tested on animals.</li>
            <li> My teen uses this in conjunction with prescription oral meds from the dermatologist.  His face is clearing up and a lot less breakouts.  This product does not dry out his skin like other acne face wash that have stronger ingredients.  More economical to purchase the jar over the tubs.  Will price this locally when the time comes to reorder.  Not sure Amazon has a better price than Target or Meijer.</li>
            <li> I have been using this scrub for over 17 years now and sometime about 3 years ago, the stores stopped selling this size... all the stores stock only the 6-7 oz tubes and I checked amazon.com and scored!! Thanks amazon.  This works very well with oily-combination skin, I am 40 years old and people are constantly complimenting me on my skin!!! I don&#x27;t use makeup, just have used a skin-care regimen that includes this.  The texture of the scrub IS a little on the rough side and might be harsh on those with sensitive skin, but if you have combination skin, this might work for you.</li>
            <li> Horrible!  Ironically this gave me acne!  I have had 5 zits in my whole life and NEVER never had acne.  This gave me horrible acne, weeping blisters and scabs on my face.  I looked like I&#x27;d been in a street fight.  It took three weeks to heal.  It was the only thing in my skin routine that I had changed...so I Googled it out of curiosity.  Sure enough, people were on there with the same problem!  The best advice on the site was to use it on your feet.</li>
            <li> I am 30 years old and have oily skin with a lot of white heads on my nose and under my lips. I started using this product 1 month back and fell in love with this scrub instantly. Smells great, leaves my skin fresh, soft and the best part is- the white heads are disappearing! Will definitely recommend to friends and will buy again!</li>
            <li> These will last longer than the tube ones I buy at the store and at the time I purchased them,  they were a good price.</li>
            <li> I love this facewash/exfoliant and this is the cheapest I have been able to find it. My boyfriend and I both use it and the two pack usually lasts us about 2-3 months.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years upon years. I swear by it, and so does my clear skin. It exfoliates in just the right amount, and this jar packaging is perfect for the shower - just grab as much (or as little) as you need and you&#x27;re ready to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend it and will continue to use this for years to come!</li>
            <li> Been using this stuff for years, just like the product I would purchase in the store but with a better price tag!</li>
            <li> St. Ives has been my go-to brand for the past year. I prefer the tube version of this, but decided to go with this tub to save some money. I got this 2-pack almost a year ago and been using it consistently every other day. My skin feels great after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would just mention to be careful when using the scrub to not let any get in your eyes (like what the label says...). I had something scratch my eye once and needless to say, it was not a good feeling.</li>
            <li> Got this 2-pack for just under $8 (as an addon-item) and was well worth it. Anything under $5/tub is a great deal (as far as I can find so far) and I&#x27;ve been keeping an eye on this for the good price to come back. I did order 4 more tubs at slightly more than the first 2 but still cheaper than in-store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using st. ives apricot scrub for almost 5 years now. I have very oily hair and skin, this helps keep my skin clean and fresh. I also love the idea that I can order two tubs at a time much cheaper than getting it at a store. I had to buy travel tubes so I can take this with me when I travel. The tubs are too big for flying.</li>
            <li> Love the smell! It works great. Not too rough. Will buy again. Super good value for such a big jar!</li>
            <li> I had very oily skin before purchasing this product. Aster a few times that i have used this i began to see a difference in my skin. It was much smoother and softer. All my friends even noticed how much better my skin looked they all commented on how great my skin looks and asked what i was using. All my friends have bought this product and none have a bad thing to say about this! i recommend this to everyone who has oily skin and wants clear skin! I hope this helped!!</li>
            <li> Have been a fan for years but only now tried the tubs (vs. the squeeze bottles) - never going back! Great deal as well!</li>
            <li> I love the tubs they are now in!!! i use to hate the bottle.</li>
            <li> i have been using this for a week since my acne is under control! I use it every other day!&lt;br /&gt;Tea tree oil and sesame on the dark spots and I have to say my skin looks healthy and the dark spots have been reduced will update every week until these marks not blemishes! actual marks are gone</li>
            <li> I really like this product, but it came almost half full... I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s the right weight! Unlike potato chips, this product can&#x27;t really settle, so there&#x27;s not really an excuse for filling half the container with air.</li>
            <li> Best scrub on the market on the market but it&#x27;s on the aggressive side so if you have delicate skin or a lot of acne blemishes, you shouldn&#x27;t use this because it&#x27;ll irritate your skin and may cause scaring.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this product on my face.  But on my body, it&#x27;s pure genius for getting rid of ingrown hairs.  Anywhere.  Ahem.  And it leaves behind a residue that makes your skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> i use this product for my face and back, it really help my acne, and i love this product very much</li>
            <li> Just received this product yesterday and I am already in love. After the first use you can already feel how soft your skin is and you can visually see the difference. If you are scared of buying it because of the reviews about being &amp;#34;too rough&amp;#34; don&#x27;t listen to them! This scrub is not rough unless you over massage it into your skin. Simply taking a small amount and applying it to your face softly massaging does all the exfoliating you will need. No need to scrub it into your skin because then, it will become too rough. It has a pretty creamy, thick texture and goes on smoothly. The scrub has a very clean scent. I wouldn&#x27;t say apricot-y but it is a pleasant somewhat sweet smell. These two jars arrive extremely full, all the way to the top! I have been using what&#x27;s on the lid and that alone could last you a week even using it multiple times a day. The actual jar, honestly it would last you a solid year-year and a half depending on how often and how much you use. Extremely fast shipping, shipped in two days. It was a little odd to me how it didn&#x27;t come with some kind of seal on the top of the jar but none the less it was filled to the top so I&#x27;m not complaining. St. Ives Apricot Scrub has already made my skin look AND feel amazing and I cannot wait to continue using this product for years to come.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never use anything else. It is better than any other scrub out there, and I love the big container.</li>
            <li> I had been using this scrub for many many years. I was using the tube version and it would run out pretty fast. Besides, it was hard to squeeze out the last bit I am so glad I found this ! It is much easier to take the scrub. I use it around 3 times a week and it has done an amazing job of clearing my skin. My skin feels much smoother and clearer than before I had used it.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;seems&amp;#34; because pompholyx eczema has no definitive solution, but this gel help soften hands after blisters appear and skyn dries.&lt;br /&gt; unfortunately i cannot prove 100% it works or not until next full eczema attack. I read of this gel on the web and decide to buy in us and test it....</li>
            <li> I love the st Ives  apricot scrub, and this is a great price.  I use it before every shower,  and my face is clear.</li>
            <li> This will last you a long time. The only problem is if you use this in the shower you will get water in it and then it will be kind of messy. But if you use at the sink you should be good to go</li>
            <li> I am 21 years old and finally decided to take care of my skin. I was looking for something to remove my blemishes and blackheads and finally came upon this. It took a week to see results, I was so amazed. I let my sister know about it and she&#x27;s also been using in. We love it.!! Defiantly buying more of this product.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite face scrub that I love to use on my face. The apricot smells amazing and the tiny beads in the the scrub is not abrasive on my skin. It takes the dead skin of my face, while leaving it feeling smooth and soft. The scrub doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin  and great for all skin type. I highly recommend this face scrub because you get a lot of apricot scrub for your money and it works.</li>
            <li> Whoever posted pictures concerned about the product not having a protective seal must not have realized this isn&#x27;t for breakfast, it&#x27;s for your face! This is the best product I have ever used!</li>
            <li> I have suffered from acne and have used many different products including a large number of scrubs.  The St. Ives Apricot Scrub has worked the best out of all the products I have tried for my skin.  I started using this product about a year ago and I love it!  I use it everyday.  This scrub is great for exfoliating and makes my skin very soft.  This product has a great texture and smell and has helped clear my skin.  This is a great product and I would recommend it to any friend!</li>
            <li> I use this on my head (I shave my head), face, shoulders and back to reduce bumps, blackheads and zits. It works well and is simple to use. Recommended.</li>
            <li> It broke me out really bad i want my money back.. I thought it was good for sensitive skin but its so bad my face is filled with pimple and before ot was clear just had backheads but now it has both</li>
            <li> St. Ives has been around for a while. I trust their products, but don&#x27;t expect it to get rid of all your blemishes and acne. I would recommend with people with bad acne to try separate products at a time so their skin won&#x27;t get too used one product and stop working. Benzoyl peroxide at some nights, and a moisturizer during the day with SPF. and if your using scrubs, don&#x27;t scrub too hard or you will cut your skin. mix it up and match every now and then. Proactive works too.</li>
            <li> I spend a LOT of money on different facial washes, masks, creams, etc.  This is, and always will be, a staple in my bathroom.  I use it on my face, arms, legs, shoulders...  I typically use a foaming wash on my face and body after using this apricot scrub, especially on my face and the combination always leaves my skin baby-butt soft.</li>
            <li> St Ives is reasonably priced and has a nice grainy feel to the scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I have no major skin allergies, it is a sensible product for me.</li>
            <li> I love all of St. Ives&#x27; apricot scrubs. I generally use this one because I tend to break out, and it seems to have a grittier texture than their other scrubs. When I ran out of it and didn&#x27;t replace it quickly, I noticed an immediate change in the texture of my skin, as well as more break outs and blackheads. Really love this stuff! Also, Amazon has by far the best price. Usually, it&#x27;s 5-6 bucks from a chain drug store for one small tube, as opposed to two large tubs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, I also use it for keratosis pilaris on my arms and it seems to work really well. Probably the salicylic acid.</li>
            <li> Good deal for a great product. My daughters loved it and even caught my 10 year old son using it a few times! Will buy again!</li>
            <li> My daughter absolutely loves this scrub. She says it has a great texture, decent smell, and makes her face look &amp; feel silky smooth. I purchased the 2-pack at a great price. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I really love it! My skin feel so fresh and clean after using it! Will come back for it again!</li>
            <li> this is great value for the st ives that you buy in the stores in the tube. the only downfall is that you have to twist open the jar everytime but it&#x27;s a sacrifice I&#x27;m willing to forego.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this scrub since May and I&#x27;ve fallen in love. I&#x27;m a big fan of neutrogena so I was always using their products and my skin started to get immune so I needed to make a swtich. I have combination/oily skin and this has worked wonders for me! My skin is no longer as oily and greasy as before. The scrub is really effective and I feel like I&#x27;m getting a really deep clean when I use it. It dries up my pimples and washes away my blackheads. I adore this scrub and I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> Use this before my shaving oil to properly clean my face of dirt and blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;Does the job and smells great in the morning or afternoon, making my hair stand up pretty well!&lt;br /&gt;One of the best face scrubs.</li>
            <li> I use this in the shower (it&#x27;s a bit messy otherwise). It feels like a nice face massage and leaves my skin feeling oh so soft. I am not sure if I would really recommend it as a blemish/blackhead control, as I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference in my skin, but that was not the primary reason I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;It is heavily fragranced, which is not a problem for me, but might be for some people.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for some time now and love it. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and after using my face looks a little more refreshed.</li>
            <li> Wow, my face feels really smooth after one application. I occasionally break out from this product, though.</li>
            <li> This scrub is great value and a great exfoliator. I love St. Ives, it is the perfect combo of natural ingredients and blemish fighting chemicals. Its is not harsh on my skin and keeps my acne under control (I use it interchangeably with proactiv-which is a little harsh for me to use daily).</li>
            <li> this is the best facial scrub for the money. gets my face clan and fresh. I will buy by this facial scrub</li>
            <li> Does exfoliate and helps keep my skin clear. Just not wowed by the product. I&#x27;m not wowed by many products, btw. Good price.</li>
            <li> My husband and I are both big fans of this product. We have used it for a long time. It is wonderful for exfoliating the face. I also use it on my knees, elbows and heels when they need it. It is gentle and leaves skin soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my wife&#x27;s stash. She loves this stuff and gets mad when I sneak some. It has helped the black heads on her nose I&#x27;ve noticed.</li>
            <li> After just one try of this apricot scrub, I immediately noticed how much softer and plump my face was. I am a 24 y/o caucasian with combination oily skin, and I use this product about once a day (maybe every other day). I will literally use this exfoliating scrub for the rest of my life. I also scrub down the rest of my body from time to time. It works wonders! I would advise following this by using the St Ives Timeless Skin lotion/cream... that stuff is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Been using it since jr. high school. You can&#x27;t beat a 2-pack of these big jars for $7, that is just outrageously low.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with it the first time I used it, clear your face without drying it. It makes your face glow after using. Besides, it smells good. I have stored up many bottles. You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> I always use Clinique facial scrub, but since I tried st Ives I am hooked.  The grained are large you can feel them message into the skin deep cleaning. Damp face first then use circular motion.  Will always buy this from now on.</li>
            <li> This scrub does exactly as the description states. It leaves skin feeling clean and gets rid of nasty oil/debri that could clog pores. Obviously, the apricot shells are hard, so any vigorous rubbing will cause damage. Use a light circular motion to scrub. And at a price of just $6 for TWO tubs? This is the best deal you can find! I have oily acne prone skin and never have breakouts caused by this scrub. I do still get hormonal breakouts here and there, but continued usage keeps them at bay. I also find that any ointments or creams are better absorbed after I have washed my face with this scrub.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost 60, been using this since my forties, my skin is soft as a baby&#x27;s uknow what and blemish free. What&#x27;s so interesting is how all those beauty editors, magazines bypass this simply amazing cleanser or suggest that apricot kernels might be too rough on the face-the same face they encourage us to use acid peels etc, chemical injections and other stuff when a good cleansing should be a woman&#x27;s priority, especially if you&#x27;re a heavy make up user-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not, but I like a &#x27;clean palette&#x27; for some blush etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And St Ives makes a version for &#x27;sensitive skin&#x27; should you want to proceed with caution. If you have regular blackheads, bumps, oiliness etc. however, start with this if you want a good scrub. One quarter size dab applied in shower with fingertips as your &#x27;scrubber&#x27; for a full minute is all you need and rinse off. Dont gunk your face with soap, it drives the PH crazy, you get those oil/dry patches and wind up searching for the right night cream...what a billion dollar business. Back to basics!!!!</li>
            <li> It was an okay buy, it really didn&#x27;t work for me though, but i would recommend it still for those who have non sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I love this scrub.  I have used it for years.  It is great at keeping skin clear and preventing breakouts.  However, if you have a big breakout already present, I know my dermatologist tells me that you should not use a harsh scrub when you have a bunch of pimples already present. It can irritate them and actually make them worse.  This is a great deal as you get 2 tubs of scrub for under $8.  You can&#x27;t beat it.  In the stores the smaller tube which is about 7 oz is about $6 so this is awesome.  Love. Will def. keeping purchasing.</li>
            <li> Loved this!!! Bought it after I saw all the great Reviews and I have very sensitive but acne prone skin. This stuff works wonders and even makes your skin soft! My mom uses it just for the way it makes her skin look and feel!</li>
            <li> The tubs are so much better than the tubes! I am so glad to have found this!!</li>
            <li> I wish I had this product when I was a teen.  I used a similar product by DDF for a decade and they discontinued it.  I tried EVERY product on the market until I found this.  It is the only one that really controls my skin.  I wash with it twice a day and NEVER have a blemish.  Without it, my face turns into a mess.  The granules in most products are not large enough to really clean your pores.  This includes all the Proactive and Clearasil products.  They worked &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;, but not like this.</li>
            <li> keeps skin clean. does not actually cure pimples</li>
            <li> This product is an amazing scrub. Makes your face feel nice and soft after each wash. Try not to use it every day unless you have a good face lotion to put on afterwards, because it will dry your face out with its Salicylic Acid content.</li>
            <li> I ordered this in bulk because my boyfriend uses the &amp;#34;Naturally Clear&amp;#34; St Ives on a daily basis. The picture shows that this is the &amp;#34;Naturally Clear&amp;#34; apricot scrub; however the jars I received are the &amp;#34;Blemish Control&amp;#34; variety, which is a slightly different consistency.</li>
            <li> I got two apricot scrubs and used it with my Olay deep cleaning brush.. My skin feels so smooth! I&#x27;m glad I got this product! Really cleanses the skin and after one use I saw a difference. I didn&#x27;t have to use a whole bunch either so a little goes a long way! I recommend this product. ;)</li>
            <li> Love how clean I feel after using this.  It&#x27;s a much better deal buying in bulk on here rather than box stores.</li>
            <li> Great product... comes in clear plastic bag, yet upon opening bag, oddly the actual tubs have no \\&quot;safety\\&quot; seal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Same scrub as Meijer sells yet much cheaper! :) Most stores sell the tubes. I&#x27;m not sure if i prefer the tubs or tubes... hmmmm I am slightly worried that if I don&#x27;t seal the top on the tub and if I have it in the shower, it&#x27;ll fill with water, yet for the much lower cost I&#x27;m willing to put up with that risk</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d believe that this is the best scrub in the market, and the price is more than fair. Strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used St. Ives Apricot Scrub on my face for years and it has helped me keep a blemish free face that makes me look younger than my years.</li>
            <li> Mix this and the Neutrogena face wash- acne alchemy.The Simpsons is the best show of all time. Need another word.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well priced, and lasts a long time, and does a good job exfoliating your skin and leaving it nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff.  it works for my tween (now teen) boy and for me.  it has almost no smell, which is very important to me.  we got a &amp;#34;similar&amp;#34; product - the house brand of a major drugstore which cost a little less - and it had some kind of drying agent that my son didn&#x27;t like at all.  Hesaid  it hurt his skin.  this is just smooth and goopy, nothing extra.</li>
            <li> I have been using St. Ives apricot face scrub for past 8 years and I never found it being worse than other more expensive drug store face scrubs. I&#x27;d say this scrub is better than other big brand babies. The scent is very pleasant, and the scrub does not irritate the skin nor breaks it out. I have used a LOT of different brands and types and I experienced variety of side effects like super dry skin, more pimples and irritation. This scrub cleanses your face squeaky clean, it clears acne and leaves your face SO refreshed and soft! Cheaper than all other scrubs in the drug stores yet more effective than all of them combined! I also like the green tea scrub by this same brand. So try it out as well.</li>
            <li> I love it. I love how my skin feel after using it. It helps with acne.</li>
            <li> Good scrub, great scent, wish it was a little creamier though</li>
            <li> Very good exfoliate r for the skin. Also helps get rid of blemishes. I have used it for years. It removes dead skin. For a fresh clean face look.</li>
            <li> The truth is, this makes your face feel very nice and clean.The exfoliating beads make you feel like its working well. I have not actually seen any difference in my facial composition. It hasn&#x27;t done anything to prevent or get rid of blackheads. It also hasn&#x27;t made a difference in blemishes. But I suppose it&#x27;s fine to wash your face with, just do not expect it to do much.</li>
            <li> I scrub this stuff on my face every single day. It for sure helped decrease and prevent breakouts on my face.</li>
            <li> I thought it was an all over body scrub. But I will still use it. Smells nice and feels great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this scrub for almost 6 months, and it is just decent. :( I SO wanted this to really clear a number of my blackheads, as it says on the label. However, it hasn&#x27;t really gotten rid of my blackhead woes at all. It IS a great exfoliator and my face feels very soft after I use it, but it doesn&#x27;t do much other than that, at least not for me.</li>
            <li> This scrub has been a favorite of mine for years. Between the scrubbing grains and the salicylic acid it gives skin a smooth surface and controls breakouts. It has a light natural scent, You can find this product in tubes or tubs. The tubs are a much better value.</li>
            <li> This scrub is great for me. I use it in the morning and at night for the past 3 months and my acne scars have cleared a lot . Also this is great for getting rid of pimples faster . I&#x27;m glad I bought this !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for about a month now, and I love it. My face is smoother than it&#x27;s ever been and it feels great. The only problem is that this did not cure the issue I had originally bought it for. While my skin is smooth, I still suffer from abundant blackheads and expanded pores on my nose. Perhaps I need something a bit stronger, but this product does its job, even if it&#x27;s not the job I needed it for.</li>
            <li> I have had problems with acne since teens. I finally had it under control about 10 years ago by using Paula&#x27;s Choice 10% AHA at night and 5% BHA in the morning along with 2.5 Benzoyl Peroxide. However, it seemed like my skincare routine plateaued about 5 years ago and I started breaking out again and my skin did not feel as smooth as it once did so I added another exfoliant, a Mia Clarisonic. It helped cut the breakouts but my skin still did not feel as smooth as before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to about a month ago when I purchased this and oh my...this really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skincare routine now is as follows. I have discovered more affordable product that work the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day (In order of usage.)&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;- Cleanse skin with Mia Clarisonic and Philosophy Purity&lt;br /&gt;- Exfoliate with Paula&#x27;s Choice 10% AHA&lt;br /&gt;- Treat with Acne.org 2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide&lt;br /&gt;- Moisturize with [[ASIN:B000UVZU1S St. Ives Facial Moisturizer, Timeless Skin Collagen Elastin, 10oz]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Night (In order of usage.)&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;- Cleanse with Philosophy Purity to remove makeup.&lt;br /&gt;- Exfoliate with [[ASIN:B004JLEGTC St. Ives Apricot Scrub Naturally Clear Blemish and Blackhead Control, 10 Ounce (Pack of 2)]]&lt;br /&gt;- Cleanse pores with 5% BHA [[ASIN:B000II57AW Stri-Dex Medicated Pads, Sensitive, 90-Count Boxes (Pack of 3)]]&lt;br /&gt;- Treat with Acne.org 2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide&lt;br /&gt;- Moisturize with [[ASIN:B000UVZU1S St. Ives Facial Moisturizer, Timeless Skin Collagen Elastin, 10oz]]</li>
            <li> i am 30, and have been using this daily since i was 16. I also use this in addition to philosophy (help me, hope in a jar, purity) and have been using those since i was 23. My skin is so youthful, my combination skin is no longer as oily. I swear, if you treat your skin right before you get wrinkles, it keeps them at bay. buy this for your teenagers and teach them the proper way to cleanse!</li>
            <li> Bought this last week and I am in love! People are already complimenting me on my skin. My boyfriend asked me how I got my skin so soft. The acne on my back has already started to clear up and the pores on my face have shrunken. I feel so clean and soft after I use this. I&#x27;ve told all my friends to use it. Would 100% recommend it!</li>
            <li> Feels good, smells good, keeps blemishes down. Lasts forever too. Love it.</li>
            <li> I bought these recently after looking thru many face wash products and these seemed to be the most reasonably priced with the best reviews from other users. Well after trying it I gotta say it does live up to its reputation. My skin feels smoother and ive seen some reduction in pimples</li>
            <li> I could not find this product in stores anymore and got a little frustrated with changing.  Finally I got it here on Amazon and for a great price.  Leaves my face clean, exfoliated and fresh.  Great for backs after a long day in the sun too.  Be careful not to use it on fresh sunburn though!  Only use it after the skin heals and pealing begins.</li>
            <li> I love this scrub and it really does work to control acne outbreaks.  I now use it 2-3 times per week and have seen a major difference in acne control.</li>
            <li> Its the best and I&#x27;ve used it for years - I&#x27;ve tried more expensive scrubs, but always go back to St Ives - I use it four times a week because my skin is sensitive, but some people use it every day.</li>
            <li> I have problems with dry skin on my face, especially during the fall/winter time.  This usually means I have flaky skin on my face towards the end of the day.  I have tried a myriad of soaps and other facial cleansers, but this stuff has been the best.  I only use it maybe once every four days.  But it does a great job of exfoliating and deep, gentle cleaning.  Dry flaky skin on my face is no longer and issue in the dry, cold weather.</li>
            <li> As a man, this stuff is awesome.  Gets some nice exfoliation going, and it smells great.  Also, the canister is huge, and will last a while.  This stuff is a deal.  I only wish I could use it every day, but apparently exfoliating that often is bad for you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so affordable.  I use it on my back as well as my face when I take a shower.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great for back-acnes and exfoliation!</li>
            <li> Superb...go for it....love this. It works great.....i m happy with my purchase. I  highly recommend this product. 5 star rating..</li>
            <li> Product arrived in great shape and no damage .&lt;br /&gt;Scrub works well.&lt;br /&gt;Need to  buy more  but price is increasing</li>
            <li> people highly recommended this and honestly my blackheads are still there. been using it for a long while now and i can not see any difference. i need something new</li>
            <li> My face feels clean after I use this but the only bad thing is that it kind of drys your face a little more. you would have to use a moisturizer afterwards and you&#x27;ll feel nice and clean.</li>
            <li> This is the best facial cleanser/scrub i have EVER used. I&#x27;ve been using it for 10 years now i wanna say. If this stuff ever goes away i will cry lol It keeps my skin so smooth and clear. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have always enjoyed St. Ives&#x27; facial scrub as I feel it really cleans out my pores and gives my face a really fresh feel.  This set is great for the price and definitely will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> item arrived quickly and was very good bargain if you buy same product in tubes usually,  this is way better deal for your money and same exact product.  I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I have been using St. Ives Apricot Scrub as my only facial cleanser for about 20 years now.  The simplicity and effectiveness of this product is really remarkable for keeping my face clean.  While the tub style packaging may seem less useful than the tube packaging, I actually prefer it for use/storage of this product in the shower.  The tube will collect water in the lid, giving you old and cold water along with your face scrub when you use it.  The tub, on the other hand, will keep things sealed nicely inside.</li>
            <li> St. Ives is a great product brand. I&#x27;ve used it many times. Yes it does clean up well and smells quite good, but it does and will dry your skin out. It&#x27;s a scrubbing product so please do not use it everyday.</li>
            <li> This product is the real truth when it comes to maintaining a healthy face..Noticed a big difference the next day.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years upon years. I swear by it, and so does my clear skin. It exfoliates in just the right amount, and this jar packaging is perfect for the shower - just grab as much (or as little) as you need and you&#x27;re ready to go!</li>
            <li> This product really dries out the skin. Especially if you have oily skin. Look into better products.</li>
            <li> I have always used this stuff and loved it for black heads</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 53 years old, and a man. I had very bad acne as a youth, in large part due to my oily skin, which is still oily to this day. I don&#x27;t have acne, which went away in my early 30s, but I do have a lot of blackheads on my back and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff does a number on my blackheads. And why shouldn&#x27;t it? After all, you are scrubbing off dead skin cells and cleansing away oil and dirt--all of the essential blackhead ingredients. After using this for a week, I noticed some blackheads just coming out in the rinse water, which had never happened before, And the new ones just aren&#x27;t coming up like they used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is thick, with the right amount of grittiness--enough to clean, not enough to damage (at least for this old goat!). It has a nice scent, and moisturizers--does not leave my face or body dried out. My formerly rough skin is now soft and smooth--I really can&#x27;t believe this is MY skin. I spend a couple of minutes rubbing it in, in the shower, then give myself a good rinse. My face looks considerably younger, too--nice glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all these years, it&#x27;s nice to look a notch or two better! Wish I had known about it a long time ago. Guys, heads up. Taking care of your skin isn&#x27;t just for the opposite sex!</li>
            <li> I can feel the difference between this scrub and others. This never leaves my skin feeling scratched. Its not creamy but doesn&#x27;t dry my skin. Thats why it works great for my dry skin. It works in all seasons and it great for body scrub. I have been using these for a long time now and never had anything to complain. The quantity, price and product are all excellent!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product FOREVER. It&#x27;s like going to a spa because the &#x27;scrub&#x27; treats your face. Even though I&#x27;m no where near as oily now, it&#x27;s still good for a pick-me up. Don&#x27;t be detered by the &#x27;creamy dirt&#x27; composition of the product. This stuff really works wonders after a few days. And it does not sting/tingle upon self-application either. People with sensitive skin aren&#x27;t going to be bothered by using it. Definently recomended.</li>
            <li> Although I did not purchase mine here on Amazon, I am an Avid Amazon shopper and do review&#x27;s frequently. I purchased this scrub at my local walgreens for my daughter who suffers from moderate acne. We have used so many acne products that have failed to clear her face as well as they are so over drying for her 13 year old baby skin. This scrub is AMAZING! Her skin has cleared up so much in just a week&#x27;s use as well as it isn&#x27;t dried out! . I tried it myself as a woman with mature skin and it was really very kind to my very dry areas and oily zone. I will purchase this on Amazon next time as it is a great savings!</li>
            <li> There are lots of the silica beads, so I can really feel it exfoliating my skin well. I would give it 5 stars if the smell wasn&#x27;t so sickly sweet and artificial. Other than that, I recommend it.</li>
            <li> CLEANSES AND SOOTHES THE SKIN. VERY AFFORDABLE AND BEST OF ALL....IT WORKS. ONE OF THE BEST FACIAL SCRUBS. A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY</li>
            <li> This size Tub is kinda hard to find at stores, so I had my wife order it on amazon. I love this scrub... I mean scrubbbbb, its pretty hard core pumice! You may not want to use this daily, but a few times a week leaves your face feeling rejuvinated and refreshed. This tub will last me 6 months or more..</li>
            <li> This product is great for those that are wishing to get a deep exfoliation when washing their face. Personally, I have had a problem with acne my entire life but when I use this product I see a noticeable difference in the way my skin looks and feels. Now when I don&#x27;t use this on my face and skin I don&#x27;t feel like I get a deep clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The amount of product that you get for the price is also fantastic. I bought this same product and it lasted for 5 months before I had to purchase more and that was with near daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone that has problems with acne or those for want a deep facial cleanse.</li>
