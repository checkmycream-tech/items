            <li>and I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments from people who thought they were my real lashes.</li>
            <li>there is days when I don&#x27;t wear much eyeshadow</li>
            <li>these were a bit much</li>
            <li>but they looked REALLY</li>

            <li>I plan on using them for special events and on nights I want to make a big impact with my eyes and makeup.  </li>
            <li>When it arrived, I notice that it was too big and full.</li>
            <li>Waste of money, lashes only good for halloween look.</li>
            <li>yes, theyre long and full.</li>
            <li>I normally wear #16, #38 paired together for a fuller look.</li>

            <li>these give that dramatic flare I wanted without being too over the top.</li>
            <li>really cute idea but too dramatic and huge/LONG.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t wear it day time but for a dramatic sexy look for the evening it may work.</li>
            <li>The band is kind of thick and the lashes are a bit heavy</li>

            <li> Super long but don&#x27;t look ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Lashes were to long and big.</li>
            <li> way to long for me.</li>
            <li> Long and luscious.</li>
            <li> They are really long</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t going for that look definitely not natural</li>
            <li> However,  they are definitely not meant to wear any other time than maybe a Halloween party.</li>
            <li> my eyes are small and set deep in my face and my nose is a bit on the big side, so these lashes give an illusion of balance to my face.</li>
            <li> Think drag, shows, or pinup bombshell.  </li>
            <li> You may wish to split them for use as the drag queens say...</li>
            <li> everything i had expected</li>
            <li> it makes me look like a drag queen, not my style.</li>
            <li> Not recommended for everyday use though, like I said they are wayyy too long.</li>
            <li> I love the wispy look and like the #102&#x27;s because are fuller at the base and as lash extends out they are wispy and does not give that &amp;#34;drag&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> little too drag even though i like them abnormally thick and long</li>
            <li> They are also heavy, because how damn big and thick they are, so take note.</li>
            <li> i wear false lashes daily and these are my go-to!</li>
            <li> theyre my favorite lashes, so i wasnt disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very heavy on my eyes</li>
            <li> here, some of mine were a bit wonky looking.</li>
            <li> however , i wasnt disappointed.</li>
            <li> r bent and twisted all up!!!</li>
            <li> i ordered theses lashes and they are horrible......</li>
            <li> These are very dramatic!!!!!  </li>

            <li> Easy to apply and I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments from people who thought they were my real lashes.</li>
            <li> i ordered theses lashes and they are horrible......they look like they r bent and twisted all up!!! i brought a pack of 6 and i gave them a try 2x but i cant wear these!!!!!</li>
            <li> Very big glamourous whispie lashes!! I&#x27;m absolutely IN LOVE. The band is kind of thick and the lashes are a bit heavy but they&#x27;re completely worth it.</li>
            <li> love red cherry lashes!! these ones in particular are super long, like up to your eyebrows long!! I plan on using them for special events and on nights I want to make a big impact with my eyes and makeup.  They feel really soft and stay put for hours until you take them off, I use LashGrip adhesive.  Longest I have had them on was 8 hours and only came off because I took them off. Not recommended for everyday use though, like I said they are wayyy too long.</li>
            <li> OK ladies, I&#x27;ve been wearing false lashes every day for about 5 years. I love red cherry, loved the 199&#x27;s for a while now but loved how whispy the 102&#x27;s looked... ordered and love love love them... they are very long and fun, super sexy! my eyes are small and set deep in my face and my nose is a bit on the big side, so these lashes give an illusion of balance to my face. If you&#x27;re looking for a big fun size for a night out, get these! If you&#x27;re like me and just love wearing big, bold lashes every day, no matter what, then you will also want to buy these! One last tip, always buy 100% human hair lashes, something red cherry delivers! Love RED CHERRY 102!!!</li>
            <li> These are thick huge lashes. Think drag, shows, or pinup bombshell.  But don&#x27;t think natural.  They are also heavy, because how damn big and thick they are, so take note. You may wish to split them for use as the drag queens say... I.e. cut apart and paste in pieces. They are beautiful, exactly the look I want, and I find it hard to find really huge lashes like this, let alone for this type of price.  So 5 stars, as usual Red Cherry is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I love love love love love eyelashes and wear them pretty much everyday. these give that dramatic flare I wanted without being too over the top. People always compliment me when I wear these and I feel sexy because they give me that extra umph.</li>
            <li> LOOOOOVE these. My favorite lashes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing !! I love how it add some pop to my eyes there is days when I don&#x27;t wear much eyeshadow but I wear red cherry lashes and it really makes me look better !!</li>
            <li> these worked great and arrived promptly. everything i had expected and this is a convenient way to buy eyelashes</li>
            <li> really cute idea but too dramatic and huge/LONG. way to long for me. it makes me look like a drag queen, not my style.</li>
            <li> Long and luscious. If you aren&#x27;t into longer lashes (almost to my eyebrows) then this isn&#x27;t for you. At first they do look rather tacky, but once you wear them for at least 20-30 minutes, they look beautiful.</li>
            <li> The quality of these lashes are amazing. However,  they are definitely not meant to wear any other time than maybe a Halloween party.</li>
            <li> They are really long and I wasn&#x27;t going for that look definitely not natural</li>
            <li> Very heavy on my eyes and it&#x27;s a pain in the butt if you wear glasses like me, shipping was fast and packaging was great so unless it&#x27;s for club wear I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them</li>
            <li> little too drag even though i like them abnormally thick and long these were a bit much</li>
            <li> I love fake eyelashes and wear them daily. These ones are nice and thick but they are so long that they don&#x27;t look natural at all.</li>
            <li> Lashes r the best and great price and arrival fast would love to order same exact again thank u</li>
            <li> When it arrived, I notice that it was too big and full. I was hoping that it would look more natural. I won&#x27;t wear it day time but for a dramatic sexy look for the evening it may work.</li>
            <li> These are very dramatic!!!!!  Perfect for a very special event where you want your eyes to just be the highlight of attention.</li>
            <li> if you order from madamemadeline, theyre always flawless wispies. here, some of mine were a bit wonky looking. however , i wasnt disappointed. theyre super affordable and id buy them again! i wore them regardless, wispies arent meant to be perfect. theyre my favorite lashes, so i wasnt disappointed! yes, theyre long and full. but so beautiful. i wear false lashes daily and these are my go-to!</li>
            <li> Lashes were to long and big. Yes they are falsies but they looked REALLY false.&lt;br /&gt;Sent them my youngest sister in California who likes those types. I prefer natural looking ones.</li>
            <li> When I received the lashes they were NOT red cherry but a generic brand! Waste of money, lashes only good for halloween look.</li>
            <li> Dramatic lashes, beautiful quality!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased these and they were delivered on 12/3/14. I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these! I have been wearing red cherry for several years. I normally wear #16, #38 paired together for a fuller look. I love the wispy look and like the #102&#x27;s because are fuller at the base and as lash extends out they are wispy and does not give that &amp;#34;drag&amp;#34; look. I have been wearing these daily. I am so in LOVE with these and are my go to lashes for good!</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering these and I absolutely love these lashes. I wear lashes every day. These are amazing for a night out at the club. Super long but don&#x27;t look ridiculous. You can definitely get more than one use out of these as well. I will for sure be ordering more.</li>
