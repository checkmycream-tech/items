            <li>I must say that I was impressed by the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Voluminous Million Lashes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>This is a great deal at seven bucks, and since you should through out mascara every six months, I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wasting a lot of money.</li>
            <li>Great for lower lashes too.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>This mascara makes my eyelashes look very nice.</li>
            <li>and I can tell you that this as good as all of them.</li>
            <li>, an this one is actually good.</li>
            <li>I think I like my Great Lash better.</li>
            <li>I mostly wanted longer lashes, though, so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>Stays on (no flaking off) and looking nice all day.</li>
            <li>Another good thing is that it is easily removable with soap and water.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one does a great job of applying the mascara and allowing you to build upon the first coat.</li>
            <li>Love the applicator, too -- spiky designs are my favorite.</li>
            <li>:).</li>
            <li>Needs to be replaced every three months, but it goes on smoothly and without clumps!</li>
            <li>I am the type of person that tries on the latest and greatest mascaras.  </li>
            <li>It has good length but doesn&#x27;t do much for volumne, contrary to the name of the product, just FYI.</li>
            <li>Easy on, easy off.  </li>
            <li>liked the applicator brush as it was easy to use, but the liquid was too much for me.</li>

            <li>This mascara is ok when first opened</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also appears to be consistently available in drug stores which is a concern if you suddenly need some when you are traveling or need a new one on the fly.</li>
            <li>With a regular wand, I would brush through the clumps to try and get better coverage, but with this wand, I don&#x27;t want to do that because it is so easy to accidentally flick it and send spatters of mascara all over my face.  </li>
            <li>And they look pretty, clean and they don&#x27;t stick together.</li>
            <li>I like the consistency of this mascara, its flexibility once it dries on the lashes, the appearance of a more volume, and the deep brown-black color.</li>
            <li>This is my first time buying mascara that was not a designer mascara.</li>
            <li>Not sure if the mascara is different or better than any other, but the clever applicator (teensy tiny rubbery fingers instead of a brush) makes for very nice application without clumps, even on my very fine textured lashes!</li>
            <li>Easy to apply to upper and lower lashes, nice shade of brownish black, and no clumps.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, mascara is largely about the applicator/wand.</li>
            <li>but I it seems like it&#x27;s more of a disposable mascara since it really doesn&#x27;t seem to stay fresh long and needs to be replaced too frequently.  </li>
            <li>I take it out of its case in one try, with no need to remove excess mascara from the wand, which is a time saver (and so much easier).</li>
            <li>I roll the brush in a Kleenex or paper towel before applying, because I like my mascara to go on evenly, and their brush holds a bit too much for me.</li>
            <li>I like my individual lashes to stay apart and look natural, but better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also better than other lower brands like covergirl and mayballine.</li>
            <li>Applies quickly but can occasionally put fleck-y blots on lashes.  </li>
            <li>, I have extra short lashes, so I get excited putting this mascara on, because after I don&#x27;t feel like I have invisible lashes</li>
            <li>Plus it has a really nice, faint, rose-y smell that I really dig.</li>
            <li>No other mascara does it so well to me, so when i couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores near me, I searched the net and bought two straight away, even though it takes time to finish.</li>
            <li>Given that my normal product (the regular voluminous lash mascara) was unavailable at the time, I decided to try the Million Lashes product.  </li>
            <li>On a blonde, its effective without being harsh, and I prefer it to black shades.</li>
            <li>My lashes clump together, and somehow appear even shorter than they do when they&#x27;re bare.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had other mascaras last for a few months and still go strong</li>
            <li>I get a slight smudge under my eyes by evening, but I just dab it gently with a Kleenex and it cleans up.</li>

            <li> I used to be a beauty consultant so I&#x27;ve used a lot of different products. I have long lashes but they are straight and incredibly thin. Any mascara I have ever used that is supposed to be for sparse lashes only clump up making them look even worse. The [[ASIN:B004GH99QO L&#x27;Oreal Paris Voluminous Million Lashes Mascara, Black, 0.3 Fluid Ounce]] makes my lashes look fuller without any clumping. Also, I curl my lashes and this mascara does not weigh it down causing the curls to come out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried almost every mascara on the market, including dior, lancome, mac, YSL,etc. and I can tell you that this as good as all of them. It&#x27;s also better than other lower brands like covergirl and mayballine. Plus it has a really nice, faint, rose-y smell that I really dig. This is a great deal at seven bucks, and since you should through out mascara every six months, I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wasting a lot of money.</li>
            <li> I take it out of its case in one try, with no need to remove excess mascara from the wand, which is a time saver (and so much easier). Obviously, there&#x27;s no excess mascara on the eyelashes either. And they look pretty, clean and they don&#x27;t stick together. No other mascara does it so well to me, so when i couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores near me, I searched the net and bought two straight away, even though it takes time to finish.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, mascara is largely about the applicator/wand. This one does a great job of applying the mascara and allowing you to build upon the first coat. Great for lower lashes too.</li>
            <li> I have to be careful about how I put this mascara on or it can be extremely clumpy.  It does wear well--no black flakies under your eyes.  I don&#x27;t think I will buy it again-I don&#x27;t like the clumps and I think there are similar mascaras that don&#x27;t clump like this one.</li>
            <li> It does flake some by the end of the day, but not obviously. I roll the brush in a Kleenex or paper towel before applying, because I like my mascara to go on evenly, and their brush holds a bit too much for me. I like my individual lashes to stay apart and look natural, but better. Another good thing is that it is easily removable with soap and water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also appears to be consistently available in drug stores which is a concern if you suddenly need some when you are traveling or need a new one on the fly. I hate having to guess about makeup.</li>
            <li> Applies quickly but can occasionally put fleck-y blots on lashes.  I think I like my Great Lash better.</li>
            <li> clumpy and not natural looking</li>
            <li> Easy to apply to upper and lower lashes, nice shade of brownish black, and no clumps. Stays on (no flaking off) and looking nice all day.</li>
            <li> Easy on, easy off.  I get a slight smudge under my eyes by evening, but I just dab it gently with a Kleenex and it cleans up.</li>
            <li> I use a makeup remover to take this mascara off, but I can also get the job done with cleanser if I spend a little extra time. I like the consistency of this mascara, its flexibility once it dries on the lashes, the appearance of a more volume, and the deep brown-black color. On a blonde, its effective without being harsh, and I prefer it to black shades. Love the applicator, too -- spiky designs are my favorite. Later in the day, I sometimes notice a little mascara dust on my lower lids, but this doesn&#x27;t bother me -- just brush it away.</li>
            <li> The applicator brush for this mascara is awful.  The head is okay, but right after the head, the wand narrows so you have this pivot point between the head and the rest of the applicator wand.  Ugh.  The formula also clumps.  With a regular wand, I would brush through the clumps to try and get better coverage, but with this wand, I don&#x27;t want to do that because it is so easy to accidentally flick it and send spatters of mascara all over my face.  Will not repurchase and would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I am not a dolled up person but I like mascara, an this one is actually good. It does not clump an it gives lashes definition, I have extra short lashes, so I get excited putting this mascara on, because after I don&#x27;t feel like I have invisible lashes :). It has really short extensions, so you get every lash. I think I&#x27;ll buy again</li>
            <li> This mascara makes my eyelashes look very nice. It has good length but doesn&#x27;t do much for volumne, contrary to the name of the product, just FYI. I mostly wanted longer lashes, though, so I&#x27;m happy. It does not clump at all when you apply it! I can put on two coats with no issues. The only reason it&#x27;s less than 5 stars is that it does flake off a bit by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Given that my normal product (the regular voluminous lash mascara) was unavailable at the time, I decided to try the Million Lashes product.  Unfortunatelty this product doesn&#x27;t even come close to comparing.  My lashes clump together, and somehow appear even shorter than they do when they&#x27;re bare.  I will not even finish the tube.</li>
            <li> I am the type of person that tries on the latest and greatest mascaras.  I must say that I was impressed by the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Voluminous Million Lashes.  It doesn&#x27;t flake, clump, smear or damage my eyelashes like other brands.  Definitely will continue to buy from this supplier.  Great product.</li>
            <li> This mascara is ok when first opened but I it seems like it&#x27;s more of a disposable mascara since it really doesn&#x27;t seem to stay fresh long and needs to be replaced too frequently.  I&#x27;ve had other mascaras last for a few months and still go strong but this seems to dry out quickly and gets too hard to apply after a short time.  Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> works well without breaking m lashes</li>
            <li> Not sure if the mascara is different or better than any other, but the clever applicator (teensy tiny rubbery fingers instead of a brush) makes for very nice application without clumps, even on my very fine textured lashes!</li>
            <li> My boss asked if I had the surgery to extend my lashes.  I told her no.  I like that she didn&#x27;t ask if I had fake eye lashes because I don&#x27;t like the way fake lashes look.  I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This is the only mascara I will use. Needs to be replaced every three months, but it goes on smoothly and without clumps!</li>
            <li> This is my first time buying mascara that was not a designer mascara. I was not pleased as it was very clumpy and too goopy for my delicate eye lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the applicator brush as it was easy to use, but the liquid was too much for me.</li>
