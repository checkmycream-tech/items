            <li>Creates a nice curl.  </li>
            <li>Even the crappy drug store irons that my sister owns have a nice rubber area to protect you from the heat.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a quality iron that creates beautiful curls full of volume and shine.</li>
            <li>but it does leave my hair with nicely rounded edges.</li>
            <li>right price and the perfect color was a lovely bonus.  </li>
            <li>i am very satisfied the way it curls my hair better than how i curled them with the chi straightener</li>
            <li>This iron is very easy to use and does the job.</li>
            <li>This one is perfect and has been working as well as my old one.  </li>

            <li>Excellent product; bought three - 2 for self (two homes) and the giant one for a friend who loves it.</li>
            <li>Love the design of the on/off switch.</li>
            <li>I love my Pinktitanium curling iron.</li>
            <li>I love the way this curling iron works and to top it off</li>
            <li>Holds the curl better than con air .</li>
            <li>I am returning this and going to find a better one.</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>Amazon was wonderful to send a replacement and within no time, the same thing happened.  </li>
            <li>i just love how it heats up and how it makes the curls....</li>
            <li>Love Love Love it</li>
            <li>I have fine super straight hair and keep it set @ 350 and get a great style every time!</li>
            <li>Also,the cord swivles easy and the cord itself is smooth and not a tangling kind.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good curling iron but way too hot on</li>
            <li>Pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li>I bought this item because Helen of Troy Hot Tools is a very reputable brand.</li>
            <li>Great curling iron to give your hair soft waves and body.</li>
            <li>My cheap Conair does a much much better job.</li>
            <li>other than that it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>Curling iron worked extremely well very happy with it</li>
            <li>To be honest, this is the first curling iron I&#x27;ve bought in 10 years</li>
            <li>Such a great curling iron.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair look really smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>Using it daily may damage one&#x27;s hair but for 2-3 times a week, it works great.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace a cheap curling iron that kept breaking after about a year.  </li>
            <li>i received the 1 inch as a christmas present and it worked great</li>
            <li>Love the swivel cord on it and love that it heats up fast.</li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t imagine this was possible, but the iron literally had some sort of runaway heating event, melted off its own plastic tip, and burned off my hair.</li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t imagine this was possible, but the iron literally had some sort of runaway heating event, melted off its own plastic tip, and burned off my hair.</li>
            <li>However, a word of caution - this thing gets hot!!  </li>
            <li>This curling iron first of all the company that i bought it from send it to me and the barrel was bended!!</li>
            <li>It is a good iron, heats very well does a great job...but a secret...their is a iron @ walmart, and they are made almost similar, i think its a knockoff to the hot tools....</li>
            <li>I loved this when I first received it, and I still really like the weight of it and</li>
            <li>I love my hot tools titanium curling iron.</li>
            <li>I used to love hot tools, but this iron is not recommended.</li>
            <li>I love the Hot Tools curling irons and have always used them.</li>
            <li>I used it right away will recommend and purchase again !</li>
            <li>It does a decent job at this, but not any better than the cheap one I was using.  </li>
            <li>I love my 1 1/4 size so much I am buying this 1 1/2 and return the 24 Gold one.</li>
            <li>i also purchased one of those and it does just as good in my opinion, and it was only like $15</li>
            <li>I really want to love this iron -</li>
            <li>I thought that I had found a real bargain and was going to be able to get a quality product.</li>
            <li>I a always loved the way my stylist was able to curl my stick straight hair into a wave and have it last for a couple days.  </li>
            <li>after many years of use my old one got dropped just right and broke the top cap off.  </li>
            <li>really want to love this iron - it made such nice, smooth curls.</li>
            <li>and they get super hot and are easy on your hair.</li>
            <li>It was fine at first, probably because it hadn&#x27;t heated up to the set temperature.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and does not burn my hair.  </li>
            <li>it made such nice, smooth curls.</li>
            <li>The curling iron does get very hot and it heats up quickly.  </li>
            <li>It gets very hot and it curls...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had that heat up to 450F, and the plastic hardware is pretty cheap quality.</li>
            <li>On the angled bar that holds up the iron off the counter is too angled and it keeps collapsing leaving a very hot iron to burn my counter.</li>
            <li>The barrel on this one isn&#x27;t as smooth &amp; doesn&#x27;t get quite as hot.  </li>
            <li>I am a cosmetician and I love trying new styles with my hair.</li>
            <li>They get HOT!  </li>
            <li>I recently bought this item (1 1/2 in barrel) and absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li>loved it not too  heavy and its very pretty!</li>
            <li>As a professional hair stylist this is one of my favorite curling irons.</li>
            <li>I love that the curls are loose and the curler itself is super easy to use.</li>
            <li>Hot Tools has a super product line.  </li>
            <li>My roommate also has a Hot Tools brand straightner she swears by for her super curly hair.</li>
            <li>Yeah right - 250 to 300 max.</li>
            <li>I only use Hot Tools&#x27; irons because they are more affordable than other brands and they work great.</li>
            <li>My sister in law (who is a hairstylist) reccomended the \\&quot;Hot Tools\\&quot; brand since it works well and is inexpensive, and she was right.  </li>
            <li>This came super fast, and it gave my hair a ver illustrious look..</li>
            <li>i just wanted to share with anyone who likes to look good for less.....</li>
            <li>I had this iron previously and loved it.  </li>
            <li>All the hair dressers I know use Hot Tools.</li>
            <li>curling iron is pretty.</li>
            <li>I have 3 hot tools and bought the one from wal-mart</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>The on/off switch is much more of a ninja than I&#x27;d initially given it credit for.</li>
            <li>It curled beautifully at first.</li>
            <li>the first one I got wouldn&#x27;t turn on</li>
            <li>Thought I should write a review so others are aware that this could happen.</li>
            <li>Heats up pretty hot though -</li>
            <li>Gives me great long lasting curl</li>
            <li>Hot Tools curling iron on the recommendation of my hair stylist.  </li>
            <li>But it gets hot, and it seems to do its job.  </li>
            <li>and i didnt even had it on higher than my sultra curling iron.</li>
            <li>the minimum heat setting is 280 degrees, which is still very, very hot, especially for fine African-American Hair.  </li>
            <li>Heats up sooo quick at a high level heat.</li>
            <li>this iron is good for someone who is wanting their hair to have a little flip at the ends, it doesnt really curl, curl your hair....</li>
            <li>And it looks great on my vanity next to my pink zebra hair blower.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gets hot fast, stays hot.</li>
            <li>The more heat, the better curl.. at least for my hair.</li>
            <li>And it gets hot so fast</li>
            <li>I have a Hot Tools Gold curling iron in the 1.25 &amp;#34; and really like it .  </li>
            <li>I used to use a T3 1.25\\&quot; curling iron, which I loved, but the curls are too small for my hair.</li>
            <li>It makes large curls and shines as well.  </li>
            <li>Received in a large box .</li>
            <li>I was in need of a new iron and this one was the right size,</li>
            <li>I have thick, stick straight hair and have never been able to curl or add wave this easily.  </li>
            <li>haha..</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and curls my hair without leaving as much \\&quot;visible\\&quot; damage.</li>
            <li>So much cheaper than what they are selling it for at Ulta.  </li>
            <li>I really like the variable heat control, and that it&#x27;s separate from the power</li>
            <li>One of my 3 versions of this iron (the 1&amp;#34; medium size) went nuclear and set my hair on fire - while I was getting ready on my wedding night.</li>
            <li>I was getting ready on my wedding night.</li>
            <li>These irons solve the straight problem and they don&#x27;t damage my hair.  </li>
            <li>It heats up really fast ~5</li>
            <li>The fact that it was made of titanium really appealed to me as well as the variable temperature feature.</li>
            <li>Price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>Money lost to fast.</li>
            <li>you need to be careful to not burn your hair off:)</li>
            <li>I did really like it.  </li>
            <li>and it was reccomended to me for fine hair that falls flat.  </li>
            <li>I love the pink!</li>
            <li>I think it definitely gets hot enough, and I love the color.</li>
            <li>Curls come out pretty and natural.</li>
            <li>the handle is easy to work with and it&#x27;s vastly becoming my favorite &#x27;go to&#x27; when I&#x27;m having a bad hair day.  </li>
            <li>I needed something bigger, so I went straight to Hot Tools!  </li>
            <li>Just looking at it infuriated me because it looks brand new except for that darn on/off switch!</li>
            <li>However, I still feel like the titanium does a decent job of controlling the heat so that evenly spread.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this curler because it is costly</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>love this iron, heats fast, keep on low setting will do the job, i have very long med/thick hair.</li>
            <li>This iron gives me large, natural looking &amp;#34;curl&amp;#34; without looking like I used a curling iron.</li>
            <li>The design and location of the on/off switch makes the iron feel shy and a bit too introverted, so you&#x27;ll want to get in the habit of glancing at that button after every curl or two.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, the iron makes beautiful, smooth curls that set faster and have a longer shelf-life than other irons I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other brands three times the cost and always find myself going back to hot tools.</li>
            <li>This is a great curling iron even for difficult hair.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be skeptical of the lower price on this one, it is a great tool to add to your collection.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t hate it, but I don&#x27;t love it more than the cheap one I use to have.</li>
            <li>I have rather thin, fair hair, so I always keep it on a lowish setting (at which it was set at the time).</li>
            <li>I have rather thin, fair hair, so I always keep it on a lowish setting (at which it was set at the time).</li>
            <li>It gets super hot but the only thing is I thought the barrel was going to be smaller.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s in such an easy spot to accidentally turn off and not notice, and it actually has happened to me a couple times.</li>
            <li>I used to have super long hair when I bought this curler</li>
            <li>it is super cute with the pink and black.</li>
            <li>main issue is a pretty big one, in my opinion - where you place your thumb to control the bumper</li>
            <li>But I thought I was purchasing a new product.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and thin and STRAIGHT!  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t yet figured out how to make the curl last in my very straight hair</li>
            <li>I am 60 years old and have used curling irons since they were invented!  </li>
            <li>Heats up almost instantly and stays hot.</li>
            <li>The power switch fell out within the first six months so my only option to power on the iron (It&#x27;s stuck in the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; position) is to plug it in and unplug it after use.</li>
            <li>I finally figured it must be the tool, so I asked him what he uses and he told me this Hot Tools curling iron.  </li>
            <li>Then all of a sudden my thumb got hot and nearly burned.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had Hot Tools curling and flat irons before but</li>
            <li>I actually use it to straighten my very curly hair.  </li>
            <li>It is a professional product so it does have some weight</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work as well as my old ceramic curling iron, but that iron was well over $100.  </li>
            <li>Love it, use this product everyday, bought this one for my second home.</li>
            <li>I was originally planning on buying a different curling iron that was MUCH more expensive.  </li>
            <li>This is a design flaw - the on/off switch is in a bad place, right near where you tend to move your thumb a lot while curling, and while it clicks &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; with an subtle sound and tactile &amp;#34;click,&amp;#34; the switch toggles &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; like a ninja, happily stealthing into the &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; position at the slightest whisper of perceived intent.</li>
            <li>My curls last throughout the entire day, only loosening up slightly, and sometimes will even still look good the next morning!</li>
            <li>Have had no problems at all since buying, had not seen brand before, but performs better than big name brands that I have owned in the past.</li>
            <li>The other people who reviewed this item was right.</li>
            <li>New hair style, so I went back to my old curling irons and they just didn&#x27;t do the trick.</li>
            <li>pretty pink.</li>
            <li>I also find it to be very heavy compared to the cheap one I use to have.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that the plastic part where you hold down to open the iron gets pretty hot as well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely buy this one again when it comes time to get a new one.</li>
            <li>And my fav is the color Hot Pink!</li>
            <li>This curling iron doesn&#x27;t get as hot as other ones</li>
            <li>I have thrown out all of my old curling irons and will only use this brand and style.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I would change would be to insulate the thumb rest as it gets very hot to the touch if you leave the iron on for a little while.</li>
            <li>The only negative is that the iron turns off easily.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s remarkably easy to accidentally turn off while using, and this happens at least every 2nd time using.</li>
            <li>The curling iron heats up very quickly, in less than a minute, and maintains a consistent temperature throughout curling.</li>
            <li>My flat iron recently broke and while waiting for my new one to arrive and took this curling iron out again.</li>
            <li>This is by far a minor point, because...</li>
            <li>As a first time curling iron buyer, I put a few hours into researching which curling iron to buy (based off customer reviews and what I could find on the internet).</li>
            <li>First one I got lasted a few months then the on/off switch broke (inner piece cracked).</li>
            <li>I have been soo pleased over the past few months</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s normal with other curling irons...  </li>
            <li>I curled my hair using this and expect that it will stay for hours, it only takes less than an hour and my hair is straight again.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> and i just purchased the 1.5 inch and also works great</li>
            <li> Also the Titanium gives great shine to my hair with no effort and this isn&#x27;t a coating on the barrel that will wear off</li>

            <li> Creates a nice curl.  </li>
            <li> Even the crappy drug store irons that my sister owns have a nice rubber area to protect you from the heat.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a quality iron that creates beautiful curls full of volume and shine.</li>
            <li> but it does leave my hair with nicely rounded edges.</li>
            <li> right price and the perfect color was a lovely bonus.  </li>
            <li> i am very satisfied the way it curls my hair better than how i curled them with the chi straightener</li>
            <li> This iron is very easy to use and does the job.</li>
            <li> This one is perfect and has been working as well as my old one.  </li>

            <li> I love the way this curling iron works and to top it off</li>
            <li> Holds the curl better than con air .</li>
            <li> I am returning this and going to find a better one.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Amazon was wonderful to send a replacement and within no time, the same thing happened.  </li>
            <li> i just love how it heats up and how it makes the curls....</li>
            <li> Love Love Love it</li>
            <li> I have fine super straight hair and keep it set @ 350 and get a great style every time!</li>
            <li> Also,the cord swivles easy and the cord itself is smooth and not a tangling kind.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good curling iron but way too hot on</li>
            <li> Pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this item because Helen of Troy Hot Tools is a very reputable brand.</li>
            <li> Great curling iron to give your hair soft waves and body.</li>
            <li> My cheap Conair does a much much better job.</li>
            <li> other than that it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Curling iron worked extremely well very happy with it</li>
            <li> To be honest, this is the first curling iron I&#x27;ve bought in 10 years</li>
            <li> Such a great curling iron.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair look really smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> Using it daily may damage one&#x27;s hair but for 2-3 times a week, it works great.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a cheap curling iron that kept breaking after about a year.  </li>
            <li> i received the 1 inch as a christmas present and it worked great</li>
            <li> Love the swivel cord on it and love that it heats up fast.</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t imagine this was possible, but the iron literally had some sort of runaway heating event, melted off its own plastic tip, and burned off my hair.</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t imagine this was possible, but the iron literally had some sort of runaway heating event, melted off its own plastic tip, and burned off my hair.</li>
            <li> However, a word of caution - this thing gets hot!!  </li>
            <li> This curling iron first of all the company that i bought it from send it to me and the barrel was bended!!</li>
            <li> It is a good iron, heats very well does a great job...but a secret...their is a iron @ walmart, and they are made almost similar, i think its a knockoff to the hot tools....</li>
            <li> I loved this when I first received it, and I still really like the weight of it and</li>
            <li> I love my hot tools titanium curling iron.</li>
            <li> I used to love hot tools, but this iron is not recommended.</li>
            <li> I love the Hot Tools curling irons and have always used them.</li>
            <li> I used it right away will recommend and purchase again !</li>
            <li> It does a decent job at this, but not any better than the cheap one I was using.  </li>
            <li> I love my 1 1/4 size so much I am buying this 1 1/2 and return the 24 Gold one.</li>
            <li> i also purchased one of those and it does just as good in my opinion, and it was only like $15</li>
            <li> I really want to love this iron -</li>
            <li> I thought that I had found a real bargain and was going to be able to get a quality product.</li>
            <li> I a always loved the way my stylist was able to curl my stick straight hair into a wave and have it last for a couple days.  </li>
            <li> after many years of use my old one got dropped just right and broke the top cap off.  </li>
            <li> really want to love this iron - it made such nice, smooth curls.</li>
            <li> and they get super hot and are easy on your hair.</li>
            <li> It was fine at first, probably because it hadn&#x27;t heated up to the set temperature.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and does not burn my hair.  </li>
            <li> it made such nice, smooth curls.</li>
            <li> The curling iron does get very hot and it heats up quickly.  </li>
            <li> It gets very hot and it curls...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had that heat up to 450F, and the plastic hardware is pretty cheap quality.</li>
            <li> On the angled bar that holds up the iron off the counter is too angled and it keeps collapsing leaving a very hot iron to burn my counter.</li>
            <li> The barrel on this one isn&#x27;t as smooth &amp; doesn&#x27;t get quite as hot.  </li>
            <li> I am a cosmetician and I love trying new styles with my hair.</li>
            <li> They get HOT!  </li>
            <li> I recently bought this item (1 1/2 in barrel) and absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li> loved it not too  heavy and its very pretty!</li>
            <li> As a professional hair stylist this is one of my favorite curling irons.</li>
            <li> I love that the curls are loose and the curler itself is super easy to use.</li>
            <li> Hot Tools has a super product line.  </li>
            <li> My roommate also has a Hot Tools brand straightner she swears by for her super curly hair.</li>
            <li> Yeah right - 250 to 300 max.</li>
            <li> I only use Hot Tools&#x27; irons because they are more affordable than other brands and they work great.</li>
            <li> My sister in law (who is a hairstylist) reccomended the \\&quot;Hot Tools\\&quot; brand since it works well and is inexpensive, and she was right.  </li>
            <li> This came super fast, and it gave my hair a ver illustrious look..</li>
            <li> i just wanted to share with anyone who likes to look good for less.....</li>
            <li> I had this iron previously and loved it.  </li>
            <li> All the hair dressers I know use Hot Tools.</li>
            <li> curling iron is pretty.</li>
            <li> I have 3 hot tools and bought the one from wal-mart</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> The on/off switch is much more of a ninja than I&#x27;d initially given it credit for.</li>
            <li> It curled beautifully at first.</li>
            <li> the first one I got wouldn&#x27;t turn on</li>
            <li> Thought I should write a review so others are aware that this could happen.</li>
            <li> Heats up pretty hot though -</li>
            <li> Gives me great long lasting curl</li>
            <li> Hot Tools curling iron on the recommendation of my hair stylist.  </li>
            <li> But it gets hot, and it seems to do its job.  </li>
            <li> and i didnt even had it on higher than my sultra curling iron.</li>
            <li> the minimum heat setting is 280 degrees, which is still very, very hot, especially for fine African-American Hair.  </li>
            <li> Heats up sooo quick at a high level heat.</li>
            <li> this iron is good for someone who is wanting their hair to have a little flip at the ends, it doesnt really curl, curl your hair....</li>
            <li> And it looks great on my vanity next to my pink zebra hair blower.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gets hot fast, stays hot.</li>
            <li> The more heat, the better curl.. at least for my hair.</li>
            <li> And it gets hot so fast</li>
            <li> I have a Hot Tools Gold curling iron in the 1.25 &amp;#34; and really like it .  </li>
            <li> I used to use a T3 1.25\\&quot; curling iron, which I loved, but the curls are too small for my hair.</li>
            <li> It makes large curls and shines as well.  </li>
            <li> Received in a large box .</li>
            <li> I was in need of a new iron and this one was the right size,</li>
            <li> I have thick, stick straight hair and have never been able to curl or add wave this easily.  </li>
            <li> haha..</li>
            <li> It heats up fast and curls my hair without leaving as much \\&quot;visible\\&quot; damage.</li>
            <li> So much cheaper than what they are selling it for at Ulta.  </li>
            <li> I really like the variable heat control, and that it&#x27;s separate from the power</li>
            <li> One of my 3 versions of this iron (the 1&amp;#34; medium size) went nuclear and set my hair on fire - while I was getting ready on my wedding night.</li>
            <li> I was getting ready on my wedding night.</li>
            <li> These irons solve the straight problem and they don&#x27;t damage my hair.  </li>
            <li> It heats up really fast ~5</li>
            <li> The fact that it was made of titanium really appealed to me as well as the variable temperature feature.</li>
            <li> Price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> Money lost to fast.</li>
            <li> you need to be careful to not burn your hair off:)</li>
            <li> I did really like it.  </li>
            <li> and it was reccomended to me for fine hair that falls flat.  </li>
            <li> I love the pink!</li>
            <li> I think it definitely gets hot enough, and I love the color.</li>
            <li> Curls come out pretty and natural.</li>
            <li> the handle is easy to work with and it&#x27;s vastly becoming my favorite &#x27;go to&#x27; when I&#x27;m having a bad hair day.  </li>
            <li> I needed something bigger, so I went straight to Hot Tools!  </li>
            <li> Just looking at it infuriated me because it looks brand new except for that darn on/off switch!</li>
            <li> However, I still feel like the titanium does a decent job of controlling the heat so that evenly spread.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this curler because it is costly</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> love this iron, heats fast, keep on low setting will do the job, i have very long med/thick hair.</li>
            <li> This iron gives me large, natural looking &amp;#34;curl&amp;#34; without looking like I used a curling iron.</li>
            <li> The design and location of the on/off switch makes the iron feel shy and a bit too introverted, so you&#x27;ll want to get in the habit of glancing at that button after every curl or two.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, the iron makes beautiful, smooth curls that set faster and have a longer shelf-life than other irons I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other brands three times the cost and always find myself going back to hot tools.</li>
            <li> This is a great curling iron even for difficult hair.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be skeptical of the lower price on this one, it is a great tool to add to your collection.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate it, but I don&#x27;t love it more than the cheap one I use to have.</li>
            <li> I have rather thin, fair hair, so I always keep it on a lowish setting (at which it was set at the time).</li>
            <li> I have rather thin, fair hair, so I always keep it on a lowish setting (at which it was set at the time).</li>
            <li> It gets super hot but the only thing is I thought the barrel was going to be smaller.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s in such an easy spot to accidentally turn off and not notice, and it actually has happened to me a couple times.</li>
            <li> I used to have super long hair when I bought this curler</li>
            <li> it is super cute with the pink and black.</li>
            <li> main issue is a pretty big one, in my opinion - where you place your thumb to control the bumper</li>
            <li> But I thought I was purchasing a new product.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and thin and STRAIGHT!  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t yet figured out how to make the curl last in my very straight hair</li>
            <li> I am 60 years old and have used curling irons since they were invented!  </li>
            <li> Heats up almost instantly and stays hot.</li>
            <li> The power switch fell out within the first six months so my only option to power on the iron (It&#x27;s stuck in the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; position) is to plug it in and unplug it after use.</li>
            <li> I finally figured it must be the tool, so I asked him what he uses and he told me this Hot Tools curling iron.  </li>
            <li> Then all of a sudden my thumb got hot and nearly burned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had Hot Tools curling and flat irons before but</li>
            <li> I actually use it to straighten my very curly hair.  </li>
            <li> It is a professional product so it does have some weight</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as well as my old ceramic curling iron, but that iron was well over $100.  </li>
            <li> Love it, use this product everyday, bought this one for my second home.</li>
            <li> I was originally planning on buying a different curling iron that was MUCH more expensive.  </li>
            <li> This is a design flaw - the on/off switch is in a bad place, right near where you tend to move your thumb a lot while curling, and while it clicks &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; with an subtle sound and tactile &amp;#34;click,&amp;#34; the switch toggles &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; like a ninja, happily stealthing into the &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; position at the slightest whisper of perceived intent.</li>
            <li> My curls last throughout the entire day, only loosening up slightly, and sometimes will even still look good the next morning!</li>
            <li> Have had no problems at all since buying, had not seen brand before, but performs better than big name brands that I have owned in the past.</li>
            <li> The other people who reviewed this item was right.</li>
            <li> New hair style, so I went back to my old curling irons and they just didn&#x27;t do the trick.</li>
            <li> pretty pink.</li>
            <li> I also find it to be very heavy compared to the cheap one I use to have.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that the plastic part where you hold down to open the iron gets pretty hot as well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely buy this one again when it comes time to get a new one.</li>
            <li> And my fav is the color Hot Pink!</li>
            <li> This curling iron doesn&#x27;t get as hot as other ones</li>
            <li> I have thrown out all of my old curling irons and will only use this brand and style.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I would change would be to insulate the thumb rest as it gets very hot to the touch if you leave the iron on for a little while.</li>
            <li> The only negative is that the iron turns off easily.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s remarkably easy to accidentally turn off while using, and this happens at least every 2nd time using.</li>
            <li> The curling iron heats up very quickly, in less than a minute, and maintains a consistent temperature throughout curling.</li>
            <li> My flat iron recently broke and while waiting for my new one to arrive and took this curling iron out again.</li>
            <li> This is by far a minor point, because...</li>
            <li> As a first time curling iron buyer, I put a few hours into researching which curling iron to buy (based off customer reviews and what I could find on the internet).</li>
            <li> First one I got lasted a few months then the on/off switch broke (inner piece cracked).</li>
            <li> I have been soo pleased over the past few months</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s normal with other curling irons...  </li>
            <li> I curled my hair using this and expect that it will stay for hours, it only takes less than an hour and my hair is straight again.</li>
            <li> After said research, I narrowed down my choices to this iron and another Hot Tools iron; I went with this one because the other one was sold out and this one was Prime</li>
            <li> This iron gets hot enough to tame my thick wavy hair and it didn&#x27;t cost much.  </li>
            <li> I used the same products and methods he did, but could never get my style to last as long.  </li>
            <li> I expect it will last just as long or longer than my last one.  </li>
            <li> I have a flat iron that I can twist and get to curl - and it heats up to 450 as well.</li>

            <li> seconds and makes the curls last all night long.</li>
            <li> Long story short is BUY it!</li>
            <li> However, at the end of my curling session my hair was already falling flat.</li>
            <li> Yes, they last that long</li>
            <li> so I got this to try something different and no matter how long I kept this on my hair</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to evaluate its longevity.  </li>
            <li> and they last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I am terrible at doing my own hair, but with this curling iron, even I can create big, loose waves without a hassle -- and quickly, too.  </li>
            <li> so I just stored it on the side for a LONG time and used my flat iron instead.</li>
            <li> But it give big loose waves.</li>
            <li> I use it on myself and my 8 year old daughter everyday.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a 1.5\\&quot; curling iron for a long time since my hair is really long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that my curls do not stay in as long.</li>
            <li> Fortunately it happened toward the back of my head where I could hide it with accessories; unfortunately black, burned hair is rather difficult to hide on a blonde</li>

            <li> Also, the cord doesn&#x27;t get twisted up because the end has a special connector that twists when you&#x27;re curling...</li>

            <li> HotTools Pink Titanium Curling Iron.</li>
            <li> I usually would by a $20 or $30 one at Target, but they were not great &amp; didn&#x27;t get hot enough.  </li>
            <li> Spring mechanism keeps your hair from slipping out of the barrel&#x27;s \\&quot;grasp\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I can definitely touch it, but it&#x27;s not comfortable.</li>
            <li> It is a bit heavy, but overall worked well.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;d even read in other reviews where others would accidentally touch the off button during use, so</li>
            <li> I can adjust the heat by the small switch located above the handle and it doesn&#x27;t have an automatic turn off (which I like).  </li>
            <li> I have really difficult hair to curl for an iron and it has to get REALLY hot to do anything.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The other issue has already been mentioned, and that is where the power switch is.</li>
            <li> This may work for other hair types, but it did not for me.  </li>
            <li> and she has told her other friends.</li>
            <li> Only side note is be careful, this bad boy gets REALLY HOT.</li>
            <li> They even include two extra spring parts (that I haven&#x27;t needed to use) in case the spring comes undone from hanging it or yanking it too hard.  </li>
            <li> a lot of money for a product that lasted less than 6 months.  </li>
            <li> This allows you to spend less time holding the iron to each curl, which could be damaging the hair.</li>
            <li> (My hair is thick and waist long.)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pull on my hair like other curling irons have in the past.  </li>
            <li> I have a few burns to prove it</li>
            <li> Have bought a few over the years</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s been using it everyday</li>
            <li> This iron stopped working in less than 6 months!  </li>
            <li> So today I had the tough decision of buying a curler for my thick, already curly, long hair.</li>
            <li> power button is in an unfortunate location, however, and I&#x27;ve twice accidentally turned it off without noticing until I&#x27;m several curls in</li>
            <li> :S</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this for a couple weeks and the switch broke making it useless.</li>
            <li> Have used these for at least 5 years and continue to buy them when needed.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of thick hair and within 10 minutes all of my hair is curled.</li>
            <li> I was shocked to see the low price once I found it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> And with having to ship it back and paying a 15% restocking fee for a product that is totally worthless is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Was not happy it did not hold my curl.</li>
            <li> I did burn myself seriously when I accidentally grabbed the wrong end.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an idiot - this isn&#x27;t user error; it&#x27;s absolutely a design flaw, and it&#x27;s very seriously annoying.</li>
            <li> The on/off switch is in the wrong place.  </li>
            <li> It often results in longer-than-wished-for curling sessions, since one has to wait for the dang thing to reheat after eventually noticing that it&#x27;s gone cold, since it&#x27;s no longer curling.</li>
            <li> This curling iron pulls my hair really badly when I try to slide my hair through it.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Awful!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!!  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I loved this when I first received it, and I still really like the weight of it and how it holds a curl. However, after 4 months the on/off switch broke! I can still use, but if it&#x27;s plugged in, it&#x27;s on. I turned it off thinking it was off and two days later noticed it was still on. I&#x27;m going to see about exchanging it, but it shouldn&#x27;t break so soon after purchase.</li>
            <li> I love the pink! It gets super hot but the only thing is I thought the barrel was going to be smaller. Its a little bigger than inticipated. But it give big loose waves.</li>
            <li> Stopped heating up after just one use, sent it back immediately</li>
            <li> Truly an amazing product, I recommend it to everyone I know. Only side note is be careful, this bad boy gets REALLY HOT. I have a few burns to prove it haha.. other than that it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> This is actually my 2nd HotTools Pink Titanium Curling Iron. I just recently purchased the 1.25 size and this one 1.5 size. I just love this iron. Heats up sooo quick at a high level heat. It doen&#x27;t pinch any hair when releasing the curl. I love the gray titanium barrel. Also,the cord swivles easy and the cord itself is smooth and not a tangling kind. I am a daily curling iron Queen. I use it on myself and my 8 year old daughter everyday. It does not sizzle or burn in any way. LOVE this iron. And I would put myself in the fuss-bud catagory!!! Great quality...All the hair dressers I know use Hot Tools.</li>
            <li> I have been using this iron for over a year. It heats up quickly and does not burn my hair.  Creates a nice curl.  The only negative is that the iron turns off easily.  The on/off switch is in the wrong place.  Other than that, it works great.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a 1.5\\&quot; curling iron for a long time since my hair is really long. I used to use a T3 1.25\\&quot; curling iron, which I loved, but the curls are too small for my hair. (I wish they made a 1.5\\&quot; one!!!). Anyway, the reviews I read about this product were really great. The video reviews/demonstrations about this product were amazing too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curling iron is pretty. But also great for curling hair. I&#x27;ve noticed that my curls do not stay in as long. Overall, I like the product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> Love this curling iron! It heats up fast and curls my hair without leaving as much \\&quot;visible\\&quot; damage. Also, the cord doesn&#x27;t get twisted up because the end has a special connector that twists when you&#x27;re curling...I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I only use Hot Tools&#x27; irons because they are more affordable than other brands and they work great.</li>
            <li> wonderful , wonderful.. love it.  price wise?? the best, never before found a quality like this... thank you very much</li>
            <li> I love my hot tools titanium curling iron. I&#x27;m a hair dresser and it&#x27;s perfect. Love the swivel cord on it and love that it heats up fast. And my fav is the color Hot Pink!</li>
            <li> I love my 1 1/4 size so much I am buying this 1 1/2 and return the 24 Gold one.</li>
            <li> Was not happy it did not hold my curl.</li>
            <li> This came super fast, and it gave my hair a ver illustrious look.. this iron is good for someone who is wanting their hair to have a little flip at the ends, it doesnt really curl, curl your hair....i recommend the 1-1/4in. barrel for someone who is wanting a curly curl, and the 1-in for jessica simpson esc. curls....It is a good iron, heats very well does a great job...but a secret...their is a iron @ walmart, and they are made almost similar, i think its a knockoff to the hot tools....they come in 24ct gold and ceramic and so on....i also purchased one of those and it does just as good in my opinion, and it was only like $15....I have 3 hot tools and bought the one from wal-mart and i use it more....but hot tools is great...i just wanted to share with anyone who likes to look good for less.....thanks!</li>
            <li> This iron stopped working in less than 6 months!  a lot of money for a product that lasted less than 6 months.  according to amazon it is only eligible for a return up to a month post purchase!  ARGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!</li>
            <li> Such a great curling iron.  I usually would by a $20 or $30 one at Target, but they were not great &amp; didn&#x27;t get hot enough.  This one gets hot and curls my hair great.  So much cheaper than what they are selling it for at Ulta.  Definitely recommend this product</li>
            <li> Gets hot fast, stays hot. Good weight and balance. I really like the variable heat control, and that it&#x27;s separate from the power button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The power button is in an unfortunate location, however, and I&#x27;ve twice accidentally turned it off without noticing until I&#x27;m several curls in and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be curling anymore. This is a design flaw - the on/off switch is in a bad place, right near where you tend to move your thumb a lot while curling, and while it clicks &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; with an subtle sound and tactile &amp;#34;click,&amp;#34; the switch toggles &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; like a ninja, happily stealthing into the &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; position at the slightest whisper of perceived intent. I&#x27;d even read in other reviews where others would accidentally touch the off button during use, so I thought I was prepared. The design and location of the on/off switch makes the iron feel shy and a bit too introverted, so you&#x27;ll want to get in the habit of glancing at that button after every curl or two.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, the iron makes beautiful, smooth curls that set faster and have a longer shelf-life than other irons I&#x27;ve used. And it looks great on my vanity next to my pink zebra hair blower.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d (EDIT: no longer) recommend this curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I&#x27;ve been using this iron and two of its differently-sized siblings for a couple of years now, and I feel I have to amend my review:&lt;br /&gt;1) The on/off switch is much more of a ninja than I&#x27;d initially given it credit for. It&#x27;s remarkably easy to accidentally turn off while using, and this happens at least every 2nd time using. I&#x27;m not an idiot - this isn&#x27;t user error; it&#x27;s absolutely a design flaw, and it&#x27;s very seriously annoying. It often results in longer-than-wished-for curling sessions, since one has to wait for the dang thing to reheat after eventually noticing that it&#x27;s gone cold, since it&#x27;s no longer curling. This is by far a minor point, because...&lt;br /&gt;2) One of my 3 versions of this iron (the 1&amp;#34; medium size) went nuclear and set my hair on fire - while I was getting ready on my wedding night. That was, um, catastrophic. I honestly didn&#x27;t imagine this was possible, but the iron literally had some sort of runaway heating event, melted off its own plastic tip, and burned off my hair. I have rather thin, fair hair, so I always keep it on a lowish setting (at which it was set at the time). Fortunately it happened toward the back of my head where I could hide it with accessories; unfortunately black, burned hair is rather difficult to hide on a blonde head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really want to love this iron - it made such nice, smooth curls. But I can&#x27;t endorse a product that outright attacks me.ile I was getting ready on my wedding night. That was, um, catastrophic.

            <li> I am 60 years old and have used curling irons since they were invented!  My hair is very fine and thin and STRAIGHT!  These irons solve the straight problem and they don&#x27;t damage my hair.  My hairdresser is impressed!  I have these in my luggage, in my make up area, and in my cabinet in all different sizes.  They get HOT!  Depending on the length of my hair, I use several different sizes.  I have thrown out all of my old curling irons and will only use this brand and style.  Have used these for at least 5 years and continue to buy them when needed.</li>
            <li> Excellent product; bought three - 2 for self (two homes) and the giant one for a friend who loves it.</li>
            <li> It gets very hot and it curls... the handle is easy to work with and it&#x27;s vastly becoming my favorite &#x27;go to&#x27; when I&#x27;m having a bad hair day.  It makes large curls and shines as well.  I can adjust the heat by the small switch located above the handle and it doesn&#x27;t have an automatic turn off (which I like).  I&#x27;d buy it again, but something tells me I won&#x27;t have to.  They even include two extra spring parts (that I haven&#x27;t needed to use) in case the spring comes undone from hanging it or yanking it too hard.  *the spring that allows the claw to open and close.</li>
            <li> 450 degrees? Yeah right - 250 to 300 max. I have really difficult hair to curl for an iron and it has to get REALLY hot to do anything. I have a flat iron that I can twist and get to curl - and it heats up to 450 as well. This thing can&#x27;t hold a candle to that flat iron. I thought that I had found a real bargain and was going to be able to get a quality product. What a joke. And with having to ship it back and paying a 15% restocking fee for a product that is totally worthless is ridiculous. I received a faulty product and am totally unsatisfied.</li>
            <li> received a defective product and trying to receive my refund</li>
            <li> I used to have super long hair when I bought this curler and I wanted big curls to give me that Kardashian hair look and this curler does that. I love that the curls are loose and the curler itself is super easy to use. It heats up really fast ~5 seconds and makes the curls last all night long. Now that I have short hair ( shoulder length) I still use this curler to give me a wavy look and to add volume to my hair. Long story short is BUY it!</li>
            <li> This curling iron does not hold my curls. It curled beautifully at first. However, at the end of my curling session my hair was already falling flat. By the end of the day, my hair looked like \\&quot; I just woke up and did not comb my hair\\&quot;. I will be going back to my ceramic curling irons. I used to love hot tools, but this iron is not recommended.</li>
            <li> As a first time curling iron buyer, I put a few hours into researching which curling iron to buy (based off customer reviews and what I could find on the internet). After said research, I narrowed down my choices to this iron and another Hot Tools iron; I went with this one because the other one was sold out and this one was Prime eligible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main issue is a pretty big one, in my opinion - where you place your thumb to control the bumper (not sure if there&#x27;s a term for this) gets hot. This is NOT supposed to happen. Even the crappy drug store irons that my sister owns have a nice rubber area to protect you from the heat. It was fine at first, probably because it hadn&#x27;t heated up to the set temperature. Then all of a sudden my thumb got hot and nearly burned. I actually put on a pair of leather gloves to finish doing my hair that day because the heat on my hand was unbearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other issue has already been mentioned, and that is where the power switch is. It&#x27;s in such an easy spot to accidentally turn off and not notice, and it actually has happened to me a couple times. This isn&#x27;t a big problem but it is a flaw in design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would not recommend this iron to anyone.</li>
            <li> I am a cosmetician and I love trying new styles with my hair. I bought this item because Helen of Troy Hot Tools is a very reputable brand. The fact that it was made of titanium really appealed to me as well as the variable temperature feature. This iron actually stays put on the little stand underneath the barrel. Heats up almost instantly and stays hot. Sleek barrel does not snag or pull. Spring mechanism keeps your hair from slipping out of the barrel&#x27;s \\&quot;grasp\\&quot;. Love the design of the on/off switch. The only thing I would change would be to insulate the thumb rest as it gets very hot to the touch if you leave the iron on for a little while. All in all I would recommend this to anyone. It&#x27;s a quality iron that creates beautiful curls full of volume and shine. Love it!</li>
            <li> I recently bought this item (1 1/2 in barrel) and absolutely love it!  I am terrible at doing my own hair, but with this curling iron, even I can create big, loose waves without a hassle -- and quickly, too.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love my Pinktitanium curling iron. I have a lot of thick hair and within 10 minutes all of my hair is curled. This product gives you instant results.</li>
            <li> I love the way this curling iron works and to top it off it is super cute with the pink and black. I love it and couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> I curled my hair using this and expect that it will stay for hours, it only takes less than an hour and my hair is straight again. :S</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this for a couple weeks and the switch broke making it useless. Very disappointed. I wish I could get my money back on this curling iron.</li>
            <li> This curling iron works so well! It doesn&#x27;t pull on my hair like other curling irons have in the past.  And it gets hot so fast so it&#x27;s good for when I&#x27;m in a rush.</li>
            <li> Have had no problems at all since buying, had not seen brand before, but performs better than big name brands that I have owned in the past.</li>
            <li> I love the Hot Tools curling irons and have always used them. I have had a total of three since I was a pre-teen and I just turned 40. Yes, they last that long and they get super hot and are easy on your hair. This is a great curling iron even for difficult hair.</li>
            <li> Curling iron worked extremely well very happy with it Thank you.</li>
            <li> One of the best curling irons I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Makes my hair look really smooth and shiny. And I like the adjustable heat.  I need to keep it on the lowest because my hair is so thin/fine.  I&#x27;d definitely buy this one again when it comes time to get a new one.</li>
            <li> Received in a large box . The iron  was in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;very pretty pink. Holds the curl better than con air .</li>
            <li> Awful! the first one I got wouldn&#x27;t turn on so I returned it and amazon sent a replacement. I usually curl my hair with hot rollers so I got this to try something different and no matter how long I kept this on my hair it wouldn&#x27;t curl it. I am returning this and going to find a better one.</li>
            <li> I have a Hot Tools Gold curling iron in the 1.25 &amp;#34; and really like it .  I wanted a curling iron that I could either straighten or create big curls and waves with.  This curling iron works great!.. I was originally planning on buying a different curling iron that was MUCH more expensive.  I am so glad that I didn&#x27;t.  This works just as I hoped it would.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t quite give me the curls I want but it&#x27;s still a good curling iron.</li>
            <li> Although I bought this product a while ago, I am only telling my story now. First one I got lasted a few months then the on/off switch broke (inner piece cracked). Amazon was wonderful to send a replacement and within no time, the same thing happened.  I didn&#x27;t want to deal with asking for an exchange again so I just stored it on the side for a LONG time and used my flat iron instead. My flat iron recently broke and while waiting for my new one to arrive and took this curling iron out again. Just looking at it infuriated me because it looks brand new except for that darn on/off switch! Thought I should write a review so others are aware that this could happen.</li>
            <li> I love love love this curling iron!  Hot Tools has a super product line.  I have used their straighteners for years.  New hair style, so I went back to my old curling irons and they just didn&#x27;t do the trick. I needed something bigger, so I went straight to Hot Tools!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!!  I have fine super straight hair and keep it set @ 350 and get a great style every time!</li>
            <li> This curling iron doesn&#x27;t get as hot as other ones I&#x27;ve had that heat up to 450F, and the plastic hardware is pretty cheap quality. The power switch fell out within the first six months so my only option to power on the iron (It&#x27;s stuck in the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; position) is to plug it in and unplug it after use.</li>
            <li> This curling iron pulls my hair really badly when I try to slide my hair through it.  I can&#x27;t even use it.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for a couple of months now, and no complaints at all. Great curling iron to give your hair soft waves and body.</li>
            <li> This iron is very easy to use and does the job. However, a word of caution - this thing gets hot!!  the minimum heat setting is 280 degrees, which is still very, very hot, especially for fine African-American Hair.  However, I still feel like the titanium does a decent job of controlling the heat so that evenly spread. If you&#x27;re looking for heat, this is it!</li>
            <li> Love it, use this product everyday, bought this one for my second home. Have bought a few over the years but this product is perfect fior me!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this curler because it is costly and it was reccomended to me for fine hair that falls flat.  I used this curler and had the flatest limpest curls I&#x27;ve ever styled immediately after.  I ended up putting my hair in a pony.  This may work for other hair types, but it did not for me.  I used styling spray and everything, but no luck.  My cheap Conair does a much much better job.</li>
            <li> So today I had the tough decision of buying a curler for my thick, already curly, long hair. I went with this one over the BaByliss and I am SOOO HAPPY! I just did my hair and the curls are beautiful and hold very well. The more heat, the better curl.. at least for my hair. Highly recommend. It&#x27;s a winner.</li>
            <li> I like this curling iron. Using it daily may damage one&#x27;s hair but for 2-3 times a week, it works great. I like the size, overall look and the price. Curls come out pretty and natural. Price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> I was in need of a new iron and this one was the right size, right price and the perfect color was a lovely bonus.  It arrived in a timely fashion &amp; has worked great!  I am completely satisfied with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a cheap curling iron that kept breaking after about a year.  I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to evaluate its longevity.  I did burn myself seriously when I accidentally grabbed the wrong end.  I actually use it to straighten my very curly hair.  It does a decent job at this, but not any better than the cheap one I was using.  I also find it to be very heavy compared to the cheap one I use to have.  I don&#x27;t hate it, but I don&#x27;t love it more than the cheap one I use to have.</li>
            <li> i received the 1 inch as a christmas present and it worked great i just love how it heats up and how it makes the curls....i like it a lot and i just purchased the 1.5 inch and also works great i am very satisfied the way it curls my hair better than how i curled them with the chi straightener</li>
            <li> Lasted a month. Don&#x27;t know if it was used. But I thought I was purchasing a new product. Money lost to fast.</li>
            <li> Best curling iron I have ever had and so pretty!  Heats up pretty hot though - you need to be careful to not burn your hair off:)</li>
            <li> I had this iron previously and loved it.  On the angled bar that holds up the iron off the counter is too angled and it keeps collapsing leaving a very hot iron to burn my counter.</li>
            <li> Great product, works amazing and I own a hair salon!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful curling iron. Gives me great long lasting curl or I can use it to straighten my hair. The barrel size is perfect for my length. It is a professional product so it does have some weight but I like that cuase it makes it easier to control. Also the Titanium gives great shine to my hair with no effort and this isn&#x27;t a coating on the barrel that will wear off it is the actual metal the curling iron is made of.</li>
            <li> I a always loved the way my stylist was able to curl my stick straight hair into a wave and have it last for a couple days.  I used the same products and methods he did, but could never get my style to last as long.  I finally figured it must be the tool, so I asked him what he uses and he told me this Hot Tools curling iron.  I was shocked to see the low price once I found it on Amazon.  I have been soo pleased over the past few months, I will never use another brand again!  My hair will now hold a wave in wind, even on a boat with NO PRODUCT!  I have thick, stick straight hair and have never been able to curl or add wave this easily.  It takes a total of about 10-15 mins to curl while it used to be an hour plus.  My roommate also has a Hot Tools brand straightner she swears by for her super curly hair.</li>
            <li> I bought a 1-1/2 in. Hot Tools curling iron on the recommendation of my hair stylist.  She said she has used them for years and they last a long time.  The curling iron does get very hot and it heats up quickly.  Haven&#x27;t yet figured out how to make the curl last in my very straight hair but it does leave my hair with nicely rounded edges.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter as a Christmas gigt and she just loves it. She&#x27;s been using it everyday and she has told her other friends.</li>
            <li> My sister in law (who is a hairstylist) reccomended the \\&quot;Hot Tools\\&quot; brand since it works well and is inexpensive, and she was right.  This iron gets hot enough to tame my thick wavy hair and it didn&#x27;t cost much.  It doesn&#x27;t work as well as my old ceramic curling iron, but that iron was well over $100.  The barrel on this one isn&#x27;t as smooth &amp; doesn&#x27;t get quite as hot.  But, again for the price it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> To be honest, this is the first curling iron I&#x27;ve bought in 10 years so I&#x27;m not the best judge of these products.  But it gets hot, and it seems to do its job.  The only thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that the plastic part where you hold down to open the iron gets pretty hot as well.  I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s normal with other curling irons...  I can definitely touch it, but it&#x27;s not comfortable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had Hot Tools curling and flat irons before but after many years of use my old one got dropped just right and broke the top cap off.  This one is perfect and has been working as well as my old one.  It leaves a good smooth curl in my hair. (My hair is thick and waist long.) I expect it will last just as long or longer than my last one.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> loved it not too  heavy and its very pretty! I used it right away will recommend and purchase again !</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t get it, it doesn&#x27;t curl my hair AT ALLLLLLLLLL. AT ALL. AT ALL. even the walgreens brand would work probably. i think its the titanium which is the issue. this should be recalled lol.</li>
            <li> love this iron, heats fast, keep on low setting will do the job, i have very long med/thick hair. works best on med/thick hair. curls great</li>
            <li> My daughter loved this product!</li>
            <li> This is a great curling iron.  My second one.  Love the temp control, get&#x27;s nice and hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This curling iron first of all the company that i bought it from send it to me and the barrel was bended!! yess and sencond this beautifull looking thing burnd my hair and i didnt even had it on higher than my sultra curling iron. I dont recommend it</li>
            <li> The other people who reviewed this item was right. Don&#x27;t turn it all the way up, you&#x27;ll end up burning yourself. It&#x27;s a good curling iron but way too hot on it&#x27;s hottest setting. Pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li> I have stick-straight hair that doesn&#x27;t like to curl. This iron gives me large, natural looking &amp;#34;curl&amp;#34; without looking like I used a curling iron. (think Kim Kardashian&#x27;s hair)  I think it definitely gets hot enough, and I love the color.</li>
            <li> Best Curling Iron I have ever used!  Love Love Love it</li>
            <li> Purchased in July 2012 and it broke Jan 2013.  The on/off switch will longer work.  When the curling iron was working I did really like it.  It is a bit heavy, but overall worked well.</li>
            <li> As a professional hair stylist this is one of my favorite curling irons. I have tried many other brands three times the cost and always find myself going back to hot tools. The curling iron heats up very quickly, in less than a minute, and maintains a consistent temperature throughout curling. This allows you to spend less time holding the iron to each curl, which could be damaging the hair. The plastic tip at the end of the iron allows you to use both hands to guide the hair without burning yourself. My curls last throughout the entire day, only loosening up slightly, and sometimes will even still look good the next morning! Don&#x27;t be skeptical of the lower price on this one, it is a great tool to add to your collection.</li>
