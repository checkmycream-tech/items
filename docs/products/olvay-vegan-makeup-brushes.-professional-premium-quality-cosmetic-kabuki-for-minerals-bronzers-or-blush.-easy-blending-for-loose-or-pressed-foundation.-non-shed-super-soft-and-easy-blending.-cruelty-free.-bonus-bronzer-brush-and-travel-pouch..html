            <li>Love love love it!</li>
            <li>Good value for the most important brush in my collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>handles are also well-made, of metal on the kabuki brush and of dense plastic with a metal ferrule on the foundation brush, very comfortable in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Better than I&#x27;ve ever had with brushes.</li>
            <li>If you use the brush with creams or liquids it might need to be cleaned more often than the brush you use with powdered makeup.</li>
            <li>Love the feel and flow.  </li>
            <li>Love these brushes.</li>
            <li>I guess what drew me in most is that they are Vegan.</li>
            <li>Love these brushes.</li>
            <li>The description says these brushes are non-shedding and so far so good!</li>
            <li>The handles are well sized for easy holding and being able to apply the powder without the brush sliding around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Felt great on my skin and gave me a nice blended overall foundation and blush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shed and it&#x27;s very easy and quick to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Included with the brushes is a plastic pouch, so they can be easily stored and traveled with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;These brushes are a great value and are so soft and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>and it would be fine.</li>
            <li>They came out great - no bad smell, and still soft as ever.</li>
            <li>It is 100% vegan and cruelty free.</li>
            <li>free guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>heads are very plush, with rounded ends, and they are remarkably soft on the skin, yet the fibers have just the right amount of stiffness to do an excellent job applying and blending any powdered</li>
            <li>but I thought I&#x27;d clean it</li>
            <li>I especially love that it does not shed and that it is so soft and gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It picks up blush very well, and the coverage is outstanding.</li>
            <li>It did equally well on both, with good coverage.</li>
            <li>These may be my new favorite brushes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using them for a week, but if they continue to work as well as they have been, I will be getting more!</li>
            <li>I love the even coverage and natural look you get from this brush.</li>
            <li>So far, I love this brush.</li>
            <li>SUPER FAST SHIPPING!</li>
            <li>$20 would be about right.  </li>
            <li>the brushes are incredibly soft, elegantly designed &amp; weighty - the budget price certainly does not reflect in quality.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re both nice and dense and soft on the skin-- but not so soft as to be ineffective.</li>
            <li>but it got prickly very fast.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I really like them, and am so happy to have Vegan brushes - thank you for making them, and caring about the other living creatures in our world!!!</li>
            <li>it should be first noted that i received my brushes - as this offer comes with a bonus, purse-perfect mini-brush - promptly.</li>
            <li>I changed my rating to a 5 since they lowered the price, I heard from the company and the higher price was a mistake.</li>
            <li>The Olvay make up brush is lush, fabulous, and doesn&#x27;t leave bristles on my face, the bristles stay in the brush.</li>
            <li>Overall, glad I made the decision to buy this brush</li>
            <li>mostly just took off one star for the initial smell</li>
            <li>So smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>They are incredibly soft and don&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, and the coverage for applying my mineral makeup is outstanding.</li>
            <li>It is still soft, some hairs fell out right when I first used it, but not since.</li>
            <li>Love how spreads my loose powder foundation and blush.</li>
            <li>These makeup brushes from Olvay are very luxurious, made of synthetic sable bristles that are hygienic and cruelty-free.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Real quality here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Love these brushes, they are so soft and don&#x27;t shed like my last ones.</li>
            <li>The bonus small blush brush was nice.</li>
            <li>Shampoo in warm water will work great for cleaning, rinse thoroughly, blot or press carefully with a towel to remove excess water &amp; lay down or angle the bristles down to dry.</li>
            <li>It is very well made, soft and no shedding.</li>
            <li>I love the brushes that I bought a few months ago</li>
            <li>This brush is lovely and soft and REALLY does not shed ( which was my main reason for purchase) but it is much smaller than I expected....</li>
            <li>The brush part is a little smaller in circumference than I wanted/ would have liked but gets the job done.</li>
            <li>However, these Olvay brushes have Taklon bristles which are very soft.</li>
            <li>:-)&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;m just not sure about the pricing.</li>
            <li>The brushes are super soft - but brushes usually are at first before you use and wash them.</li>
            <li>They ship in a zippered clear vinyl storage pouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These brushes are so soft and work so well.  </li>
            <li>Soft.</li>
            <li>The little pink one is great for blush, soft but firm enough to keep a line.</li>
            <li>The little one is cute, but I use a pressed blush, so it&#x27;s not very useful.  </li>
            <li>I always used the bare minerals brushes because that&#x27;s the make up</li>

            <li> Soft.</li>
            <li> The little pink one is great for blush, soft but firm enough to keep a line.</li>
            <li> The little one is cute, but I use a pressed blush, so it&#x27;s not very useful.  </li>
            <li> I always used the bare minerals brushes because that&#x27;s the make up</li>
            <li> They hold a lot of loose powder (I didn&#x27;t have to keep &amp;#34;reloading&amp;#34;) and didn&#x27;t make a mess of it.</li>
            <li> and I will probably buy it again when I need a new one down the road.</li>
            <li> though the BukiBrush is slightly  denser &amp; fuller than the smaller blush brush, both brushes are dense, soft &amp; pick up &amp; hold powder without wasting makeup.</li>
            <li> I use the small one for my blush, and really like it, and the Kabuki brush for my powder foundation, which works well.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I wanted to review sooner but hadn&#x27;t had the brush for long enough.</li>
            <li> The larger brush I tried with both loose powder and compact powder.</li>
            <li> I love putting my brushes in a sleeve to prevent the bristles from bending at awkward angles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product as there is nothing negative</li>
            <li> I tried the BukiBrush with loose mineral powder &amp; loose foundation, too.</li>
            <li> It appears that I just happened to get one of the few defective brushed</li>
            <li> but no way, I cannot see paying $40 when I only paid $25 a few months ago.</li>
            <li> Those are so rough compared to these.  </li>
            <li> I knew I couldn&#x27;t return it due to no packaging &amp; had washed it</li>
            <li> I was making up some spray for my other brushes, so I felt challenged, and I cleaned them.</li>
            <li> brushes have dense bristles &amp; tapered heads  for full coverage in small, difficult to apply areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought them for a friend and she loves them too, truly no shed unlike all other brushes I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> few years ago, I purchased some  makeup brushes that were so scratchy, I couldn&#x27;t use them.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical because a lot of these reviews for this brush seemed fake and I rely heavily on reviews for whether I buy a product, especially when there are tons of options from different companies.</li>
            <li> Not sure what that was about.</li>
            <li> It kept shedding and the water ran yellow no matter how much I rinsed it &amp; an awful stench came from it...</li>
            <li> I find it annoying that it is more expensive for me not to want to hurt another living</li>
            <li> I bought the brush and it was very stiff &amp; shed as I ran it over my hand</li>
            <li> Hard to find a quality brush that is not made from, or tested on, animals.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Besides the lack of shedding, it&#x27;s hard for me to see the benefit versus less expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the flat base on the handles so I can stand my makeup brush up rather than lay it down while I&#x27;m using</li>
            <li> They smelled awful when I received them, and I don&#x27;t have a case for them, because that smelled awful too.</li>

            <li> Both brushes are so soft, no shedding, and create a beautiful finish!  I would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Very, very happy with this brushes. Love how spreads my loose powder foundation and blush.</li>
            <li> it is with great pleasure that i review the olvay bukibrush. it should be first noted that i received my brushes - as this offer comes with a bonus, purse-perfect mini-brush - promptly. the brushes are incredibly soft, elegantly designed &amp; weighty - the budget price certainly does not reflect in quality. thank you, olvay, for providing vegan / animal-minded people with a superior, cruelty-free product! i have already recommended you to myriad friends.</li>
            <li> These may be my new favorite brushes. I&#x27;ve only been using them for a week, but if they continue to work as well as they have been, I will be getting more! They are incredibly soft and don&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, and the coverage for applying my mineral makeup is outstanding. Better than I&#x27;ve ever had with brushes. Very nice!</li>
            <li> The Olvay face makeup brush is great for applying foundation. I love the even coverage and natural look you get from this brush. It gives me an airbrush finish to my skin when I use it.  It is by far the best brush I own.  It doesn&#x27;t shed and it&#x27;s very easy and quick to use. You can also use it for applying powder and bronzer. The bonus blusher brush is a great addition also. It picks up blush very well, and the coverage is outstanding. It is 100% vegan and cruelty free. It also comes in a handy pouch. I highly recommend this product as there is nothing negative I have to say about it! You have nothing to lose as it comes with a 100% no questions asked refund policy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> Currently Olvay is offering the smaller blush brush as an added bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neither brush shed for me  &amp; these Olvay brushes are guaranteed to never shed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few years ago, I purchased some  makeup brushes that were so scratchy, I couldn&#x27;t use them. However, these Olvay brushes have Taklon bristles which are very soft. Talkon is also hypoallergenic &amp; cruelty free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though the BukiBrush is slightly  denser &amp; fuller than the smaller blush brush, both brushes are dense, soft &amp; pick up &amp; hold powder without wasting makeup. I tried each brush with pressed make-up (blush &amp; foundation) ...both were great. I tried the BukiBrush with loose mineral powder &amp; loose foundation, too. Again, it performed great for me. I don&#x27;t have any complaints. I appreciate the flat base on the handles so I can stand my makeup brush up rather than lay it down while I&#x27;m using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushes come with a carrying case. The larger one also has a sleeve. I love putting my brushes in a sleeve to prevent the bristles from bending at awkward angles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Approximate length:&lt;br /&gt;BukiBrush..... 5 1/4\\&quot; from tip to tip.  Handle is 4 3/4\\&quot; long&lt;br /&gt;Blush Brush.. 2 1/2\\&quot; from tip to tip.  Handle is 1 3/16\\&quot; long&lt;br /&gt;Both brushes have dense bristles &amp; tapered heads  for full coverage in small, difficult to apply areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush maintenance&lt;br /&gt;Any brush that is used daily should be cleaned weekly. If you use the brush with creams or liquids it might need to be cleaned more often than the brush you use with powdered makeup. Shampoo in warm water will work great for cleaning, rinse thoroughly, blot or press carefully with a towel to remove excess water &amp; lay down or angle the bristles down to dry. Don&#x27;t stand the brush to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent quality.  5 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Risk free guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;review sample provided</li>
            <li> Excellent VEGAN brushes for mineral makeup.  Recommending to all of my family &amp; friends.</li>
            <li> I bought the brush and it was very stiff &amp; shed as I ran it over my hand but I thought I&#x27;d clean it and it would be fine. I threw out the packaging and cleaned it twice. It kept shedding and the water ran yellow no matter how much I rinsed it &amp; an awful stench came from it...something akin to sweaty gym shoes. I knew I couldn&#x27;t return it due to no packaging &amp; had washed it so I left feedback. Upon seeing the feedback Olvay sent me these replacement brushes which arrived within about 48 hours of posting the feedback. It appears that I just happened to get one of the few defective brushed (i get it-this happens with all products) because the replacement brush is exactly as described and perfectly what I was hoping for. It is very well made, soft and no shedding. Thank you Olvay!</li>
            <li> One star taken off for the price. I love the brushes that I bought a few months ago so I was going to purchase for a gift but no way, I cannot see paying $40 when I only paid $25 a few months ago. They need to get this price in check. $20 would be about right.  Update: I changed my rating to a 5 since they lowered the price, I heard from the company and the higher price was a mistake. I bought them for a friend and she loves them too, truly no shed unlike all other brushes I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> Love the feel and flow.  Use them for blush ad it goes on flawlessly with this brush.</li>
            <li> These are very nice brushes. They are supposed to not shed but we will see. I have heard that before! The brushes are super soft - but brushes usually are at first before you use and wash them. We will wait and see!</li>
            <li> These makeup brushes from Olvay are very luxurious, made of synthetic sable bristles that are hygienic and cruelty-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heads are very plush, with rounded ends, and they are remarkably soft on the skin, yet the fibers have just the right amount of stiffness to do an excellent job applying and blending any powdered makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handles are also well-made, of metal on the kabuki brush and of dense plastic with a metal ferrule on the foundation brush, very comfortable in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushes also wash well, without shedding.  They ship in a zippered clear vinyl storage pouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are high-quality makeup brushes that are a pleasure to use and they are an excellent choice to replace all those worn-out brushes begging to be thrown out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sample was provided for testing and evaluation.</li>
            <li> Good quality brush at a great price! Just what I need for my mineral powder foundation and mineral veil powder application. Have not yet used the blush brush that comes with it, but it appears to be good quality as well.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes, they are so soft and don&#x27;t shed like my last ones.</li>
            <li> The Olvay make up brush is lush, fabulous, and doesn&#x27;t leave bristles on my face, the bristles stay in the brush. The little pink one is great for blush, soft but firm enough to keep a line. The larger brush I tried with both loose powder and compact powder. It did equally well on both, with good coverage. The handles are well sized for easy holding and being able to apply the powder without the brush sliding around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Included with the brushes is a plastic pouch, so they can be easily stored and traveled with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are a great value and are so soft and comfortable to use. Real quality here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for evaluation</li>
            <li> Great quality for a portion of the price you pay for name brand make up brushes. I especially love that it does not shed and that it is so soft and gentle on my sensitive skin. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes. They&#x27;re both nice and dense and soft on the skin-- but not so soft as to be ineffective. They hold a lot of loose powder (I didn&#x27;t have to keep &amp;#34;reloading&amp;#34;) and didn&#x27;t make a mess of it. Felt great on my skin and gave me a nice blended overall foundation and blush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had zero shedding with either brush and they feel like they&#x27;re made to last. The zippered pouch is a nice touch as well. Good value for the most important brush in my collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this for review.</li>
            <li> This brush is lovely and soft and REALLY does not shed ( which was my main reason for purchase) but it is much smaller than I expected....My fault for not reading the dimensions.</li>
            <li> The description says these brushes are non-shedding and so far so good! After using the brushes for one week I would rate them as excellent.</li>
            <li> I wanted to review sooner but hadn&#x27;t had the brush for long enough. I was a little skeptical because a lot of these reviews for this brush seemed fake and I rely heavily on reviews for whether I buy a product, especially when there are tons of options from different companies. So far, I love this brush. It is still soft, some hairs fell out right when I first used it, but not since. The brush part is a little smaller in circumference than I wanted/ would have liked but gets the job done. The bonus small blush brush was nice. Overall, glad I made the decision to buy this brush and I will probably buy it again when I need a new one down the road. I always used the bare minerals brushes because that&#x27;s the make up I use but it got prickly very fast. Hope that doesn&#x27;t happen to this one!</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft and work so well.  I had been using the brushes that come with my mineral makeup.  Those are so rough compared to these.  The little one is cute, but I use a pressed blush, so it&#x27;s not very useful.  Very pleased with the upgrade.</li>
            <li> Here are my pros and cons on these brushes:&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- They are Vegan!!!! Hard to find a quality brush that is not made from, or tested on, animals.&lt;br /&gt;- Two brushes in the mix. I use the small one for my blush, and really like it, and the Kabuki brush for my powder foundation, which works well.&lt;br /&gt;- No shedding - everyone loves that!&lt;br /&gt;- They are soft.&lt;br /&gt;- They come out great after cleaning!&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- They smelled awful when I received them, and I don&#x27;t have a case for them, because that smelled awful too. I was making up some spray for my other brushes, so I felt challenged, and I cleaned them. They came out great - no bad smell, and still soft as ever. Not sure what that was about. :-)&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;m just not sure about the pricing. I understand that there are others that are more expensive, so what? Besides the lack of shedding, it&#x27;s hard for me to see the benefit versus less expensive brushes. I guess what drew me in most is that they are Vegan. I find it annoying that it is more expensive for me not to want to hurt another living soul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mostly just took off one star for the initial smell - seems like that should have been addressed in quality control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really like them, and am so happy to have Vegan brushes - thank you for making them, and caring about the other living creatures in our world!!! I&#x27;m grateful!</li>
            <li> Best brush I have ever had! So smooth and soft. Zero shedding. So glad I found this product! Love love love it!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes. No shedding. Soft. SUPER FAST SHIPPING!</li>
