            <li>The conditioner has a mild, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>The conditioner smells nice and it relatively easy to spread over my hair, although I feel like I need quite a lot of it to cover all my hair.</li>
            <li>You should try it:) you are gonna LOVE IT</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Pantone products for many years.</li>
            <li>But it is even better.</li>
            <li>I use their volume shampoo and conditioner all the time, and really love it.</li>
            <li>I love the appealing fragrance, the creamy thickness, and the rinse-ability of this product.</li>
            <li>Pantene is one of my favorite drugstore brands.</li>
            <li>I’ve used Pantene for years and am always pleased with the performance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pantene is my favorite drug store shampoo.  </li>
            <li>and I love the scent.</li>
            <li>and so it feels like I am using more of the conditioner to coat my hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably an upside for some people. :)</li>
            <li>It has a nice clean smell.</li>
            <li>I used this conditioner and at first it felt good.  </li>
            <li>It works pretty good -</li>
            <li>It worked great and kept my daughter&#x27;s hair free from tangles and much easier to comb.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner has a very nice, light floral-berry scent that I really like.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love the Pro-V Smooth and Sleek line.</li>
            <li>I just feels so so soft and clean and beautiful.</li>
            <li>Perhaps, a more significant difference would be seen for the hair type it calls for.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner works well, leaving the hair shiny and easy to brush.</li>
            <li>It is easy to comb hair after using the conditioner.</li>
            <li>Styling is easy after use.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a problem with the scent, though it is strong.</li>
            <li>Great scent--subtle, sweet, somewhat fruity, and not too strong, and it leaves hair Very soft and silky.</li>
            <li>My hair was detangle and somewhat smooth.  </li>
            <li>After drying, the hair look smooth and sleek indeed, but it does leave some body to the hair, too, which I like.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling and looking smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>this makes it feel silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>, PANTENE USED TO BE FABULOUS FOR MY HAIR</li>
            <li>So I decided to try this smooth and sleek conditioner.</li>
            <li>Like the name implies, this is definitely smooth and sleek.</li>
            <li>The formula with added Argan oil helps keep hair smooth and frizz free.</li>
            <li>I use this Pantene Pro-V Smooth and Sleek Conditioner with the matching Shampoo</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for the ends of my hair and isn&#x27;t so heavy that it weighs my hair</li>
            <li>I think it would be perfect for everyday use for someone with a lot of frizz.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is clean and  product is creamy and easy to apply and rinse out.</li>
            <li>Also, I am getting curl instead of frizz, so this conditioner is seek and smooth.</li>
            <li>and they both have worked the same good magic on</li>
            <li>so she can keep it looking clean, shiny, manageable and frizz free...</li>
            <li>They are good value, smell good and usually work quite well.  </li>
            <li>so the ends that break on top, stay pretty fuzzy.</li>
            <li>The bottom of the bottle flip cap works great in the shower and gravity helps empty the bottle</li>
            <li>It  does the job for such a good price.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a sweet, fruity fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Per FDA cosmetic labeling guidelines, ingredients are listed in descending order of prominence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only good use I found for this product was using it as shaving cream...</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this product unless you want nice smelling legs and armpits.</li>
            <li>That is good enough.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Pantene Pro-V Smooth and Sleek is a thick and rich conditioner that makes a beautiful lather.  </li>
            <li>It rinses away easily without a lot of buildup, but after a few weeks of using it, I needed a good washing with my clarifying shampoo.</li>
            <li>Pro-V Smooth and Sleek Conditioner is a very moisturizing formula.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick with Dr. Bronners which leaves my hair glistening and healthy, naturally.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own when I DO NOT shampoo the next day, and work a bit into my ends.  </li>
            <li>It does seem to help tame fly aways and frizz, though.</li>
            <li>, so I thought this would really smooth it out, which it did, but it did leave my hair feeling heavier, which caused it to go flat on top, even after blow drying it.</li>
            <li>This is one of the better conditioners I have used, the organ oil seems to really help condition, but more importantly it also helps keep down the frizz.  </li>
            <li>My fingers could slide right through it.  </li>
            <li>It washes away easily and immediately leaves hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li>If your hair isn&#x27;t too dry, or you don&#x27;t especially need a really good detangling conditioner, this will work out fine for you.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need to use very much to condition my hair, which is about shoulder length.&lt;br</li>
            <li>works well (for the little I need it) and it smells good too.</li>
            <li>The formula actually has more vitamin E, in the form of tocopherol acetate.  </li>
            <li>After the first use I felt my hair</li>
            <li>My hair feels softer and looks really shiny even before I use any styling products!  </li>
            <li>fragrance is very strong for even me (someone who doesn&#x27;t mind stronger scents) and is noticeable even on dry hair.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down too much, which is a good thing.</li>
            <li>Other Pro-V conditioner that I used was good too, but this one seems to be leaving the hair more silky, less frizzy, and easier to manage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This particular variety, smooth and sleek does a slightly better job at taming away the little frizz that my wife get when the weather turns humid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>when using my straightening iron or curling wand, my hair remains moisture rich and not dry at all.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find this conditioner to be very moisturizing or to work very well for detangling.</li>
            <li>I think it would cause too much build up if I went all the way to the roots</li>
            <li>My daughter has very flyaway hair.</li>
            <li>Moisturizes really well and leave hair feeling and looking good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>also really like the bottle design</li>
            <li>It reverses the straightening process much faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using stuff from the beauty supply, but this really rivals them.  </li>
            <li>Very nice - not drippy but very thick</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much shine like I normally do when I use Argan oil but thought it would come over time.  </li>
            <li>hair brushed out very easily after rinsing and towel drying,&lt;br /&gt;After it air dried, my hair was smooth and soft with no</li>
            <li>use many different shampoos but one I use often &amp; with this conditioner is the Pantene Sheer Volume</li>
            <li>So I guess it is good for people with longer thicker hair, but not so much for people with thin hair.</li>
            <li>I find that when I use a better shampoo and conditioner, I lose less hair and it&#x27;s never dull.  </li>
            <li>If I use this on days when I let my hair completely air-dry, I will not have much curl but the next day, my hair will be very straight &amp; smooth - do not even need a flat iron.  </li>
            <li>review is a courtesy of my 12.5 year old daughter who has curly and very frizzy</li>
            <li>/&gt;She normally washes her hair thoroughly 3</li>
            <li>It gives me smooth, straight results without weighing it down &amp; making it greasy.  </li>
            <li>Dad, this new conditioner seems to be leaving the hair feeling more silky and allows me to use the straightening iron much easier than in the past.  </li>
            <li>, I always looked like I needed to hop right back into the shower.</li>
            <li>While the product did leave my hair smooth and sleek, this was solely due to it making my hair look and feel greasy.</li>
            <li>have very very thick long beautiful hair</li>
            <li>I think it is the first Pantene product that I have ever used that has a different scent.</li>
            <li>daughter who has long thick hair, tried it, and she absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li>us and Pantene keeps their prices pretty much the same across the different varieties they offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For our type of hair,  between me, my wife and daughter,  we did not see much difference between this and our regular Pantene conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I have shoulder-length naturally wavy/big curls hair.</li>
            <li>I just flip my head upside down &amp; use the blow dryer on cool for a minute to fluff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>the only downside I really notice is that my hair seems to have more volume with this conditioner and my hair is thick enough.</li>
            <li>, I can never wash more than 1 or 2 times a week but with this conditioner it doesn&#x27;t even look good for 1 day, I&#x27;d rather not use any conditioner if I had to use this, it&#x27;s horrible!</li>
            <li>I have dry hair, and I get it colored and highlighted, so rarely blow it dry.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy using this conditioner and only do so every other day so as to not overly dry out my hair.</li>
            <li>Even though it is long, it is very curly when short</li>
            <li>After shower hair was still pretty manageable, but I don&#x27;t know that I noticed any less frizz after blow drying</li>
            <li>and I found that it actually seemed to give my hair a little more body without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>Old products used to just make my hair very flat.</li>
            <li>I think if I were to use it every other day when I wash my hair, it might over moisturize it and make it too oily, but as an occasional boost it worked very well.</li>
            <li>I have medium lengthy straight to slightly wavy hair</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way to smooth hair, but not weigh down and leave a greasy look.</li>

            <li> works well (for the little I need it) and it smells good too.</li>
            <li> The formula actually has more vitamin E, in the form of tocopherol acetate.  </li>
            <li> After the first use I felt my hair</li>
            <li> My hair feels softer and looks really shiny even before I use any styling products!  </li>
            <li> fragrance is very strong for even me (someone who doesn&#x27;t mind stronger scents) and is noticeable even on dry hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down too much, which is a good thing.</li>
            <li> Other Pro-V conditioner that I used was good too, but this one seems to be leaving the hair more silky, less frizzy, and easier to manage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This particular variety, smooth and sleek does a slightly better job at taming away the little frizz that my wife get when the weather turns humid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> when using my straightening iron or curling wand, my hair remains moisture rich and not dry at all.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find this conditioner to be very moisturizing or to work very well for detangling.</li>
            <li> I think it would cause too much build up if I went all the way to the roots</li>
            <li> My daughter has very flyaway hair.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes really well and leave hair feeling and looking good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> also really like the bottle design</li>
            <li> It reverses the straightening process much faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using stuff from the beauty supply, but this really rivals them.  </li>
            <li> Very nice - not drippy but very thick</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much shine like I normally do when I use Argan oil but thought it would come over time.  </li>
            <li> hair brushed out very easily after rinsing and towel drying,&lt;br /&gt;After it air dried, my hair was smooth and soft with no</li>
            <li> use many different shampoos but one I use often &amp; with this conditioner is the Pantene Sheer Volume</li>
            <li> So I guess it is good for people with longer thicker hair, but not so much for people with thin hair.</li>
            <li> I find that when I use a better shampoo and conditioner, I lose less hair and it&#x27;s never dull.  </li>
            <li> If I use this on days when I let my hair completely air-dry, I will not have much curl but the next day, my hair will be very straight &amp; smooth - do not even need a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> review is a courtesy of my 12.5 year old daughter who has curly and very frizzy</li>
            <li> /&gt;She normally washes her hair thoroughly 3</li>
            <li> It gives me smooth, straight results without weighing it down &amp; making it greasy.  </li>
            <li> Dad, this new conditioner seems to be leaving the hair feeling more silky and allows me to use the straightening iron much easier than in the past.  </li>
            <li> , I always looked like I needed to hop right back into the shower.</li>
            <li> While the product did leave my hair smooth and sleek, this was solely due to it making my hair look and feel greasy.</li>
            <li> have very very thick long beautiful hair</li>
            <li> I think it is the first Pantene product that I have ever used that has a different scent.</li>
            <li> daughter who has long thick hair, tried it, and she absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li> us and Pantene keeps their prices pretty much the same across the different varieties they offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For our type of hair,  between me, my wife and daughter,  we did not see much difference between this and our regular Pantene conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I have shoulder-length naturally wavy/big curls hair.</li>
            <li> I just flip my head upside down &amp; use the blow dryer on cool for a minute to fluff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> the only downside I really notice is that my hair seems to have more volume with this conditioner and my hair is thick enough.</li>
            <li> , I can never wash more than 1 or 2 times a week but with this conditioner it doesn&#x27;t even look good for 1 day, I&#x27;d rather not use any conditioner if I had to use this, it&#x27;s horrible!</li>
            <li> I have dry hair, and I get it colored and highlighted, so rarely blow it dry.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy using this conditioner and only do so every other day so as to not overly dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> Even though it is long, it is very curly when short</li>
            <li> After shower hair was still pretty manageable, but I don&#x27;t know that I noticed any less frizz after blow drying</li>
            <li> and I found that it actually seemed to give my hair a little more body without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Old products used to just make my hair very flat.</li>
            <li> I think if I were to use it every other day when I wash my hair, it might over moisturize it and make it too oily, but as an occasional boost it worked very well.</li>
            <li> I have medium lengthy straight to slightly wavy hair</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way to smooth hair, but not weigh down and leave a greasy look.</li>
            <li> The smooth and sleek conditioner is not as thick as some of Pantene&#x27;s other conditioners that I have used</li>
            <li> Like literally I washed my hair yesterday and today it&#x27;s flat and looks like I put vegetable oil in it,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice the fragrance lasting much longer than other products after my hair was dried and styled.</li>
            <li> I occasionally blow it almost dry with my fingers and a blowdryer, and then I use the curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended</li>
            <li> It always leaves my hair smooth, shiny, and bouncy (which is not easy with my long, thick, wavy hair).</li>
            <li> As a result of using my fingers and hairspray as tools for a wavy long look, my hair isn&#x27;t breaking off and splitting.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used Pantee products in a long time.</li>
            <li> It leaves her hair (and mine too) really soft and tame.</li>
            <li> The scent is a bit different than other Pantene products.</li>
            <li> don;r leave it on very long.  </li>
            <li> so I need something that doesn&#x27;t dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> After several uses, the conditioner has left a heavy build up in my hair.  </li>
            <li> The volumizing conditioner would leave my hair rough and just not very soft..</li>
            <li> I was afraid that this Smoth and Sleek conditioner might be too heavy for my fine textured, straight, but fairly thick hair since it&#x27;s designed to get rid of frizz on coarse and curly hair.</li>
            <li> and I work it into the bottom half of my hair only.</li>
            <li> After having a Brazilian Blowout done to my hair, I have to be careful not to use any products that contain sulfur.  </li>
            <li> After using this conditioner three times (every other day), I noticed that my hair had a sticky residue that made it look and feel like my hair was oily or that I had product in my hair even after just washing and drying it.</li>
            <li> Going on my hair it felt like silk, and made my hair slick almost instantly.  </li>
            <li> and I do take precautions to reduce frizz with other products and with the nozzles I use on my blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> I usually wash my hair only every other day</li>
            <li> What I found was that it left my hair feeling a little heavy and</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, at all, but Pantene has a distinct smell that is just not present in this conditioner.</li>
            <li> , the bottle stays upside down</li>
            <li> Left in for awhile before rinsing it out, after rinsing hair still felt very slick and manageable.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair smoother with less frizz</li>
            <li> My hair has been a little dry lately</li>
            <li> My hair looks limp and without body.  </li>
            <li> In recent years my intolerance to chemicals has grown from FD&amp;C food colors causing rashes and GI issues to chemical scents causing headaches and worse.</li>
            <li> I am not sure this is a conditioner for my type of hair.  </li>
            <li> Pantene products usually don&#x27;t disappoint.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately Pantene uses some sort of chemicalized fragrance, I couldn&#x27;t tolerate the smell lingering in my hair after a single use, I had to reward my hair a few times to get rid of the &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I actually have very thin hair and for the longest time I have been using volumizing conditioner for my hair.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easier to get the product out since conditioner is thick product and can be hard to get out once you are towards the end of the bottle.</li>
            <li> have shoulder length thin, but frizzy hair</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about this product.</li>

            <li> Goodbye Frizzy hair........&lt;br /&gt;This review is a courtesy of my 12.5 year old daughter who has curly and very frizzy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She normally washes her hair thoroughly 3+ times a week so she can keep it looking clean, shiny, manageable and frizz free...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her comments:  Dad, this new conditioner seems to be leaving the hair feeling more silky and allows me to use the straightening iron much easier than in the past.  Other Pro-V conditioner that I used was good too, but this one seems to be leaving the hair more silky, less frizzy, and easier to manage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply put...she loves it....5 stars.</li>
            <li> My hair is med-fine texture and tends to get frizzy in the spring and summer.  I used this conditioner and at first it felt good.  My hair was detangle and somewhat smooth.  I didn&#x27;t see much shine like I normally do when I use Argan oil but thought it would come over time.  After several uses, the conditioner has left a heavy build up in my hair.  My hair looks limp and without body.  Still no shine.  I am not sure this is a conditioner for my type of hair.  I think this would work best on coarser hair.</li>
            <li> Great scent--subtle, sweet, somewhat fruity, and not too strong, and it leaves hair Very soft and silky. This conditioner does a great job making your hair look and feel strong and shiny!</li>
            <li> In recent years my intolerance to chemicals has grown from FD&amp;C food colors causing rashes and GI issues to chemical scents causing headaches and worse. Unfortunately Pantene uses some sort of chemicalized fragrance, I couldn&#x27;t tolerate the smell lingering in my hair after a single use, I had to reward my hair a few times to get rid of the &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;ll stick with Dr. Bronners which leaves my hair glistening and healthy, naturally.</li>
            <li> This is a good budget conditioner.  It  does the job for such a good price.  This particular variety, smooth and sleek does a slightly better job at taming away the little frizz that my wife get when the weather turns humid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; For our type of hair,  between me, my wife and daughter,  we did not see much difference between this and our regular Pantene conditioner.  It worked great and kept my daughter&#x27;s hair free from tangles and much easier to comb.  Perhaps, a more significant difference would be seen for the hair type it calls for.  Nonetheless,  it still works for us and Pantene keeps their prices pretty much the same across the different varieties they offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great budget conditioner that works.</li>
            <li> This conditioner works well, leaving the hair shiny and easy to brush. It does seem to reduce frizzing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a sweet, fruity fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Per FDA cosmetic labeling guidelines, ingredients are listed in descending order of prominence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The label features the phrase \\&quot;With Argan Oil,\\&quot; but it only has a miniscule amount, certainly not enough to be functional.  The formula actually has more vitamin E, in the form of tocopherol acetate.  The only ingredients included in a lesser quantity are the two preservative chemicals, methylchloroisothiazolinone and methylisothiazolinone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:  Water, stearyl alcohol, behentrimonium chloride, cetyl alcohol, bis-aminopropyl dimethicone, fragrance, benzyl alcohol, disodium EDTA, panthenol, panthenyl ethyl ether, citric acid, tocopherol acetate, Argania spinosa kernel oil, methylchloroisothiazolinone, methylisothiazolinone.</li>
            <li> The conditioner smells nice and it relatively easy to spread over my hair, although I feel like I need quite a lot of it to cover all my hair. It washes away easily and immediately leaves hair soft and silky. After drying, the hair look smooth and sleek indeed, but it does leave some body to the hair, too, which I like. It is easy to comb hair after using the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Smells great, felt good on my hair, very silky. I didn&#x27;t need to use very much to condition my hair, which is about shoulder length.&lt;br /&gt;My hair brushed out very easily after rinsing and towel drying,&lt;br /&gt;After it air dried, my hair was smooth and soft with no tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find this conditioner to be very moisturizing or to work very well for detangling. It does seem to help tame fly aways and frizz, though. It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down too much, which is a good thing. It rinses away easily without a lot of buildup, but after a few weeks of using it, I needed a good washing with my clarifying shampoo. If your hair isn&#x27;t too dry, or you don&#x27;t especially need a really good detangling conditioner, this will work out fine for you. The scent is a bit different than other Pantene products. I think it is the first Pantene product that I have ever used that has a different scent. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, at all, but Pantene has a distinct smell that is just not present in this conditioner.</li>
            <li> After using this conditioner three times (every other day), I noticed that my hair had a sticky residue that made it look and feel like my hair was oily or that I had product in my hair even after just washing and drying it. I tried shampooing it without the conditioner, but the only way I could get rid of it was to wash my hair with dish soap! I will be throwing this bottle away and not buying it again.</li>
            <li> I actually have very thin hair and for the longest time I have been using volumizing conditioner for my hair. The volumizing conditioner would leave my hair rough and just not very soft.. So I switched to this product to try it out. After the first use I felt my hair and I was like ooooooooohhhhhhhhh that feels sooooo niiiiccccceee. I just feels so so soft and clean and beautiful. I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about this product. You should try it:) you are gonna LOVE IT</li>
            <li> This Pantene Pro-V Conditioner has been great at keeping my hair smooth and healthy looking. It has a nice texture and I work it into the bottom half of my hair only. I think it would cause too much build up if I went all the way to the roots and I don’t need much extra control there. The conditioner has a mild, pleasant scent. It leaves my hair feeling and looking smooth and shiny. I’ve been using it about five times a week and I’ve been really happy with the results.</li>
            <li> This Pantene smells really good, like candied fruit.  Going on my hair it felt like silk, and made my hair slick almost instantly.  Left in for awhile before rinsing it out, after rinsing hair still felt very slick and manageable. My fingers could slide right through it.  After shower hair was still pretty manageable, but I don&#x27;t know that I noticed any less frizz after blow drying and I do take precautions to reduce frizz with other products and with the nozzles I use on my blow dryer.  This is just how my hair is though, no product can fix it.  But for a conditioner. ... I like it.  Feels wonderful.  Smells great.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder-length naturally wavy/big curls hair. I use this conditioner on days when I want to straighten my hair.  It gives me smooth, straight results without weighing it down &amp; making it greasy.  I usually wash my hair only every other day so I do not put this on my roots/scalp unless I&#x27;m going to wash my hair again the next day.  If I use this on days when I let my hair completely air-dry, I will not have much curl but the next day, my hair will be very straight &amp; smooth - do not even need a flat iron.  I just flip my head upside down &amp; use the blow dryer on cool for a minute to fluff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use many different shampoos but one I use often &amp; with this conditioner is the Pantene Sheer Volume - they are good in combination on my hair.</li>
            <li> My son is on a competitive swim team so his hair is always being damaged by chlorine water ... this makes it feel silky and smooth. He says it smells good too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it on my disappearing hair ... works well (for the little I need it) and it smells good too.</li>
            <li> We LOVE this! I&#x27;ve used Pantone products for many years. For whatever reason, hairdressers don&#x27;t suggest using it. But I do anyway. I have especially loved the conditioners. So I was expecting the same greatness from this. But it is even better. My daughter has very flyaway hair. Even though it is long, it is very curly when short so the ends that break on top, stay pretty fuzzy. She has been using this and loving it. And I have to say that her hair has never looked neater and shinier. It leaves her hair (and mine too) really soft and tame. She styles it, straightens it and braids it without issues. I like how it keeps my color dyed hair bright and shiny as well.</li>
            <li> OH MY GOSH WHAT HAVE THEY DONE , PANTENE USED TO BE FABULOUS FOR MY HAIR&lt;br /&gt;NOW IT MAKES MY hair incredibly greasy! This is the ONLY conditioner to ever make my hair this greasy! Like literally I washed my hair yesterday and today it&#x27;s flat and looks like I put vegetable oil in it,&lt;br /&gt;I have very very thick long beautiful hair, I can never wash more than 1 or 2 times a week but with this conditioner it doesn&#x27;t even look good for 1 day, I&#x27;d rather not use any conditioner if I had to use this, it&#x27;s horrible!</li>
            <li> The only good use I found for this product was using it as shaving cream...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is very strong for even me (someone who doesn&#x27;t mind stronger scents) and is noticeable even on dry hair. While the product did leave my hair smooth and sleek, this was solely due to it making my hair look and feel greasy. Every attempt I tried, I always looked like I needed to hop right back into the shower. Do not waste your money on this product unless you want nice smelling legs and armpits.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Pantene Pro-V products. I use their volume shampoo and conditioner all the time, and really love it. So I decided to try this smooth and sleek conditioner. What I found was that it left my hair feeling a little heavy and flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have shoulder length thin, but frizzy hair, so I thought this would really smooth it out, which it did, but it did leave my hair feeling heavier, which caused it to go flat on top, even after blow drying it. However, the fragrance is very nice. It has a nice clean smell. I just wish they had a volume shampoo and conditioner with this same fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter who has long thick hair, tried it, and she absolutely loved it. So I guess it is good for people with longer thicker hair, but not so much for people with thin hair.</li>
            <li> Pantene products usually don&#x27;t disappoint.  They are good value, smell good and usually work quite well.  This is one of the better conditioners I have used, the organ oil seems to really help condition, but more importantly it also helps keep down the frizz.  Like the name implies, this is definitely smooth and sleek.</li>
            <li> I have used Pro-V on and off for years. I love the appealing fragrance, the creamy thickness, and the rinse-ability of this product. It always leaves my hair smooth, shiny, and bouncy (which is not easy with my long, thick, wavy hair). Likewise, I love the upside-down bottle! (This ensures that I get every last drop and avoid looking like a cheapskate by having a regular bottle upside-down in my shower).  This is a staple in my linen closet. It makes my hair gorgeous!</li>
            <li> Pantene is one of my favorite drugstore brands. I’ve used Pantene for years and am always pleased with the performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pro-V Smooth and Sleek Conditioner is a very moisturizing formula. The formula with added Argan oil helps keep hair smooth and frizz free. It smells really good. Moisturizes really well and leave hair feeling and looking good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really like the bottle design, the bottle stays upside down so it&#x27;s easier to get the product out since conditioner is thick product and can be hard to get out once you are towards the end of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Pantene is my favorite drug store shampoo.  I use this Pantene Pro-V Smooth and Sleek Conditioner with the matching Shampoo and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results!  After having a Brazilian Blowout done to my hair, I have to be careful not to use any products that contain sulfur.  It reverses the straightening process much faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pantene Pro-V Smooth and Sleek is a thick and rich conditioner that makes a beautiful lather.  I can actually feel the difference when I use it.  My hair feels softer and looks really shiny even before I use any styling products!  It&#x27;s perfect for the ends of my hair and isn&#x27;t so heavy that it weighs my hair down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even when using my straightening iron or curling wand, my hair remains moisture rich and not dry at all. I find that when I use a better shampoo and conditioner, I lose less hair and it&#x27;s never dull.  I absolutely love the Pro-V Smooth and Sleek line. It&#x27;s perfect for keeping my hair straight, shiny and smooth!</li>
            <li> I was afraid that this Smoth and Sleek conditioner might be too heavy for my fine textured, straight, but fairly thick hair since it&#x27;s designed to get rid of frizz on coarse and curly hair. My hair has been a little dry lately and I found that it actually seemed to give my hair a little more body without weighing it down. I think if I were to use it every other day when I wash my hair, it might over moisturize it and make it too oily, but as an occasional boost it worked very well. I think it would be perfect for everyday use for someone with a lot of frizz. The fragrance is kind of a floral and is very nice, like most Pantene products. I didn&#x27;t notice the fragrance lasting much longer than other products after my hair was dried and styled.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair smoother with less frizz and I love the scent. The bottom of the bottle flip cap works great in the shower and gravity helps empty the bottle easily.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is clean and  product is creamy and easy to apply and rinse out. This is one of my favorites from the Pantene line.</li>
            <li> For the price this is a great conditioner.  I&#x27;ve been using stuff from the beauty supply, but this really rivals them.  I have frizzy hair, and it is double processed - so I need something that doesn&#x27;t dry my hair.  Also, I am getting curl instead of frizz, so this conditioner is seek and smooth. I&#x27;ve tried the avocado one and they both have worked the same good magic on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don;r leave it on very long.  I just work it through to the ends.  That is good enough.  This is especially great to have on it&#x27;s own when I DO NOT shampoo the next day, and work a bit into my ends.  My hair feels almost as if I shampoo.  I have dry hair, and I get it colored and highlighted, so rarely blow it dry.  As a result of using my fingers and hairspray as tools for a wavy long look, my hair isn&#x27;t breaking off and splitting. I occasionally blow it almost dry with my fingers and a blowdryer, and then I use the curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended</li>
            <li> This conditioner has a very nice, light floral-berry scent that I really like.  The smooth and sleek conditioner is not as thick as some of Pantene&#x27;s other conditioners that I have used and so it feels like I am using more of the conditioner to coat my hair.  It works pretty good - the only downside I really notice is that my hair seems to have more volume with this conditioner and my hair is thick enough. It&#x27;s probably an upside for some people. :)</li>
            <li> Good conditioner but I prefer the moisturizing or the Pro-V Hydrating varieties of Pantene. This one has a heavier scent  and doesn&#x27;t tackle my fly-away hair as well as the others/</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used Pantee products in a long time. Old products used to just make my hair very flat. This actually gave some body and bounce to my hair. Very impressed!</li>
            <li> Pantene is one of my go to hair brands. This conditioner is great, as well. A little goes a long way to smooth hair, but not weigh down and leave a greasy look. I don&#x27;t have a problem with the scent, though it is strong. I enjoy using this conditioner and only do so every other day so as to not overly dry out my hair. Styling is easy after use. I have medium lengthy straight to slightly wavy hair and this works great for me</li>
            <li> Very nice - not drippy but very thick - don&#x27;t like the white container though. Would prefer transparence.</li>
