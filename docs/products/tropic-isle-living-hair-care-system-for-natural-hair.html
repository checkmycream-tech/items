            <li>I would purchase more of there product and refer family and friends!</li>
            <li>The favorite is the JBCO and hair food!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been mixing my own avocado coconut conditioner along the way, but the JBCO hair care system is much better and cheaper per use</li>
            <li>I love the texture and spicy scent of the protein treatment and it works well with heat.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>and I am some glad I got it.</li>
            <li>Very mild on my hair without the greasy build up.</li>
            <li>Amazing! Makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li>Will continue to use these products and excited to see the difference in my hair</li>

            <li>It also leaves my hands nice and soft.</li>
            <li>but they all arrived relatively quickly.</li>
            <li>and I figured okay the condictioner will make it soft</li>
            <li>I think that those will be purchased separately in the future, because they&#x27;re used up much more quickly.</li>

            <li>I can&#x27;t really comment on the hair food because I haven&#x27;t used it enough, but the JBCO definitely thickened my hair up</li>

            <li> This hair care system is the love of my hair&#x27;s life! A little back story: I had a bad experience with Lush henna 6 mo ago. My hair fell out in patches and my scalp was burned. The curl specialty store recommended JBCO (and stay away from the henna!) I used JBCO faithfully AM and PM and my hair and scalp made a full recovery. I&#x27;d been mixing my own avocado coconut conditioner along the way, but the JBCO hair care system is much better and cheaper per use (avocados are $4 each in Australia!). I love the texture and spicy scent of the protein treatment and it works well with heat. It also leaves my hands nice and soft. JBCO is great stuff and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be switching to anything else.</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED THE OIL ONLY,BUTI WILL BE PURCHASING ALL THE OTHER PRODUCTS REAL SOON.LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> Received item as described. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I have 3B hair texture and this product did not work for me,yet Im not completely bashing from others using it or trying it. The Shampoo made my hair feel rubbery and I figured okay the condictioner will make it soft but it didnt. My hair was also extrememly tangled as well. I gave the other stuff to my SGT that has 4c hair texture. I did keep the castor oil from the lil bundle b/c it keeps my hair moistured but you only need a lil. Also, Im deployed in Afghanistan and I thought the products would take forever to reach me but they all arrived relatively quickly. Im also transitioning from a relaxer/perm and this is my second time trying to find a natural product that works for my hair. Kinda upset it didnt work but not bashing it for anyone else to try.</li>
            <li> i loved it! Will continue to use these products and excited to see the difference in my hair</li>
            <li> Condition: I had my locks chemically rebonded and it couldnt get any frizzier/ terrible hair fall out, so decided to go back to my natural roots. I bought this product (after reading up on a lot of reviews) help with the transition back smoothly, and also because I wanted to .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here in Singapore, the weather is humid and sunny all year round.  So I usually wash out my hair on a daily basis to avoid sebum/oil buildup. During my first few washes, there wasnt much of a difference, but after a week into the routine, I began to notice a slight  improvement with the texture of my hair and its elasticity. Am going to continue with this for a few months, and hopefully provide an updated review in time to come. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> The products are really great!  I am seeing the result already. Very mild on my hair without the greasy build up. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have natural 4A/B hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo sort of leaves a squeaky clean, stripped feeling. It did not tangle my hair though and once I rinsed the shampoo out and put the protein treatment in, my hair felt soooo soft. The protein treatment really STINKS though. I could barely bare it. The conditioner was just a conditioner. It did make my hair soft though. I can&#x27;t really comment on the hair food because I haven&#x27;t used it enough, but the JBCO definitely thickened my hair up some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have any problem with shipping/delivery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to have found this product , I have tried many products over the last year for nautrual hair, many made my hair hard to manage very tangle; These products are easy to use, the smell its not great but my hair is soft and tangle free scalp is healthy.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Ejc</li>
            <li> All I can say great product. I would purchase more of there product and refer family and friends! A must have.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  After 2 weeks there was new growth.</li>
            <li> i like these products</li>
            <li> My first use.. I have permed hair but decided to try this product out. Hate the smell and it made my hair feel heavy. It felt rough after I was done. Will try it out again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to help my hair grow my hair is to whimpy for this stuff it over dried my hair and made it feel real ruff and broke it off worse than it was</li>
            <li> I use black castor oil a regular base. So I get the kit and I am some glad I got it. It leave your hair feeling so soft</li>
            <li> Oh my ....Love these items !!!</li>
            <li> Amazing! Makes my hair soft. I haven&#x27;t seen any growth yet, but then again I&#x27;ve only had it a little over a month. So I will keep using!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom and she loves it! You can feel the shampoo &amp; conditioner working, and the conditioning treatment works well (can you tell I used it too!?!). The favorite is the JBCO and hair food! I think that those will be purchased separately in the future, because they&#x27;re used up much more quickly. She&#x27;s seen obvious results of using the product in conjunction with biotin supplements for thinning hair. Highly recommended for anyone with moisture or edge issues</li>
            <li> These products are the only products that I have found that keeps my hair from falling out excessively.  I will use forever and would highly recommend to everyone.</li>
