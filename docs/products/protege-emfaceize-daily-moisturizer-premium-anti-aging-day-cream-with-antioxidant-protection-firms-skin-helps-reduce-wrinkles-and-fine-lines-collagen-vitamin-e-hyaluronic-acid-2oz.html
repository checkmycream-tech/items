            <li>I also used this cream as a post peel moisturizer and it worked amazingly to help heal my skin.  </li>
            <li>This is an amazing anti-aging moisturizer.</li>
            <li>but it smells nice goes on well and seems to do the job.</li>
            <li>It absorbs nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cost effective.  </li>
            <li>the product is luxurious and feels really nice on the skin.  </li>
            <li>As with ALL face and neck products, you honestly cannot expect miracles in a jar...</li>
            <li>All opinions are my own and based on my own experience with the item.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Looking over the ingredients, I can see why it feels so effective.</li>
            <li>I honestly can say my face is softer then before using this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It feels great as it&#x27;s put on and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>The texture of the cream is lovely and light, didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all, and VERY light pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I had a great experience with EmFACEize and would certainly add it to my skincare routine!</li>
            <li>This is an awesome product and I love the results I have seen thus far.</li>
            <li>It also has diminished some of the fine lines around my eyes in the process!</li>
            <li>This Emfacize cream is very light and doesn&#x27;t feel cakey on your face.  </li>
            <li>It is not greasy or smelly its very light.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is very light and not greasy.</li>
            <li>It is a bit more liquidy</li>
            <li>I love this face cream.</li>
            <li>After using this I have noticed my face has been firmer and looks better.</li>
            <li>But I did not see any fewer lines, or more firmness.</li>
            <li>I think they are on to something great at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I love both products.  </li>
            <li>I love this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s safe around eyes and mouth.  </li>
            <li>I love how this works on my skin.</li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel awesome...and looks more healthier now...</li>
            <li>This is now a staple in my skin care routine :)</li>
            <li>I found this to be a desirable product to use twice daily for protecting and helping my skin to look its best.</li>
            <li>a magic bullet?</li>
            <li>Box was opened and contents had been used as sealed top was unsealed.</li>
            <li>Better than the Olay I had been using.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll buy more when needed.  </li>
            <li>My skin immediately felt softer and more supple after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am glad I tried it,</li>
            <li>I really love the way it hydrates my skin.  </li>
            <li>but I already love it.</li>
            <li>Stays on top.</li>
            <li>I suggest this to everyone! :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many other brands of comparable cost and this is the very best.</li>
            <li>I am a lover of all things skincare, so naturally I&#x27;m always looking for a great product to use on my skin.</li>
            <li>the most I expect is smooth, moisturized skin</li>
            <li>For the two weeks I used the product, I enjoyed it and found it comfortable on my skin leaving it with a softness and a bit of a glow.</li>
            <li>It feels almost as if it&#x27;s tightening your skin after you apply it, but then it looks great on and your skin feels soft and well moisturized.</li>
            <li>My skin feels better and smooth.</li>
            <li>consistency is not mayonnaise-y; this cream is much lighter, which makes it good for under makeup.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;*Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li>They feel great on and make my skin feel soft and smooth without being heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t oily or greasy feeling and applies smoothly and easily to my face.</li>
            <li>It has helped on reducing the fine lines and wrinkles on her face.</li>
            <li>I am a loyal customer now :-)</li>
            <li>I use it twice a day, and love that it absorbs quickly, and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>I love the lightness of the cream and it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy like some I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I have the eye cream and it works fabulous</li>
            <li>was given this product for free, for review purposes</li>
            <li>my ongoing quest to find THE perfect face cream, the holy grail that will stop wrinkles cold in their tracks, tighten my pores, brighten my complexion and leave my visage so smooth and creamy that passing babies will cry out in jealousy, I was happy to try EmFACEize from Protege Beauty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>This moisturizer is good, my skin feels very soft and is true about the lift sensation in your skin.</li>
            <li>also love that it is made right here in the USA and is not tested on animals!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is packed full of amazing ingredients which are designed to help fight against environmental damage and keep your face feeling young and</li>
            <li>and I returned it for a full refund.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care for sticky skin and not being able to apply makeup when I want, which it very seldom, so</li>
            <li>Makes my face feel nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>and I love the night cream by Protege so much</li>
            <li>Maybe I need to wait more for the moisturizer to get absorb in my skin, but it will help to do it fast for the morning hurries.</li>
            <li>It seems to smooth out my lines right away.</li>
            <li>It quickly absorbs into my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s absorbed quickly into skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on a constant quest to find effective skin creams.  </li>
            <li>In addition, there&#x27;s some ingredient in the EmFACEize that catches the light and makes skin look better than it actually is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am loving all the Protégé Beauty products that I have purchased, this is my third.</li>
            <li>I feel a distinct tightening on my face when I used it, but it didn&#x27;t have that effect on my neck</li>
            <li>One man&#x27;s pleasant scent is another&#x27;s bad scent, so I am happy that this product has no scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>one thing I especially like is that the company periodically send me tips on how to use the cream and make it more effective such as warming your face etc.</li>
            <li>It quickly absorbed into my skin and left it feeling soft and smooth not greasy or sticky AT ALL and helped smooth out my fine lines.  </li>
            <li>name is cute and clever, but did the product live up to its nomenclature?</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product for those looking for an effective facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I did not notice any difference after finishing the first jar.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I really enjoy this, and it has replaced my old moisturizer.</li>
            <li>First I use their serum; Collage.  </li>
            <li>I first found these products by googling the ingredients from La Mer&#x27;s serum.  </li>
            <li>Definitely going to purchase more soon.</li>
            <li>I can see a definite change in my skin texture, but I was hoping for more improvement for the grooves and dips around the nose to chin area of the face.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different brands of moisturizers and anti aging creams.</li>
            <li>Seems to be doing the same great job the other much higher product that they wanted to force you to spend 200.00 a month with auto dlvy for 3 products.&lt;br /&gt;Went</li>
            <li>Like the product , very fast shipping thanks</li>
            <li>The face cream leaves my skin soft, absorbs quickly and well,  my makeup goes on well over it.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy or oily on my skin, which I love!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I am not so young, so preventing wrinkles, spots and such are very important to me.  </li>
            <li>Also fast delivery.</li>
            <li>but this one works really well.</li>
            <li>So much so my husband says my face is glowing.</li>
            <li>I really like this face cream..</li>
            <li>I went through it too fast.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>The company is very customer oriented, I like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>daily defense cream is not tested on animals and is cruelty free.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous without the enormous price tag!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Xoxobetsy</li>
            <li>No, those really don&#x27;t exist.</li>
            <li>it feels very sticky going on...and then the stickness feeling goes away...</li>
            <li>Will use it for another week or so to really say how I feel about it...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cream!</li>
            <li>I really like EMFACIZE, it is a lightweight moisturizer that does not leave your face oily or cause it to breakout.  </li>
            <li>This product also works very well.</li>
            <li>and she just loves it, It really does work.</li>
            <li>much prefer for night-time use, after shower, as it doesn&#x27;t contain SPF.  </li>
            <li>, pores seem to be smaller, and make up goes on smooth, I would recommend this product</li>
            <li>I really could not see a difference in my skin using this.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really working.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a miracle cream, but it is a very high quality daily moisturizer with some unique qualities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The other product did show great results but the price was extreme.  </li>
            <li>I put it on after their Vitamin C serum (C-rum ;) ) and just gives my skin this soft supple feeling.</li>
            <li>So I cracked open the jar and applied a very light amount to the back of my hand.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and smooth and I have a younger looking glow.</li>
            <li>As I have gotten older, my skin has become drier.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;*I</li>
            <li>The cute little pouch it comes in.  </li>
            <li>Since I started this little regime, so many people have complemented my skin</li>
            <li>so far so good,  you only need a little bit, I do like how it moisturizes my face</li>
            <li>Lol You won&#x27;t go wrong trying this product.</li>
            <li>You need not worry though because it is not thick.</li>
            <li>you can use it day or night and it does seem to make your skin look and feel better, after a few applications.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin very soft but it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film on your skin.</li>
            <li>It is really hard to find a product with such a great list of ingredients for the price, and the return was simple.</li>
            <li>It has a tightening effect on the skin at first but after several applications that tends to go away.  </li>
            <li>All of the other brands that I have tried may be helping, but they do not feel good on-too heavy and greasy, and in addition-too expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a nice sized container and a little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li>I order the second jar to give a little more time.</li>
            <li>Protege EmFACEize Fortified Daily Defense Cream comes in a cute little velvety bag and a 2 oz (60mL) container.  </li>
            <li>It dries quickly and works well with my makeup and other beauty products.  </li>
            <li>So soft and supple.</li>
            <li>I recognize my skin is soft, but it doesn&#x27;t help with the wrinkles.</li>
            <li>After a month of purchase the product started smelling like old stored stuff.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The list of ingredients leans towards the natural.  </li>
            <li>but so far so</li>
            <li>this really was a big time bummer for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this daily and have noticed my skin is moisturized and much softer than it used to be.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product is unscented and has natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel soft and</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I&#x27;ve only been using the product for two weeks, I can&#x27;t address long-range benefits, but the short term benefits make this product well worth the purchase.  </li>
            <li>Same white  flakes after it is absorbed as with the eye cream .</li>
            <li>The EMFACEiZE is an excellent base for BBs--it keeps the BB from drying out skin and settling into wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>It compares favorably with other creams I&#x27;ve used at many different price points like Clinique, Dr. Perricone (the gold standard), and</li>
            <li>It is light feeling on the skin, and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy or slick feeling once applied.</li>
            <li>The EmFACEize daily moisturizer has now become my new go to moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My whole complexion has benefit from this cream, the areas that tended to be dry are no longer.</li>
            <li>and it was only half full</li>
            <li>I apply each morning after I shower and complete my facial regime.</li>
            <li>I admit that I am one of those people who things tend to not work for; things tend to do the opposite for me, so I wasn&#x27;t surprised.</li>
            <li>The company stands behind their products 100%, respond quickly, and provide fast shipping.</li>
            <li>The description is true that you only need a small amount to make a difference.  </li>
            <li>It took a few weeks of using it daily to see the results, but it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li>The formula feels lush and non-greasy and it really takes only a small amount to cover your face.</li>
            <li>A small amount is enough for your whole face, I like that is made of natural products and cruelty</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This way, I can moisturize my skin with this product and then protect my skin with a good sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I really loved this one.  </li>
            <li> Good value.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best that I&#x27;ve used without going to get a chemical peel from a professional plus none of the after affects just great results.</li>
            <li> I simply love this cream!</li>
            <li> I will keep using it for sure!</li>
            <li> This is a &amp;#34;light, light, light&amp;#34; cream which moisturizes beautifully.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  </li>
            <li> This cream is wonderful and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this company and so will you!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I also used this cream as a post peel moisturizer and it worked amazingly to help heal my skin.  </li>
            <li> This is an amazing anti-aging moisturizer.</li>
            <li> but it smells nice goes on well and seems to do the job.</li>
            <li> It absorbs nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cost effective.  </li>
            <li> the product is luxurious and feels really nice on the skin.  </li>
            <li> As with ALL face and neck products, you honestly cannot expect miracles in a jar...</li>
            <li> All opinions are my own and based on my own experience with the item.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Looking over the ingredients, I can see why it feels so effective.</li>
            <li> I honestly can say my face is softer then before using this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels great as it&#x27;s put on and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> The texture of the cream is lovely and light, didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all, and VERY light pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I had a great experience with EmFACEize and would certainly add it to my skincare routine!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product and I love the results I have seen thus far.</li>
            <li> It also has diminished some of the fine lines around my eyes in the process!</li>
            <li> This Emfacize cream is very light and doesn&#x27;t feel cakey on your face.  </li>
            <li> It is not greasy or smelly its very light.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is very light and not greasy.</li>
            <li> It is a bit more liquidy</li>
            <li> I love this face cream.</li>
            <li> After using this I have noticed my face has been firmer and looks better.</li>
            <li> But I did not see any fewer lines, or more firmness.</li>
            <li> I think they are on to something great at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> I love both products.  </li>
            <li> I love this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s safe around eyes and mouth.  </li>
            <li> I love how this works on my skin.</li>
            <li> Love it...</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel awesome...and looks more healthier now...</li>
            <li> This is now a staple in my skin care routine :)</li>
            <li> I found this to be a desirable product to use twice daily for protecting and helping my skin to look its best.</li>
            <li> a magic bullet?</li>
            <li> Box was opened and contents had been used as sealed top was unsealed.</li>
            <li> Better than the Olay I had been using.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll buy more when needed.  </li>
            <li> My skin immediately felt softer and more supple after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am glad I tried it,</li>
            <li> I really love the way it hydrates my skin.  </li>
            <li> but I already love it.</li>
            <li> Stays on top.</li>
            <li> I suggest this to everyone! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many other brands of comparable cost and this is the very best.</li>
            <li> I am a lover of all things skincare, so naturally I&#x27;m always looking for a great product to use on my skin.</li>
            <li> the most I expect is smooth, moisturized skin</li>
            <li> For the two weeks I used the product, I enjoyed it and found it comfortable on my skin leaving it with a softness and a bit of a glow.</li>
            <li> It feels almost as if it&#x27;s tightening your skin after you apply it, but then it looks great on and your skin feels soft and well moisturized.</li>
            <li> My skin feels better and smooth.</li>
            <li> consistency is not mayonnaise-y; this cream is much lighter, which makes it good for under makeup.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;*Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> They feel great on and make my skin feel soft and smooth without being heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t oily or greasy feeling and applies smoothly and easily to my face.</li>
            <li> It has helped on reducing the fine lines and wrinkles on her face.</li>
            <li> I am a loyal customer now :-)</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day, and love that it absorbs quickly, and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> I love the lightness of the cream and it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy like some I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I have the eye cream and it works fabulous</li>
            <li> was given this product for free, for review purposes</li>
            <li> my ongoing quest to find THE perfect face cream, the holy grail that will stop wrinkles cold in their tracks, tighten my pores, brighten my complexion and leave my visage so smooth and creamy that passing babies will cry out in jealousy, I was happy to try EmFACEize from Protege Beauty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> This moisturizer is good, my skin feels very soft and is true about the lift sensation in your skin.</li>
            <li> also love that it is made right here in the USA and is not tested on animals!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is packed full of amazing ingredients which are designed to help fight against environmental damage and keep your face feeling young and</li>
            <li> and I returned it for a full refund.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for sticky skin and not being able to apply makeup when I want, which it very seldom, so</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel nice and soft.  </li>
            <li> and I love the night cream by Protege so much</li>
            <li> Maybe I need to wait more for the moisturizer to get absorb in my skin, but it will help to do it fast for the morning hurries.</li>
            <li> It seems to smooth out my lines right away.</li>
            <li> It quickly absorbs into my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s absorbed quickly into skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on a constant quest to find effective skin creams.  </li>
            <li> In addition, there&#x27;s some ingredient in the EmFACEize that catches the light and makes skin look better than it actually is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am loving all the Protégé Beauty products that I have purchased, this is my third.</li>
            <li> I feel a distinct tightening on my face when I used it, but it didn&#x27;t have that effect on my neck</li>
            <li> One man&#x27;s pleasant scent is another&#x27;s bad scent, so I am happy that this product has no scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> one thing I especially like is that the company periodically send me tips on how to use the cream and make it more effective such as warming your face etc.</li>
            <li> It quickly absorbed into my skin and left it feeling soft and smooth not greasy or sticky AT ALL and helped smooth out my fine lines.  </li>
            <li> name is cute and clever, but did the product live up to its nomenclature?</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product for those looking for an effective facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I did not notice any difference after finishing the first jar.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I really enjoy this, and it has replaced my old moisturizer.</li>
            <li> First I use their serum; Collage.  </li>
            <li> I first found these products by googling the ingredients from La Mer&#x27;s serum.  </li>
            <li> Definitely going to purchase more soon.</li>
            <li> I can see a definite change in my skin texture, but I was hoping for more improvement for the grooves and dips around the nose to chin area of the face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different brands of moisturizers and anti aging creams.</li>
            <li> Seems to be doing the same great job the other much higher product that they wanted to force you to spend 200.00 a month with auto dlvy for 3 products.&lt;br /&gt;Went</li>
            <li> Like the product , very fast shipping thanks</li>
            <li> The face cream leaves my skin soft, absorbs quickly and well,  my makeup goes on well over it.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy or oily on my skin, which I love!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I am not so young, so preventing wrinkles, spots and such are very important to me.  </li>
            <li> Also fast delivery.</li>
            <li> but this one works really well.</li>
            <li> So much so my husband says my face is glowing.</li>
            <li> I really like this face cream..</li>
            <li> I went through it too fast.  </li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> The company is very customer oriented, I like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> daily defense cream is not tested on animals and is cruelty free.  </li>
            <li> Fabulous without the enormous price tag!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Xoxobetsy</li>
            <li> No, those really don&#x27;t exist.</li>
            <li> it feels very sticky going on...and then the stickness feeling goes away...</li>
            <li> Will use it for another week or so to really say how I feel about it...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cream!</li>
            <li> I really like EMFACIZE, it is a lightweight moisturizer that does not leave your face oily or cause it to breakout.  </li>
            <li> This product also works very well.</li>
            <li> and she just loves it, It really does work.</li>
            <li> much prefer for night-time use, after shower, as it doesn&#x27;t contain SPF.  </li>
            <li> , pores seem to be smaller, and make up goes on smooth, I would recommend this product</li>
            <li> I really could not see a difference in my skin using this.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really working.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle cream, but it is a very high quality daily moisturizer with some unique qualities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other product did show great results but the price was extreme.  </li>
            <li> I put it on after their Vitamin C serum (C-rum ;) ) and just gives my skin this soft supple feeling.</li>
            <li> So I cracked open the jar and applied a very light amount to the back of my hand.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and smooth and I have a younger looking glow.</li>
            <li> As I have gotten older, my skin has become drier.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;*I</li>
            <li> The cute little pouch it comes in.  </li>
            <li> Since I started this little regime, so many people have complemented my skin</li>
            <li> so far so good,  you only need a little bit, I do like how it moisturizes my face</li>
            <li> Lol You won&#x27;t go wrong trying this product.</li>
            <li> You need not worry though because it is not thick.</li>
            <li> you can use it day or night and it does seem to make your skin look and feel better, after a few applications.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin very soft but it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film on your skin.</li>
            <li> It is really hard to find a product with such a great list of ingredients for the price, and the return was simple.</li>
            <li> It has a tightening effect on the skin at first but after several applications that tends to go away.  </li>
            <li> All of the other brands that I have tried may be helping, but they do not feel good on-too heavy and greasy, and in addition-too expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a nice sized container and a little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> I order the second jar to give a little more time.</li>
            <li> Protege EmFACEize Fortified Daily Defense Cream comes in a cute little velvety bag and a 2 oz (60mL) container.  </li>
            <li> It dries quickly and works well with my makeup and other beauty products.  </li>
            <li> So soft and supple.</li>
            <li> I recognize my skin is soft, but it doesn&#x27;t help with the wrinkles.</li>
            <li> After a month of purchase the product started smelling like old stored stuff.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The list of ingredients leans towards the natural.  </li>
            <li> but so far so</li>
            <li> this really was a big time bummer for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this daily and have noticed my skin is moisturized and much softer than it used to be.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product is unscented and has natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel soft and</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve only been using the product for two weeks, I can&#x27;t address long-range benefits, but the short term benefits make this product well worth the purchase.  </li>
            <li> Same white  flakes after it is absorbed as with the eye cream .</li>
            <li> The EMFACEiZE is an excellent base for BBs--it keeps the BB from drying out skin and settling into wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> It compares favorably with other creams I&#x27;ve used at many different price points like Clinique, Dr. Perricone (the gold standard), and</li>
            <li> It is light feeling on the skin, and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy or slick feeling once applied.</li>
            <li> The EmFACEize daily moisturizer has now become my new go to moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My whole complexion has benefit from this cream, the areas that tended to be dry are no longer.</li>
            <li> and it was only half full</li>
            <li> I apply each morning after I shower and complete my facial regime.</li>
            <li> I admit that I am one of those people who things tend to not work for; things tend to do the opposite for me, so I wasn&#x27;t surprised.</li>
            <li> The company stands behind their products 100%, respond quickly, and provide fast shipping.</li>
            <li> The description is true that you only need a small amount to make a difference.  </li>
            <li> It took a few weeks of using it daily to see the results, but it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> The formula feels lush and non-greasy and it really takes only a small amount to cover your face.</li>
            <li> A small amount is enough for your whole face, I like that is made of natural products and cruelty</li>
            <li> Not willing to spend 2400.00 a year on this 67 year old face.</li>
            <li> I was just disappointed, because I love the night cream by the company so much.</li>
            <li> I am still using this, and haven&#x27;t yet used up the entire container, so the long term effects I cannot comment on,</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t use a lot and the product will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I notice that my skin alone feels very soft, and the dry areas are starting to become less.</li>
            <li> Perhaps my face is on the dry side, but I do not feel that this provides enough hydration for my skin.  </li>
            <li> I really try hard to take care of my face.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a very long way, and I can&#x27;t believe how soft and radiant my skin is.</li>
            <li> I find when a product tries to be more than one thing, like a moisturizer and a sun screen, it does a haphazard job at both.  </li>
            <li> It also provides a great base for my foundation, and doesn&#x27;t make my makeup look heavy or</li>
            <li> /&gt;Though skin feels tight after application, the cream does not dry.</li>
            <li> Only a very little dab is needed to cover the face, neck and upper chest.</li>
            <li> You can wear this under your makeup the only thing this product does not contain is spf which is odd for a day cream in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I&#x27;m always washing my hands so that was my first test!</li>
            <li> moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little bit worried when I saw the yellow color of the cream.</li>
            <li> have always had a rough time finding a moisturizer that works well with my skin type.</li>
            <li> Then I wait a few minutes and use their moisturizer, Emfaceize, mixed with a dab of my Chanel make up.  </li>
            <li> After it few weeks, my skin felt and looked tighter, my pores got smaller, other ppl noticed a glow in my complexion.</li>
            <li> The packaging says that a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and leaves your face moisturized all day.  </li>
            <li> recommend you give this and other products a try.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, a little goes a long way which is always a bonus!  </li>
            <li> Another dip for the other side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Finished using my other products I had bought at 5 times the price.  </li>
            <li> I can see why other people would like this</li>
            <li> I have to be extra careful of my skin, so I need to wear at least a 30 SPF sun screen every day.</li>
            <li> I like the way it goes on as it is non greasy, and a small amount does go a long way.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my pores are tight, my face has a sort of glow to it that my other creams do not do.</li>
            <li> Just a dip of your fingertip will suffice for half of your face.  </li>
            <li> on Amazon and studied all the reviews and found 3 products, a serum, a face cream and an eye product for way less.  </li>
            <li> We barely get over the dry, cold weather of winter when suddenly everything changes and I&#x27;m subjecting my skin to the harsh rays of the sun, along with salt, sand, chlorine, briar patches!</li>
            <li> Also, it makes my skin feel tight afterwards.  </li>
            <li> so I am always a little apprehensive when it comes to face creams</li>
            <li> I have seen a little bit of difference in my wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> A little amount is needed to cover to face and neck.</li>
            <li> One thing that I did not like was that it made my face feel tight after it dried.  </li>
            <li> I tend to have dry skin, with a very small area that gets oily.</li>
            <li> Helps lighten and firm skin under the eyes without irritation.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few days</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks and see a difference.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very slight if any at this point.  </li>
            <li> little dab&#x27;ll do ya!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a face cream that will moisturize without feeling really heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li> disrespecting suggested I use a quarter sized portion and that I should activate it by putting the small amount in my palm and rubbing it with my finger to &amp;#34;activate&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My poor skin must think I&#x27;m some kind of evilly sadistic torture genius.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several face products over the years and they were some what disappointing</li>
            <li> I think the least I can do is offer some sort of soothing</li>
            <li> It gives it a thick almost glue look.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s creamy, not too thick, and runs a bit during application.  </li>
            <li> Usually I&#x27;m the &amp;#34;recommender&amp;#34; to my mother so as a surprise, I bought her a jar of this goodness!</li>
            <li> In fact all the products I purchased in this line feel inferior and work poorly with my existing products.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It is a bit more liquidy than I like but it smells nice goes on well and seems to do the job.</li>
            <li> I love this face cream. I will not be without it ever. It gives you a tightening effect. I use this with my pumpkin papaya enzyme by Protege. The effects on my skin are amazing!!!! Great customer service as well. Also fast delivery. I am a loyal customer now :-)</li>
            <li> I would just like to express how happy my skin feels! Yes! It feels happy! Lol to start off I&#x27;m a mom on the go. I&#x27;m either cleaning, scrubbing,or peeling something from somewhere. Needless to say I&#x27;m always washing my hands so that was my first test! What I wldnt give to have the touch of a masseuses hand. So soft and supple. Mine feel like sand paper on a good day. So I cracked open the jar and applied a very light amount to the back of my hand. In seconds I could feel the difference and the look was dramatic. Well if it worked that well on my hands, what would this cream do to my face?  I really try hard to take care of my face. It took me forever to find what works and I take pride in my complexion. I applied a very light amount to my skin and &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; I was so impressed! Usually I&#x27;m the &amp;#34;recommender&amp;#34; to my mother so as a surprise, I bought her a jar of this goodness! Along with a back up for moi! Lol You won&#x27;t go wrong trying this product. Take it from someone whose tried her fair share of everything out there. You will like the end results I knw my hands finally thanked me! 😁</li>
            <li> Sticky and left a film on my face.  Emailed disrespecting suggested I use a quarter sized portion and that I should activate it by putting the small amount in my palm and rubbing it with my finger to &amp;#34;activate&amp;#34; it........what?....  It felt like parchment over my skin and I returned it for a full refund.  I wanted a moisturizer not a mask!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product and I love the results I have seen thus far. This is a nice sized container and a little goes a long ways. It isn&#x27;t oily or greasy feeling and applies smoothly and easily to my face. It absorbs nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue. After using this I have noticed my face has been firmer and looks better. My skin is soft and smooth and I have a younger looking glow. I received this to share my experiences while using this product.</li>
            <li> This cream is not as good as  I was expecting. I recognize my skin is soft, but it doesn&#x27;t help with the wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I order the second jar to give a little more time. I did not notice any difference after finishing the first jar.</li>
            <li> I simply love this cream! I put it on after their Vitamin C serum (C-rum ;) ) and just gives my skin this soft supple feeling. It dries in seconds and I go on with my makeup routine. My whole complexion has benefit from this cream, the areas that tended to be dry are no longer. I will keep using it for sure!</li>
            <li> Like the product , very fast shipping thanks</li>
            <li> This product is not as described.  It is sticky and uncomfortable on face.  I would return it, but I missed my return deadline.  In fact all the products I purchased in this line feel inferior and work poorly with my existing products.</li>
            <li> This is a really good moisturizer before make up. But I did not see any fewer lines, or more firmness.</li>
            <li> After a month of purchase the product started smelling like old stored stuff.</li>
            <li> This is the second product I have purchased from Protégé.  I think they are on to something great at a reasonable price.  I love both products.  They feel great on and make my skin feel soft and smooth without being heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not so young, so preventing wrinkles, spots and such are very important to me.  All of the other brands that I have tried may be helping, but they do not feel good on-too heavy and greasy, and in addition-too expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend you give this and other products a try.</li>
            <li> Perfect i can see a difference before and after using the product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on a constant quest to find effective skin creams.  I am so happy to have discovered this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I love this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It works.  As I have gotten older, my skin has become drier.  It&#x27;s hard to find a face cream that will moisturize without feeling really heavy and greasy. This product moisturizes, but is not heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s cost effective.  You only need a small amount to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* No scent.  One man&#x27;s pleasant scent is another&#x27;s bad scent, so I am happy that this product has no scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* No SPF.  This is a skin cream and is a good one.  I find when a product tries to be more than one thing, like a moisturizer and a sun screen, it does a haphazard job at both.  I have to be extra careful of my skin, so I need to wear at least a 30 SPF sun screen every day. This way, I can moisturize my skin with this product and then protect my skin with a good sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The cute little pouch it comes in.  I feel so pampered with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am finding this cream is especially effective when used in conjunction with [[ASIN:B00IROPDPS ResurFACE Luxurious Premium Quality Night Cream by Protege Beauty]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product for those looking for an effective facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using EMFACEiZE every day for a couple of weeks now.  It&#x27;s not a miracle cream, but it is a very high quality daily moisturizer with some unique qualities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EMFACiZE is scent-free.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s absorbed quickly into skin.&lt;br /&gt;A little dab&#x27;ll do ya!  It doesn&#x27;t take much.&lt;br /&gt;The list of ingredients leans towards the natural.  There are jojoba and avocado oils; pomegranate has a presence, and the rest of the ingredients have pronounceable names.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though skin feels tight after application, the cream does not dry. The tightness takes a bit of getting used to, but it is visible which does make one look a bit younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is not mayonnaise-y; this cream is much lighter, which makes it good for under makeup.&lt;br /&gt;There is no SPF protection, so you&#x27;ll either need a sunscreen in addition, or your makeup should have an SPF rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have cosmetic-sensitive skin and lots of skin treatments cause nasty little subdermal bumps.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for two weeks and have yet to experience a reaction.  It&#x27;s safe around eyes and mouth.  Yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a big fan of Korean BBs.  The EMFACEiZE is an excellent base for BBs--it keeps the BB from drying out skin and settling into wrinkles.  In addition, there&#x27;s some ingredient in the EmFACEize that catches the light and makes skin look better than it actually is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EMFACEiZE is very good value for the money.  It compares favorably with other creams I&#x27;ve used at many different price points like Clinique, Dr. Perricone (the gold standard), and Olay products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve only been using the product for two weeks, I can&#x27;t address long-range benefits, but the short term benefits make this product well worth the purchase.  While I was given a sample for review, I would not hesitate to purchase it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several face products over the years and they were some what disappointing but this one works really well. So much so my husband says my face is glowing. It&#x27;s the best that I&#x27;ve used without going to get a chemical peel from a professional plus none of the after affects just great results. It works and for the price it&#x27;s a great buy. I recommend this to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I like this cream.  Not only does it moisturize but it also works to remove lines and discoloration.  i use it with Protege Collage which have been lightening the sun spots on my face and my skin looks smoother. The face cream leaves my skin soft, absorbs quickly and well,  my makeup goes on well over it.  It seems to smooth out my lines right away. I have used every type of product and this combo is working to repair the damage of years and sun.  The company stands behind their products 100%, respond quickly, and provide fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I like the way it goes on as it is non greasy, and a small amount does go a long way.  you can use it day or night and it does seem to make your skin look and feel better, after a few applications.</li>
            <li> It was good as a moisturizer but not the greatest at reducing fine lines and wrinkles</li>
            <li> I have the eye cream and it works fabulous so I had to try out the moisturizer and of course was not dissapointed with this product either! During the summer my skin needs the extra attention and hydration because of the humidity, wind, and sun. This product delivers and I am very satisfied with this purcahse!</li>
            <li> I really like this face cream.. Wish it came in larger quantity.. I went through it too fast.  I can recommend</li>
            <li> I am a lover of all things skincare, so naturally I&#x27;m always looking for a great product to use on my skin. The EmFACEize daily moisturizer has now become my new go to moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always had a rough time finding a moisturizer that works well with my skin type. I tend to have dry skin, with a very small area that gets oily. I love how this works on my skin. It is light feeling on the skin, and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy or slick feeling once applied. It quickly absorbs into my skin. I use this in the morning prior to applying my foundation. I wash my face, then apply the EmFACEize, let it set for 2-3 minutes, then apply my foundation. I notice that my skin alone feels very soft, and the dry areas are starting to become less. It also provides a great base for my foundation, and doesn&#x27;t make my makeup look heavy or cakey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I really enjoy this, and it has replaced my old moisturizer. I am still using this, and haven&#x27;t yet used up the entire container, so the long term effects I cannot comment on, but so far so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> Love it... Makes my skin feel awesome...and looks more healthier now...</li>
            <li> I was sent this face cream to test for Protege Beauty (THANK YOU!!).  Even though I am 41 I have very oily skin so I am always a little apprehensive when it comes to face creams but I really loved this one.  It quickly absorbed into my skin and left it feeling soft and smooth not greasy or sticky AT ALL and helped smooth out my fine lines.  I also used this cream as a post peel moisturizer and it worked amazingly to help heal my skin.  Also, a little goes a long way which is always a bonus!  This is now a staple in my skin care routine :)</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for 4 days so, I can&#x27;t speak to the claims this company guarantee&#x27;s HOWEVER....the product is luxurious and feels really nice on the skin.  It seems hydrating and does a very nice job of softening the skin.  The company is very customer oriented, I like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot give a 5 star rating as of yet...I will come back in 3 or 4 weeks with update.  As with ALL face and neck products, you honestly cannot expect miracles in a jar...keep that i mind and you can go from there....the most I expect is smooth, moisturized skin thats feels and appears to be well cared for and pampered.</li>
            <li> Nothing to write home about.The eye creme is very good.</li>
            <li> This is a &amp;#34;light, light, light&amp;#34; cream which moisturizes beautifully. Only a very little dab is needed to cover the face, neck and upper chest. It feels great as it&#x27;s put on and absorbs quickly. I&#x27;ve used many other brands of comparable cost and this is the very best. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Protege EmFACEize Fortified Daily Defense Cream comes in a cute little velvety bag and a 2 oz (60mL) container.  The packaging says that a little goes a long way and I have to agree.  Just a dip of your fingertip will suffice for half of your face.  Another dip for the other side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This daily defense cream is not tested on animals and is cruelty free.  It is packed full of amazing ingredients which are designed to help fight against environmental damage and keep your face feeling young and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little bit worried when I saw the yellow color of the cream. It gives it a thick almost glue look. You need not worry though because it is not thick. It has the perfect creamy-ness to it.  It will also not leave your skin feeling greasy.  It has a skin-firming non-greasy formula.</li>
            <li> Finished using my other products I had bought at 5 times the price.  Have been using this about a week.  Seems to be doing the same great job the other much higher product that they wanted to force you to spend 200.00 a month with auto dlvy for 3 products.&lt;br /&gt;Went on Amazon and studied all the reviews and found 3 products, a serum, a face cream and an eye product for way less.  Hope this combination will work together.  The other product did show great results but the price was extreme.  Not willing to spend 2400.00 a year on this 67 year old face.</li>
            <li> First I use their serum; Collage.  Then I wait a few minutes and use their moisturizer, Emfaceize, mixed with a dab of my Chanel make up.  Since I started this little regime, so many people have complemented my skin I think I may have to use it forever.  The cream has a particularly lovely aroma and absorbs perfectly.  I first found these products by googling the ingredients from La Mer&#x27;s serum.  Fabulous without the enormous price tag!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Xoxobetsy</li>
            <li> This is the second product I have ordered from the Prot&amp;eacute;g&amp;eacute; line.  They are both quality products and well packaged.  This Emfacize cream is very light and doesn&#x27;t feel cakey on your face.  It dries quickly and works well with my makeup and other beauty products.  Essentially no smell.</li>
            <li> Same white  flakes after it is absorbed as with the eye cream .</li>
            <li> I found this to be a desirable product to use twice daily for protecting and helping my skin to look its best. For the two weeks I used the product, I enjoyed it and found it comfortable on my skin leaving it with a softness and a bit of a glow. Nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it a magic bullet? No, those really don&#x27;t exist. But will it help you to look your best? I think it will. I can recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It is too soon to say if it is beneficial for me or not...I will continue to try it out before I make judgement...but I will say one thing...it feels very sticky going on...and then the stickness feeling goes away...Will use it for another week or so to really say how I feel about it...</li>
            <li> Same comments as it&#x27;s partner.  It&#x27;s just not for me.  I don&#x27;t care for sticky skin and not being able to apply makeup when I want, which it very seldom, so this really was a big time bummer for me.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing anti-aging moisturizer. A little bit goes a very long way, and I can&#x27;t believe how soft and radiant my skin is. I use it twice a day, and love that it absorbs quickly, and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy. I highly recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;*I was given this product for free, for review purposes*</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the EmFACEize for almost a week now and I have to say it&#x27;s a great product! I love the lightness of the cream and it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy like some I&#x27;ve used. It also has diminished some of the fine lines around my eyes in the process! And the scent is very pleasant! I highly recommend this cream!</li>
            <li> I really like EMFACIZE, it is a lightweight moisturizer that does not leave your face oily or cause it to breakout.  A little goes a long way and leaves your face moisturized all day.  I am loving all the Protégé Beauty products that I have purchased, this is my third.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy or oily on my skin, which I love!  This cream is wonderful and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> This product also works very well. I apply each morning after I shower and complete my facial regime. It feels almost as if it&#x27;s tightening your skin after you apply it, but then it looks great on and your skin feels soft and well moisturized.</li>
            <li> I also use their night cream version of this and its wonderful, however this as soon as I place on my face it starts going to work. It is not greasy or smelly its very light. You can wear this under your makeup the only thing this product does not contain is spf which is odd for a day cream in my opinion. I&#x27;ve noticed my pores are tight, my face has a sort of glow to it that my other creams do not do. I am in love with this company and so will you! Was sent for review purposes. Tested, Tried and Approved!</li>
            <li> My makeup flakes when applied over moisturizer,  wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several months now in the morning.  At night I use their night cream.  This moisturizer is very light and not greasy. Perhaps my face is on the dry side, but I do not feel that this provides enough hydration for my skin.  I still have some dryness around the corners of my mouth.  Also, it makes my skin feel tight afterwards.  I won&#x27;t buy this again in the future, but I do like their night cream a lot.</li>
            <li> still using it haven&#x27;t seen no change yet</li>
            <li> Box was opened and contents had been used as sealed top was unsealed. I threw it away. Too much red tape to send back for the price!!</li>
            <li> it looked like it was opened before, no inner lid and it was only half full</li>
            <li> Great product.  I&#x27;ve been using this daily and have noticed my skin is moisturized and much softer than it used to be.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel nice and soft.  Better than the Olay I had been using.  I&#x27;ll buy more when needed.  Good value.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my mom and she just loves it, It really does work. It has helped on reducing the fine lines and wrinkles on her face. Definitely going to purchase more soon.</li>
            <li> I like this face cream.  It&#x27;s creamy, not too thick, and runs a bit during application.  It has a tightening effect on the skin at first but after several applications that tends to go away.  Skin does feel firmer after a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I much prefer for night-time use, after shower, as it doesn&#x27;t contain SPF.  Helps lighten and firm skin under the eyes without irritation. Works well on the skin of the neck area, too.&lt;br /&gt;Only drawback for me is the lack of SPF protection for daytime use.&lt;br /&gt;I received the Protege Emfaceize in order to facilitate this review.  All opinions are my own and based on my own experience with the item.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for two weeks.My skin feels better and smooth. I have seen a little bit of difference in my wrinkles.  I will definately purchase buy this product again.</li>
            <li> My poor skin must think I&#x27;m some kind of evilly sadistic torture genius. We barely get over the dry, cold weather of winter when suddenly everything changes and I&#x27;m subjecting my skin to the harsh rays of the sun, along with salt, sand, chlorine, briar patches! I think the least I can do is offer some sort of soothing protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my ongoing quest to find THE perfect face cream, the holy grail that will stop wrinkles cold in their tracks, tighten my pores, brighten my complexion and leave my visage so smooth and creamy that passing babies will cry out in jealousy, I was happy to try EmFACEize from Protege Beauty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The name is cute and clever, but did the product live up to its nomenclature? For me, I think it did. After using this for a week, during which I was out swimming and in the sun almost every day. I felt like it truly quenched and replenished my moisture-hungry skin.  The formula feels lush and non-greasy and it really takes only a small amount to cover your face. My skin immediately felt softer and more supple after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking over the ingredients, I can see why it feels so effective. It contains a combination of hyaluronic acid, jojoba oil, and almond oil to fight dryness, vitamin E and lycopene to combat UV damage, and collagen, pomegranate seed oil, and avocado oil to help improve elasticity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that it is made right here in the USA and is not tested on animals!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I had a great experience with EmFACEize and would certainly add it to my skincare routine!</li>
            <li> this is just an awful product. It does not work, makes your face breakout. I would not recommend it at all.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few days I honestly can say my face is softer then before using this product.&lt;br /&gt;The product is unscented and has natural ingredients. A little amount is needed to cover to face and neck. My face is smooth as silk !!!</li>
            <li> so far so good,  you only need a little bit, I do like how it moisturizes my face, pores seem to be smaller, and make up goes on smooth, I would recommend this product</li>
            <li> I can see why other people would like this and I love the night cream by Protege so much, I thought I would give this a try too. It was not for me. I feel a distinct tightening on my face when I used it, but it didn&#x27;t have that effect on my neck and it didn&#x27;t seem to last over time. I admit that I am one of those people who things tend to not work for; things tend to do the opposite for me, so I wasn&#x27;t surprised. I was just disappointed, because I love the night cream by the company so much. It is really hard to find a product with such a great list of ingredients for the price, and the return was simple. The texture of the cream is lovely and light, didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all, and VERY light pleasant scent. I am glad I tried it, just bummed it didn&#x27;t seem to be the product for me.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is good, my skin feels very soft and is true about the lift sensation in your skin. Skin feels great. A small amount is enough for your whole face, I like that is made of natural products and cruelty free.&lt;br /&gt;The only think I found is when I apply the moisturizer and the after my make up. The moisturizers makes a layer and when apply the make up the don&#x27;t mix so well. Maybe I need to wait more for the moisturizer to get absorb in my skin, but it will help to do it fast for the morning hurries. I will keep on use this product to see fulls results and try match it with my make up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 weeks now.  I can see a definite change in my skin texture, but I was hoping for more improvement for the grooves and dips around the nose to chin area of the face.  This has not happened yet.  It&#x27;s very slight if any at this point.  I will continue to use it as I like the texture and the moisture.  But do not see a definite change in my lifting of the face yet.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about two weeks and can see a difference in my skin.  It seems firmer.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic.  I really love the way it hydrates my skin.  The description is true that you only need a small amount to make a difference.  I have been using this product for a few weeks and see a difference.  Now I am ordering the night crème!</li>
            <li> I really could not see a difference in my skin using this.  One thing that I did not like was that it made my face feel tight after it dried.  Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have only had this face cream for a couple of days but I already love it. It makes my face feel soft and even though they didn&#x27;t say it does this it makes my face feel firmer. one thing I especially like is that the company periodically send me tips on how to use the cream and make it more effective such as warming your face etc. Excellent tips!</li>
            <li> This cream does not absorb into skin. Stays on top. Doesn&#x27;t seem to have any benefit for face . Its like a body lotion  thin.</li>
            <li> Loves this moisturizer! Leaves skin very soft but it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film on your skin.</li>
            <li> Ordered once before and got wrong item..sent back..dared to order again..I like it..im going to try the night cream..this doesnt have spf in it but I still like it.</li>
            <li> Love it! It&#x27;s really working. My face looks brighter and younger.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only 28 and wanted to work to take care of my skin. I&#x27;ve tried many different brands of moisturizers and anti aging creams. This one I was skeptical about. It took a few weeks of using it daily to see the results, but it&#x27;s totally worth it. After it few weeks, my skin felt and looked tighter, my pores got smaller, other ppl noticed a glow in my complexion. You don&#x27;t use a lot and the product will last a long time. I suggest this to everyone! :)</li>
