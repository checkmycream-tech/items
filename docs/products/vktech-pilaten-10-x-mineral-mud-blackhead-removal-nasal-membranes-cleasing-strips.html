            <li>It works really good!!!</li>
            <li>Dawn works best.</li>
            <li>Awesome service and great product!!</li>
            <li>These aren&#x27;t the best.</li>
            <li>i love it, its just like the description, I just need the ingredients!!!</li>
            <li>I used it all over my tzone and got great results.</li>
            <li>lol .. wouldn&#x27;t recommend it .</li>
            <li>But it does the job great.</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t work as great as my Biore strips</li>
            <li>I found these to work great for my blackheads.</li>
            <li>A great product</li>
            <li>that I can get my hands on and haven&#x27;t found any that work as good as this stuff.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s good if you have blackheads on the tip of your nose</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so good in taking out everything that it</li>
            <li>I had heard some good things about them.</li>
            <li>The charcoal in it is good for removing toxins.</li>
            <li>Great and cheap product!</li>
            <li>; ... the good shine, not the oily kind.</li>
            <li>The Elmer&#x27;s glue might work better!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I have used every kind of pore strip sold in the US.  </li>
            <li>There still might be a darker stain, but put a bit more Dawn on it as a pretreater and it will come out in the wash.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more and giving as gifts.</li>
            <li>and that was when I decided to find a better alternative.</li>
            <li>and glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li>but I absolutely love how it smells.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work any better than water alone.</li>
            <li>It took 3 or 4 applications, but I am satisfied with the result of these blackhead removers.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to use this product after reading others reviews.</li>
            <li>They are so cheap and come with so many packets that it&#x27;s not a problem.</li>
            <li>And i have lots of blackheads, this product is the best black head product ive tried.</li>
            <li>Liked it it really does what it say it do</li>
            <li>u have to ise it a few times before seeing great results, but it definatly softens the skin and pulls blackheads out and to the surface!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to buy things from Americas, the fee for shiping is never more than 8,40€ for a lot more weight !!!!!!!</li>
            <li>It went on smoothly and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this was at such a good deal of 4$ compared to the 8$ pore strips you buy from the drug store.</li>
            <li>I have tried these as many different ways as i can think of, (for using blackhead removers).</li>
            <li>When I first wanted to buy it</li>
            <li>One last thing that i will add, if you seal the pouch up well you will be able to get up to 4 uses on just one pouch.</li>
            <li>First, they took for every to get here.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got a piece that&#x27;s too large or</li>
            <li>Does NOT remove blackheads but certainly helps.</li>
            <li>This stuff burnt my face pretty severely, it&#x27;s been 3 days and my skin is still bright red and rough in texture.</li>
            <li>I used it on my whole face and it works a lot like the peel away</li>
            <li>that much).</li>
            <li>Okay product doesn&#x27;t really take off black heads/whiteheads to well</li>
            <li>and you should wash your face and your face has to be clean and dry when applying this.</li>
            <li>I used them a few times and found that I would have more clogged pores using this then just washing my face.</li>
            <li>Leaves your very soft</li>
            <li>this is light years ahead and hands down everything you&#x27;ll never get from Biore and at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really help much with the black, not as much as pore strips!</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t clear any pores.</li>
            <li>The only problem I have with it is it is really drippy.</li>
            <li>My wife and I tried this product and we were both surprised on how well it worked.</li>
            <li>If first layer isn&#x27;t completely dry, you&#x27;ll end up picking that layer off when you touch</li>
            <li>The product is a liquid (I knew it would be and was excited to try something new, and something that had a larger reach for my face) but it is just too messy.</li>
            <li>Then again I&#x27;ve used it only a few times, so maybe it will be better, but for now it is only 3 of 5 stars.</li>
            <li>It did dry to a peelable mask which I didn&#x27;t think it really would.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to pull off if you apply a thick enough layer.</li>
            <li>Basically it was a hot mess to put on.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really work when i peeled the product off , my black heads were still on my nose and not on the product.</li>
            <li>Umm... I don&#x27;t think it really does anything to help removing black heads ...</li>
            <li>If your pores aren&#x27;t too bad, this is a good product.</li>

            <li> The only thing is that you do have to wait for it to fully dry</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, oily/acne prone skin with patches that get dry and flakey - pretty much everything bad.</li>
            <li> I have never completely gotten rid of them before.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and even worse because im a chef thats always in the hot kitchen, not very good for my skin.</li>
            <li> The black liquid can get a bit messy but you get so much product for $3.</li>
            <li> The mask takes a long time to dry</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not near to try it at this price !</li>
            <li> I put this on my nose and let it dry.</li>
            <li> You can tell it&#x27;s dry when it&#x27;s matte.</li>
            <li> When applying the masque you should wear a towel as a bib and even a few minutes after application until it&#x27;s dry enough not to drip off your nose.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s painful, it&#x27;s mostly b/c</li>
            <li> You need to wash it off while it&#x27;s still wet.</li>
            <li> This is a liquid mask in a packet it can get messy and there is enough in each pouch for your face</li>
            <li> and it will work as expected.</li>
            <li> pat it dry and apply a thin layer (specific areas or entire face).</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s gets those and other like Bior</li>
            <li> This product works so well - not just for blackheads, but also for a lot of other grossness I&#x27;ve seen come out of my pores.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really great at pealing away all the nasty stuff that gets in your pores and removing any dead skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned to steer clear of the eye area as the skin is too thin for this mask and peeling will not end well.</li>
            <li> It is impossible to remove it cleanly without having a black smudge on your face.</li>
            <li> It gets into all the little crevices that those other strips just don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> My face feels cleaner after using this product, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do the job promised, by removing black heads.</li>
            <li> The black stuff does washout of clothes IF you get it to the sink before it drys on your clothes.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t pull out any of my black heads</li>
            <li> I opened the package and there was this black bud substance.</li>
            <li> If u have alot of black heads</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t pull up any type of black heads or anything.</li>
            <li> This thing didn&#x27;t do a thing for me but a mess on my face</li>
            <li> but they are a bit less harsh.</li>
            <li> All this product removes is dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> I twitch my face to loosen the edges and begin to peel with a firm grip of edges.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s messy.</li>
            <li> WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money or time.</li>
            <li> My sister ordered them and all I know is that she did not enjoy the project.</li>
            <li> Not a strong smell either I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t prove it yet, but I think this mask is the reason I&#x27;ve seen very little breakouts</li>
            <li> Use small amounts and pat on skin like you you would concealer or else</li>
            <li> I have seen hardly any being removed.</li>
            <li> product will be hard to apply and spread.</li>
            <li> have complained about the smell</li>
            <li> 29 € for shipping a few grams of stuff to France !!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it did not remove anything from my pores but it did remove some hair.</li>
            <li> this stuff is terrible what is a mess!</li>
            <li> VERY DISAPPOINTING.</li>

            <li> My face feels cleaner after using this product, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do the job promised, by removing black heads. I have seen hardly any being removed. Then again I&#x27;ve used it only a few times, so maybe it will be better, but for now it is only 3 of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I purchased this from another website I googled instructions and you should wash your face and your face has to be clean and dry when applying this. The mask takes a long time to dry so I sat I front of a fan. It works really good!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is really great at pealing away all the nasty stuff that gets in your pores and removing any dead skin. The only problem I have with it is it is really drippy. When applying the masque you should wear a towel as a bib and even a few minutes after application until it&#x27;s dry enough not to drip off your nose. The black stuff does washout of clothes IF you get it to the sink before it drys on your clothes. You need to wash it off while it&#x27;s still wet. Dawn works best. There still might be a darker stain, but put a bit more Dawn on it as a pretreater and it will come out in the wash.</li>
            <li> i love it, its just like the description, I just need the ingredients!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried these as many different ways as i can think of, (for using blackhead removers). There are no instructions in english so it is a bit of guess work. And i have decided they just don&#x27;t work to what I need. There is not enough stick from them to pull out any blackheads. The product is a liquid (I knew it would be and was excited to try something new, and something that had a larger reach for my face) but it is just too messy. It is impossible to remove it cleanly without having a black smudge on your face. I like to use pore strips as a way to close my facial routine. I didn&#x27;t want to have to wash my face again.&lt;br /&gt;Overall the pull on these is no different then if you put glue on your hand and pulled it off. All this product removes is dead skin cells. VERY DISAPPOINTING. would not purchase again, would not recomend.&lt;br /&gt;this was at such a good deal of 4$ compared to the 8$ pore strips you buy from the drug store. However i think overall i want something that works, rather then saving myself 4$</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really work when i peeled the product off , my black heads were still on my nose and not on the product.</li>
            <li> I have used every kind of pore strip sold in the US.  that I can get my hands on and haven&#x27;t found any that work as good as this stuff. It gets into all the little crevices that those other strips just don&#x27;t. I used it all over my tzone and got great results. I will be buying more and giving as gifts.</li>
            <li> This thing didn&#x27;t do a thing for me but a mess on my face</li>
            <li> This stuff burnt my face pretty severely, it&#x27;s been 3 days and my skin is still bright red and rough in texture. I would definitely not recommended this stuff.</li>
            <li> Umm... I don&#x27;t think it really does anything to help removing black heads ... It hurts when u peel it off, like ripping tape off leg hair lol .. wouldn&#x27;t recommend it .</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really help much with the black, not as much as pore strips! But it&#x27;s good if you have blackheads on the tip of your nose it&#x27;s gets those and other like Bior don&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t pull out any of my black heads</li>
            <li> Works blackheads are gone</li>
            <li> Awesome service and great product!!</li>
            <li> This product works so well - not just for blackheads, but also for a lot of other grossness I&#x27;ve seen come out of my pores. I have very sensitive, oily/acne prone skin with patches that get dry and flakey - pretty much everything bad. I can&#x27;t prove it yet, but I think this mask is the reason I&#x27;ve seen very little breakouts lately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;APPLICATION --- I like to wash my face, pat it dry and apply a thin layer (specific areas or entire face). Use small amounts and pat on skin like you you would concealer or else product will be hard to apply and spread. Once dry apply a second layer. If first layer isn&#x27;t completely dry, you&#x27;ll end up picking that layer off when you touch it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For removal I twitch my face to loosen the edges and begin to peel with a firm grip of edges. Peeling does not hurt. If it&#x27;s painful, it&#x27;s mostly b/c I&#x27;ve got a piece that&#x27;s too large or my grip isn&#x27;t close enough to skin. ** I&#x27;ve learned to steer clear of the eye area as the skin is too thin for this mask and peeling will not end well. Same goes for eyebrow hair --- yeah... oouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to Biore strips .... this is light years ahead and hands down everything you&#x27;ll never get from Biore and at a fraction of the price. My skin is so sensitive I have to wet the Biore strips to remove without damaging my skin (which usu renders it ineffective) and that was when I decided to find a better alternative. This product also gets in every nook and cranny unlike the strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using one packet for two masks and several spot applications as needed. Face literally looks &amp;#34;shiny and new&amp;#34; ... the good shine, not the oily kind. I had intended on using this only where I had blackheads but after seeing the smoothing effect it had I had to apply it all over - and glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some have complained about the smell but I absolutely love how it smells. As for redness, I had redness after peeling but it only lasted about 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;mhooked and the only downside I can think of is that it takes forever to deliver.</li>
            <li> This item doesn&#x27;t work..it&#x27;s messy. When I first wanted to buy it I thought this item was going to be a strip but it&lt;br /&gt;wasn&#x27;t. I opened the package and there was this black bud substance. I put this on my nose and let it dry. When I peeled it off, it didn&#x27;t remove any of my blackhead. I thought I maybe didn&#x27;t use enough, so i tried it again. Samething happened, there was no blackheads removed. DONT BUY! WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME.</li>
            <li> ARE YOU JOKING ??? 29 € for shipping a few grams of stuff to France !!!! I&#x27;m used to buy things from Americas, the fee for shiping is never more than 8,40€ for a lot more weight !!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Then I read the comments : does your stuff even works ?&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not near to try it at this price !</li>
            <li> I was very excited to use this product after reading others reviews. It went on smoothly and dries quickly. There is a ton of product in each package so you can use it for multiple applications. It&#x27;s easy to pull off if you apply a thick enough layer. You can tell it&#x27;s dry when it&#x27;s matte. Unfortunately, it did not remove anything from my pores but it did remove some hair.</li>
            <li> Liked it it really does what it say it do</li>
            <li> This is a liquid mask in a packet it can get messy and there is enough in each pouch for your face I used it on my whole face and it works a lot like the peel away mask I&#x27;ve got from a drugstore it is sticky and gummy but dries well so you can peel it well and you can see the dirt when you peel it off . Not a strong smell either I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> My wife and I tried this product and we were both surprised on how well it worked. The only thing is that you do have to wait for it to fully dry and it will work as expected. One last thing that i will add, if you seal the pouch up well you will be able to get up to 4 uses on just one pouch.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so good in taking out everything that it hurts(not that much). But it does the job great. You can notice the difference instantly.  Leaves your very soft</li>
            <li> I just bought these to try them. I had heard some good things about them. They didn&#x27;t work as great as my Biore strips but they are a bit less harsh. The black liquid can get a bit messy but you get so much product for $3. If your pores aren&#x27;t too bad, this is a good product. If they are, I suggest another product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work any better than water alone. The Elmer&#x27;s glue might work better!</li>
            <li> Okay product doesn&#x27;t really take off black heads/whiteheads to well</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I have very oily skin and even worse because im a chef thats always in the hot kitchen, not very good for my skin. And i have lots of blackheads, this product is the best black head product ive tried. If u have alot of black heads u have to ise it a few times before seeing great results, but it definatly softens the skin and pulls blackheads out and to the surface! Great and cheap product!</li>
            <li> Basically it was a hot mess to put on. It did dry to a peelable mask which I didn&#x27;t think it really would. It hurt like a you know what when peeling it off and it didn&#x27;t clear any pores. So over all if you want the same results these gave me you can just go buy some duck tape.</li>
            <li> I found these to work great for my blackheads. I have never completely gotten rid of them before. It took 3 or 4 applications, but I am satisfied with the result of these blackhead removers. I think upkeep once a week will keep blackheads away. They are so cheap and come with so many packets that it&#x27;s not a problem.</li>
            <li> A great product but it took over three weeks to get to me.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t the best. First, they took for every to get here. Second, there are no type of instructions. I used them a few times and found that I would have more clogged pores using this then just washing my face. It didn&#x27;t pull up any type of black heads or anything. Dont waste your money or time. Stick with ur store bought strips.</li>
            <li> My sister ordered them and all I know is that she did not enjoy the project. She said to give it one star, but, well, teenagers can be prude.</li>
            <li> this stuff is terrible what is a mess!</li>
            <li> Does NOT remove blackheads but certainly helps. Pulls off like glue. The charcoal in it is good for removing toxins. HELPS reduce pores.</li>
