            <li>, maybe it&#x27;s not as earthly nuts &amp; berries as I&#x27;d like in a perfect world, but damn</li>
            <li>Smells good and doesn&#x27;t look like a deodorant container!</li>

            <li>Bought this for myself and it works great.  </li>
            <li>Surprisingly, this works all day for me.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t write more except that she loves it and makes me buy it for her!</li>

            <li>The scent is nice.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell.</li>
            <li>And works nicely for my Dgtr .</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant, light scent.  </li>
            <li>The scent is very light, and it seems to prevent--not cover up-- her body odor.</li>
            <li>Good first deodorant!</li>
            <li>I will be getting her more when she gets close to running out.</li>
            <li>LOVE.</li>
            <li>I was the most okay</li>
            <li>my daughters 8 and 12 both love this deodorant.</li>
            <li>Kids love it</li>
            <li>and she was very excited when she received it.</li>
            <li>This has a nice clean scent and holds up all day.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and was pleased to have no irritation and great results with this deodorant  </li>
            <li>Right after I looked up deodorants for kids and was so pleased to find this!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many aluminum free deodorants, and</li>
            <li>This is great for my eight year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>This deodorant doesn&#x27;t wash off easily -</li>
            <li>If your child has strong body odor, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li>On a positive note it did have a nice smell.</li>
            <li>They are gentle, easy to use, and smell nice, too.  </li>
            <li>Light perfume.</li>
            <li>I did not want her using anything harsh and this stuff is perfect.</li>
            <li>They enjoy being so &amp;</li>
            <li>/&gt;*As for the scent, the&amp;#34;Purple&amp;#34; smells REALLY good (I&#x27;m normally super sensitive.</li>
            <li>This seems to be a light flower and not too sweet.</li>
            <li>Not terrible, but too much for me.</li>
            <li>This one smells fresh and clean - a smell that I could also see as a perfume or body spray.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly.</li>
            <li>This works well for me (I don&#x27;t have very strong body odor), but it doesn&#x27;t completely get rid of my daughter&#x27;s BO (which is why I bought this).</li>
            <li>lol Smells really good going on, but didn&#x27;t last and made me stinky after a few hours.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just light, clean, and fresh (not like a cleaning product though, haha).</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a great alternative to regular deodorant special for kids that shouldn&#x27;t be exposed to all those harmful chemicals from a young age.</li>
            <li>I love this natural deodorant!</li>
            <li>Great for a young girl just starting to wear deodorant!</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m definitely a Clinical Strength formula kind of girl).</li>
            <li>(HIIT/crossfit/weights) and sometimes I re-apply prior to the workout, and sometimes I don&#x27;t (just my own paranoia).</li>
            <li>It is not very bad but still it gives her a reaction.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even made my own, with somewhat effective, but highly irritating results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since found that I am extremely sensitive to baking soda, which is really the odor eliminating component in most of those formulas.</li>
            <li>Kind Fresh Kidz deoderants &#x3D; this purple one, the pink &amp; the boys.</li>
            <li>Really like this one, and my daughter does too!  </li>
            <li>also - is gentle on her skin and keeps her smelling fresh.</li>
            <li>We will DEFINITELY use this as our go-to for many years to come.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve literally peeled sheets of blackened, papery skin from my pits (I have dark skin, so any kind of hyper-pigmentation is a real issue).</li>
            <li>My daughter really likes this product and says it works well.</li>
            <li>This product is working really well on my 10-year-old daughter</li>
            <li>I did notice some off/on itchiness after about 1 1/2 weeks of first starting to use Fresh Kidz.</li>
            <li>My 8 and 10 year old both need to wear deodorant (super active and super smelly haha!).</li>
            <li>Nice scent for my 7 year old who just started needing a little something.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Works better than the other natural products I&#x27;ve tried for my daughter.</li>
            <li>Over all I would recommend trying it if your child doesn&#x27;t have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>this &#x27;kids&#x27; one is the first one that actually worked for me.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t) and perhaps subsequent applications at first.</li>
            <li>We do no use it daily since she doesn&#x27;t sweat/smell every day specially now that we are back home, but the days she does use it she keeps scratching her arm pits even after taking a bath.</li>
            <li>This stuff has made her smell fresh all day long so far.</li>
            <li>I finally decided to give in and try deodorant, but was looking for something natural and gentle.</li>
            <li>Bought for my 6 year old daughter who has been having some body odor.</li>
            <li>I had a natural option for my daughter that wasn&#x27;t working</li>
            <li>Use on my 4 year old girl.</li>
            <li>My two year old has that &amp;#34;onion&amp;#34; smell underneath her arms and needs deodorant.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my almost 6 year old when we were on vacation.</li>
            <li>We will try reintroducing this natural deodorant in a couple of weeks before giving up on it.</li>
            <li>Again, it works well for my 7 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>Wish they had a stronger adult version for me though...</li>
            <li>About 2 years ago, I decided to go all natural with my products/life.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re coming straight from commercial aluminum land, then you may need an adjustment period to purge your pores</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not accustomed to using a roll-on, the benefits far outweigh the temporary wetness.</li>
            <li>I purchased one for my 8 year old son, and it&#x27;s become a part of their morning routine.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t last more than few hours.</li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t stain the clothes since it takes a little longer than normal deodorant to dry.</li>
            <li>It was very hot and for the first time she was sweating and having a little smell, my mom wanted to use regular deodorant on her</li>
            <li>My daughter is 6 and is very active and gets hot fast.  </li>
            <li>Finally we may have found a natural &#x27;tickle treatment&#x27; that works!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much nicer than the pink scent.  </li>
            <li>I have tried several things to help my 5-year old daughter&#x27;s body odor, to no avail.</li>
            <li>All of them were fairly strongly scented with chemical (not natural) perfume &amp; I had a hard time choosing which scent</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve been natural for a long time</li>
            <li>The scent was lovely but it caused my daughter&#x27;s armpits to break out in a pretty bad rash.</li>
            <li>That said, I&#x27;ve likely tried EVERY SINGLE brand/type of naturally formulated deodorant on the market.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find my 6 year old daughter had body odor under her armpits and as we had a busy day, getting late, no time for shower, I washed her with a washcloth and put her to bed.  </li>

            <li> Slightly strange feeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent upwards of $25 a pop on things that were either TOTALLY ineffective</li>
            <li> At times, I could barely put my arms down from the pain/swelling.</li>
            <li> This is only for kids/people who just slightly have a stink to them.</li>
            <li> Deodorant goes on wet and stays wet for a while.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that it&#x27;s really wet &amp; takes a bit to dry.</li>
            <li> I found with the other stuff I was getting for her</li>
            <li> This product may work well for other children but not for mine.</li>
            <li> Less scent to this one than the pink label</li>
            <li> I hate floral, musky, strong, or perfumed scents).</li>
            <li> you could still smell a little BO</li>
            <li> I wanted something without a bunch of harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> After several weeks of using one scent or the other of Fresh Kidz deoderants, I broke out in a terribly &amp; itchy rash on my underarms - never ever had anything happen like that to my armpits.</li>
            <li> Trying to find an aluminum AND baking soda free solution has been basically impossible until now!</li>
            <li> My daughter is only 5 and needs it unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I learned the hard way.</li>
            <li> but unlike the &amp;#34;Pink&amp;#34; Natural Roll On it caused her underarms to itch like crazy!</li>
            <li> I can certainly work up a terrible stink doing almost nothing.</li>
            <li> Aside from the nasty news about aluminum containing products, even sensitive skin formulas eventually caused painful cysts and ingrown hairs in my pits.</li>
            <li> I may smell &amp;#34;sweaty&amp;#34; afterwards, but it&#x27;s NOT the rank, BO pits</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I had a natural option for my daughter that wasn&#x27;t working so I decided to try this kids version and it works great.  My daughter is 6 and is very active and gets hot fast.  I found with the other stuff I was getting for her you could still smell a little BO but with this stuff I haven&#x27;t noticed any.  Very happy with this and will buy again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful. My daughter is only 5 and needs it unfortunately. I did not want her using anything harsh and this stuff is perfect. Smells great also and the smell is not over powering. I will be getting her more when she gets close to running out.</li>
            <li> It works!  I&#x27;ve tried many aluminum free deodorants, and this &#x27;kids&#x27; one is the first one that actually worked for me.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> Nice scent for my 7 year old who just started needing a little something. Not overbearing or too &amp;#34;adult&amp;#34; smelling.</li>
            <li> Smells nice. Dries quickly. Works better than the other natural products I&#x27;ve tried for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Use on my 4 year old girl. She inherited her daddy&#x27;s stinky pits. Even with bathing daily sometimes she has an odor. This works. Only complaint is that it&#x27;s really wet &amp; takes a bit to dry.</li>
            <li> Smells great.  Daughter loves it.  Good first deodorant!</li>
            <li> The product worked to suppress B.O. but unlike the &amp;#34;Pink&amp;#34; Natural Roll On it caused her underarms to itch like crazy!</li>
            <li> This is great for my eight year old daughter.  She likes using it because she feels like a big kid.  It has a pleasant, light scent.  It works well also - is gentle on her skin and keeps her smelling fresh.</li>
            <li> My pre teen daughter loves the scent and now puts on her &amp;#34;deodorant&amp;#34; without being asked!!! Happy Mom!!!</li>
            <li> My two year old has that &amp;#34;onion&amp;#34; smell underneath her arms and needs deodorant. This stuff has made her smell fresh all day long so far.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last more than few hours.</li>
            <li> The scent is nice. Deodorant goes on wet and stays wet for a while. Slightly strange feeling. This works well for me (I don&#x27;t have very strong body odor), but it doesn&#x27;t completely get rid of my daughter&#x27;s BO (which is why I bought this). If your child has strong body odor, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend. This is only for kids/people who just slightly have a stink to them.</li>
            <li> I have tried several things to help my 5-year old daughter&#x27;s body odor, to no avail. I finally decided to give in and try deodorant, but was looking for something natural and gentle. This stuff is great! The scent is very light, and it seems to prevent--not cover up-- her body odor. We will buy this again!</li>
            <li> I love this natural deodorant! I bought it for my almost 6 year old when we were on vacation. It was very hot and for the first time she was sweating and having a little smell, my mom wanted to use regular deodorant on her and there was no way I was going to do that. My daughter chose this lavender/purple color over the pink/baby powder one and she was very excited when she received it. It smells great and even I&#x27;m using it know. I love that it doesn&#x27;t stain the clothes since it takes a little longer than normal deodorant to dry. I only gave it 4 stars since it gives my daughter an itch under her armpit pover time. We do no use it daily since she doesn&#x27;t sweat/smell every day specially now that we are back home, but the days she does use it she keeps scratching her arm pits even after taking a bath. It is not very bad but still it gives her a reaction. Also it took a couple of times using it before it happened. Over all I would recommend trying it if your child doesn&#x27;t have very sensitive skin. I think it&#x27;s a great alternative to regular deodorant special for kids that shouldn&#x27;t be exposed to all those harmful chemicals from a young age. We will try reintroducing this natural deodorant in a couple of weeks before giving up on it.</li>
            <li> Works great for kids, but not for adults. I learned the hard way. lol Smells really good going on, but didn&#x27;t last and made me stinky after a few hours. Again, it works well for my 7 year old daughter. Wish they had a stronger adult version for me though...</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this! Smells good and doesn&#x27;t look like a deodorant container! Great for a young girl just starting to wear deodorant!</li>
            <li> LOVE. My 8 and 10 year old both need to wear deodorant (super active and super smelly haha!). This one smells fresh and clean - a smell that I could also see as a perfume or body spray. We will DEFINITELY use this as our go-to for many years to come.</li>
            <li> My daughter really likes this product and says it works well. I haven&#x27;t used it personally so I can&#x27;t write more except that she loves it and makes me buy it for her!</li>
            <li> About 2 years ago, I decided to go all natural with my products/life. While I&#x27;ve managed to switch everything, deodorant has been the ONE thing that has eluded me. I&#x27;ll say it. I can certainly work up a terrible stink doing almost nothing. Even commercial deodorants never worked well for me (I&#x27;m definitely a Clinical Strength formula kind of girl). Aside from the nasty news about aluminum containing products, even sensitive skin formulas eventually caused painful cysts and ingrown hairs in my pits. At times, I could barely put my arms down from the pain/swelling. That said, I&#x27;ve likely tried EVERY SINGLE brand/type of naturally formulated deodorant on the market. I&#x27;ve spent upwards of $25 a pop on things that were either TOTALLY ineffective (I&#x27;m looking at you, TOM&#x27;s) or kept the stink at bay, but left my armpits itchy, burning, scabbed, and darkened. I&#x27;ve literally peeled sheets of blackened, papery skin from my pits (I have dark skin, so any kind of hyper-pigmentation is a real issue). I&#x27;ve even made my own, with somewhat effective, but highly irritating results. I&#x27;ve since found that I am extremely sensitive to baking soda, which is really the odor eliminating component in most of those formulas. Trying to find an aluminum AND baking soda free solution has been basically impossible until now! That said, this stuff is AWESOME!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*If you&#x27;re coming straight from commercial aluminum land, then you may need an adjustment period to purge your pores (I&#x27;ve been natural for a long time so I didn&#x27;t) and perhaps subsequent applications at first. Surprisingly, this works all day for me. I exercise 4-6 times/week (HIIT/crossfit/weights) and sometimes I re-apply prior to the workout, and sometimes I don&#x27;t (just my own paranoia). I may smell &amp;#34;sweaty&amp;#34; afterwards, but it&#x27;s NOT the rank, BO pits smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*While I&#x27;m not accustomed to using a roll-on, the benefits far outweigh the temporary wetness. I&#x27;m getting used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*As for the scent, the&amp;#34;Purple&amp;#34; smells REALLY good (I&#x27;m normally super sensitive. I hate floral, musky, strong, or perfumed scents). It&#x27;s just light, clean, and fresh (not like a cleaning product though, haha). The &amp;#34;Pink&amp;#34; as some reviewers have stated, smells like perfume. Not terrible, but too much for me. I keep that one in my purse for now, but won&#x27;t repurchase. I dunno who&#x27;s kid is wearing that one...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Sure, maybe it&#x27;s not as earthly nuts &amp; berries as I&#x27;d like in a perfect world, but damn if it hasn&#x27;t saved my life!</li>
            <li> Finally we may have found a natural &#x27;tickle treatment&#x27; that works! My peanut has had b.o. since she was 5. It has taken  5 years to find a product that works. Plus we love the scents! (I use it too sometimes.)  I got one for my 8y/o son and he likes it too. Yay!</li>
            <li> I have been using non-aluminum deodorants for years &amp;  thought I would try the Keep it Kind Fresh Kidz deoderants &#x3D; this purple one, the pink &amp; the boys. All of them were fairly strongly scented with chemical (not natural) perfume &amp; I had a hard time choosing which scent I was the most okay with. I did notice some off/on itchiness after about 1 1/2 weeks of first starting to use Fresh Kidz. After several weeks of using one scent or the other of Fresh Kidz deoderants, I broke out in a terribly &amp; itchy rash on my underarms - never ever had anything happen like that to my armpits. This deodorant doesn&#x27;t wash off easily - I found I had to wash the armpits 2 or 3 times to remove the lingering deodorant film.</li>
            <li> great scent.  just what my daughter needed</li>
            <li> Bought this for myself and it works great.  I have sensitive skin and was pleased to have no irritation and great results with this deodorant  Less scent to this one than the pink label but I like both of them.  This seems to be a light flower and not too sweet.</li>
            <li> my daughters 8 and 12 both love this deodorant. They feel so grown up!</li>
            <li> This product is working really well on my 10-year-old daughter</li>
            <li> The scent was lovely but it caused my daughter&#x27;s armpits to break out in a pretty bad rash.</li>
            <li> Kids love it and I dont smell them like before...now I need find something for their feet.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell. And works nicely for my Dgtr .</li>
            <li> Did not work at all for my seven-year-old. This product may work well for other children but not for mine. Will be looking for something else. On a positive note it did have a nice smell.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find my 6 year old daughter had body odor under her armpits and as we had a busy day, getting late, no time for shower, I washed her with a washcloth and put her to bed.  Right after I looked up deodorants for kids and was so pleased to find this!  They are gentle, easy to use, and smell nice, too.  I purchased one for my 8 year old son, and it&#x27;s become a part of their morning routine.  They enjoy being so &amp;#34;grown up&amp;#34;!  And they work.</li>
