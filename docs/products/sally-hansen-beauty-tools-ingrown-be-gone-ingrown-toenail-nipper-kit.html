            <li>Perfect !!</li>
            <li>This set provides the perfect tools to forever banish your ingrown toenails.</li>
            <li>These are great to get my ingrown toenails, but they are now rusting!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Despite the name, this works wonderfully on fingernails too.</li>
            <li>The idea is perfect as I have already used side cutters from my tool box and they worked perfectly LOL.  </li>
            <li>Great what an excellent job!</li>

            <li>okay ........</li>
            <li>works okay for ingrown nails.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The slanted clippers work better that way.  </li>
            <li>applying Tea Tree Oil &amp; &#x27;prying&#x27; the skin from the nail using the smaller tool contained in this package to be sure it gets in + applying an antibacterial ointment with a pain killer &amp; bandaging for a day works perfectly every time.</li>
            <li>Good quality, and the price was right.  </li>
            <li>keep up the good works guys, thanks!.</li>
            <li>They are most easily used by another person who can be facing you.  </li>
            <li>I am much more pain free.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Item works fine.</li>
            <li>Overall happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>eh, either way I clean anything before I use it.</li>
            <li>Do the job,  and price is right !</li>
            <li>This is very pointed and precise for getting at the curled under part of the toenail.</li>
            <li>i am getting married in november</li>
            <li>This product is strong enough to cut through nails, but the tips are blunted, which makes for inaccurate trimming and jagged edges.</li>
            <li>Item shipped fast</li>
            <li>Wife really likes this nipper kit.</li>
            <li>Maybe the other models are better, I&#x27;ll have to try them.  </li>
            <li>I did better just filing the nail down.  </li>
            <li>High quality product.</li>
            <li>sharp, strong, and makes the job easier</li>
            <li>but not pointy enough to get  deep or sharp enough to do a great job.</li>
            <li>First I bought these at a big box store, not Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Package had clearly been opened so</li>
            <li>I used to wait until my toenail was soft after a shower and try to cut away the ingrown curved under part of the toenail with a dental tool.</li>
            <li>This clipper is huge and hard to maneuver.</li>
            <li>It is perfect to get the awkward hard skin or splintering nails out without butchering yourself.</li>

            <li> Package had clearly been opened so</li>
            <li> I used to wait until my toenail was soft after a shower and try to cut away the ingrown curved under part of the toenail with a dental tool.</li>
            <li> This clipper is huge and hard to maneuver.</li>
            <li> It is perfect to get the awkward hard skin or splintering nails out without butchering yourself.</li>
            <li> Have used it half a dozen times and clippers are certainly not sharp enough.  </li>
            <li> I am  finding a use for the long &amp;#34;tool&amp;#34; that is included.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always suffered from really bad toenail and fingernail ingrowns, and this tool in conjunction with attempting to stop biting/ripping the nails off and otherwise keeping them better maintained has almost entirely eliminated ingrowns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and you will get your nails done in half the time than with a regular paid of clippers.</li>
            <li> The nipper is not really strong... much too small for toenails...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little big for my needs.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> My toenail tries to curl under from both sides and starts to look like a tube from the front view.</li>
            <li> not really happy with the product... quite difficult to use too..could get a better deal for the money I paid for this item</li>
            <li> My doctor suggested filing down the center arc of the toenail a little to allow the toenail to flatten out a bit ( in order to &#x27;loosen the clamp pressure&#x27; so to speak).</li>
            <li> Very sharp and the nose is a lot longer than what you can find at the drug store.</li>
            <li> so i did not want to have the surgery to remove it and have a missing toenail for ny wedding dayâ€¦  </li>
            <li> I have had ingrown toenail trouble for years.</li>
            <li> Not the usual small, well made toe nail assistant.</li>
            <li> Wasted funds!</li>
            <li> It was hard getting the clippers under the nail</li>
            <li> Poor Quality</li>
            <li> All in all, a disappointing purchase.</li>
            <li> sort breaks the nail off instead of cutting......</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been afraid to try that.  </li>
            <li> Cutting edges do not line up.</li>
            <li> It is utterly worthless.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is strong enough to cut through nails, but the tips are blunted, which makes for inaccurate trimming and jagged edges. Don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> Perfect !! Do the job,  and price is right !</li>
            <li> Great nippers.  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> The nipper is not really strong... much too small for toenails...</li>
            <li> good tool, good price</li>
            <li> not really happy with the product... quite difficult to use too..could get a better deal for the money I paid for this item</li>
            <li> Package had clearly been opened so I assume it was returned by someone else.  Have used it half a dozen times and clippers are certainly not sharp enough.  I should have returned them.  All in all, a disappointing purchase.</li>
            <li> okay ........but not pointy enough to get  deep or sharp enough to do a great job. sort breaks the nail off instead of cutting...... the file  works okay for ingrown nails.&lt;br /&gt;I would NOT purchase these again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up buying these........Body Toolz Ingrown Toenail Clipper</li>
            <li> I purchased these for an ingrown toenail.  They are most easily used by another person who can be facing you.  Using them yourself means holding them backwards it seems to me and I&#x27;ve been afraid to try that.  The slanted clippers work better that way.  I am  finding a use for the long &amp;#34;tool&amp;#34; that is included.</li>
            <li> This set provides the perfect tools to forever banish your ingrown toenails. Simply use the arrow-head end of the tool to push skin away from the ingrown nail then use the opposite end to file the nail. Within a day your feet will be well on their way back to normal!&lt;br /&gt;This tool works miracles!</li>
            <li> Item shipped fast and I got it in a timely manner. Item works fine. Only concern was that it seemed as though it might have been opened at one point....eh, either way I clean anything before I use it. Overall happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Wife really likes this nipper kit. We bought one about a year ago and my wife&lt;br /&gt;liked it so well she had me order a second pair.&lt;br /&gt;She now keeps one in her travel bag and one at home.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and the nose is a lot longer than what you can find at the drug store. It makes removing ingrown nails very easy.</li>
            <li> doe&#x27;s exactly what it say&#x27;s on the tin, excellent product, would have no problem recommending this product to friends and family.</li>
            <li> I got this for my Father for the reaso it is to be used. He never said if he used it or not. He died two weeks ago, so I can&#x27;t ask him about it.</li>
            <li> Great tool, and works well.</li>
            <li> This product won&#x27;t cut anything, let alone nails.  It is utterly worthless.</li>
            <li> These are great to get my ingrown toenails, but they are now rusting! I have only had them a couple of months. And the file can&#x27;t even get in between my skin and the actual toenail.</li>
            <li> Good quality, and the price was right.  I would recommend these to anyone who is looking for a good pair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always suffered from really bad toenail and fingernail ingrowns, and this tool in conjunction with attempting to stop biting/ripping the nails off and otherwise keeping them better maintained has almost entirely eliminated ingrowns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the name, this works wonderfully on fingernails too. It is perfect to get the awkward hard skin or splintering nails out without butchering yourself. I like to use it after a softening treatment like the Essie Cuticle Treatment Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I do get one, applying Tea Tree Oil &amp; &#x27;prying&#x27; the skin from the nail using the smaller tool contained in this package to be sure it gets in + applying an antibacterial ointment with a pain killer &amp; bandaging for a day works perfectly every time.</li>
            <li> It was hard getting the clippers under the nail ti trim it.  I did better just filing the nail down.  Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Purchased this tool from walmartâ€¦ this is my second time getting an ingrown toenailâ€¦  i am getting married in november so i did not want to have the surgery to remove it and have a missing toenail for ny wedding dayâ€¦  after you figure out hand-eye coordination it works like a dream!  I recommend this to anyone.  It has saved me time,  money,  and my toenail!</li>
            <li> Cutting edges do not line up. Will not even cut fingernails. Poor Quality</li>
            <li> First I bought these at a big box store, not Amazon.  They would not cut my nails, even after a soak. The idea is perfect as I have already used side cutters from my tool box and they worked perfectly LOL.  Maybe the other models are better, I&#x27;ll have to try them.  Now I&#x27;m stuck with these things.  I don&#x27;t think even Walmart would take back a used pair of nail cutters.</li>
            <li> This clipper is huge and hard to maneuver. Not the usual small, well made toe nail assistant. You cannot cut ingrown toe nails with these. Wasted funds!</li>
            <li> Great product. Very easy to use and you will get your nails done in half the time than with a regular paid of clippers.</li>
            <li> Effective and easy to use! Will get it again.</li>
            <li> sharp, strong, and makes the job easier</li>
            <li> I have had ingrown toenail trouble for years. I used to wait until my toenail was soft after a shower and try to cut away the ingrown curved under part of the toenail with a dental tool. This is very pointed and precise for getting at the curled under part of the toenail. My toenail tries to curl under from both sides and starts to look like a tube from the front view. My doctor suggested filing down the center arc of the toenail a little to allow the toenail to flatten out a bit ( in order to &#x27;loosen the clamp pressure&#x27; so to speak). I thought he was reaching but between this tool and the doc&#x27;s advise I am much more pain free.</li>
            <li> High quality product. It&#x27;s a little big for my needs.</li>
            <li> Great what an excellent job! keep up the good works guys, thanks!.</li>
            <li> very nice and useful. thank you for this product.</li>
