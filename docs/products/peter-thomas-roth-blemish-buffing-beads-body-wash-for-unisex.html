            <li>Good for oily skin.</li>

            <li>I absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li>It smells amazing too.</li>
            <li>I opted for this blemish solution because Peter Thomas Roth discontinued their marvelously effective benzoyl peroxide scrub, which itself was a miracle worker.</li>
            <li>I liked it, but wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li>Great to clean out pores.</li>
            <li>Perfect, clear face nowüëç</li>
            <li>However, I have thoroughly enjoyed it.  </li>
            <li>Better than any salicylic face wash</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love the grapefruit smell of this face wash.</li>
            <li>I love Thomas Roth products</li>
            <li>I really love this product - the scent is so refreshing and helps me wake up in the morning.  </li>
            <li>but I love it.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love the smell and feel of it.</li>
            <li>but I did feel exfoliated which felt refreshing.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love the blemish buffing beads cleanser by Peter Thomas Roth.</li>
            <li>I love all his products , you have to try this if you have sought or even severe acne.</li>
            <li>Its an ok product.</li>
            <li>Its better as a face wash but wont buy again.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Made my skin feel very clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>This is a great, fresh smelling product that leaves your skin feeling super clean.</li>
            <li>Not harsh but great at exfoliating the skin.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t have strong odors, and don&#x27;t bleach my sheets.</li>
            <li>This arrived really quickly!  </li>
            <li>The scent is clean but not too strong.</li>
            <li>I used to use Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Wash, but now it just doesn&#x27;t do the job anymore.  </li>
            <li>I also use the glycolic wash for bright soft skin</li>
            <li>I use this as a face wash everyday, and it is the best!</li>
            <li>It feels good on my skin and while my skin isn&#x27;t perfectly clear, I think it has helped a lot.  </li>
            <li>It very powerful smell</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth it!</li>
            <li>Worth a try!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still optimistic but I am well aware that sometimes things look better in the store.</li>
            <li>It is a great product and works really well to clear skin and exfoliate.</li>
            <li>They make my face look clean and polished.</li>
            <li>but I find that a good exfollation really helps keep it clear and smooth.</li>
            <li>Now I use it just because I love the way it keeps my skin so fresh and soft, and it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>I use it daily and the results have been outstanding!  </li>
            <li>It is just the right balance for my super oily skin and breaks through the oil without drying.  </li>
            <li>A great product to buff off dead skin and leave your skin smoother than before.</li>
            <li>The only thing I liked about it was the smell.  </li>
            <li>I use a small amount on my Olay spin brush and it works beautifully.</li>
            <li>used nightly with PTR Max Correction Pads I rarely have a blemish.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve searched high and low for a good price</li>
            <li>This stuff keeps my clogged pores at bay and performs the right amount of exfoliation to prevent breakouts.</li>
            <li>I had probably tried almost every kind of scrub on the market and the only other product I liked was discontinued.</li>
            <li>Well, it does make my skin really soft; I use this on my entire body then, I follow up with a good lotion or oil like coconut oil or Jergens lotion</li>
            <li>Does a great job preventing future breakouts and treating current ones.  </li>
            <li>The buffing beads are amazing for everyday exfoliation and the smell is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>The exfoliating beads are very gentle.  </li>
            <li>This works very well!</li>
            <li>They are more concerned with their &#x27;financial loss&#x27; than they are about the customer receiving satisfaction.  </li>
            <li>Sephora prices were much higher and so I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Noticed blemishes from hot yoga.</li>
            <li>No weird reactions.</li>
            <li>This has helped my skin so much!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to trying more PTR products in the future.</li>
            <li>I have dealt with cystic acne on my chin for about 20 years and this is the first product that has mostly kept the issue at bay for a long period of time.  </li>
            <li>and it leaves my skin super soft.</li>
            <li>but I hit a certain age and BLAMMO</li>
            <li>but I certainly feel cleaner after using it.</li>
            <li>I first started using the product a couple years ago, when I was in high school</li>
            <li>This product does what it promises, and very well.</li>
            <li>but I would not use it on my face as it was drying it too much.</li>
            <li>However, I am getting ready to travel for the holidays,and if they will not deliver my correct merchandise until they receive my return, I will not have it before I travel.  </li>
            <li>They really do their job at clearing away the oils.</li>
            <li>also a much softer feel than a lot of exfoliants.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t really.</li>
            <li>Doesnt really help with body blemishes and dries out skin.</li>
            <li>But at home, I still haven&#x27;t seen any real effects yet.</li>
            <li>and this really works well for me.</li>
            <li>I just ordered more Murad products which will hopefully clear my skin up again within the next week.</li>
            <li>I am a brown man and this product left my skin feeling healthy without losing my natural oils.</li>
            <li>Has been the only face wash to get rid of my adult cystic acne and has made my skin more even and helped with blackheads as well.</li>
            <li>During my actual facial, all the products used were effective.</li>
            <li>It will last a long time and has a nice foam to it.</li>
            <li>I was hoping this would clear up some light back acne</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Totally recommend it, worth every cent.</li>
            <li>I also moisturize daily, which really contributes to getting rid of those bumps, but this product gave me the boost my skin needed to look much healthier.</li>
            <li>It cleaned out my skin and made my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>My entire skincare &amp; makeup routine consists of all natural, holistic products, EXCEPT for this product right here.</li>
            <li>I gave him this to use and his back has really improved!</li>
            <li>It doesnt latter very well like my (benefit bionic blast, which was discontinued by the company!</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and when it gets dry, I get little red bumps on the backs of my arms and on my thighs.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t clear up all the acne</li>
            <li>We have corresponded numerous times and they are absolutely unflexible.  </li>
            <li>It is gentle enough to use every day.</li>
            <li>This cleanser brings the soil and oil deep in your pores to the surface and exfoliates gently.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin soft and clear.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it on my face because I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I used to use benzoyl peroxide products but grew too sensitive.</li>
            <li>but you do feel it when it hits the skin, it tingles with a soft heat, which I dont mind, but</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin prone to breakouts</li>
            <li>Now I use this once every other day to keep my complexion even and open to absorb all the moisturizers and oils I enjoy putting on in the AM &amp; PM.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so hard to find a slightly rough grainy exfoliant; most grains are too small or too smooth to do anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the Peter Thomas Roth Acne line is the only thing that has helped keep my face clear.</li>
            <li>The few that sneak through (usually only if I miss a day or 2 Of product use) heal quickly and redness fades faster than it used to.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, these blemish buffing beads really fell short of my expectations and only caused more irritation to my husband&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>I have tried MULTIPLE other high end products and until I tried the Peter Thomas Roth line I was not getting relief.</li>
            <li>The grains of the products are really big and very abrusive, so if you are use to smaller less abrusive exfoliators then this is not the product for you.</li>

            <li> Now I use this once every other day to keep my complexion even and open to absorb all the moisturizers and oils I enjoy putting on in the AM &amp; PM.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to find a slightly rough grainy exfoliant; most grains are too small or too smooth to do anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the Peter Thomas Roth Acne line is the only thing that has helped keep my face clear.</li>
            <li> The few that sneak through (usually only if I miss a day or 2 Of product use) heal quickly and redness fades faster than it used to.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, these blemish buffing beads really fell short of my expectations and only caused more irritation to my husband&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried MULTIPLE other high end products and until I tried the Peter Thomas Roth line I was not getting relief.</li>
            <li> The grains of the products are really big and very abrusive, so if you are use to smaller less abrusive exfoliators then this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li> I use this exfoliator every other day (a facialist once told me it was not good to exfoliate every single day because it could stimulate more oil production).</li>
            <li> I have not been using it long enough to see any life changing difference to my face</li>
            <li> , if you are highly allergic to everything then the smell might bother you, other than that the smell remind me of other citrus based acne products.</li>
            <li> Although my order was correct, as confirmed by the shipping documents, they shipped the wrong merchandise.  </li>
            <li> I will up date in a few months to let you know how my journey is going so far with this product.</li>
            <li> Can dry out skin.</li>
            <li> The bottle is very large, so it will last me at least 3 if not more months.  </li>
            <li> I would suggest using this everyday to see some major results.</li>
            <li> and it never leaves your face dry!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other brands with the same active ingredient</li>
            <li> It is not too rough and doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;ve exfoliated my face off like some products do.</li>
            <li> oh and a little goes a long way.....</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even bother with other brands to treat my blemish-proned skin anymore.</li>
            <li> Not only that, they have clearly stated in our correspondence that they do not feel they should suffer any inconvenience due to their erroneous shipping merchandise.  </li>
            <li> For this price, I would at least expect results commensurate with the brand&#x27;s reputation and former products--not so with this product.</li>
            <li> This product is a little expensive but you only need a tiny amount to do the job.</li>
            <li> Have used it for 2 months now, few times a week, and noticed improvement.</li>
            <li> I used to use a benzoyl peroxide face wash, but it was a bit too harsh for me.</li>
            <li> it last long after the showering or bathing is over( which can be annoying when you applying lotion, thinking you have tiny bee stings all over your body)</li>
            <li> The small beads polish the skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple months now in the shower, usually 2-3 times a week</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, with breakouts usually around my jawline and chin.</li>
            <li> my skin SUCKS.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I actually ordered the &amp;#34;Botanical Buffing Beads&amp;#34; (the blue one) but got this one instead.  However, I have thoroughly enjoyed it.  It feels good on my skin and while my skin isn&#x27;t perfectly clear, I think it has helped a lot.  I&#x27;ve been using it about 5 months now and still have some left, and I use it pretty much everyday!  I will probably order it again.</li>
            <li> My skin is oily - but I find that a good exfollation really helps keep it clear and smooth. This product does what it promises, and very well. I had probably tried almost every kind of scrub on the market and the only other product I liked was discontinued. This works very well!</li>
            <li> I started using in on my chest and shoulders. It feels great but I would not use it on my face as it was drying it too much.</li>
            <li> I have recently purchased some items from Flex Commerce in NYC.  Although my order was correct, as confirmed by the shipping documents, they shipped the wrong merchandise.  I contacted them regarding an exchange of merchandise, and they will not exchange until I return/they receive the incorrect merchandise they shipped.  They have offered to reimburse for return postage.  However, I am getting ready to travel for the holidays,and if they will not deliver my correct merchandise until they receive my return, I will not have it before I travel.  They are more concerned with their &#x27;financial loss&#x27; than they are about the customer receiving satisfaction.  We have corresponded numerous times and they are absolutely unflexible.  Not only that, they have clearly stated in our correspondence that they do not feel they should suffer any inconvenience due to their erroneous shipping merchandise.  I will not use them again.  I have ordered similar products from another vendor, Payless Beauty, Inc, and had absoutely no problems.  I will continue to use Payless Beauty for future purchases.</li>
            <li> Better than any salicylic face wash and it never leaves your face dry!</li>
            <li> Perfect, clear face nowüëç</li>
            <li> The product was horrible! The only thing I liked about it was the smell.  I tried it after using Murad&#x27;s acne body wash and I starting breaking out immediately again. This product is not for someone with moderate to severe body acne.  I just ordered more Murad products which will hopefully clear my skin up again within the next week.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is very good.  The small beads polish the skin.  It is gentle enough to use every day. This cleanser brings the soil and oil deep in your pores to the surface and exfoliates gently.</li>
            <li> This product is great!&lt;br /&gt;I use it after i was my face wash!&lt;br /&gt;Great for just making your face look flawless!</li>
            <li> This is a great, fresh smelling product that leaves your skin feeling super clean. I would definitely recommended it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I debated for a week to buy this or not. I&#x27;m really happy with it. I have fair skin and when it gets dry, I get little red bumps on the backs of my arms and on my thighs. I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple months now in the shower, usually 2-3 times a week and I love it. I also moisturize daily, which really contributes to getting rid of those bumps, but this product gave me the boost my skin needed to look much healthier.</li>
            <li> Love the grapefruit smell of this face wash. Good for oily skin. I  wouldn&#x27;t recommend for severe acne though. It is not a miracle product but a good skin maintaining product when used with moisturizer.</li>
            <li> So I dunno if it&#x27;s hormones or what the heck happened but I hit a certain age and BLAMMO my skin SUCKS. I have acne that would rival any teen boy. I have tried MULTIPLE other high end products and until I tried the Peter Thomas Roth line I was not getting relief. I like that the products have medicated and homeopathic aspects to support them. They don&#x27;t have strong odors, and don&#x27;t bleach my sheets. I will be a repeat customer - oh and a little goes a long way.....</li>
            <li> I bought this product after I notice I had engrowing hair on my legs and thighs. This occurred after getting my legs waxed never again will I get my legs waxed just shaved like before. So, I wanted to try something that would soften up my skin and force the hairs to pop out by exfoilating and moisturize my skin with something that also had acid in it. I&#x27;ve searched high and low for a good price and I came across this. Sephora prices were much higher and so I found it on Amazon. Well, it does make my skin really soft; I use this on my entire body then, I follow up with a good lotion or oil like coconut oil or Jergens lotion and it leaves my skin super soft. I would suggest using this everyday to see some major results. I will up date in a few months to let you know how my journey is going so far with this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Not harsh but great at exfoliating the skin. Absolutely worth it! I love Thomas Roth products and I&#x27;ll by buying this gem again! It HELPS my acne!</li>
            <li> This arrived really quickly!  It is a great product and works really well to clear skin and exfoliate. Plus you don&#x27;t need to use a lot to see results.</li>
            <li> Noticed blemishes from hot yoga. Have used it for 2 months now, few times a week, and noticed improvement. It also smells great. Worth a try!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used everything Clinique, Murad, ProActive, Philosophy, things for doctors, you name it I&#x27;ve tried it and the Peter Thomas Roth Acne line is the only thing that has helped keep my face clear.</li>
            <li> I really love this product - the scent is so refreshing and helps me wake up in the morning.  If you do not like citrusy smells, this is not the product for you but I love it.  The exfoliating beads are very gentle.  I use it morning and night and have not had any irritation.  It keeps my skin soft and clear.  I have dealt with cystic acne on my chin for about 20 years and this is the first product that has mostly kept the issue at bay for a long period of time.  Crossing my fingers it continues!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for almost two years! My entire skincare &amp; makeup routine consists of all natural, holistic products, EXCEPT for this product right here. This stuff keeps my clogged pores at bay and performs the right amount of exfoliation to prevent breakouts. I used to use a benzoyl peroxide face wash, but it was a bit too harsh for me. I have combination skin, with breakouts usually around my jawline and chin. Now I use this once every other day to keep my complexion even and open to absorb all the moisturizers and oils I enjoy putting on in the AM &amp; PM.</li>
            <li> A great product to buff off dead skin and leave your skin smoother than before. I use this with the PTR Beta Hydroxy Acid 2% Acne Wash 8.5 fl oz</li>
            <li> My husband has some backne due to being in the army and always sitting in sweaty and dirty clothes. I gave him this to use and his back has really improved!</li>
            <li> I love these scrubbing beads! They really do their job at clearing away the oils. They make my face look clean and polished.</li>
            <li> This face wash is awesome. It&#x27;s cleared up my forehead bumps and evened out my skin tone over all. It smells amazing too. Excellent acne product.</li>
            <li> I am a brown man and this product left my skin feeling healthy without losing my natural oils. No drying up. No patches. No weird reactions. No issues at all.</li>
            <li> This has helped my skin so much!</li>
            <li> love this!!!! Has been the only face wash to get rid of my adult cystic acne and has made my skin more even and helped with blackheads as well. It also cleared my back acne!! Wont go without this</li>
            <li> Love this wash!  Does a great job preventing future breakouts and treating current ones.  I use it daily and the results have been outstanding!  If you suffer from body breakouts, you definitely need to purchase this product!!!</li>
            <li> this product smells really great - citrus, grapefuit. also a much softer feel than a lot of exfoliants. totally recommend, especially for oily skin</li>
            <li> I use this exfoliator every other day (a facialist once told me it was not good to exfoliate every single day because it could stimulate more oil production). I absolutely love the smell and feel of it. I have not been using it long enough to see any life changing difference to my face but I certainly feel cleaner after using it.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would clear up some light back acne but it didn&#x27;t really. I still gave it 4 stars because I like the roughness of the grains. It&#x27;s so hard to find a slightly rough grainy exfoliant; most grains are too small or too smooth to do anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t clear up all the acne but I did feel exfoliated which felt refreshing. Plus the grapefruit scent is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> One of the best acne treatments I have used. It also helps control my oily skin.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. A product I can&#x27;t do without. I don&#x27;t use it on my face because I have sensitive skin but I use it on my back after working out. The scent is clean but not too strong. It would work well for a man or woman and doesn&#x27;t clash with any of my perfumes. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love the blemish buffing beads cleanser by Peter Thomas Roth. I use a small amount on my Olay spin brush and it works beautifully. A little goes a long way so it lasts me for months and months! (Probably close to 6 months.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When used nightly with PTR Max Correction Pads I rarely have a blemish. The few that sneak through (usually only if I miss a day or 2 Of product use) heal quickly and redness fades faster than it used to. I used to use benzoyl peroxide products but grew too sensitive. Salacylic acid alone just doesn&#x27;t seem to touch the problem. But this glycolic acid based pad has come to my rescue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other brands with the same active ingredient but I always come back to Peter Thomas Roth. I don&#x27;t even bother with other brands to treat my blemish-proned skin anymore. This one is the best!</li>
            <li> Read the reviews on this product and decided to give it a try.  It is just the right balance for my super oily skin and breaks through the oil without drying.  The bottle is very large, so it will last me at least 3 if not more months.  The buffing beads are amazing for everyday exfoliation and the smell is fantastic.  I used to use Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Wash, but now it just doesn&#x27;t do the job anymore.  This product also cuts through and cleans well with taking all of your make up off.  I&#x27;m looking forward to trying more PTR products in the future.</li>
            <li> Best thing ever!! In one night my breakouts were gone! And I haven&#x27;t had any since , I use it every night. I also use the glycolic wash for bright soft skin it&#x27;s wonderful I love all his products , you have to try this if you have sought or even severe acne.</li>
            <li> I opted for this blemish solution because Peter Thomas Roth discontinued their marvelously effective benzoyl peroxide scrub, which itself was a miracle worker. Unfortunately, these blemish buffing beads really fell short of my expectations and only caused more irritation to my husband&#x27;s skin. For this price, I would at least expect results commensurate with the brand&#x27;s reputation and former products--not so with this product.</li>
            <li> Great to clean out pores. Can dry out skin. Found to use just twice a week for my skin type (combination). But I do like it a lot!</li>
            <li> Its an ok product. Doesnt really help with body blemishes and dries out skin. Its better as a face wash but wont buy again.</li>
            <li> I use this as a face wash everyday, and it is the best! I first started using the product a couple years ago, when I was in high school and it totally helped fight acne. Now I use it just because I love the way it keeps my skin so fresh and soft, and it smells fantastic. Totally recommend it, worth every cent.</li>
            <li> Its works great!!!! Just wish it was cheaper if you buy in bulk. I get 3-6 an itll last me 5-9 months before rebuying</li>
            <li> All my acne cleared up in two days with this! And I had tried almost everything else! Use this at night and in the morning for great results.</li>
            <li> I bought this product 6 months ago to combat my acne on my arms, back and chest. It very powerful smell, if you are highly allergic to everything then the smell might bother you, other than that the smell remind me of other citrus based acne products. The grains of the products are really big and very abrusive, so if you are use to smaller less abrusive exfoliators then this is not the product for you. It doesnt latter very well like my (benefit bionic blast, which was discontinued by the company! tear!) but you do feel it when it hits the skin, it tingles with a soft heat, which I dont mind, but it last long after the showering or bathing is over( which can be annoying when you applying lotion, thinking you have tiny bee stings all over your body) It takes about month to  notice your acne start to go away! So would I buy this product again yes, because this is about as good as it gets for acne products for the body!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel great, smells good, and gets job done.  I liked it, but wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot. I use it on my face and body.  It is not too rough and doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;ve exfoliated my face off like some products do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this about a month now, after being recommended it by a skin therapist. During my actual facial, all the products used were effective. But at home, I still haven&#x27;t seen any real effects yet. I&#x27;m still optimistic but I am well aware that sometimes things look better in the store.</li>
            <li> Love it.  The buffing beads make your face tingle.  I have sensitive skin prone to breakouts and this really works well for me.</li>
            <li> Made my skin feel very clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> It is great for my skin!  I absolutely love it!  It cleaned out my skin and made my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> This product is a little expensive but you only need a tiny amount to do the job. It will last a long time and has a nice foam to it.</li>
