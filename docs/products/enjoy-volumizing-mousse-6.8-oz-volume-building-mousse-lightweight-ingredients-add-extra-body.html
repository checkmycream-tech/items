            <li>this volumizing mousse is awesome!</li>
            <li>This is still the perfect mousse for me!</li>

            <li>Excellent product and service</li>
            <li>Great product!  </li>
            <li>Best mousse I have used.  </li>
            <li>It is probably the best  volumizing product I have found for my challenging hair!</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for treated and colored hair.</li>
            <li>Great buy too.</li>
            <li>I ordered 2 &amp; will be getting more!!</li>
            <li>The perfect mousse for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>Does a good job on my hair - keeps the style in shape without any issues.  </li>
            <li>It does a good job holding curl or styling.  </li>
            <li>Good scent</li>
            <li>The price is much better than what I would pay at a salon even with the shipping!</li>
            <li>but you do need heat for this to be effective.  </li>
            <li>Did is absolutely the best mousse product I have ever found.  </li>
            <li>Nice smell.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for something that would give my hair something new to think about and maybe make it realize that I do have it&#x27;s best interests in mind.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good pricking and quick shipping as always with amazon.</li>
            <li>Great mousse, very good quality mousse, washes off really easily and doesn&#x27;t have too much shine, highly recommended for longer hair.</li>
            <li>My hairstylist turned me on to this product and I love it.  </li>
            <li>So to say I love it is an understatement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really works great.</li>
            <li>I use this product all the time and the price was much better than the beauty supply shops.</li>
            <li>in addition, the mousse is more like foam</li>
            <li>but then no one product is, but for me, it works as promised and I am very much enjoying the end result.</li>
            <li>Glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Love this mousse.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it faithfully for a couple of years or more per a stylists recommendation.  </li>
            <li>I blow dry with a diffuser and this method seems to work perfectly.  </li>
            <li>One of the better products I&#x27;ve used for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>You can enjoy ENJOY!</li>
            <li>My hair actually perked right up as if saying, hey, I feel great today and think I&#x27;ll strut my stuff!  </li>
            <li>If you have fine hair, it will give you the volume you desire that also holds throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair that is wavy/frizzy, and I straighten it.</li>
            <li>I have tried others but keep returning to Enjoy.</li>
            <li>A light spray holds the style.  </li>
            <li>I still haven&#x27;t finished my original bottle, but saw this and decided to &amp;#34;stock up.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>and then blow it out using a cool hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>This helps my fine, straight, colored hair respond to styling after shampoo as well as the days I don&#x27;t shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I really like the Enjoy products.  </li>
            <li>My hair is soft to the touch (so many mousses leave your hair sticky feeling)</li>
            <li>This product may not be right for everyone</li>
            <li>I have short and perfectly straight fine hair, I apply every so lightly the Enjoy Voluminous Mousse comb my hair into place, take a rat-tail comb and lift in certain areas of my hair that I want a little more height (like the top).</li>
            <li>As I get older my hair isn&#x27;t as full as it used to be.  </li>
            <li>It gives just enough body and hold to be able to push and prod my hair into a presentable style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Unlike my experience with many other mousse styling products Enjoy really does what it claims.  </li>
            <li>Amazons price is much cheaper than the salon price.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like the product when it works.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m back to buy another Enjoy Volumizing Mousse.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t need much</li>
            <li>Really like the &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I have to ever so often change an old tried and true hair product for a new one because I think my hair gets to thinking I take it for granted</li>
            <li>Not super sticky like most others.  </li>
            <li>I can still comb and brush my hair and more importantly it completely washes out when I shampoo, which I have not found with other volumizing products.</li>
            <li>Very lightweight;  doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine, blond hair.  </li>
            <li>I have baby fine thin hair and this ENJOY mousse just isn&#x27;t for me.  </li>
            <li>I local hair stylist recommended this product to me, but sold it at a MUCH higher price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Enjoy mousse has performed well for me in that I have new body and new shine for my baby fine limp hair although as I age, it&#x27;s beginning to want to curl.  </li>
            <li>&gt; A few pumps is all it takes so this bottle will last a good long time.  </li>
            <li>Not heavy on the hair, but does the trick.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I think I received an old bottle.</li>
            <li>Had to use another product during a recent trip and really noticed the difference in quality.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way in my hair, giving it more body.</li>
            <li>I apply it to the roots of my damp freshly washed hair (be careful on how much you use...too much does not better make!)</li>
            <li>I have very straight and slinky hair and this product does not weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t attest to its effectiveness if you let your hair air dry because that particular method never works for me.</li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t attest to its effectiveness if you let your hair air dry because that particular method never works for me.</li>
            <li> I used this prior to blowing dry with a big round brush - I do think it added volume, but I didn&#x27;t like using my flat iron afterwards because my hair really wouldn&#x27;t straighten.</li>
            <li> The scent was very soapy and chemical-smelling, and the product made my hair hard like gel.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and was hopeful this would be a lightweight medium to create volume, instead a small amount made my hair dull, sticky and heavy.</li>
            <li> Works and goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I wonder if it would work well on thick, coarse hair since it&#x27;s not a thick formula.  </li>
            <li> Brush it out after it is dry</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed because while the formula is light and doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down, by the end of the day, you can clearly see flakes.</li>
            <li> A little of this product goes a long way so don&#x27;t be thrown by the price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I can say that other reviewers didn&#x27;t say,</li>
            <li> while I finish getting dresses, have breakfast or what other morning routines I have.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry-out hair like some other products that have alcohol.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products and I might as well have used nothing.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t weigh down hair</li>
            <li> This product is a lightweight foam that does not weigh down your hair.  </li>
            <li> I was to lazy to return it, but nothing would come out except liquid, not like the other ones I have bought.  </li>
            <li> if you have curly hair that you don&#x27;t mind being a little crunchy, this might work to keep you from being frizzy.</li>
            <li> It adds volume without making my hair stiff or sticky.</li>
            <li> It plumbs hair without making it stiff.  </li>
            <li> I always use this mousse &amp; not many salons in my area carry it.</li>
            <li> I have very limp hair and can&#x27;t do without it.  </li>
            <li> Makes hair feel thick and shiny.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money on this one though!!</li>
            <li> My hair is thin and it seems to keep my hair easier to manage.</li>
            <li> So this definitely volumizes as promised, but it FLAKES badly!!</li>
            <li> This stuff left a horrible film in my hair.  </li>
            <li> No hair spay, no more bad hair days!</li>
            <li> It provides lift without crazy stickiness.</li>
            <li> hate</li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this product!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My hairstylist turned me on to this product and I love it.  Amazons price is much cheaper than the salon price.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Fiance, and she reports that she is very happy with this product. The price beat prices at local stores, so it is a win/win.</li>
            <li> I really like the Enjoy products.  This mousse is great!  Not heavy on the hair, but does the trick.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> A little of this product goes a long way so don&#x27;t be thrown by the price. Works great. Cheaper than what I can but it for at the salon.</li>
            <li> So this definitely volumizes as promised, but it FLAKES badly!! I was extremely disappointed because while the formula is light and doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down, by the end of the day, you can clearly see flakes. I did not have flakes before and once I stopped using this they went away, so I can definitely attribute it to this product…I guess the search continues.  A friend of mine recommended Phyto Phytovolume Actif Volumizer Spray. I&#x27;m going to give that one a try next…hate I wasted my money on this one though!!</li>
            <li> I was to lazy to return it, but nothing would come out except liquid, not like the other ones I have bought.  So will not order again.  I really like the product when it works.</li>
            <li> I have been using this mousse in conjunction with the Texturizing Cr&amp;egrave;me for quite some time and consider it a Holy Grail item.  Unlike my experience with many other mousse styling products Enjoy really does what it claims.  It volumizes as well as holds my curl.  I blow dry with a diffuser and this method seems to work perfectly.  I can&#x27;t attest to its effectiveness if you let your hair air dry because that particular method never works for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I can say that other reviewers didn&#x27;t say, this volumizing mousse is awesome! I have short and perfectly straight fine hair, I apply every so lightly the Enjoy Voluminous Mousse comb my hair into place, take a rat-tail comb and lift in certain areas of my hair that I want a little more height (like the top). Air drying my hair is the next step while I finish getting dresses, have breakfast or what other morning routines I have. Brush it out after it is dry and it looks like I used a curling Iron to lift my hair. No hair spay, no more bad hair days! My hair is soft to the touch (so many mousses leave your hair sticky feeling) I can&#x27;t tell by feel I&#x27;ve put anything on my hair. So to say I love it is an understatement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;April 10, 2017:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m back to buy another Enjoy Volumizing Mousse. This is still the perfect mousse for me! I have tried others but keep returning to Enjoy. It adds volume without making my hair stiff or sticky. I can still comb and brush my hair and more importantly it completely washes out when I shampoo, which I have not found with other volumizing products. I also find this product doesn&#x27;t take a lot to work: of course my hair is short and even with using it all the time I only buy one container every 9 months. Remember to shake, shake, shake before using. Good pricking and quick shipping as always with amazon.</li>
            <li> This was a repeat purchase!  I notice a big difference when I don&#x27;t use it only at roots,crown - you don&#x27;t need much but you do need heat for this to be effective.  Unless they change the formula, I&#x27;m sticking with this product! It provides lift without crazy stickiness.</li>
            <li> Great mousse, very good quality mousse, washes off really easily and doesn&#x27;t have too much shine, highly recommended for longer hair.</li>
            <li> This product is an upgrade from the moroccon oil product I used for years.  This helps my fine, straight, colored hair respond to styling after shampoo as well as the days I don&#x27;t shampoo.  Really works great.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> One of the better products I&#x27;ve used for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> I use this product all the time and the price was much better than the beauty supply shops.</li>
            <li> Very lightweight;  doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine, blond hair.  It doesn&#x27;t even feel like there&#x27;s product in my hair after.  But it definitely provides lift and volume.  I wonder if it would work well on thick, coarse hair since it&#x27;s not a thick formula.  But it&#x27;s perfect for someone with finer hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff left a horrible film in my hair.  Did not give me volume at all.  I have baby fine thin hair and this ENJOY mousse just isn&#x27;t for me.  Yuck.</li>
            <li> Did is absolutely the best mousse product I have ever found.  If you have fine hair, it will give you the volume you desire that also holds throughout the day.  You can enjoy ENJOY!</li>
            <li> Does a good job on my hair - keeps the style in shape without any issues.  I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> The perfect mousse for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> This is not a sticky mousse.  It&#x27;s a foam pump.  The product has a good/pleasing smell.  It doesn&#x27;t dry-out hair like some other products that have alcohol.  It plumbs hair without making it stiff.  It does a good job holding curl or styling.  A light spray holds the style.  I would recommend the product.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and was hopeful this would be a lightweight medium to create volume, instead a small amount made my hair dull, sticky and heavy. Good scent but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> You can definitely feel it in your hair but it does the job.</li>
            <li> did not work so well for me. if you have curly hair that you don&#x27;t mind being a little crunchy, this might work to keep you from being frizzy. I have fine hair that is wavy/frizzy, and I straighten it. I used this prior to blowing dry with a big round brush - I do think it added volume, but I didn&#x27;t like using my flat iron afterwards because my hair really wouldn&#x27;t straighten. in addition, the mousse is more like foam and it felt drying. won&#x27;t repurchase. I prefer Sebastian whipped cream or texturizing gel.</li>
            <li> I have to ever so often change an old tried and true hair product for a new one because I think my hair gets to thinking I take it for granted and then like a wayward teenager, has to cut up a bit.  This is what brought me to this product.  I was looking for something that would give my hair something new to think about and maybe make it realize that I do have it&#x27;s best interests in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy mousse has performed well for me in that I have new body and new shine for my baby fine limp hair although as I age, it&#x27;s beginning to want to curl.  Told you it was acting up!  I apply it to the roots of my damp freshly washed hair (be careful on how much you use...too much does not better make!) and then blow it out using a cool hair dryer.  My hair actually perked right up as if saying, hey, I feel great today and think I&#x27;ll strut my stuff!  It gives just enough body and hold to be able to push and prod my hair into a presentable style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A few pumps is all it takes so this bottle will last a good long time.  I do appreciate the fact that it&#x27;s not an aerosol and is a manual pump bottle creating a foam as it&#x27;s pumped.  This product may not be right for everyone but then no one product is, but for me, it works as promised and I am very much enjoying the end result.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t weigh down hair</li>
            <li> I always use this mousse &amp; not many salons in my area carry it. Glad I found it on Amazon. The price is much better than what I would pay at a salon even with the shipping! I ordered 2 &amp; will be getting more!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product for treated and colored hair. My hair is thin and it seems to keep my hair easier to manage.</li>
            <li> Love this mousse.  I have very straight and slinky hair and this product does not weigh my hair down.  A little goes a long way in my hair, giving it more body.</li>
            <li> As I get older my hair isn&#x27;t as full as it used to be.  This product makes my hair look fuller and healthier!  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and service</li>
            <li> Terrible. I think I received an old bottle. The scent was very soapy and chemical-smelling, and the product made my hair hard like gel. The product didn&#x27;t foam at all, and I got no volume whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I local hair stylist recommended this product to me, but sold it at a MUCH higher price. I know where I&#x27;ll get it from now on! Works and goes a long way. I still haven&#x27;t finished my original bottle, but saw this and decided to &amp;#34;stock up.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Great product!  Not super sticky like most others.  Nice smell.  Will be buying again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it faithfully for a couple of years or more per a stylists recommendation.  I like it a lot.  It gives my hair a lot of body without weight or stiffness.  I have very limp hair and can&#x27;t do without it.  I&#x27;ve tried other products and I might as well have used nothing.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product; too sticky for me.</li>
            <li> Best mousse I have used.  Lots of volume, zero sticky buildup.  Had to use another product during a recent trip and really noticed the difference in quality.</li>
            <li> This product is a lightweight foam that does not weigh down your hair.  It is probably the best  volumizing product I have found for my challenging hair!</li>
            <li> Really like the &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34;.  Makes hair feel thick and shiny. Great buy too. Will buy again when I run out.</li>
