            <li>I did my first tattoo on my bf and the machine was awesome.</li>
            <li>it came out nice</li>
            <li>Guns are ok, ink not so good</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and awesome for beginners, Will but again</li>
            <li>say if you want to start practicing to become a tattoo artist, this kit fits you perfectly because it gives you what you need to start for a great low price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;s giving it a good use</li>
            <li>I kind of considered the holidays.</li>
            <li>Decent selection of needles, not the best ink</li>
            <li>then that great buy for the price worth every penny.</li>
            <li>very pleased redid my tattoo right after i got it good buy .</li>
            <li>The guns are really nice and seem to be working very well!!!!  </li>
            <li>wait to be a pro for sure</li>
            <li>it would be better</li>
            <li>This was what we purchased for my son&#x27;s first tattoo kit and it was absolutely perfect for a first timer.</li>
            <li>How to video could be better but it was helpful.</li>
            <li>Outstanding quantity, quality and price.</li>
            <li>It got me the money to buy better equipment and develop needed skills.</li>
            <li>This has everything you need to start tattooing, but you will need to order more transfer stencils sheet.</li>
            <li>It has a cd  showing methods, but you can learn more by going to YouTube.</li>
            <li>and they sell on most web sites for around 6 or7 dollars ,not including shipping,then you got them liners shaders machines and all kinds of suplies</li>
            <li>I got this kit for a friend that wanted to get into tattooing and for the money she is very impressed with the entire kit except for the skins.  </li>
            <li>The kit seems ok.</li>
            <li>This kit is okay for beginners</li>
            <li>Foot pedal is a lil cheap, so Im ordering a more durable one, but overall a great kit for the price!!!!</li>
            <li>This kit arrived quickly, with a nice case holding all the contents.</li>
            <li>so far the guns work great.</li>
            <li>Use the ink that comes with for the practice skins but buy some good stuff for real tattoos.</li>
            <li>Despite the flaws with this kit, I am still satisfied as I read previous reviews and wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be perfect.</li>
            <li>power supply works fine, as well as the pedal.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>But do not use the inks on a person there only good for practice, when ready to start doing real skin order some star bright or moms or another good brand.</li>
            <li>Super value!</li>
            <li>I didnt recieve a metal tip to fit my 9 liner needles</li>
            <li>They even offered me free items etc.</li>
            <li>I FOR GOT TO SAY ABOUT THE FREE SHIPPING THAT ANOTHER 30.00 SAVED,</li>
            <li>I FOR GOT TO SAY ABOUT THE FREE SHIPPING THAT ANOTHER 30.00 SAVED,</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, items great except for the power supply box which makes the whole thing WORK does not WORK.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have any reference with other machines, but I can say everything showed up very fast and works great!</li>
            <li>Order was processed and arrived on time.&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the product was not professional grade, rather it was a great quality beginner set.</li>
            <li>for the price that was paid I can easily say it was worth the money.the guns</li>
            <li>no instructions on how to set up, use the guns, or clean up after...</li>
            <li>: The customer service is AMAZING and ABOVE and BEYOND most others.</li>
            <li>they are machines ask any experienced tattoo artist and they will tell you the same thing they are not shooting ink into your skin they are not guns that are shooting bullets they are machines for doing artwork underneath the skin get it right or do not tattoo</li>
            <li>; works great found it to be as advertised:  Highly recommend this to anyone looking for high value and economical price</li>
            <li>You will need to buy more ink soon, the bottles are small, but for the price, this is great.</li>
            <li>The stainless steel ones don&#x27;t fit at all!</li>
            <li>Good for a starter kit if you have done proper research on tattooing and tattoo machine equipment.</li>
            <li>ink is only good for practicing not for skin.</li>
            <li>Not bad for a beginner set.</li>
            <li>,the guns works great~!~ made one for liner and one for shader, and save other two for back up, love it...</li>
            <li>no biggy,they are mainly for looks in my collection,and I love the craving grips you get with them,but with this kit you get the brass grips to match then</li>
            <li>Bought as a gift for my brother-in-law who, though young, is very gifted and he absolutely loves this outfit.</li>
            <li>Overall pretty good deal.</li>
            <li>p.s the box has nice strong plastic rubber to hold you stuff tight ,not like the cheap boxes with the flimsy foam rubber in them.thanks ordertattoo.com and amazon P.S</li>
            <li>would have liked a little more stencil paper n pen</li>
            <li>Guns are great, well ive only tried 1 so far.</li>
            <li>was well worth the money.</li>
            <li>it showen on the web but not all was worth watiin for</li>
            <li>Not five stars due to the lack of a good video or book or both.</li>
            <li>kit came right on time.</li>
            <li>everything was right.</li>
            <li>One thing I didn&#x27;t like about this kit being a beginner is that there should be a little more practice skins in it, maybe more than 2 pair of gloves that didn&#x27;t fit, the iron sakura ink it came in was OK for practice skin, there are no directions on anything,  the 2 skull machines are pretty heavy after 30 to 45 minutes, there&#x27;s more to it</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve seen better, its not really detailed and its a crappy blurry quality, but I guess its ok...</li>
            <li>I finally got my kit, and like I said ,it was going to be a good deal for the money, love them skull  machines, I switched out the springs and a - bar on all them and tuned them and the skull are a little loud and the little cheap ones would be good backup machines, and the skulls surprised me with a metal thumb screw and a skull top</li>
            <li>And will mess up a tattoo, no matter how good of an artist.</li>
            <li>The equipment in it is very high quality!</li>
            <li>It was a gift and the other person loved it sooo much...</li>
            <li>2x jus wish there a different look for 2x etc buyers :)</li>
            <li>I received it exactly on the estimated date.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>Make sure to order transfer papers and extra needles!</li>
            <li>Of course, if you have to watch a video, you should not order it in the first place!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I was really pissed because now I have to wait for a whole new one , but other then that the kit is great and came pretty fast</li>
            <li>The video was not good at all but the rest of the stuff is great to start learning.</li>
            <li>I think for the money ,this is the nices kit,i every seen,its got useble ink,the ink in the kit is mid grade ink,and I love and collect skull tattoo machines,and I happen not to have these two in my collection, they are fair machines in price and quality, but if you tune them and do a little spring and a-bar changing ,you got a good machine ,just a little heavy, but the ones I&#x27;ve bought work great out of the box with a little tuning or changing out front springs</li>
            <li>inks are kind of crappy, I personally recommend you to buy different inks with higher quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Inks are very watery</li>
            <li>My son really likes it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know, I was watching it</li>
            <li>the tattooing equipment works very well</li>
            <li>what really annoys me is people buying a tattoo machine kit and calling them guns they are not guns</li>
            <li>So, the usable items were really great!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is very portable.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for everything.</li>
            <li>Power supply works when it wants to.</li>
            <li>THANKS AGAIN</li>
            <li>My package came with everything and fast</li>
            <li>But the other too are really nice, not heavy at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>a back up power supply or full time power box  </li>
            <li>Decent product for the price.</li>
            <li>Not that vibrant.</li>
            <li>Quality of the guns are decent.</li>
            <li>me.it had nice hard nipples ,so they don&#x27;t give when lining, with a little help from pliers.this is all I have to say this is a good quality kit for beginners or for back up and supplies for pros.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The needles are nicely protected in a smaller box and wrapped separately and sterilized.&lt;br /&gt;Speaking about the other things included, they&#x27;re just fine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was an okay product, but I found myself a little disheartened by the ink.</li>
            <li>so i recommend u buy new ink before using.</li>
            <li>If you are brand new to Tattoos.</li>
            <li>it not work like new stuff</li>
            <li>The ones with the skulls are heavy tho, I don&#x27;t plan on using them too much because they don&#x27;t allow me to move as freely as my hand would want to.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The grips are nice too, I thought they would be heavy or hard to handle, but they are just fine.</li>
            <li>so i had to clean everything before using it other</li>
            <li>What you do get is a great deal - Four guns, ready to use and of studry build, a reasonable array of ink colors, ink cups, a number of needles in various sizes, a \\&quot;how-to\\&quot; guide on disc, fake skin to practice on right on down to rubber bands and latex gloves.</li>
            <li>These tattoo machines definitely lay down ink, all my friends show there tatts off everyday, these machines are pretty heavy duty and nice already layed down more than 24 hrs of ink and still work like new thanks ordertattoo!</li>
            <li>B004ZBT43Y Professional Tattoo Kit 4</li>
            <li>SO just THREE STARS IS WHAT I SAY THIS ONE NAEMED PROFESSIONAL KIT SHOULD BE named&lt;br</li>
            <li>it has everything u need and more only thing I had trouble with was the power supply , it jus stop working out of no</li>
            <li>I ordered the other items I listed above along with this kit, and have 8 new tatt&#x27;s already and still have a fair amount of supplies - they even thought to double the black ink for outlining and B&amp;W work.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I have a few Tattoos myself and understand a bit about the process.</li>
            <li>Great machines and supplies, only problems are that the ink it comes with sucks, and the &amp;#34;stencil magic&amp;#34; came broken and spilled allover</li>
            <li>two dragon guns are really pretty, but way too heavy.</li>
            <li>people look all this stuff up, shipping and handling,you and see how much you save on supplies,the boxes are around 25.00 plus s and handling,that almost half of what the kit cost, I know</li>
            <li>Its not great science but a little help would be nice.</li>

            <li> The kit seems ok.</li>
            <li> This kit is okay for beginners</li>
            <li> Foot pedal is a lil cheap, so Im ordering a more durable one, but overall a great kit for the price!!!!</li>
            <li> This kit arrived quickly, with a nice case holding all the contents.</li>
            <li> so far the guns work great.</li>
            <li> Use the ink that comes with for the practice skins but buy some good stuff for real tattoos.</li>
            <li> Despite the flaws with this kit, I am still satisfied as I read previous reviews and wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be perfect.</li>
            <li> power supply works fine, as well as the pedal.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> But do not use the inks on a person there only good for practice, when ready to start doing real skin order some star bright or moms or another good brand.</li>
            <li> Super value!</li>
            <li> I didnt recieve a metal tip to fit my 9 liner needles</li>
            <li> They even offered me free items etc.</li>
            <li> I FOR GOT TO SAY ABOUT THE FREE SHIPPING THAT ANOTHER 30.00 SAVED,</li>
            <li> I FOR GOT TO SAY ABOUT THE FREE SHIPPING THAT ANOTHER 30.00 SAVED,</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, items great except for the power supply box which makes the whole thing WORK does not WORK.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have any reference with other machines, but I can say everything showed up very fast and works great!</li>
            <li> Order was processed and arrived on time.&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the product was not professional grade, rather it was a great quality beginner set.</li>
            <li> for the price that was paid I can easily say it was worth the money.the guns</li>
            <li> no instructions on how to set up, use the guns, or clean up after...</li>
            <li> : The customer service is AMAZING and ABOVE and BEYOND most others.</li>
            <li> they are machines ask any experienced tattoo artist and they will tell you the same thing they are not shooting ink into your skin they are not guns that are shooting bullets they are machines for doing artwork underneath the skin get it right or do not tattoo</li>
            <li> ; works great found it to be as advertised:  Highly recommend this to anyone looking for high value and economical price</li>
            <li> You will need to buy more ink soon, the bottles are small, but for the price, this is great.</li>
            <li> The stainless steel ones don&#x27;t fit at all!</li>
            <li> Good for a starter kit if you have done proper research on tattooing and tattoo machine equipment.</li>
            <li> ink is only good for practicing not for skin.</li>
            <li> Not bad for a beginner set.</li>
            <li> ,the guns works great~!~ made one for liner and one for shader, and save other two for back up, love it...</li>
            <li> no biggy,they are mainly for looks in my collection,and I love the craving grips you get with them,but with this kit you get the brass grips to match then</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my brother-in-law who, though young, is very gifted and he absolutely loves this outfit.</li>
            <li> Overall pretty good deal.</li>
            <li> p.s the box has nice strong plastic rubber to hold you stuff tight ,not like the cheap boxes with the flimsy foam rubber in them.thanks ordertattoo.com and amazon P.S</li>
            <li> would have liked a little more stencil paper n pen</li>
            <li> Guns are great, well ive only tried 1 so far.</li>
            <li> was well worth the money.</li>
            <li> it showen on the web but not all was worth watiin for</li>
            <li> Not five stars due to the lack of a good video or book or both.</li>
            <li> kit came right on time.</li>
            <li> everything was right.</li>
            <li> One thing I didn&#x27;t like about this kit being a beginner is that there should be a little more practice skins in it, maybe more than 2 pair of gloves that didn&#x27;t fit, the iron sakura ink it came in was OK for practice skin, there are no directions on anything,  the 2 skull machines are pretty heavy after 30 to 45 minutes, there&#x27;s more to it</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve seen better, its not really detailed and its a crappy blurry quality, but I guess its ok...</li>
            <li> I finally got my kit, and like I said ,it was going to be a good deal for the money, love them skull  machines, I switched out the springs and a - bar on all them and tuned them and the skull are a little loud and the little cheap ones would be good backup machines, and the skulls surprised me with a metal thumb screw and a skull top</li>
            <li> And will mess up a tattoo, no matter how good of an artist.</li>
            <li> The equipment in it is very high quality!</li>
            <li> It was a gift and the other person loved it sooo much...</li>
            <li> 2x jus wish there a different look for 2x etc buyers :)</li>
            <li> I received it exactly on the estimated date.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> Make sure to order transfer papers and extra needles!</li>
            <li> Of course, if you have to watch a video, you should not order it in the first place!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I was really pissed because now I have to wait for a whole new one , but other then that the kit is great and came pretty fast</li>
            <li> The video was not good at all but the rest of the stuff is great to start learning.</li>
            <li> I think for the money ,this is the nices kit,i every seen,its got useble ink,the ink in the kit is mid grade ink,and I love and collect skull tattoo machines,and I happen not to have these two in my collection, they are fair machines in price and quality, but if you tune them and do a little spring and a-bar changing ,you got a good machine ,just a little heavy, but the ones I&#x27;ve bought work great out of the box with a little tuning or changing out front springs</li>
            <li> inks are kind of crappy, I personally recommend you to buy different inks with higher quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Inks are very watery</li>
            <li> My son really likes it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know, I was watching it</li>
            <li> the tattooing equipment works very well</li>
            <li> what really annoys me is people buying a tattoo machine kit and calling them guns they are not guns</li>
            <li> So, the usable items were really great!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is very portable.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for everything.</li>
            <li> Power supply works when it wants to.</li>
            <li> THANKS AGAIN</li>
            <li> My package came with everything and fast</li>
            <li> But the other too are really nice, not heavy at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> a back up power supply or full time power box  </li>
            <li> Decent product for the price.</li>
            <li> Not that vibrant.</li>
            <li> Quality of the guns are decent.</li>
            <li> me.it had nice hard nipples ,so they don&#x27;t give when lining, with a little help from pliers.this is all I have to say this is a good quality kit for beginners or for back up and supplies for pros.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The needles are nicely protected in a smaller box and wrapped separately and sterilized.&lt;br /&gt;Speaking about the other things included, they&#x27;re just fine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was an okay product, but I found myself a little disheartened by the ink.</li>
            <li> so i recommend u buy new ink before using.</li>
            <li> If you are brand new to Tattoos.</li>
            <li> it not work like new stuff</li>
            <li> The ones with the skulls are heavy tho, I don&#x27;t plan on using them too much because they don&#x27;t allow me to move as freely as my hand would want to.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The grips are nice too, I thought they would be heavy or hard to handle, but they are just fine.</li>
            <li> so i had to clean everything before using it other</li>
            <li> What you do get is a great deal - Four guns, ready to use and of studry build, a reasonable array of ink colors, ink cups, a number of needles in various sizes, a \\&quot;how-to\\&quot; guide on disc, fake skin to practice on right on down to rubber bands and latex gloves.</li>
            <li> These tattoo machines definitely lay down ink, all my friends show there tatts off everyday, these machines are pretty heavy duty and nice already layed down more than 24 hrs of ink and still work like new thanks ordertattoo!</li>
            <li> B004ZBT43Y Professional Tattoo Kit 4</li>
            <li> SO just THREE STARS IS WHAT I SAY THIS ONE NAEMED PROFESSIONAL KIT SHOULD BE named&lt;br</li>
            <li> it has everything u need and more only thing I had trouble with was the power supply , it jus stop working out of no</li>
            <li> I ordered the other items I listed above along with this kit, and have 8 new tatt&#x27;s already and still have a fair amount of supplies - they even thought to double the black ink for outlining and B&amp;W work.</li>
            <li> Luckily, I have a few Tattoos myself and understand a bit about the process.</li>
            <li> Great machines and supplies, only problems are that the ink it comes with sucks, and the &amp;#34;stencil magic&amp;#34; came broken and spilled allover</li>
            <li> two dragon guns are really pretty, but way too heavy.</li>
            <li> people look all this stuff up, shipping and handling,you and see how much you save on supplies,the boxes are around 25.00 plus s and handling,that almost half of what the kit cost, I know</li>
            <li> Its not great science but a little help would be nice.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s pretty common.</li>
            <li> The tips don&#x27;t fit in any of the machines properly which was very frustrating.</li>
            <li> but it is a starter kit not professional.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve been tattooing three yrs ,everyday almost ,and the kit s quality surprised</li>
            <li> Includes a piece of practice paper that is supposed to be similar in consistency to skin; not exactly but for practicing, was helpful.</li>
            <li> Machine Guns Power Supply Disposable Needles Inks (Double Black) G4]]</li>
            <li> I would also order different needles as they look a little misshapen.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s everything you need to start off, but a few things you may want to grab are other needle sizes &amp; types, a book of \\&quot;Flash\\&quot; artwork to use, and order an extra pack of transfer paper.</li>
            <li> guns and power pack was fine but really bad</li>
            <li> Overall,  I got my hopes high and waited so long to be disappointed and couldn&#x27;t use my kit when I got it.</li>
            <li> My only gripe is the ridiculous VCD that comes with it...</li>
            <li> This one didn&#x27;t actually come in a hard case it came in a bag i had to go out and purchase a box that would keep everything organized and the machines didn&#x27;t match the ones in the pictures they were plain black.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only done 6 small tattoos so far and the power supply already died, it&#x27;s a complete piece of crap, will never purchase from this seller again</li>
            <li> but the ink is a little wack.</li>
            <li> The kit arrived on time and everything was there as expected!!!  </li>
            <li> not too heavy.</li>
            <li> i have bought a few of these kits</li>
            <li> There was a few needles with bent tips in the box</li>
            <li> The cd included was choppy .</li>
            <li> and the frames are pretty sick.</li>
            <li> the guns where but the main source very unhappy with it.</li>
            <li> but if you are serious about tattooing</li>
            <li> I noticed the carrying case was not great quality, its made of cardboard on the inside</li>
            <li> but the case is poorly made and upon getting this the inside of the case was coming apart and looked to be cut up in places.</li>
            <li> also the dvd doent pertain to what comes in this and is also poorly made.</li>
            <li> , the dvd was actually broken, had a spider web crack around the edging.</li>
            <li> There is a poorly made video and no instructions at all.</li>
            <li> The practice skins are totally useless as they are too rubbery.</li>
            <li> She said they are useless but from what I hear</li>
            <li> Ever since i bought this ive been gettin weird charges on my credit card</li>
            <li> It was disappointing because any beginner would need them to know how to get the machine together and</li>
            <li> crazy rick</li>
            <li> but I got screw when the power supply staring not working ,my customers where mad cause</li>
            <li> The cores to the coils are glued on, which causes the magnetic connections to be weak and cause horrible tattoos.</li>

            <li> It was an okay product, but I found myself a little disheartened by the ink.</li>
            <li> for the price that was paid I can easily say it was worth the money.the guns a very well made and surprisingly heavy.</li>

            <li> Everything was good... got what it said... would have liked a little more stencil paper n pen</li>
            <li> one machine non working case all messed up</li>
            <li> Good stuff I like what I got its very good no problems yet but letts see&lt;br /&gt;Cant wait to be a pro for sure one day its gonna happem</li>
            <li> Not bad for a beginner set. My son loves it. I have a machine that cost 5xs what this set is and he prefers his over mine. Well c after a 40hrs of ink how they hold up.</li>
            <li> This one didn&#x27;t actually come in a hard case it came in a bag i had to go out and purchase a box that would keep everything organized and the machines didn&#x27;t match the ones in the pictures they were plain black. I don&#x27;t think i will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> 4 machines, case, needles, barrels etc very good kit for anyone, i bought 2x jus wish there a different look for 2x etc buyers :)</li>
            <li> This is an excellent buy ! The case came loaded with items. It even had a how to video and practice skins. It is good quality as well. Very happy customer :)</li>

            <li> Guns are ok, ink not so good</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Excellent packing. Everything included as stated. Guns are great, well ive only tried 1 so far. I didnt recieve a metal tip to fit my 9 liner needles so i had to use the plastic ones. Foot pedal is a lil cheap, so Im ordering a more durable one, but overall a great kit for the price!!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this to surprise my boyfriend,  he loves it. He can&#x27;t do using it the machines are great and everything works verywell. Fast shipping and awesome for beginners, Will but again</li>
            <li> Great Product - good value; works great found it to be as advertised:  Highly recommend this to anyone looking for high value and economical price</li>
            <li> kit came right on time. everything was right. only thing is the ink is kinda crappy but it is a starter kit not professional. I did my first tattoo on my bf and the machine was awesome. not too heavy. don&#x27;t like the practice skin cuz I can tell im tattin rubber. but all in all im very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This kit arrived quickly, with a nice case holding all the contents. It&#x27;s everything you need to start off, but a few things you may want to grab are other needle sizes &amp; types, a book of \\&quot;Flash\\&quot; artwork to use, and order an extra pack of transfer paper.

            <li> Decent product for the price. Inks are very watery so I ordered different ones. The tips don&#x27;t fit in any of the machines properly which was very frustrating. The stainless steel ones don&#x27;t fit at all! No directions came with this kit. I would also order different needles as they look a little misshapen.

Despite the flaws with this kit, I am still satisfied as I read previous reviews and wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be perfect.</li>
            <li> This was what we purchased for my son&#x27;s first tattoo kit and it was absolutely perfect for a first timer.</li>
            <li> The video was not good at all but the rest of the stuff is great to start learning.</li>
            <li> guns and power pack was fine but really bad ink got infection in leg and almost lost it .would not buy!!!!!junk junk!!</li>
            <li> Great starter kit! Use the ink that comes with for the practice skins but buy some good stuff for real tattoos. My only gripe is the ridiculous VCD that comes with it...no instructions on how to set up, use the guns, or clean up after...it&#x27;s literally just a video of a guy giving a tattoo...no instructions at all! Thank God for youtube, just do a search on there if you don&#x27;t know how to set the guns up</li>
            <li> This is a very nice kit. Bought it for my teenage son for Christmas. How to video could be better but it was helpful. Includes a piece of practice paper that is supposed to be similar in consistency to skin; not exactly but for practicing, was helpful. My son really likes it.</li>
            <li> The only thing in this kit that is usable is the ink cups, rubber bands, nipples, and needles. The machines are Chinese.. And will mess up a tattoo, no matter how good of an artist. Power supplies and foot switch hasn&#x27;t quit on me yet. I&#x27;ve used this machine for about 2 weeks on four tattoos, and the machines are junk. The cores to the coils are glued on, which causes the magnetic connections to be weak and cause horrible tattoos. The inks are alright. Not that vibrant. I would recommend this to a youngster for practice only!</li>
            <li> These tattoo machines definitely lay down ink, all my friends show there tatts off everyday, these machines are pretty heavy duty and nice already layed down more than 24 hrs of ink and still work like new thanks ordertattoo!</li>
            <li> Got this for my nephew and he loves it.</li>
            <li> the tattoo kit is good in quality and worked perfect</li>
            <li> great, comes with everything in picture. was well worth the money.</li>
            <li> i have bought a few of these kits no and have beeen happy every time</li>
            <li> I received it exactly on the estimated date.&lt;br /&gt;When I opened it I noticed the carrying case was not great quality, its made of cardboard on the inside but they tried to make it look as real as possible, I don&#x27;t really mind it because I wont use it anyway, but its perfect to protect and store your tools.&lt;br /&gt;Speaking about the tattoo machines, they are just perfect. The ones with the skulls are heavy tho, I don&#x27;t plan on using them too much because they don&#x27;t allow me to move as freely as my hand would want to. But the other too are really nice, not heavy at all.&lt;br /&gt;The grips are nice too, I thought they would be heavy or hard to handle, but they are just fine. The machines are good quality machines.&lt;br /&gt;The power supply works fine, as well as the pedal.&lt;br /&gt;The inks are kind of crappy, I personally recommend you to buy different inks with higher quality.&lt;br /&gt;The needles are nicely protected in a smaller box and wrapped separately and sterilized.&lt;br /&gt;Speaking about the other things included, they&#x27;re just fine.&lt;br /&gt;NO INSTRUCTIONS THO!! It was disappointing because any beginner would need them to know how to get the machine together and all of that. Its not great science but a little help would be nice. you can go and watch instructional videos on youtube tho....&lt;br /&gt;And the instructional video... I don&#x27;t really know, I was watching it but I&#x27;ve seen better, its not really detailed and its a crappy blurry quality, but I guess its ok...&lt;br /&gt;I say if you want to start practicing to become a tattoo artist, this kit fits you perfectly because it gives you what you need to start for a great low price.</li>
            <li> One thing I didn&#x27;t like about this kit being a beginner is that there should be a little more practice skins in it, maybe more than 2 pair of gloves that didn&#x27;t fit, the iron sakura ink it came in was OK for practice skin, there are no directions on anything,  the 2 skull machines are pretty heavy after 30 to 45 minutes, there&#x27;s more to it but you get the idea.</li>
            <li> It a great kit for the price but there are no directions and nothing is labeled. . . . .</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my brother-in-law who, though young, is very gifted and he absolutely loves this outfit. Outstanding quantity, quality and price.</li>
            <li> Used the kit a couple times already. Came with everything we needed to get started.</li>
            <li> The kit arrived on time and everything was there as expected!!!  The guns are really nice and seem to be working very well!!!!  You will have to buy good inks!!!  There was a few needles with bent tips in the box and I can not use so just trashed them!!! That&#x27;s the only reason I gave 4 stars!!!  If they send me a pack of needles I will rate again!!!</li>
            <li> guys can any one pls tell me what is the liner and what is the shader.....what can i say in this item is so good for me i just don&#x27;t know how to use it ,but this one is grate ^_^</li>
            <li> happy,, very happy with the tat kit,works real good,c/d was helpful to me, someone that never done a tat with a gun b4.finally finish tat,the guns works great~!~ made one for liner and one for shader, and save other two for back up, love it...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only done 6 small tattoos so far and the power supply already died, it&#x27;s a complete piece of crap, will never purchase from this seller again</li>
            <li> This is a great starter kit for anyone that has inspirations in being a tattoo artist. Make sure to order transfer papers and extra needles!</li>
            <li> This kit comes with everything advertised and everything came 100% functional. Great machines and supplies, only problems are that the ink it comes with sucks, and the &amp;#34;stencil magic&amp;#34; came broken and spilled allover so i had to clean everything before using it other then that great buy for the price worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I love the kit, the guns and power supply work great. But do not use the inks on a person there only good for practice, when ready to start doing real skin order some star bright or moms or another good brand.</li>
            <li> the tattooing equipment works very well but the case is poorly made and upon getting this the inside of the case was coming apart and looked to be cut up in places. also the dvd doent pertain to what comes in this and is also poorly made. so far the guns work great. Also I cannot get the transfer oil to work AT ALL&gt;</li>
            <li> Good price for the quality, perfect thing to get me started. It got me the money to buy better equipment and develop needed skills. I didnt use the ink and i wouldnt recommend  it.</li>
            <li> served the purpose i needed it for</li>
            <li> learned to tattoo on the machine. transfer paper is&#x27;nt the best.</li>
            <li> what really annoys me is people buying a tattoo machine kit and calling them guns they are not guns they are machines ask any experienced tattoo artist and they will tell you the same thing they are not shooting ink into your skin they are not guns that are shooting bullets they are machines for doing artwork underneath the skin get it right or do not tattoo</li>
            <li> This kit comes with everything you need to start tattooing! The equipment in it is very high quality! And the customer service I revived was great!</li>
            <li> Most of the kit was great. The instructional video that came with it could only be used in a computer, not a dvd player. Of course, if you have to watch a video, you should not order it in the first place!&lt;br /&gt;The two dragon guns are really pretty, but way too heavy. So, the usable items were really great!&lt;br /&gt;I would say it has a lot of bang for the buck.</li>
            <li> this is a very good kit to get. it comes with 4 machines for practice/spare parts. and the frames are pretty sick. but the ink is a little wack. so i recommend u buy new ink before using. but all in all a good kit</li>
            <li> This has everything you need to start tattooing, but you will need to order more transfer stencils sheet. It has a cd  showing methods, but you can learn more by going to YouTube. It is very portable. It has no instructions in it what so ever, so you need to know how things work. I figured it out, but YouTube again shows everything.  You will need to buy more ink soon, the bottles are small, but for the price, this is great.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B004ZBT43Y Professional Tattoo Kit 4 Machine Guns Power Supply Disposable Needles Inks (Double Black) G4]] Fast delivery, items great except for the power supply box which makes the whole thing WORK does not WORK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: The customer service is AMAZING and ABOVE and BEYOND most others. Thank you so much for everything. They even offered me free items etc. Which I cannot accept. Will do business with them in the future.</li>
            <li> great kit comes with all needes ink is only good for practicing not for skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a beginner so I don&#x27;t have any reference with other machines, but I can say everything showed up very fast and works great! There is a ton of stuff to get started and I think  for the money this kit is a winner.</li>
            <li> Order was processed and arrived on time.&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the product was not professional grade, rather it was a great quality beginner set. Power supply works when it wants to. Decent selection of needles, not the best ink but I have a tattoo with it, and will get another. Quality of the guns are decent. Overall pretty good deal.</li>
            <li> EHHH! ITS OK NOT THAT GREAT. BUT YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THAT ITS FOR AMATEURS SO YEAH KEEP THAT IN MIND.</li>
            <li> all around good machine, all the guns work, everything came packaged well, except for the dvd, the dvd was actually broken, had a spider web crack around the edging.</li>
            <li> I think for the money ,this is the nices kit,i every seen,its got useble ink,the ink in the kit is mid grade ink,and I love and collect skull tattoo machines,and I happen not to have these two in my collection, they are fair machines in price and quality, but if you tune them and do a little spring and a-bar changing ,you got a good machine ,just a little heavy, but the ones I&#x27;ve bought work great out of the box with a little tuning or changing out front springs no biggy,they are mainly for looks in my collection,and I love the craving grips you get with them,but with this kit you get the brass grips to match then and they sell on most web sites for around 6 or7 dollars ,not including shipping,then you got them liners shaders machines and all kinds of suplies a back up power supply or full time power box  I got a power supply like this one and its on the money and works better than some of them expensive ones. people look all this stuff up, shipping and handling,you and see how much you save on supplies,the boxes are around 25.00 plus s and handling,that almost half of what the kit cost, I know I shop the internet every day.this is a good buy and a its no doult about it. I finally got my kit, and like I said ,it was going to be a good deal for the money, love them skull  machines, I switched out the springs and a - bar on all them and tuned them and the skull are a little loud and the little cheap ones would be good backup machines, and the skulls surprised me with a metal thumb screw and a skull top cap.hell I didn&#x27;t even get metal thumb scwews with my top of the line machines ,I was impressed, I&#x27;ve been tattooing three yrs ,everyday almost ,and the kit s quality surprised me.it had nice hard nipples ,so they don&#x27;t give when lining, with a little help from pliers.this is all I have to say this is a good quality kit for beginners or for back up and supplies for pros. lol crazy rick p.s the box has nice strong plastic rubber to hold you stuff tight ,not like the cheap boxes with the flimsy foam rubber in them.thanks ordertattoo.com and amazon P.S I FOR GOT TO SAY ABOUT THE FREE SHIPPING THAT ANOTHER 30.00 SAVED,BECAUSE ALL THE KITS ONLINE DON&#x27;T HAVE THAT OFFER,THANKS AGAIN AMAZON.p boxes with the flimsy foam rubber in them.thanks ordertattoo.com and amazon P.S I FOR GOT TO SAY ABOUT THE FREE SHIPPING THAT ANOTHER 30.00 SAVED,BECAUSE ALL THE KITS ONLINE DON&#x27;T HAVE THAT OFFER,THANKS AGAIN AMAZON.</li>
            <li> great starter kit had everything I needed to start my hobby had no issues with this kit at all</li>
            <li> Just got my kit everything was great. The transfer oil however no just get something else. Great starter kit though.</li>
            <li> I got this kit for a friend that wanted to get into tattooing and for the money she is very impressed with the entire kit except for the skins.  She said they are useless but from what I hear that&#x27;s pretty common.</li>
            <li> The kit is awesome it has everything u need and more only thing I had trouble with was the power supply , it jus stop working out of no were I was really pissed because now I have to wait for a whole new one , but other then that the kit is great and came pretty fast</li>
            <li> The kit came as described..everything except instructions on how to put guns together and load.  The DVD that came with it would not play on our DVD player or computor.  Just FYI ..tried different programs to open CD..looked up the company that was listed and called and phone was disconnected.  I brought this with Prime Amazon so not a problem with returning..but it was a disapointment for a christmas present.</li>
            <li> My wife got this kit for me for Christmas. There is a poorly made video and no instructions at all. Luckily, I have a few Tattoos myself and understand a bit about the process. If you are brand new to Tattoos. BUY A BOOK, READ THE BOOK, along with the kit, or before you purchase this kit.&lt;br /&gt;  I have had no quality issues or power supply problems. The kit seems ok. Not five stars due to the lack of a good video or book or both.</li>
            <li> it was a gift and they loved it so im happy with what i happily helped my cus with! perfect</li>
            <li> a gift for my brother,he is more than happy</li>
            <li> this was a good by for me&lt;br /&gt;as it showen on the web but not all was worth watiin for&lt;br /&gt;i like all the stuff like the 4 machine guns even the logo&lt;br /&gt;not like the way i dont use it not cus i do not know how but the&lt;br /&gt;power supply is not working for me&lt;br /&gt;i plug in all the stuff an nothen nope nothen y do it not work like new stuff do  on christmas hu.!_- SO just THREE STARS IS WHAT I SAY THIS ONE NAEMED PROFESSIONAL KIT SHOULD BE named&lt;br /&gt;NOTSOPROTHOW U C /BUT YOU SEE]</li>
            <li> The guns work great but the box worked one time then it broke.. I had to buy another one!! This kit is okay for beginners but if you are serious about tattooing I suggest getting something else.</li>
            <li> Ever since i bought this ive been gettin weird charges on my credit card</li>
            <li> I didnt have a clue what the guns and kit was gonna be like but im very pleased redid my tattoo right after i got it good buy .</li>
            <li> The satisfaction is beyond expectation. It was a gift and the other person loved it sooo much... I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;s giving it a good use</li>
            <li> I received my product two days after the estimated delivery time. I kind of considered the holidays. But then I opened my product and everything was included as listed, but the tips were not labeled. My power supply did not work.  I had to some how rig it and it still didn&#x27;t work correctly. The cd included was choppy . Overall,  I got my hopes high and waited so long to be disappointed and couldn&#x27;t use my kit when I got it.</li>
            <li> My package came with everything and fast but I got screw when the power supply staring not working ,my customers where mad cause I star the tatto and dint finish .now I got a returned and wait but the guns where but the main source very unhappy with it.</li>
            <li> The DVD is not giving good instruction on how to use the gun</li>
