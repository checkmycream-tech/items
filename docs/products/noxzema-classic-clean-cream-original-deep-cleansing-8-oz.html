            <li>I love this formula-</li>
            <li>my boyfriend hates that it doesn&#x27;t lather, but that is one of the things I like most about it.</li>
            <li>This is more convenient for travel and in the shower - just pump some and go.  </li>
            <li>I ordered 2 for me and 2 more for a friend, who could not find it ether.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser.</li>

            <li>but looking for a better deal.  </li>
            <li>I love this cleansing cream for cleanse at night.</li>
            <li>So glad I found it again.</li>
            <li>The pump dispenser is most helpful, too.</li>
            <li>This is a good modern alternative if you want a creamy cleanser in a hygenic pump!</li>
            <li>I am glad the original is in a pump.  </li>
            <li>I always return to Noxema because I LOVE the clean minty feeling it leaves on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Love this product and the tingly clean feeling I get after each use.</li>
            <li>but fortunately I can still get it at Amazon.  </li>
            <li>and I was happy to send back and pay for it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only too happy to find it at Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Noxema in a pump dispenser is very convenient and you still get the same excellent product.  </li>
            <li>the way, the product I originally ordered is fabulous and</li>
            <li>Love Noxema, local stores don&#x27;t carry it anymore around here or are out, love love noxema been using it for moisturizing my face forever.....</li>
            <li>I like the clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>Great face soap and so much easier to dispense than the old fashion tub.</li>
            <li>I have exclusively used Noxema since I was 16 and look a good 20 years younger than I am.  </li>
            <li>My Mom used it for years from the cobalt blue glass jar...and it still works as good today.</li>
            <li>The scent is the same - refreshing menthol!  </li>
            <li>I love how it makes my skin feel clean and not dry at all.  </li>
            <li>I love that its Old Skool too.  </li>
            <li>Always leaves my face feeling clean, soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It arrived on time and the price was right.</li>
            <li>Noxzema is a great product and for some reason very hard to find in stores.&lt;br /&gt;It is not the cheapest price wise, but it does last a while.  </li>
            <li>I really do like this but only gave it four stars since I like the original in the jar better.  </li>
            <li>, very soothing menthol, it leaves your skin feeling very clean and soft!</li>
            <li>And you still get the same Noxema clean smell and easy wash-off.</li>
            <li>was shipped fast and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>wouldn&#x27;t work on the first bottle I opened.  </li>
            <li>I have used Noxzema over the years but this was only ok.</li>
            <li>Great formula for my skin at least.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This was the second time in many years that I have had to return a product.</li>
            <li>The first time was my fault</li>
            <li>Eucalyptus Oil is sometimes used as a stimulant and antiseptic.&amp;#34;)  </li>
            <li>Glad we finally found this product sold in a dispenser.</li>
            <li>Smells good, cleans well, doesn&#x27;t dry my sensitive skin out.</li>
            <li>I ordered 3 Noxzema Original product and AmericaRX sent me 5 Old Spice somethings.</li>
            <li>Feels good and helps to wake me up a little!</li>
            <li>I really like this product for washing my face.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find this for a while and so much easier for in the shower.  </li>
            <li>One knit-pick is that I can never use the pump to get the whole product out of the bottle, which has irritated me for years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never broken out from a product before but as soon as I used this that changed.</li>
            <li>People tell me I have a nice complexion, but I only use this and a basic moisturizing cream.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s &amp;#34;medicated,&amp;#34; and it might be the eucalyptus that really makes my face feel clean, but not dry.  </li>
            <li>Noxzema is the answer for soft, clear, clean skin.</li>
            <li>but as I got older switched to this cream version.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to all ages.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>They clean the same - leaving my skin soft and takes off all my makeup.  </li>
            <li>I use this to wash my face, and sometimes as a body wash for an extra tingly fresh feeling.</li>
            <li>It is just a part of my face washing routine, but a very vital part.</li>
            <li>Been using this since my young teenage years (I&#x27;m in my early 50&#x27;s &amp; a male), and my face doesn&#x27;t has any winkles &amp; is smooth.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, I still had my previous bottle, and just swoped them out.</li>
            <li>Bottom line is that as I have gotten older I can not use regular soap on my face and I need something that is going to clean but not leave my face dry</li>
            <li>I have been using it forever, since my early 20&#x27;s, started with the jar, then the pump dispenser for this product came out.</li>
            <li>An old reliable product that can be depended upon to do what you expect of it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Rather than spending too much time on this, I simply shipped back to these people and decided never to deal with them again.</li>
            <li>I used to love this stuff when I was younger, not sure why it took me so long to re discover it</li>
            <li>I am in my late 60&#x27;s and have used this to clean my face since I was in my 20&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>It does not dry my skin out</li>
            <li>leaves you face moisturized, not dry like washing with soap can.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I only used this on my forehead chin and around my nose because if I had used it all over I would have broken out all over.</li>
            <li>It is a non nonsense cleaner for everyday use....and not expensive</li>

            <li> I am 62 years old and have far less wrinkles than alot of other people I know who are same age or even younger.  </li>
            <li> I like the pump nozzle because early in the morning I don&#x27;t want to have to mess around with a jar</li>
            <li> Stop searching for expensive acne treatments, instead try Noxzema and enjoy the creaminess and trademark scent.</li>
            <li> Same quality of the other Noxzema.</li>
            <li> I would purchase this again because it cleans so well and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin -</li>
            <li> Guaranteed to dry up blemishes without overdrying the surrounding skin...</li>
            <li> Not much else to say, not very greasy at all yet still provides some moisturizing.</li>
            <li> THE PRODUCT IS AS EXPECTED</li>
            <li> Noone believes how old I am or that I&#x27;ve never had any serious acne problems...</li>
            <li> I believe it is due to this product.  </li>
            <li> Its a feeling that can&#x27;t be replaced with any other cleanser I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li> There is also a slight tingle on my face when I use it.  </li>
            <li> For Noxema fans, this is easier to dispense than the tub sized, which sometimes get stiff and hard before you get to the last dab.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m just use to the jar version - super thick cold cream consistency.  </li>
            <li> This purchase was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have been using Noxzema products (or generics when times are tougher that usual) for over 40 years.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m lazy</li>
            <li> , it is hard to find anymore.  </li>
            <li> I have used Noxema for at least 35 years exclusively</li>
            <li> complained to Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> When I was young I had acne on my neck and face that made it difficult to shave without cutting myself.</li>
            <li> This does have ingredients that some might find irritating so check the ingredients before buying.</li>
            <li> The eucalyptus in it helps repel mosquitoes and gnats but is not perfect for the job.</li>
            <li> and they told me that I needed to take a picture to prove to them that they had sent the wrong product.</li>
            <li> It smelled awful - could not use.</li>
            <li> I bought this after seeing all the rave reviews about this brand and my experience was awful.</li>
            <li> it was awful and it didn&#x27;t cleanse or moisturize at all.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The product must have been expired. It smelled awful - could not use. This purchase was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Would have given 5 stars except the pump wouldn&#x27;t work on the first bottle I opened.  Fortunately, I still had my previous bottle, and just swoped them out.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE THIS STUFF.  I have been using it forever, since my early 20&#x27;s, started with the jar, then the pump dispenser for this product came out. I am 62 years old and have far less wrinkles than alot of other people I know who are same age or even younger.  I believe it is due to this product.  I love the pump however, it is hard to find anymore.  My local drugstore stopped carrying it but fortunately I can still get it at Amazon.  I highly recommend this product to all ages.</li>
            <li> I have used Noxzema over the years but this was only ok. It cleaned my skin but didn&#x27;t seem to help improve my skin overall.  It did not help my breakouts.  I ended up switching to a different cleanser.  I would recommend you try it yourself as it may work for you.</li>
            <li> For Noxema fans, this is easier to dispense than the tub sized, which sometimes get stiff and hard before you get to the last dab. And you still get the same Noxema clean smell and easy wash-off.</li>
            <li> I have used Noxzema for decades - started as a teenager and I&#x27;m 53 now.  Used to be the jar version but as I got older switched to this cream version.  I love how it makes my skin feel clean and not dry at all.  Works well as a body wash, too.  This does have ingredients that some might find irritating so check the ingredients before buying.</li>
            <li> I like the pump.  I like the clean feeling.  Refreshing.</li>
            <li> My local store had run out of this and I ordered it online.  I really like this product for washing my face.  It does not dry my skin out and I grew up using Noxzema so I love the smell.  I understand it may not be for everyone, but I like it.  There is also a slight tingle on my face when I use it.  Bottom line is that as I have gotten older I can not use regular soap on my face and I need something that is going to clean but not leave my face dry and this does the trick well for me.</li>
            <li> I have used Noxema for at least 35 years exclusively and I either just have good skin or this product works...Noone believes how old I am or that I&#x27;ve never had any serious acne problems...I just chalk it up to good hygiene and the noxema.</li>
            <li> I used to love this stuff when I was younger, not sure why it took me so long to re discover it, very soothing menthol, it leaves your skin feeling very clean and soft!</li>
            <li> I love this formula- my boyfriend hates that it doesn&#x27;t lather, but that is one of the things I like most about it. Smells good, cleans well, doesn&#x27;t dry my sensitive skin out. Good price, can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> I really do like this but only gave it four stars since I like the original in the jar better.  They clean the same - leaving my skin soft and takes off all my makeup.  The scent is the same - refreshing menthol!  This is more convenient for travel and in the shower - just pump some and go.  It has a thinner consistency than the jar version - so it doesn&#x27;t seem to have the same cooling effect (e.g. like for a sunburn).  I would purchase this again because it cleans so well and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin - but I&#x27;m just use to the jar version - super thick cold cream consistency.  This is a good modern alternative if you want a creamy cleanser in a hygenic pump!</li>
            <li> Noxzema is a great product and for some reason very hard to find in stores.&lt;br /&gt;It is not the cheapest price wise, but it does last a while.  It is good to stock up&lt;br /&gt;on I ordered 2 for me and 2 more for a friend, who could not find it ether.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves you face moisturized, not dry like washing with soap can. It is&lt;br /&gt;very easy to use and just pumps out !</li>
            <li> Nice sized bottle, it lasts me more than a month on this.</li>
            <li> I have been using Noxzema products (or generics when times are tougher that usual) for over 40 years.  Great formula for my skin at least.</li>
            <li> I am glad the original is in a pump.  I couldn&#x27;t find this for a while and so much easier for in the shower.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I am always bouncing around with face cleansers.  I always return to Noxema because I LOVE the clean minty feeling it leaves on my skin.  Its a feeling that can&#x27;t be replaced with any other cleanser I&#x27;ve found.  I love that its Old Skool too.  NEVER change the formula Noxema!</li>
            <li> Have used for 55 years. Like the pump instead of sticking fingers in jar.</li>
            <li> Great face soap and so much easier to dispense than the old fashion tub. Love this product and the tingly clean feeling I get after each use.</li>
            <li> Noxema in a pump dispenser is very convenient and you still get the same excellent product.  I have exclusively used Noxema since I was 16 and look a good 20 years younger than I am.  The eucalyptus in it helps repel mosquitoes and gnats but is not perfect for the job.</li>
            <li> I have been using Noxzema Cleansing Cream for over 60 years to shave with. When I was young I had acne on my neck and face that made it difficult to shave without cutting myself. I had a Barber recommend that I use Noxzema as a shave cream. Everything cleared up on my skin and I have been using it ever since.</li>
            <li> I ordered 3 Noxzema Original product and AmericaRX sent me 5 Old Spice somethings. I went to return it and they told me that I needed to take a picture to prove to them that they had sent the wrong product. They told me that they would not send UPS to pick it up and that I needed to go to the post office and mail it back to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I complained to Amazon.com. This was the second time in many years that I have had to return a product. The first time was my fault and I was happy to send back and pay for it. Amazon arranged for the UPS pick up. They said that they would have this done this time.........but it didn&#x27;t happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather than spending too much time on this, I simply shipped back to these people and decided never to deal with them again. I had 3 phone conversations with them. They are scripted and have no room to be reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caveat Emptor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, the product I originally ordered is fabulous and I&#x27;ve used it for shaving each day for 10 years. My comment here has only to do with the vendor......AmericaRX</li>
            <li> Have been using Noxema since 1972. Love it! Always leaves my face feeling clean, soft and smooth. It&#x27;s a must have for me.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser. It arrived on time and the price was right.</li>
            <li> This was recommended for acne prevention but caused me to break out.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> love it too......but looking for a better deal.  Only paid 3.97 last time I ordered this product</li>
            <li> I am in my late 60&#x27;s and have used this to clean my face since I was in my 20&#x27;s.  People tell me I have a nice complexion, but I only use this and a basic moisturizing cream.  I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else and just hope they never stop making  it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product insyead of soap since highschool. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Been using this since my young teenage years (I&#x27;m in my early 50&#x27;s &amp; a male), and my face doesn&#x27;t has any winkles &amp; is smooth.  Yes I know the gene pool has some effect on this.  Not much else to say, not very greasy at all yet still provides some moisturizing.</li>
            <li> My grandmother used it, my Mom used it, and I keep coming back to this product, as a cleanser and/or as a moisturizer.  I&#x27;m only too happy to find it at Amazon.  It&#x27;s &amp;#34;medicated,&amp;#34; and it might be the eucalyptus that really makes my face feel clean, but not dry.  (&amp;#34;Its oil has a pleasant aroma and cooling properties.  Eucalyptus Oil is sometimes used as a stimulant and antiseptic.&amp;#34;)  Seems excellent for my complexion.  One knit-pick is that I can never use the pump to get the whole product out of the bottle, which has irritated me for years.  Nevertheless, I recommend that you try it.</li>
            <li> Very good, not too oily and smell good.. I love this cleansing cream for cleanse at night. I will definitevely recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> I used Noxzema as a teenager for breakouts, and 40 years later, still, skin is breakout prone. Noxzema is the answer for soft, clear, clean skin. Stop searching for expensive acne treatments, instead try Noxzema and enjoy the creaminess and trademark scent. Guaranteed to dry up blemishes without overdrying the surrounding skin...</li>
            <li> I have used it for years, and now my son uses it too. It is just a part of my face washing routine, but a very vital part.</li>
            <li> And oldie but a goodie! I had forgotten how much I loved this stuff. So glad I found it again.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Same quality of the other Noxzema.</li>
            <li> THE PRODUCT IS AS EXPECTED</li>
            <li> This stuff works great for cleaning the days dirt off your face. My Mom used it for years from the cobalt blue glass jar...and it still works as good today. It is a non nonsense cleaner for everyday use....and not expensive always helps the pocketbook!</li>
            <li> Love Noxema, local stores don&#x27;t carry it anymore around here or are out, love love noxema been using it for moisturizing my face forever.....great price, great shipping, great product</li>
            <li> Everyone in the family likes this product. We have used it for years. We cannot find it any place in our area anymore. It is a staple in our house.&lt;br /&gt;It was shipped fast and arrived quickly. We love this product!</li>
            <li> An old reliable product that can be depended upon to do what you expect of it. I wish the same could be said of all products.</li>
            <li> I like Noxzema a lot and my sisters and my mom have used it for years. I like the pump nozzle because early in the morning I don&#x27;t want to have to mess around with a jar (I&#x27;m lazy I guess!) Feels good and helps to wake me up a little!</li>
            <li> Glad we finally found this product sold in a dispenser.</li>
            <li> I bought this after seeing all the rave reviews about this brand and my experience was awful. I&#x27;ve never broken out from a product before but as soon as I used this that changed. I&#x27;m glad I only used this on my forehead chin and around my nose because if I had used it all over I would have broken out all over. Everywhere I put this stuff broke out in acne it was awful and it didn&#x27;t cleanse or moisturize at all. I do not recommend this to anybody.</li>
            <li> I use this to wash my face, and sometimes as a body wash for an extra tingly fresh feeling. Try it...!</li>
            <li> This cream is great for removing makeup, just don&#x27;t get it into your eyes!  The pump dispenser is most helpful, too.</li>
