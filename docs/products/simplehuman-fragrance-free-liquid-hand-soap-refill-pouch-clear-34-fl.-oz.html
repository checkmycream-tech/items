            <li>Great smelling and works very well.  </li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>so this gets five stars more for the dispenser</li>
            <li>So grand to find a liquid hand soap with NO fragrance.</li>
            <li>Love this soap for the pump</li>
            <li>Probably to-die-for for those who really love lavender, but for us it&#x27;s almost eye-watering in its pungency.  </li>
            <li>The bags hold up better in shipping than the jugs I used to order from a competitor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it in BB&amp;B and haven&#x27;t been able to find it since.</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance free liquid hand soap from Simplehuman.  </li>
            <li>We love the product being fragrance free also.</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s fragrance free.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to fill with the spout.</li>
            <li>Washes off easily, but cleans well.</li>
            <li>My batch was way too watery, and the unexpected lack of viscosity caused me to spill a good amount all over the counter top.</li>
            <li>(we had just one bag of that one as it came with the pump) as it was equally as insanely strong smelling.  </li>
            <li>One reviewer indicated that it is not fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>I like the fragrance free for everyone</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and lathers</li>
            <li>Would recommend for ever day use, not for people who work with their hands, they may do best with heavy duty hand cleaners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Their soap works best in their dispenser, unless you want to go to all the trouble of thinning another vendor&#x27;s soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it says it is fragrance free and still has a bit of an odor which I do not care for.  </li>
            <li>right, and nothing more.</li>
            <li>Worked perfectly in the Simple Human dispensers, smells great, and most importantly it doesn&#x27;t dry out your hands.</li>
            <li>smells clean and does not leave your hands feeling like build up is on them.</li>
            <li>Now everybody has clean hands.  </li>
            <li>antibacterial version is really nice; it&#x27;s quite neutral smelling and it does not contain triclosan, which is used in many antibacterial soaps and is currently under investigation by the FDA and Health Canada, so that&#x27;s a bonus.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It rinses clean and doesn&#x27;t leave a perfumy smell.</li>
            <li>I will say the screw cap is nice and this make no mess when you fill the dispenser.</li>
            <li>Love the Simple Human hand soap dispenser and so happy they offer a fragrance-free refill for those of us who suffer from breathing issues.</li>
            <li>The package is designed very well and makes it so easy to refill the dispenser.</li>
            <li>This is fragrance free and lathers very well.</li>
            <li>A great fragrance free alternative for the Simple Human auto hand soap dispenser.</li>
            <li>For what it&#x27;s worth, I store the package on its side, and no leaking has occurred.    </li>
            <li>Works perfectly for me, no fragrance (cannot buy without fragrance locally), just regular, do not like antibacterial - regular soap is much better for killing germs and bacteria.</li>
            <li>Their scented varieties are nice, but I&#x27;m generally not a fan of any scented hand soap.  </li>
            <li>This liquid soap works great in our Simple Human soap dispenser.  </li>
            <li>neither of us are sensitive to strong aromas.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as strongly scented as the lavender version (more on that later), but just very unpleasant in that &#x27;sickly sweet and floral&#x27; way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two stars because it dispenses perfectly from the simplehuman pump for which it was made, and the soap works well to clean your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While I haven&#x27;t noticed a scent, it is possible that one or more of the contents has a scent.    </li>
            <li>Love the soap and the touchless dispenser especially in the kitchen</li>
            <li>but I feel like this is a better value and seems to last longer.</li>
            <li>Finally a fragrance free liquid soap for dispensers !</li>
            <li>Hands feel clean after washing but not dried out.</li>
            <li>Thus I was delighted to find that Simple Human made a fragrance-free liquid soap.  </li>
            <li>So an interesting thing has happened: the next package of this soap had a much lighter scent.  </li>
            <li>it was completely different in how strong it was.  </li>
            <li>soap is gentle on the skin and has no lingering smell.  </li>
            <li>It is not fragrance free, it has a hint of European 4711 cologne.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much of it to wash your hands.</li>
            <li>but it is reasonably priced even when there is no sale.â€‹</li>
            <li>Also, there seems to be a problem in the production process which result in VERY overly scented bags, and there is no quality control to catch these mistakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>: We actually purchased this because the trial soap which came with the pump (lavender scent) has a very strong smell not only to me, but also my hubby, and</li>
            <li>Fragrance, on the other hand, is made up of a plethora of chemicals, many of which can effect a severe sensitivity after sufficient exposure.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps the fragrance is added to each bag as it goes down the production line, and therefore there is more opportunity for things to go wrong?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The scent was very light, but it is definitely the same scent, so their claim that it is unscented is clearly a falsehood.  </li>
            <li>Love getting this as an add on product as I used to order direct from Simple Human and shipping</li>
            <li>Unfortunately the price has doubled and there are better options out there -- like Dove fragrance free bars</li>
            <li>I use it as a refill in all kinds of containers, it works just fine as a foaming soap, and you use less, too.</li>
            <li>Scent is the natural smell of a product -- lemons smell like lemons, but contain no fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Your hands smell of it for a long time after washing up, and that just wasn&#x27;t what he was looking for.  ;)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased several bags to find my favorite scent, some a few times again because they were on sale.</li>
            <li>This stuff is just plain horrid; it smells like &#x27;White Shoulders&#x27; perfume, a favorite of the elderly lady crowd.  </li>
            <li>This particular scent, seems to be mostly water instead of actually being soap - or at least, the batch I just purchsed.</li>
            <li>for quality, not scientifically proven, but washed dirty hands, put them under the black light kinda of machine to test for how clean they were, passed, just fine.</li>
            <li>We finally finished the first bag, so I opened up the next package and poured it into the dispenser-</li>
            <li>it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems obvious that there was a production error which dumped a large quantity of the fragrance into the batch, and I now wonder if the same occurred in the lavender scent we tied as well</li>
            <li>Unable to find it in any retail store, it is no longer sold, so very grateful to be able to buy it here.  </li>
            <li>The price is much higher then other products on the market.</li>
            <li>Fragrance free soap is hard to find.  </li>
            <li>Some times the refilll is perfect, other times it seems too thick or thin.</li>
            <li>We purchased a 3-pack from Amazon (as the seller as well, not third party), and as I wrote in the original review, it was incredibly strong and unpleasant.  </li>
            <li>Also it is too expensive and leaves my hands kind of dry.</li>
            <li>Very hard to find fragrance free hand soap.</li>

            <li> Fragrance free soap is hard to find.  </li>
            <li> Some times the refilll is perfect, other times it seems too thick or thin.</li>
            <li> We purchased a 3-pack from Amazon (as the seller as well, not third party), and as I wrote in the original review, it was incredibly strong and unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> Also it is too expensive and leaves my hands kind of dry.</li>
            <li> Very hard to find fragrance free hand soap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice consistency too, similar to Softsoap but a little less thick.  </li>
            <li> I would say 20 times less strong seriously.  </li>
            <li> They make me sick, and I am grateful to be able to get this terrific product from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Very little dripping occurs, so the cap is not messy when you finish.  </li>
            <li> I had expected the liquid to react one way, but it acted in another.</li>
            <li> I like the &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; packaging and the soap works as expected.</li>
            <li> I like to sometimes add a few drops of essential oil to this soap -- especially bergamot or lemon, which gives it the added benefits of essential oil (antibacterial, disinfectant) and a whiff of delicate scent that does not linger.</li>
            <li> I have not tried it with any other brand of soap dispenser.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a little disappointed the Container Store stopped selling this variety, but I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, the rating is staying unchanged due to the fact that they state that it is unscented, and yet this is clearly not true.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand waste or heavily perfumed products</li>
            <li> I started to refill my automatic dispenser and ended up making a mess!</li>
            <li> SO much better than the awful, heavily perfumed liquid hand soaps you find everywhere.</li>
            <li> The soap cleans well, in relatively small amounts.  </li>
            <li> I usually stock up when ever it is on sale</li>
            <li> Its soap, does the job not sure what else to say?</li>
            <li> Does not foam excessively.  </li>
            <li> I wash my hands often enough that I&#x27;d get bored or annoyed by the smells</li>
            <li> Note, it is less expensive in the 6-pack.</li>
            <li> To use, you screw off the lid, and poor the viscous liquid soap into the pump.  </li>
            <li> I received the dispenser as a freebie and now I am addicted to the product.</li>
            <li> she got the wrong product, or there is a confusion between scent and fragrance.  </li>

            <li> I am severely allergic to many fragrances.  Thus I was delighted to find that Simple Human made a fragrance-free liquid soap.  Because of this, I purchased a Simple Human sensor pump, and this soap refill.  (I gave away the Lavender fragranced liquid soap that came with the pump.)    The soap cleans well, in relatively small amounts.  It works perfectly with the sensor pump (as of 2 months).    To use, you screw off the lid, and poor the viscous liquid soap into the pump.  Very little dripping occurs, so the cap is not messy when you finish.  For what it&#x27;s worth, I store the package on its side, and no leaking has occurred.    I will purchase more as needed.    &gt;2014-06: year later, still using it with no allergic affects.    &gt;2014-11: One reviewer indicated that it is not fragrance free.  Either he/she got the wrong product, or there is a confusion between scent and fragrance.  Scent is the natural smell of a product -- lemons smell like lemons, but contain no fragrance.  Fragrance, on the other hand, is made up of a plethora of chemicals, many of which can effect a severe sensitivity after sufficient exposure.  This soap contains no fragrances, as evidenced to me by my continued use.  (If it contained fragrances, my throat and lungs would definitely be severely affected.)  While I haven&#x27;t noticed a scent, it is possible that one or more of the contents has a scent.    2015-01: I now use this both in my Simple Human automatic dispenser (kitchen), a Simple Human pump dispenser (guest bath), and a third party foaming dispenser.  I cannot use any product with fragrances.  Note, it is less expensive in the 6-pack.</li>
            <li> this soap is simply amazing. smells clean and does not leave your hands feeling like build up is on them.</li>
            <li> Great smelling and works very well.  I use this in our guest bathroom and everyone loves it.  I like the fragrance free for everyone</li>
            <li> good product but needed to,use pliers to unscrew cap -- which broke it</li>
            <li> Love the product. Would like coupons for this product. The price is much higher then other products on the market.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give them three stars because the soap does the job of cleaning my hands without leaving a filmy residue like some soaps. I took off two stars because some of the SimpleHuman soaps labled for my SimpleHuman automatic soap dispenser have left things to be desired. I&#x27;ve purchased several bags to find my favorite scent, some a few times again because they were on sale. Anyways, the consistency is quite off from one another. Some times the refilll is perfect, other times it seems too thick or thin. This particular scent, seems to be mostly water instead of actually being soap - or at least, the batch I just purchsed. I started to refill my automatic dispenser and ended up making a mess! I had expected the liquid to react one way, but it acted in another. My batch was way too watery, and the unexpected lack of viscosity caused me to spill a good amount all over the counter top. Disapointed.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance free liquid hand soap from Simplehuman.  Their scented varieties are nice, but I&#x27;m generally not a fan of any scented hand soap.  I wash my hands often enough that I&#x27;d get bored or annoyed by the smells eventually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap is gentle on the skin and has no lingering smell.  It&#x27;s a nice consistency too, similar to Softsoap but a little less thick.  It&#x27;s smooth and lathers lightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a little disappointed the Container Store stopped selling this variety, but I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon.  Here&#x27;s hoping they don&#x27;t discontinue it.</li>
            <li> This soap is wonderful for anyone with allergies, and it also keeps your skin from drying out, very happy with this product.  Unable to find it in any retail store, it is no longer sold, so very grateful to be able to buy it here.  Have been using this to refill the automatic dispenser for about a year.</li>
            <li> Love the soap and the touchless dispenser especially in the kitchen</li>
            <li> I use this formula in the Simple Human dispenser.  I like the &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; packaging and the soap works as expected.</li>
            <li> It is not fragrance free, it has a hint of European 4711 cologne.</li>
            <li> This liquid soap works great in our Simple Human soap dispenser.  The package is designed very well and makes it so easy to refill the dispenser. It doesn&#x27;t take much of it to wash your hands. We love the product being fragrance free also.</li>
            <li> I received the dispenser as a freebie and now I am addicted to the product. I can&#x27;t stand waste or heavily perfumed products this is neither. I find that free-in-clear Method has worked in the dispenser but I feel like this is a better value and seems to last longer.</li>
            <li> Generous refill for the Simple Human automatic soap dispenser. I have one in my kitchen and I love it. I don&#x27;t have to wash grunge off the soap dispenser any more! I have not tried it with any other brand of soap dispenser.</li>
            <li> Fragrance free soap is hard to find.  This is made for a dispenser; however, I put it in a soap bottle.  It&#x27;s easy to fill with the spout.</li>
            <li> Liquid soap is liquid soap so this gets five stars more for the dispenser it goes in than the actual soap. I will say the screw cap is nice and this make no mess when you fill the dispenser.</li>
            <li> So grand to find a liquid hand soap with NO fragrance. I use it as a refill in all kinds of containers, it works just fine as a foaming soap, and you use less, too. I like to sometimes add a few drops of essential oil to this soap -- especially bergamot or lemon, which gives it the added benefits of essential oil (antibacterial, disinfectant) and a whiff of delicate scent that does not linger. SO much better than the awful, heavily perfumed liquid hand soaps you find everywhere. They make me sick, and I am grateful to be able to get this terrific product from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love this soap for the pump but if you are looking to make foaming soap out of it it doesn&#x27;t quite work well. Love that it&#x27;s fragrance free.</li>
            <li> I really liked the product because achievement fulfill all that was needed.&lt;br /&gt;Fulfilled with my expectations completely.&lt;br /&gt;Would consider buying again.</li>
            <li> Awesome soap, love how it works with the dispenser.</li>
            <li> I love the product and the price of the refill is exceptional. I usually stock up when ever it is on sale but it is reasonably priced even when there is no sale.â€‹</li>
            <li> My husband is allergic to fragrances. Very hard to find fragrance free hand soap. This is fragrance free and lathers very well.</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly in the Simple Human dispensers, smells great, and most importantly it doesn&#x27;t dry out your hands. Love this soap!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for me, no fragrance (cannot buy without fragrance locally), just regular, do not like antibacterial - regular soap is much better for killing germs and bacteria.</li>
            <li> This product was purchased along with the dispenser and my kids love it!  Now everybody has clean hands.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Its soap, does the job not sure what else to say?</li>
            <li> So an interesting thing has happened: the next package of this soap had a much lighter scent.  We purchased a 3-pack from Amazon (as the seller as well, not third party), and as I wrote in the original review, it was incredibly strong and unpleasant.  We finally finished the first bag, so I opened up the next package and poured it into the dispenser- it was completely different in how strong it was.  I would say 20 times less strong seriously.  The scent was very light, but it is definitely the same scent, so their claim that it is unscented is clearly a falsehood.  (By the way the scent lingers on your hands for probably 5 minutes after you use it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems obvious that there was a production error which dumped a large quantity of the fragrance into the batch, and I now wonder if the same occurred in the lavender scent we tied as well (we had just one bag of that one as it came with the pump) as it was equally as insanely strong smelling.  Perhaps the fragrance is added to each bag as it goes down the production line, and therefore there is more opportunity for things to go wrong?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the rating is staying unchanged due to the fact that they state that it is unscented, and yet this is clearly not true.  Also, there seems to be a problem in the production process which result in VERY overly scented bags, and there is no quality control to catch these mistakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review Jan 5 2013:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow, talk about a misnomer!  This stuff is just plain horrid; it smells like &#x27;White Shoulders&#x27; perfume, a favorite of the elderly lady crowd.  It&#x27;s not as strongly scented as the lavender version (more on that later), but just very unpleasant in that &#x27;sickly sweet and floral&#x27; way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two stars because it dispenses perfectly from the simplehuman pump for which it was made, and the soap works well to clean your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Backstory: We actually purchased this because the trial soap which came with the pump (lavender scent) has a very strong smell not only to me, but also my hubby, and neither of us are sensitive to strong aromas.  Probably to-die-for for those who really love lavender, but for us it&#x27;s almost eye-watering in its pungency.  Your hands smell of it for a long time after washing up, and that just wasn&#x27;t what he was looking for.  ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The antibacterial version is really nice; it&#x27;s quite neutral smelling and it does not contain triclosan, which is used in many antibacterial soaps and is currently under investigation by the FDA and Health Canada, so that&#x27;s a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps those wondering about the scents, but especially those with fragrance sensitivity issues.</li>
            <li> We use the soap with our Simple Human soap dispensers. It rinses clean and doesn&#x27;t leave a perfumy smell. You can fill the dispensers several times with one bag of this soap. We like the soap and the dispensers which we use in both bathrooms. Very nice product.</li>
            <li> Must have for auto pump</li>
            <li> Would recommend for ever day use, not for people who work with their hands, they may do best with heavy duty hand cleaners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their soap works best in their dispenser, unless you want to go to all the trouble of thinning another vendor&#x27;s soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for quality, not scientifically proven, but washed dirty hands, put them under the black light kinda of machine to test for how clean they were, passed, just fine.</li>
            <li> The bags hold up better in shipping than the jugs I used to order from a competitor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just right, and nothing more.</li>
            <li> Works well in the hands-free soap dispenser.</li>
            <li> I like the soap but it says it is fragrance free and still has a bit of an odor which I do not care for.  Not planning to try it again  unless there is nothing else I can find to use in the simple human hand soap dispenser I bought. Also it is too expensive and leaves my hands kind of dry.</li>
            <li> Finally a fragrance free liquid soap for dispensers !&lt;br /&gt;Saw it in BB&amp;B and haven&#x27;t been able to find it since.</li>
            <li> Always buy this brand its great.</li>
            <li> good soap, great packaging. no spill motion sensor pump refill takes seconds.</li>
            <li> Love getting this as an add on product as I used to order direct from Simple Human and shipping would almost double cost.  Good product</li>
            <li> great soap for people that need fragrance and dye free.  Unfortunately the price has doubled and there are better options out there -- like Dove fragrance free bars</li>
            <li> Love the Simple Human hand soap dispenser and so happy they offer a fragrance-free refill for those of us who suffer from breathing issues.</li>
            <li> Washes off easily, but cleans well. Does not foam excessively.  Hands feel clean after washing but not dried out. I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> A great fragrance free alternative for the Simple Human auto hand soap dispenser. My husband wouldn&#x27;t use the moisturizing hand soap. He kept on complaining it was too stinky.</li>
