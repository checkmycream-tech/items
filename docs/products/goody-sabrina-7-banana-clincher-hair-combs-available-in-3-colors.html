            <li>SO I WAS GLAD TO SEE YOU CARRY THEM.  </li>
            <li>They hold my hair securely and look cute.</li>
            <li>Make your hair appear longer by using these banana clips and so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Its was shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li>and they are great for pulling curly hair up and it looking more formal than a regular hair tie.</li>
            <li>I received the order very quick .</li>
            <li>have fine</li>
            <li>They are well made and since I have fine hair-no issues with popping or breaking.</li>
            <li>This product made a great gift for a friend, who couldn&#x27;t find these banana clips at local stores.</li>
            <li>Looks like they were cheap plastic made in a mold and not all the excess plastic was cleared out.  </li>
            <li>Cheap</li>
            <li>these are the good banana clips,  thats what I called them when I was young.</li>
            <li>Keeps long hair up, great for hot weather, work best when hair is wet or damp</li>
            <li>I have found my original banana comb.</li>
            <li>I would def purchase again - thanks :)</li>
            <li>These clips create great and quick styles for twist outs and other curly styles.</li>
            <li>No other product holds hair strongly all day!</li>
            <li>These clips work great and allow my hair to be neatly pulled back, but leave enough out so that I am more stylish than if I were to simply put my hair into a bun.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m betting that the &#x27;ball and socket&#x27; closure is going to wear out pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Slide right out.  </li>
            <li>.....broke right out of the package.</li>
            <li>Very VERY flimsy.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly what i was looking for and wanting.</li>
            <li>Will be ordering more in future.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I am letting my hair grow and it is getting hot and on my nerves.</li>
            <li>These aren&#x27;t like the banana clips I wore in the 80s which were pretty sturdy...</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s exactly what I got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are exactly like what I used to buy in the 80&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I so wish these would come back in style, I love banana clips</li>
            <li>The length is good (long) but I&#x27;m dubious as to how well the clip action is going to work... because they are so flimsy</li>
            <li>and I can keep my hair off my back for the hot summer days!!!</li>
            <li>Great to hold long hair back, nice and tight hold.</li>
            <li>love these, but...2 broken and package open on side when received, will buy more and try again :), ty for fast arrival tho</li>
            <li>I wanted a certain look for a show</li>
            <li>These will work best on larger heads with very thick hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The teeth on the combs just seem very flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>These hold my hair well and are very comfy</li>
            <li>They banana clip does not hold my hair very well.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much and</li>
            <li>These are very flimsy.</li>
            <li>Works good for my thick curly hair</li>
            <li>So great for long super thick curly hair.</li>
            <li>a little long but works great</li>
            <li>I have very thick, but also very smooth and fine hair</li>
            <li>They are rather cheaply made and way to long to use in my hair.</li>
            <li>Only Size that will hold all my hair,  great for thick hair and curly up</li>
            <li>These particular ones are just like I remember.</li>
            <li>These are a good size as it covers my whole head so I can get the cool Mohawk look without cutting my hair.</li>
            <li>Even though my hair is natural, I personally prefer a look that is more sleek and pulled back because I don&#x27;t like hair in my face (a hazard in my line of work).  </li>
            <li>So far the brown clip works pretty well, but only if I put some gel in my hair first, else my hair slides out of it.</li>
            <li>and they are big enough fit my hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be ordering more soon,  from Amazon due to 7&amp;#34; Banana Clips can&#x27;t be found in stores here locally.</li>
            <li>This clip will not hold hair in place because it is made of plastic which reminds me of gummy bear, TOO SOFT.  </li>
            <li>I have natural curly hair</li>
            <li>so they would hold really thick hair better.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>Being a Goody product, the plastic was not as sturdy as I had expected, but they still work very well!</li>
            <li>Also, because if the length the teeth are further apart and the tension between the clasps is not as tight a fit.  </li>
            <li>purchased some large barrettes at Walmart a while back and one broke the very same day&lt;</li>
            <li>wild back</li>
            <li>it could barely close when I tried to put it in my hair</li>
            <li>its cheaply made and loose wont buy again was not worth the shipping cost when I could&#x27;ve bought it at my local Walgreens</li>
            <li>Wide teeth, large enough, and flexible, doesnt tangle my hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have super thick hair, so that is not the problem.  </li>
            <li>These clips allow me to pull my hair back and up even though it is not long enough for a pony tail</li>
            <li>I used these every day for several years in the late 80s and early 90s.&lt;br /&gt;I was really looking forward to getting these before a recent trip.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I used these every day for several years in the late 80s and early 90s.&lt;br /&gt;I was really looking forward to getting these before a recent trip.&lt;br</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know anyone with hair as long as mine, so would not be recommending them to others, but I would recommend the shorter version as I have used them as well, when my hair was not long enough for the 7&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Not to thrilled with these they are thin and hard to open</li>
            <li> they will last a long time...</li>
            <li> I have pretty thick hair</li>
            <li> they are VERY thin/flexible and are the ugliest colors- battleship gray, brown (at least they don&#x27;t even pretend to be &#x27;horn&#x27;), and milky white.</li>
            <li> I am not new to banana clip and this clip is nothing close to what I had some years back.  </li>
            <li> work well with long hair</li>
            <li> Bigger than I expected</li>
            <li> 7 inch is too long.  </li>
            <li> I wish they were a little bigger</li>
            <li> not as expected</li>
            <li> They used to be harder plastic.</li>
            <li> my natural hair is thick...</li>
            <li> they are not nearly strong enough to hold long hair--just slides around, doesn&#x27;t hold tight no matter where you clip it!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use these, total waste!  </li>
            <li> could not really get them to hold my hair in place which is odd because my hair is thinner than it was 20 years</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me, these are very long on my head and very curved so they do not fit as well as the shorter ones.</li>
            <li> hair is thick and long, and these banana clips keep all my hair tucked in.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> Some of the teeth on the clip are already bent after I tried it out for a few times.  </li>
            <li> They are 7&amp;#34; so that makes them thin and harder to use.</li>
            <li> They work but it is a bit difficult to open and close.</li>
            <li> They are useless for holding back my hair.</li>
            <li> 5 inch is almost too small.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on these!</li>
            <li> know a couple of other people that have had similar experiences with Goody Products.&lt;br /&gt;It is too bad that so few things are of the quality that they once</li>
            <li> Sucks for wash and gos...</li>
            <li> I have thick girly hair and they keep it up 4 me</li>
            <li> Not like the ones we use to get that were thick and lasted forever.</li>
            <li> slides out of hair and I have thick hair.  </li>

            <li> I have loved since I was a kid. I have thick girly hair and they keep it up 4 me</li>
            <li> This product made a great gift for a friend, who couldn&#x27;t find these banana clips at local stores. I am very please and happy with this product. For the price and quality of this product, it&#x27;s a must have!</li>
            <li> I have been searching for these seems like FOREVER! So imagine my surprise when I found them on amazon! I bought 2 packs just because I lose them a lot!</li>
            <li> I used these every day for several years in the late 80s and early 90s.&lt;br /&gt;I was really looking forward to getting these before a recent trip.&lt;br /&gt;They did get here on time however, they are definitely not as good as they used to be.&lt;br /&gt;I could not really get them to hold my hair in place which is odd because my hair is thinner than it was 20 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The teeth on the combs just seem very flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;I have about given up on Goody Products all together after this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased some large barrettes at Walmart a while back and one broke the very same day&lt;br /&gt;I know a couple of other people that have had similar experiences with Goody Products.&lt;br /&gt;It is too bad that so few things are of the quality that they once were.&lt;br /&gt;A wild back I purchased some Scunci Banana clips here on Amazon from a third-party seller.&lt;br /&gt;The quality of those was definitely superior to the goody Brand.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I have not been able to find those in a 6 or 7 inch length.&lt;br /&gt;Last night I ordered one made by Vidal Sassoon and I will post a review when I receive it.</li>
            <li> These clips were too big and would slip off my hair. I would not recommend this to a anyone.</li>
            <li> Not to thrilled with these they are thin and hard to open seems like they will break after using them awhile. They are 7&amp;#34; so that makes them thin and harder to use. Not like the ones we use to get that were thick and lasted forever. Sorry but these are not working for me</li>
            <li> Keeps long hair up, great for hot weather, work best when hair is wet or damp</li>
            <li> They work but it is a bit difficult to open and close.</li>
            <li> So great for long super thick curly hair. They hold well at closure.</li>
            <li> I loved these in the 80&#x27;s and I love them now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is thick and long, and these banana clips keep all my hair tucked in. The newer styles do not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are a perfect &#x27;come back&#x27;!</li>
            <li> work well with long hair</li>
            <li> These clips create great and quick styles for twist outs and other curly styles. I have pretty thick hair and they are big enough fit my hair</li>
            <li> They are rather cheaply made and way to long to use in my hair. I&#x27;ve already broken one of the three. Sadly disappointed.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t worn &amp;#34;banana clips&amp;#34; in years, but these were perfect for the updo I wanted for my wedding. It saved a lot of time and pinning with just one clip.</li>
            <li> I am not new to banana clip and this clip is nothing close to what I had some years back.  This clip will not hold hair in place because it is made of plastic which reminds me of gummy bear, TOO SOFT.  Some of the teeth on the clip are already bent after I tried it out for a few times.  I am now stuck with 3 useless clips and am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money!!! They fell apart and wouldn&#x27;t stay together in the hair at all... :(</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.  Just like the banana clips from the 80&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> love these, but...2 broken and package open on side when received, will buy more and try again :), ty for fast arrival tho</li>
            <li> I like these banana clips they remind me when I was a teenager. I could not find these in any store. I have been looking for months and was really happy when I found these online.</li>
            <li> Only Size that will hold all my hair,  great for thick hair and curly up - do&#x27;s</li>
            <li> they are not nearly strong enough to hold long hair--just slides around, doesn&#x27;t hold tight no matter where you clip it!</li>
            <li> Buy them now. You know you want to.</li>
            <li> I remember years ago when these were popular and you could get them just about anywhere. I never see them in any stores even ones that sell discontinued items. I bought this three pack and I am happy with my purchase. I do remember there were ones that were better made or more durable but these ones are nice and they work great with my hair.</li>
            <li> They got the job done. I wanted a certain look for a show and I knew these would be the answer. The pricing was good and delivery was prompt.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed...sturdy, functional and colors that go with any look.  Great clips.</li>
            <li> slides out of hair and I have thick hair.  not as expected</li>
            <li> You cant find these in the drug stores, not even Ulta.  So I was happy to find them on Amazon.  Make your hair appear longer by using these banana clips and so easy to use.  Wonderful!</li>
            <li> Its was shipped very quickly. It was exactly what i was looking for and wanting. it was the correct size that i was lookn for.</li>
            <li> Finally! I have found my original banana comb. Love these. I have natural curly hair I throw my head over comb my lower head and flip over and snap. Stays all day. Will be ordering more in future.</li>
            <li> These are a good size as it covers my whole head so I can get the cool Mohawk look without cutting my hair.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Banana clips arrived, very cheap looking and would not clip.  I don&#x27;t have super thick hair, so that is not the problem.  Looks like they were cheap plastic made in a mold and not all the excess plastic was cleared out.  DO NOT BUY!</li>
            <li> These hold my hair well and are very comfy</li>
            <li> It will get the job done. I wanted to use it to create a fake mohawk but didnt work so well. Maybe I could find another use.</li>
            <li> I am letting my hair grow and it is getting hot and on my nerves. These clips allow me to pull my hair back and up even though it is not long enough for a pony tail</li>
            <li> Years ago I used banana clips to hold back my hair.  Well, either my hair changed texture dramatically or the way these are made has changed.  They are useless for holding back my hair.</li>
            <li> Great to hold long hair back, nice and tight hold.</li>
            <li> Looking for these everywhere!! Love it. Works good for my thick curly hair</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair and that&#x27;s why I bought them cause they were long,but they broke within a week</li>
            <li> Admittedly, I saw the style and thought these were the same as ones I&#x27;ve owned for years but can no longer find in stores.  Unfortunately for me, these are very long on my head and very curved so they do not fit as well as the shorter ones. Also, because if the length the teeth are further apart and the tension between the clasps is not as tight a fit.  I will be looking to see if an Amazon vendor carries the shorter length ones next time.  These will work best on larger heads with very thick hair.</li>
            <li> It was listed for thick hair....it could barely close when I tried to put it in my hair</li>
            <li> Bigger than I expected</li>
            <li> Being a Goody product, the plastic was not as sturdy as I had expected, but they still work very well! I would def purchase again - thanks :)</li>
            <li> 5 inch is almost too small.  7 inch is too long.  6 inch would be perfect.  Hope the 7 inich works better as the hair gets longer.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product.  Cheesy make-up and do not work.  Not like the product produced by Goody in the USA.</li>
            <li> They banana clip does not hold my hair very well.  I have very thick, but also very smooth and fine hair and it just slips out.</li>
            <li> Not good for thick hair!</li>
            <li> Sucks for wash and gos... my natural hair is thick... when I finally get the clip on it pops open all the dang time... I have to put a pile of Bobbi pins around jus sob it can stay on...</li>
            <li> These clips are great!  So I&#x27;m stuck in the 80s, I couldn&#x27;t find these in stores so Amazon saved the day, AGAIN.</li>
            <li> Sure did miss these. Fits my hair the same as when I wore them in the 80&#x27;s. Very, very happy!!!!!</li>
            <li> Even though my hair is natural, I personally prefer a look that is more sleek and pulled back because I don&#x27;t like hair in my face (a hazard in my line of work).  These clips work great and allow my hair to be neatly pulled back, but leave enough out so that I am more stylish than if I were to simply put my hair into a bun.  No other product holds hair strongly all day!</li>
            <li> So glad to find these clips. I wasn&#x27;t sure they were made any more and they are great for pulling curly hair up and it looking more formal than a regular hair tie. I wish they were a little bigger so they would hold really thick hair better.</li>
            <li> Because they keep my hair in place.&lt;br /&gt;Have no dislikes.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know anyone with hair as long as mine, so would not be recommending them to others, but I would recommend the shorter version as I have used them as well, when my hair was not long enough for the 7&amp;#34; length.</li>
            <li> Love these.  Sturdy and just what I wanted</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even know they made clips this big!!! I works great for my lond hair and I can keep my hair off my back for the hot summer days!!!</li>
            <li> these are the good banana clips,  thats what I called them when I was young. This is a great price that amazon offered because you cant find them in the stores and the beauty supply carries the cheap version.</li>
            <li> The Goody hair clips are of good quality...they will last a long time...I also like the colors...I received the order very quick .</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold hair cause its cheaply made and loose wont buy again was not worth the shipping cost when I could&#x27;ve bought it at my local Walgreens</li>
            <li> Horrible hair clips.  Slide right out.  Very VERY flimsy.  I can&#x27;t use these, total waste!  Don&#x27;t waste your money on these!</li>
            <li> THESE ARE THE BEST BANANA CLIPS.  THE CANNOT FIND THIS LENGTH IN ANY STORE SO I WAS GLAD TO SEE YOU CARRY THEM.  WILL ORDER AGAIN.</li>
            <li> Love it! Definitely is a plus to my hair care regimen. Wide teeth, large enough, and flexible, doesnt tangle my hair. I&#x27;ll be ordering more soon,  from Amazon due to 7&amp;#34; Banana Clips can&#x27;t be found in stores here locally.</li>
            <li> I had a so so haircut and needed a perky way to put up my hair.  It fell apart the first time and since it was a small item I did not bother to return it.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t like the banana clips I wore in the 80s which were pretty sturdy... they are VERY thin/flexible and are the ugliest colors- battleship gray, brown (at least they don&#x27;t even pretend to be &#x27;horn&#x27;), and milky white. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much and that&#x27;s exactly what I got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair- but a lot of it. So far the brown clip works pretty well, but only if I put some gel in my hair first, else my hair slides out of it. The length is good (long) but I&#x27;m dubious as to how well the clip action is going to work... because they are so flimsy I&#x27;m betting that the &#x27;ball and socket&#x27; closure is going to wear out pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> The banana clips are great...just like I remember them :) I can keep my hair out of my face and still look great.</li>
            <li> a little long but works great</li>
            <li> The way it is designed a person can&#x27;t know from which end to unhook it from.I have just packed the remaining two,they should  starting putting an instruction or guideline of how to use the combs.</li>
            <li> These are very flimsy. They used to be harder plastic. I never use them.</li>
            <li> Cheap.....broke right out of the package. Won&#x27;t hold anything. Do NOT purchase.</li>
            <li> Thrilled to find these on Amazon! They are exactly like what I used to buy in the 80&#x27;s. have been looking for them in stores for years with no luck. They are well made and since I have fine hair-no issues with popping or breaking.</li>
            <li> Just like I used to use when I was much younger!</li>
            <li> I so wish these would come back in style, I love banana clips</li>
            <li> Kind of wimpy strength, not the good quality they used to make. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I use to wear these when I was a teenager so I was very happy to see the and now I gave them to my daughter.</li>
            <li> I bought these because they remind me of my childhood. I grew up with these in every color!  These particular ones are just like I remember. They hold my hair securely and look cute.</li>
            <li> Work well with thick hair</li>
