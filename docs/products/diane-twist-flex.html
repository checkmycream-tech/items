            <li>and I like to have nice hair.</li>
            <li>but I ended up doing it my own way.</li>
            <li>This is  really nice an convenient.</li>
            <li>And they&#x27;re a nice length.</li>
            <li>but they work pretty great.</li>
            <li>These flexi-rods are very strong compared to some others that i&#x27;ve tried ; would definitely purchase this awesome product again.</li>
            <li>Pretty good, they make nice curls.</li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with these or how about rolling them into my hair.  </li>
            <li>and i really love getting smacked in the face when I move my head trying to get things done by multi tasking</li>
            <li>So much better on your hair than using heat.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about these but went ahead and ordered them.</li>
            <li>then I spray them lightly and take the rods out and have all day curls!</li>
            <li>These curlers are okay.  </li>
            <li>I also make sure they lay in a uniform -even row which helps some.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love these.  </li>
            <li>I love it just need more practice with it ,</li>
            <li>I wish they had included more than six though - something closer to 10 would have been a better amount.</li>
            <li>both really love them, they do what they wanted and hoped for .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried sleeping in them because I roll around too much at night, but I&#x27;m guessing that would work great too.</li>
            <li>I bought two just to be sure, and I use all of the rods when I do my hair.</li>
            <li>They are the most used and best out of the different colors</li>
            <li>I Love the flex rods would recommend to anyone, received ahead of schedule.</li>
            <li>These are great for those who want a much bigger/looser curls in their hair.</li>
            <li>Perfect for long hair.</li>
            <li>Purchase this merchandise and the flexi rods holds the curls pretty good.</li>
            <li>Quick and easy for styling nice curls.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re great for natural hair.</li>
            <li>These flexirods did a great job as far as being sturdy and bendable.</li>
            <li>but with these it&#x27;s super easy!</li>
            <li>Easy use and never used this product before .  </li>
            <li>It was so strong that I wanted to take my hair done after I finished rolling bc</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve got full, lovely curls.</li>
            <li>These are fine if you plan on wearing them during the day,but I &amp;#34;personally&amp;#34; had problems with the bulkiness/firmness.  </li>
            <li>but i prefer just getting it over with quickly and getting better results by using a curling iron.</li>
            <li>but it was relatively cheap and you can probably get it to work if you fiddle around with</li>
            <li>They were very affordable and the quality was amazing.  </li>
            <li>Durable and comfortable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I didn&#x27;t use these right.</li>
            <li>But then my hair is very easily persuaded--it&#x27;s naturally wavy to start with, but nowhere near as attractive as these rollers can make it.</li>
            <li>They are super easy to use.  </li>
            <li>these are the perfect size and my hair is about 3-4 inches past my shoulders</li>
            <li>Any way, they&#x27;re pretty ok.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t exactly look nice if left to their own devices.</li>
            <li>price is right!</li>
            <li>Great curlers, curled my hair way tighter than I expected.</li>
            <li>This flexi rods is good for big bouncy curls.</li>
            <li>cant get over the chemical smell and the curls weren&#x27;t very pretty.</li>
            <li>and it came out very pretty.</li>
            <li>My package came home two days earlier than the expected arrival date, so I got to try them out sooner! :D</li>
            <li>Very effective within a few hours</li>
            <li>I ordered three sets of the orange hair rods, and they arrived neatly packaged, and right on time.</li>
            <li>just right-</li>
            <li>and, I just don&#x27;t care to worry about whether or not I got it just right.</li>
            <li>An important thing to note is - you want to make sure your hair is about 80-90% dry before putting these in otherwise they won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I tried them for the first time yesterday and it was totally worth it.  </li>
            <li>so i struggled with it a little more than most people.</li>
            <li>and if I accidentally touch the first it just unrolls and falls out</li>
            <li>I would go larger if you want more of a wave.</li>
            <li>but they make for great, bouncy, long lasting curls!</li>
            <li>All I do is spray a little warm water on my hair before I put them in and after it dries (about an hour) I get lovely curls that last for days if I let them; basically until I wash them out.</li>
            <li>after watching some youtube videos its pretty straight forward.  </li>
            <li>I am the type of person who can sleep through pretty much anything</li>
            <li>I have used them three times, and after experimenting with placement a little, I accheived wonderful tightly coiled ringlets which fell into lovely loose bouncy curls.</li>
            <li>They never seemed to really curl my hair.</li>
            <li>These work just as well as a curling iron, without the heat damage, and they&#x27;re much easier to use.</li>
            <li>None work on my hair, did not bother to return, too much hastle.</li>
            <li>If you have straight hair, these will not stay in.</li>
            <li>Makes hair care so much easier and does not disturb sleep either.  </li>
            <li>They also don&#x27;t hold hair very well.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t absorb much moisture from my hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a mix between straight and Curly</li>
            <li>These rollers are the real thing.</li>
            <li>fast shipping</li>
            <li>They came sooner than I expected and worked better than I thought they would.</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable.</li>
            <li>it works very well</li>
            <li>I really like these rollers.</li>
            <li>Maybe if you want extra big hair you may want more rods.</li>
            <li>I have Long hair &amp; personally I felt that a shorter version would work better &amp; not leave so much excess to twist up.</li>
            <li>For years I&#x27;ve been trying to master the curling iron because even though my hair is naturally curly, it is completely straight in some areas and sometimes the parts that curl</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried to curl my hair with these in a couple different ways, and it just did not look right.</li>
            <li>They make pretty tight curls, but they&#x27;re natural-looking, and they stayed put for 2 full days until I washed the hair.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stay very well in my asian hair</li>
            <li>So far, my attempts at using a curling iron haven&#x27;t gone well</li>
            <li>Purchased these for my 13 Year Old Daughters (Twins)&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>Depending on how you use them you can get a few different looks, and this method is much better for your hair than an iron.</li>
            <li>Bought this along with the smaller size these are &amp;#34;fluffier&amp;#34; so they bounce back better and look like they will long outlast the smaller ones</li>
            <li>i would highly recommend these for curls that last all day!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t sleep in them very well, so I just leave them in for a long while as I do my homework and fix dinner etc.</li>
            <li>The negative side is that they aren&#x27;t comfortable to sleep in</li>
            <li>Your hair needs to be just barely damp for these; gotta get it</li>
            <li>I just shower, blow-dry until just barely damp, apply some mousse and then start rolling.  </li>
            <li>If you want natural looking loose curls</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve got fine, thin hair that does not like to do what I ask of it</li>

            <li> The negative side is that they aren&#x27;t comfortable to sleep in</li>
            <li> Your hair needs to be just barely damp for these; gotta get it</li>
            <li> I just shower, blow-dry until just barely damp, apply some mousse and then start rolling.  </li>
            <li> If you want natural looking loose curls</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve got fine, thin hair that does not like to do what I ask of it</li>
            <li> How you first start your hair will depend on the user in whether the curls will be tight or loose.</li>
            <li> love them as they were much lower priced than the other brands!&lt;br /&gt;Do not be afraid of</li>
            <li> Once they&#x27;re all in, I blow dry again for a couple minutes, then do my makeup or get dressed--only leaving them in for about ten minutes sets curls that last for me all day.  </li>
            <li> I usually plat my hair and then place rollers at the end to get my desired look but its very time consuming.</li>
            <li> i put these in before bed and slept in them a little uncomfortable but the results were worth it!!!</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair (African American) and wanted a faster way to curl my hair naturally without heat and tons of chemicals.</li>
            <li> so it takes so long to roll them because I have to do each one like 5 times.</li>
            <li> They are just way too long.</li>
            <li> I believe they will hold up for a long time.</li>
            <li> And even how long you leave it in will make a difference.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not thin but it isn&#x27;t too thick either.</li>
            <li> I put them in when my hair was 90% dry, tied a scarf over it and went to bed.</li>
            <li> just wait for it to dry.</li>
            <li> I wait until my hair is 90% dry, add some mouse, a curl setting spray, and a sea salt spray, then wrap sections of my hair around them.</li>
            <li> Then I sit around for an hour or so and let my hair air dry, blast it with the blow dryer a bit, then unwrap</li>
            <li> Meaning if you use any curling leave in product or if you use the product when your hair is dry, damp, or wet.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that having your hair dry, damp, or wet does make a difference.</li>
            <li> using these is really awkward and annoying-not to mention sleeping on these is SO COMFORTABLE</li>
            <li> If your hair is thin, shoulder length and straight, you&#x27;re outta luck.</li>
            <li> These worked just the same but took much less time and the curls lasted longer!</li>
            <li> The description should say they are for long, thick hair only.</li>
            <li> The only slightly bad thing that I have to say is that one package would definitely not be enough to do my whole head all at once.</li>
            <li> I usually roll &amp; the just bend the last in.</li>
            <li> Curls are too tight for my personal liking and they are not comfortable to sleep in, but they do the job so can&#x27;t blame the product.</li>
            <li> not to bad to sleep in them but not 100% comfortable.</li>
            <li> Plus when I lay down in bed, they just fall out.  </li>
            <li> They are not comfy to wear for five minutes, much less sleep in.</li>
            <li> My hair type is hard to describe, it&#x27;s long.</li>
            <li> Usualy when i curl my hair with foam rollers they make the curls to tight but with these flex rods they dont make my hair to tightly curled.</li>
            <li> This size makes tight curls.</li>
            <li> These things only work if your hair is past your shoulders and thick.</li>
            <li> Wish they were a little shorter.  </li>
            <li> One works to tame my ponytail.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just my hair or what, but I do not like this item.</li>
            <li> I would say the only con would be that they have a faint odor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty much worthless when it comes to styling my hair.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me and have a hard time figuring out how to style your hair, you can probably use these.</li>
            <li> These were really hard to put on, even after watching a number of youtube videos.  </li>
            <li> My hair is too thin to hold the heavy rods</li>
            <li> But if my hair was long and thick, I wouldn&#x27;t have needed these stupid pieces of crap rollers in the first place.</li>
            <li> Cannot figure out how to use on straight hair, was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> but they are SO uncomfortable to sleep in.</li>
            <li> I was so uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> And are impossible to sleep in.</li>
            <li> it was that bad.</li>
            <li> I got these because I hate heat products</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I didn&#x27;t use these right. They never seemed to really curl my hair.</li>
            <li> These work just as well as a curling iron, without the heat damage, and they&#x27;re much easier to use. I put them in when my hair was 90% dry, tied a scarf over it and went to bed. In the morning it took 5 minutes to take them out, and once I ran my fingers through a bit, I stopped looking like Shirley Temple. They make pretty tight curls, but they&#x27;re natural-looking, and they stayed put for 2 full days until I washed the hair. I used 2.5 packs for my medium-thick waist-length hair.</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with these or how about rolling them into my hair.  after watching some youtube videos its pretty straight forward.  not to bad to sleep in them but not 100% comfortable.</li>
            <li> cant get over the chemical smell and the curls weren&#x27;t very pretty. using these is really awkward and annoying-not to mention sleeping on these is SO COMFORTABLE and i really love getting smacked in the face when I move my head trying to get things done by multi tasking so I don&#x27;t have to sit still and just wait for it to dry. It doesn&#x27;t stay very well in my asian hair so i struggled with it a little more than most people. but it was relatively cheap and you can probably get it to work if you fiddle around with but i prefer just getting it over with quickly and getting better results by using a curling iron.</li>
            <li> Cannot figure out how to use on straight hair, was very disappointed. Ordered four sets in different siZes. None work on my hair, did not bother to return, too much hastle. If you have straight hair, these will not stay in. try something else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty much worthless when it comes to styling my hair. For years I&#x27;ve been trying to master the curling iron because even though my hair is naturally curly, it is completely straight in some areas and sometimes the parts that curl don&#x27;t exactly look nice if left to their own devices. So far, my attempts at using a curling iron haven&#x27;t gone well so I gave these a try. If you&#x27;re like me and have a hard time figuring out how to style your hair, you can probably use these. I wait until my hair is 90% dry, add some mouse, a curl setting spray, and a sea salt spray, then wrap sections of my hair around them. Then I sit around for an hour or so and let my hair air dry, blast it with the blow dryer a bit, then unwrap and I&#x27;ve got full, lovely curls. They last all day with a bit of hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve got fine, thin hair that does not like to do what I ask of it so I&#x27;m very pleased to find these work so well for me. I plan to purchase different sizes at some point in the future.</li>
            <li> Great curlers, curled my hair way tighter than I expected. I need to work on that. But they work great. THey keep my hair curled when no curling iron will.</li>
            <li> Easy use and never used this product before .  My hair had the most beautiful curls!  Love the results, will use often!</li>
            <li> These were really hard to put on, even after watching a number of youtube videos.  They wouldnt hold the ends of the hair either.</li>
            <li> I love these! So much better on your hair than using heat. I am still trying to figure them out but they work pretty great.</li>
            <li> Must have item. Makes hair care so much easier and does not disturb sleep either.  Very effective within a few hours</li>
            <li> Funally heartless curls!! If rolled correctly these curls turn out amazing. The negative side is that they aren&#x27;t comfortable to sleep in but then again if you have time to let stay in before going out then they work wonderful. Also no directions so youtube is helpful</li>
            <li> i put these in before bed and slept in them a little uncomfortable but the results were worth it!!! didn&#x27;t even have to use product! i would highly recommend these for curls that last all day!</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t stay in and prevent my hair from drying for hours and hours.... And are impossible to sleep in. They also don&#x27;t hold hair very well.</li>
            <li> I purchased these as an alternative to heat rollers and I absolutely love them! I tried them for the first time yesterday and it was totally worth it.  Great results!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about these but went ahead and ordered them. I have long thick hair (African American) and wanted a faster way to curl my hair naturally without heat and tons of chemicals. I usually plat my hair and then place rollers at the end to get my desired look but its very time consuming. These worked just the same but took much less time and the curls lasted longer!</li>
            <li> I ordered three sets of the orange hair rods, and they arrived neatly packaged, and right on time. I have used them three times, and after experimenting with placement a little, I accheived wonderful tightly coiled ringlets which fell into lovely loose bouncy curls. Depending on how you use them you can get a few different looks, and this method is much better for your hair than an iron. I can&#x27;t sleep in them very well, so I just leave them in for a long while as I do my homework and fix dinner etc. then I spray them lightly and take the rods out and have all day curls!</li>
            <li> These curlers are okay.  They don&#x27;t absorb much moisture from my hair.  Your hair needs to be just barely damp for these; gotta get it just right- and, I just don&#x27;t care to worry about whether or not I got it just right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Twist-Flex Rods. These were added to my collection!!! They do a very good job with curls and no products are required on the hair.</li>
            <li> These are fine if you plan on wearing them during the day,but I &amp;#34;personally&amp;#34; had problems with the bulkiness/firmness.  I have Long hair &amp; personally I felt that a shorter version would work better &amp; not leave so much excess to twist up. I usually roll &amp; the just bend the last in. over on each end .  I also make sure they lay in a uniform -even row which helps some.&lt;br /&gt;The price is right!</li>
            <li> These flexi-rods are very strong compared to some others that i&#x27;ve tried ; would definitely purchase this awesome product again. They&#x27;re great for natural hair.</li>
            <li> I bought these after reading the good reviews on them. If I was rating them for the curl they gave me I&#x27;d give a 5/5 but they are SO uncomfortable to sleep in. I am the type of person who can sleep through pretty much anything and they had me up multiple times during the night I was so uncomfortable. So, if you&#x27;re looking for curlers to sleep in these aren&#x27;t the ones to get. That being said, it did give my hair very nice bouncy curls. An important thing to note is - you want to make sure your hair is about 80-90% dry before putting these in otherwise they won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I love these flex twist rods! I got these because I hate heat products and I like to have nice hair. My hair type is hard to describe, it&#x27;s long. It&#x27;s a mix between straight and Curly so I could wear it either way. It&#x27;s not thin but it isn&#x27;t too thick either. I only got one pack and it&#x27;s all I need. I separated my layers and did three on each side of my head and it came out very pretty. I youtubed videos on how to use these but I ended up doing it my own way. Maybe if you want extra big hair you may want more rods. I doubt these work for short hair. My hair turned out very beautiful. If you want natural looking loose curls I feel like these are the way to go.</li>
            <li> These things only work if your hair is past your shoulders and thick. My hair is too thin to hold the heavy rods no matter how I bend them. If I roll thicker sections then I have no curl. They are not comfy to wear for five minutes, much less sleep in. Plus when I lay down in bed, they just fall out.  Once I get one roller in place, I try to roll another one and if I accidentally touch the first it just unrolls and falls out so it takes so long to roll them because I have to do each one like 5 times. They are just way too long. The description should say they are for long, thick hair only. But if my hair was long and thick, I wouldn&#x27;t have needed these stupid pieces of crap rollers in the first place. If your hair is thin, shoulder length and straight, you&#x27;re outta luck. Go get a perm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just my hair or what, but I do not like this item. I&#x27;ve tried to curl my hair with these in a couple different ways, and it just did not look right.</li>
            <li> Bought this along with the smaller size these are &amp;#34;fluffier&amp;#34; so they bounce back better and look like they will long outlast the smaller ones</li>
            <li> Tricky to keep in hair that&#x27;s silky... definitely dampen hair a bit before using these.</li>
            <li> These rollers are the real thing. Not the generic. Wish they were a little shorter.  But thats my fault.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> fast shipping and i love it! these are the perfect size and my hair is about 3-4 inches past my shoulders so im happy :)</li>
            <li> They came sooner than I expected and worked better than I thought they would. I will probably be ordering them in the larger sizes as well for a larger curl.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my fine hair! Painless and carefree, low maintenance curls!</li>
            <li> These rollers are great for people who don&#x27;t want their hair to curly. Usualy when i curl my hair with foam rollers they make the curls to tight but with these flex rods they dont make my hair to tightly curled. i would buy this again!</li>
            <li> This is  really nice an convenient. You don&#x27;t need and clips to hold it.&lt;br /&gt;Flex Rods are great and easy to carry them.</li>
            <li> I love these.  They are super easy to use.  I just shower, blow-dry until just barely damp, apply some mousse and then start rolling.  Once they&#x27;re all in, I blow dry again for a couple minutes, then do my makeup or get dressed--only leaving them in for about ten minutes sets curls that last for me all day.  But then my hair is very easily persuaded--it&#x27;s naturally wavy to start with, but nowhere near as attractive as these rollers can make it.</li>
            <li> I love the foam rollers!  They were very affordable and the quality was amazing.  Quick and easy for styling nice curls.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product! It curls your hair without any heat! My package came home two days earlier than the expected arrival date, so I got to try them out sooner! :D</li>
            <li> I love it just need more practice with it , yes I think everybody should purchase this product , good luck</li>
            <li> Perfect for long hair. I use about 2 packs at a time. This size makes tight curls. I would go larger if you want more of a wave.</li>
            <li> They do the job. And they&#x27;re a nice length. The price was reasonable. I would say the only con would be that they have a faint odor. Sort of indescribable but you&#x27;ll know it when you smell it. Any way, they&#x27;re pretty ok.</li>
            <li> Pretty good, they make nice curls. I wish they had included more than six though - something closer to 10 would have been a better amount.</li>
            <li> Just like I stated it works, my hair doesn&#x27;t keep curls and curlers are a pain to sleep in but with these it&#x27;s super easy!</li>
            <li> Purchased these for my 13 Year Old Daughters (Twins)&lt;br /&gt;They both really love them, they do what they wanted and hoped for .&lt;br /&gt;I love them as they were much lower priced than the other brands!&lt;br /&gt;Do not be afraid of the lower price,,just buy them!</li>
            <li> works great and no heat damage</li>
            <li> These are seriously so perfect if you want curls without heat. All I do is spray a little warm water on my hair before I put them in and after it dries (about an hour) I get lovely curls that last for days if I let them; basically until I wash them out. I haven&#x27;t tried sleeping in them because I roll around too much at night, but I&#x27;m guessing that would work great too.The only slightly bad thing that I have to say is that one package would definitely not be enough to do my whole head all at once. I bought two just to be sure, and I use all of the rods when I do my hair.</li>
            <li> They are the most used and best out of the different colors but they make for great, bouncy, long lasting curls!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find any directions on how to use them.  So I&#x27;m still experimenting.  One works to tame my ponytail.</li>
            <li> These flexirods did a great job as far as being sturdy and bendable. I believe they will hold up for a long time. The only downfall was the over-powering smell of the rods. It was so strong that I wanted to take my hair done after I finished rolling bc it was that bad.</li>
            <li> Curls are too tight for my personal liking and they are not comfortable to sleep in, but they do the job so can&#x27;t blame the product.</li>
            <li> Purchase this merchandise and the flexi rods holds the curls pretty good. Very good for your hair without using heat tools. This flexi rods is good for big bouncy curls.</li>
            <li> I Love the flex rods would recommend to anyone, received ahead of schedule. Great product and it works very well</li>
            <li> I really like these rollers. Durable and comfortable. I slept in them and got plenty of sleep. I would definitely recommend them.</li>
            <li> These are great for those who want a much bigger/looser curls in their hair. How you first start your hair will depend on the user in whether the curls will be tight or loose. Meaning if you use any curling leave in product or if you use the product when your hair is dry, damp, or wet. And even how long you leave it in will make a difference. Best thing to do is try all types of variations to figure out the perfect curl for you. If you ever need help figuring out how to use these just go on YouTube and you can find plenty of videos. Keep in mind that having your hair dry, damp, or wet does make a difference.</li>
