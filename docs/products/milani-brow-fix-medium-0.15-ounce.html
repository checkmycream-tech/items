            <li>This brow powder is great!  </li>

            <li>Very nice thank you to upscale deal</li>
            <li>The colors are easy to blend and are surprisingly perfect for my medium brown hair.</li>
            <li>Went on so nice and the brush included worked great.</li>
            <li>Salty and sweet are wonderful together.</li>
            <li>just love this set and the mini tools are well crafted.. great item</li>
            <li>This is as good as the clnique, maybe even better and the price is fair.</li>
            <li>Love this product for maintaining my eyebrows neat!</li>
            <li>absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>The product is great, easy to apply and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>easy to apply brush works great...</li>
            <li>but I still think the angle brush that comes with it is amazing.</li>
            <li>nice nice brow kit.</li>
            <li>Hi-lite shade is really a nice touch for the under brows.</li>
            <li>but brow1 is nice as a eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>I love the tweezer too, so cute!</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product!</li>
            <li>I find that many brands don&#x27;t have natural looking shades for brows and these are just perfect!</li>
            <li>Great melted and poured over hot popcorn.</li>
            <li>I can easily blend the colors and the highlight is nice and smooth!</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>The brushes are cute, the highlighter works well under my brow.</li>
            <li>I have used many, a lot of Clinique, some gels.</li>
            <li>I love this kit.</li>
            <li>Colors are ok.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS, RE-REVIEWED</li>
            <li>AS I LEARNED HOW TO USE IT :)</li>
            <li>but you do get better at it with time.</li>
            <li>I love this kit, just wish there wasn&#x27;t shimmer.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, I don&#x27;t leave the house without it on.</li>
            <li>I mostly just use the hi-lite and brow2</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>love how the holder can stand up</li>
            <li>I am in LOVE with this make up.</li>
            <li>I love love love it :)</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I would definitely order again as the kit is perfect!</li>
            <li>This kit also makes it easy, just follow what it says on the palette itself....</li>
            <li>My hair is dark brown but these matched perfectly.</li>
            <li>Took me less then a minute to do and had awesome results!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to change the shape of my eyebrows—just wanted to make them look a little fuller—and for that this shadow-like filler is perfect.</li>
            <li>This is great for people who have light eyebrows or for people like me who don&#x27;t have enough.</li>
            <li>But overall great</li>
            <li>great but and recieved it only 2 days after ordering!</li>
            <li>Enjoy</li>
            <li>It brings tweezers that are tiny but work great a magnifying mirror</li>
            <li>This is the perfect little brow kit!</li>
            <li>DEFINITELY worth the money!</li>
            <li>It does better and looks more natural than a brow pencil.</li>
            <li>It fills in, looks natural, and most importantly, it lasts!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been playing with the kit for two days, sometimes my brow color choice is perfect and other times, I&#x27;ve added too much, who knew brows</li>
            <li>This fills in nicely and looks natural.</li>
            <li>.............use the light color right under your brow</li>
            <li>I usually get Mally Bulletproof Brow pencils for my brows, this kits is better, cheaper and absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li>I just use a separate stick of wax but it would be great to have it already in the little palette.</li>
            <li>The only thing keeping me from LOVING this product is that I wish that it had eyebrow wax included (holds your eyebrow hairs in place/seals the powder).</li>
            <li>Also the back of the kit shows you where to apply the hi lite and brow color, which is a nice guide.  </li>
            <li>It looks more natural and easier to use than pencil.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, this kit is perfect for my needs and was definitely $9 well spent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The lightest color is intended to be a highlighter, but you can also mix it with either of the other two colors just enough that you can get the perfect shade.</li>
            <li>Followed advice of using highlighter, lighter powder at head of brow, darker at arch end, and the brushes stand right up</li>
            <li>Very compact little package with great brushes.</li>
            <li>the second color is great for the middle fold and then the dark brown is for the lid and even good for eye brows.  </li>
            <li>I love that it comes with tiny tweezers and application brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been using the same brow powder for years - love this.  </li>
            <li>and I love the light then dark towards the ends of my brows theory</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this brow kits for a few years,great to just throw in make up bag and go,I think the powders have good staying power.</li>
            <li>My favorite daily eyebrow material - I have lost a lot of eyebrow as I have gotten older.  </li>
            <li>Not that easy to use these tiny things</li>
            <li>Brow Kit is so easy to work but get bigger brushes</li>
            <li>Sorry Mally, my brows have found their new best friend.</li>
            <li>I have medium brown hair (fair skin tone) and am pleasantly surprised by this little palette.</li>
            <li>but if you want your brows to really pop all day, you might need to re-apply.</li>
            <li>Shades are suitable for medium to dark coloured brows.</li>
            <li>could be so much work?</li>
            <li>Will continue to purchase this product as long as its available.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent brow tool.</li>
            <li>I mostly use the angled brush, but it comes with a little sponge brush as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I definitely didn&#x27;t expect the tweezers to work at all, but they&#x27;re actually not terrible for being an inch long.</li>
            <li>I have dark hair and light eye brows</li>
            <li>So basically using this kit is arguably the same as using eyeshadow on your brows, but that&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>, and you already have eyeshadow in these exact same colors, you probably don&#x27;t need this.</li>
            <li>The darker color matches well, but I don&#x27;t feel it looks as natural as I would like.</li>
            <li>Brows have a natural look unlike a drawn on look as with a pencil.</li>
            <li>Well, I am surprised.</li>
            <li>The tools it came with are decent as well, and I didn&#x27;t realize that you can actually flip them up to reveal an itty bitty mirror.</li>
            <li>DOES THE JOB, FILLING IN AND CREATING A FULL EYEBROW, WITH LITTLE TO NO FUSS.</li>
            <li>From high end to low</li>
            <li>it seems a little light so maybe I&#x27;d go with a darker color next time, depends on your preference.</li>
            <li>A little more reddish than I expected.</li>
            <li>Decided to try something new, and definitely did not regret it.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I&#x27;m not super picky since I don&#x27;t fill in my brows too often, but I definitely prefer this little kit to any of the pencils or &amp;#34;creamy&amp;#34; fillers I&#x27;ve used.</li>

            <li> I also love the gadgets that come with the compact even if they are really small and hard to use.</li>
            <li> One set goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little more expensive</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian, so I have black hair and.</li>
            <li> And come in a little package smaller than the palm of my hand!</li>
            <li> Having trouble finding it locally.</li>
            <li> a little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> I find no difference other than shade.</li>
            <li> It was too dark for me</li>
            <li> but I am dark complected</li>
            <li> I have naturally dark brown hair and normal/light brown eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I chose Medium for my dark blond colored brows</li>
            <li> This is the pencil I used before this product: NYX Auto Eyebrow Pencil, Black (http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B002S8PU02)--</li>
            <li> Add a little cream for pouring consistency.</li>
            <li> It has everything you need in one little kit.</li>
            <li> I would recommend buying it to anyone who is missing a few hairs in their brows.</li>

            <li> My hair is dark brown but these matched perfectly.</li>
            <li> It was too dark for me but I am dark complected so I&#x27;m not sure why but I cannot use it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brow kits for a few years,great to just throw in make up bag and go,I think the powders have good staying power.</li>
            <li> nice nice brow kit. love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent brow tool. I&#x27;ve never used anything on my brows before, so I have nothing to compare it to. I like the different tools. The brushes are cute, the highlighter works well under my brow. The darker color matches well, but I don&#x27;t feel it looks as natural as I would like.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this eyebrow product. I have used many, a lot of Clinique, some gels. This is as good as the clnique, maybe even better and the price is fair. Will repurchase.</li>
            <li> Great for eyebrow touch ups!</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot. The colors are easy to blend and are surprisingly perfect for my medium brown hair. I love that it comes with tiny tweezers and application brush. The only thing keeping me from LOVING this product is that I wish that it had eyebrow wax included (holds your eyebrow hairs in place/seals the powder). I just use a separate stick of wax but it would be great to have it already in the little palette. I only use it once a day but if you want your brows to really pop all day, you might need to re-apply.</li>
            <li> This is one of the easiest eyebrow fix kits I&#x27;ve used. The simplistic process has made this my go to eyebrow fix kit. I use it daily, and it lasts all day!</li>
            <li> I love this kit. I went from using just a pencil to this. I think the best part of it is the brush that comes with it. This is the pencil I used before this product: NYX Auto Eyebrow Pencil, Black (http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B002S8PU02)-- so that&#x27;s what I have to compare it to. I&#x27;m Asian, so I have black hair and. it seems a little light so maybe I&#x27;d go with a darker color next time, depends on your preference. Also the back of the kit shows you where to apply the hi lite and brow color, which is a nice guide.  Updated: I started to use this and an eye brow pencil which I think it the best combination. This product is similar to eye shadow but I still think the angle brush that comes with it is amazing. It gives a softer look than using just a pencil.</li>
            <li> Colors are ok. The tweezers are hard to use and the brush is not pleasant. I use my MAC with it instead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using the same brow powder for years - love this.  Followed advice of using highlighter, lighter powder at head of brow, darker at arch end, and the brushes stand right up and there is a mirror under them.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Like this product! I can easily blend the colors and the highlight is nice and smooth!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS, RE-REVIEWED AS I LEARNED HOW TO USE IT :)</li>
            <li> The product is great, easy to apply and lasts all day.  No touchups needed.  Brows have a natural look unlike a drawn on look as with a pencil.The only problem I had was the bar code was attached to the instructions on how to apply so I had to figure it out for myself.</li>
            <li> This  is not the color that it is displaying. It is actually lighter and you can not return  the product so think about it.</li>
            <li> My favorite daily eyebrow material - I have lost a lot of eyebrow as I have gotten older.  This fills in nicely and looks natural.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product.  It is the perfect color for me.  I give it a four because of the very tiny brushes and such.  Not that easy to use these tiny things but you do get better at it with time.</li>
            <li> I love this kit, just wish there wasn&#x27;t shimmer. But overall great</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product! Having trouble finding it locally.</li>
            <li> Shades are suitable for medium to dark coloured brows. Hi-lite shade is really a nice touch for the under brows. One set goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Great melted and poured over hot popcorn. Add a little cream for pouring consistency. Salty and sweet are wonderful together.</li>
            <li> I have naturally dark brown hair and normal/light brown eyebrows. I love this stuff, I don&#x27;t leave the house without it on. I mostly just use the hi-lite and brow2 but brow1 is nice as a eyeshadow. I will definitely buy another kit when mine is close to running out!</li>
            <li> perfect!!!! love it. im a tan hispanic and this kits colors are perfect for my skina! easy to apply brush works great...love how the holder can stand up and you can insert the tools. great but and recieved it only 2 days after ordering! great sellera!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect little brow kit! I am so happy I bought this. It has everything you need in one little kit. It is perfect for any makeup bag!</li>
            <li> Very nice thank you to upscale deal</li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with this make up. a little bit goes a long way and I now get compliments on my eyebrows all the time. It lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t smudge - not even when you come out of the shower or sleep with it on! I am seriously obsessed with this stuff, I would buy it over and over again. I&#x27;ve been using the same one for a couple months now and I&#x27;m not even close to running out. DEFINITELY worth the money!</li>
            <li> Does great at filling in brows. I would recommend buying it to anyone who is missing a few hairs in their brows. It does better and looks more natural than a brow pencil.</li>
            <li> Love this product for maintaining my eyebrows neat!</li>
            <li> The best brow shadow and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I have been trying different powder brow fillers and this is about the same as others I have experimented with. From high end to low I find no difference other than shade. The annoying problem is the powder flakes onto my face when applying.  I will continue to search for the perfect brow powder.</li>
            <li> Brow Kit is so easy to work but get bigger brushes.............use the light color right under your brow and you crows lines.  the second color is great for the middle fold and then the dark brown is for the lid and even good for eye brows.  Enjoy</li>
            <li> If you want to hop on the brow trend this is the perfect palette for it. It has two great shades, perfect for filling in brows &amp; the palette is the perfect size for on-the-go! If you don&#x27;t know how to do brows, I suggest watching a YouTube tutorial video, that&#x27;s how I learned LOL. This kit also makes it easy, just follow what it says on the palette itself....they are labeled brow1, brow2 &amp; hi-light. I find that many brands don&#x27;t have natural looking shades for brows and these are just perfect! I love the tweezer too, so cute! I totally recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Favorite brow kit ever!! Decided to try something new, and definitely did not regret it.</li>
            <li> This is great for people who have light eyebrows or for people like me who don&#x27;t have enough. It&#x27;s a great filler.</li>
            <li> Very compact little package with great brushes.</li>
            <li> I love love love it :)</li>
            <li> A little more expensive but stores don&#x27;t  carry it anymore</li>
            <li> Love this. It brings tweezers that are tiny but work great a magnifying mirror a highlight shadow and 2 brow shadows. And come in a little package smaller than the palm of my hand!</li>
            <li> just love this set and the mini tools are well crafted.. great item</li>
            <li> When the item arrived it was broken.  It is powder based and the item was in two pieces.The item was not wrapped in any sort of container ,only put in the package.</li>
            <li> The colors are a little weird not natural looking.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  It looks more natural and easier to use than pencil.</li>
            <li> DOES THE JOB, FILLING IN AND CREATING A FULL EYEBROW, WITH LITTLE TO NO FUSS.</li>
            <li> Received mine 3 days after ordering and used it instantly... absolutely love it! I have dark hair and light eye brows and now they look even. Went on so nice and the brush included worked great. Will continue to purchase this product as long as its available. Took me less then a minute to do and had awesome results!</li>
            <li> This brow powder is great!  It fills in, looks natural, and most importantly, it lasts!</li>
            <li> I have medium brown hair (fair skin tone) and am pleasantly surprised by this little palette. To be honest, I&#x27;m not super picky since I don&#x27;t fill in my brows too often, but I definitely prefer this little kit to any of the pencils or &amp;#34;creamy&amp;#34; fillers I&#x27;ve used. So basically using this kit is arguably the same as using eyeshadow on your brows, but that&#x27;s exactly what I wanted. I didn&#x27;t want to change the shape of my eyebrows—just wanted to make them look a little fuller—and for that this shadow-like filler is perfect. But obviously powdery makeup (like eyeshadow and this stuff) isn&#x27;t as &amp;#34;precise&amp;#34; as cream-based makeup or brow pencils, so if you&#x27;re looking to change the shape of your eyebrows, you may want to try the latter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lightest color is intended to be a highlighter, but you can also mix it with either of the other two colors just enough that you can get the perfect shade. The tools it came with are decent as well, and I didn&#x27;t realize that you can actually flip them up to reveal an itty bitty mirror. I definitely didn&#x27;t expect the tweezers to work at all, but they&#x27;re actually not terrible for being an inch long. I mostly use the angled brush, but it comes with a little sponge brush as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this kit is perfect for my needs and was definitely $9 well spent. However, unless you like the idea of having a travel kit (which this is great for!), and you already have eyeshadow in these exact same colors, you probably don&#x27;t need this.</li>
            <li> A little more reddish than I expected. Otherwise, a great product.</li>
            <li> Well, I am surprised. I usually get Mally Bulletproof Brow pencils for my brows, this kits is better, cheaper and absolutely amazing! I chose Medium for my dark blond colored brows and I love the light then dark towards the ends of my brows theory, Mally never gives this choice. I also love the gadgets that come with the compact even if they are really small and hard to use. For travel, one would and could use them. I&#x27;ve been playing with the kit for two days, sometimes my brow color choice is perfect and other times, I&#x27;ve added too much, who knew brows could be so much work? I&#x27;ve been finding it out... I think once one gets the hang of the colors and how to blend these colors the easier it gets. I would definitely order again as the kit is perfect! Sorry Mally, my brows have found their new best friend.</li>
