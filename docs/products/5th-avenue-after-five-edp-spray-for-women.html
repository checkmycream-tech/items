            <li>Love this I got it as a gift for my mother and she felt in love with it</li>
            <li>My most favorite perfumes are by Elizabeth Arden.  </li>
            <li>Love the fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love all Fith Avenue from Elizabeth Arden.</li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>It needs to have more pizzazz to truly be astonishing.</li>
            <li>Great perfume and much cheaper than department stores.</li>
            <li>I love the smell because it&#x27;s fresh</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I enjoy fragrances that are stronger moreso, I can still value this one.</li>
            <li>And Amazon&#x27;s price is fantastic having in mind the quality of the produc</li>

            <li>Low price is nice, and one can spray it</li>
            <li>The other reviews were good .</li>
            <li>This scent is so fresh and pretty.  </li>
            <li>I received exactly the product, size and edition</li>
            <li>Thanks so very much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s somewhat comparable to my beloved Cartier Baiser Vol&amp;eacute;, just a very, very weak form of it, but it&#x27;s still unique and distinct from it, just saying.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It is reasonable in price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It would be great in a work-type environment, not strong at all, not at all overpowering, even with several sprays.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A very light fragrance that&#x27;s fresh, floral, powdery, delicate, and feminine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>expected it to be light, and it sooooo is.</li>
            <li>I ordered online, in a perfectly new condition.</li>
            <li>The first impact is too much alcohol, than white floral bouquet and at the end be powder scent that is not lasting long...</li>
