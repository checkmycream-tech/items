            <li>grandson (teen) says great stuff for your skin.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>so  clean  </li>
            <li>I thoroughly enjoy the Proactiv Deep Cleansing Wash -- it lathers up nicely</li>
            <li>Totally worth it.</li>
            <li>A good alternative to the small-sized face scrub that is more commonly used in the ProActiv line.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Renewing Cleanser for several years and I love the way my face feels.</li>
            <li>I love Proactiv Deep Cleansing Wash.  </li>
            <li>It caused a great deal of itching and dry skin when used on the rest of my body, so I&#x27;d suggest using it only on target areas.</li>
            <li>It works to keep my complexion clean and clear.  </li>
            <li>After buying the whole kit of proactive for my kids, we noticed the only really good product is the deep cleansing solution.  </li>
            <li>I noticed that I was breaking out on my neck and chest, and it was REALLY bothering me.</li>
            <li>is  very convenient, but don&#x27;t like being on the automatic delivery system</li>
            <li>So, I went straight for this product.</li>
            <li>it really helps.</li>
            <li>My face was completely clear, and then you look at my neck and decollete and there were bumps galore!</li>
            <li>My skin has almost completely cleared up!</li>
            <li>so I have to be VERY careful what I use to clean it with.</li>
            <li>completely gone or nearly gone.</li>
            <li>It worked really well on my back, but ended up drying out the rest of my body.  </li>
            <li>I am going to be 65 Years old soon and have been using this</li>
            <li>Just dab a little bit over a forming pimple, allow to dry before bed, and wake to clear or nearly clean skin!</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says it should....clears up skin, been using for about two weeks, and have far less blemishes, or breakouts.</li>
            <li>I have bought this for my sons for years, but with free amazon prime shipping I saved at least $8.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Happy with this product. Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I thoroughly enjoy the Proactiv Deep Cleansing Wash -- it lathers up nicely and if it is as great as the Renewing face Cleanser - I know I will be greatly pleased. I have been using the Renewing Cleanser for several years and I love the way my face feels. I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I noticed that I was breaking out on my neck and chest, and it was REALLY bothering me. My face was completely clear, and then you look at my neck and decollete and there were bumps galore! I assumed it was because I have long hair and I&#x27;m always pulling it down around my neck; I wore my hair pulled back for a week and still no difference. I tried spot treatments and I scrubbed in religiously in the morning and night, and still nothing! I was getting extremely frustrated and becoming self conscious. I decided to order the deep cleansing wash (set of 2? sure!) and I am so glad that I did. I have been using it for 3 weeks now and the difference is amazing! My skin has almost completely cleared up! It makes your skin feel great, I haven&#x27;t had any problems with dryness, but then again I do have more oily skin. I plan to keep using this as a staple in my beauty regime- the pump makes it so easy to use in the shower- and I used it on my face too! This cleansing wash may not work for everyone, but it&#x27;s definitely working for me!</li>
            <li> I  love  Proactive  products,  and  this  face  wash  is  great,  my  face  feels  so  clean  after  using  and  the  pump top  is  very convenient, but don&#x27;t like being on the automatic delivery system that  Proactive forces you  to  be  on,  and  hounds  you  when  you  want  to  get  off.&lt;br /&gt;Thank Amazon  once  again  for  coming  through  with  an  offer  we  can&#x27;t  refuse.</li>
            <li> I have combination oily/sensitive skin so I have to be VERY careful what I use to clean it with. Upon entering my 30&#x27;s, I noticed a few blemishes that I thought were gone forever. Wrong!!! So, I went straight for this product. It&#x27;s the Deep Cleansing Wash, and usually meant for the entire body. That&#x27;s fine with me, but I needed it for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The regular Proactiv Cleansing Wash dried out my skin within a day. This one, however, is a thick blue lotion like substance with tiny little granules that exfoliate your skin. I use it twice per day, and my skin never dries out. My blemishes stay gone and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use another over the counter product. I will be purchasing the deep cleaning mask next. It works as a great spot treatment! Just dab a little bit over a forming pimple, allow to dry before bed, and wake to clear or nearly clean skin! Perfect. If a blemish makes a sudden unwanted appearance, I use the PROACTIV MASK as a spot treatment. I dab a little on the blemish, go to bed and wake up with it completely gone or nearly gone. Yay!</li>
            <li> My kids love these products.  Do actually work!  Use with the other Proactive solutions and it seems to be something you can see the difference with.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the product I have received. Leaves a nice cooling sensation on my skin, with which I am pleased.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says it should....clears up skin, been using for about two weeks, and have far less blemishes, or breakouts. Will continue use, no adverse effects, and I have super sensitive skin, so I am very impressed. Great buy! Totally worth it.</li>
            <li> After buying the whole kit of proactive for my kids, we noticed the only really good product is the deep cleansing solution.  Using this one product helps by itself.</li>
            <li> I have bought this for my sons for years, but with free amazon prime shipping I saved at least $8.  This proactive product has no peroxide in it so it doesn&#x27;t bleach out my towels. There is always a bottle in the shower.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great we will consider ordering more soon as she runs out and as soon as we can get it gone</li>
            <li> As a result of my pregnancy, I started getting a lot of back acne.  I&#x27;ve used Proactiv in the past on my face, but never on my body.  I told a friend about my problem and she suggested this product.  It worked really well on my back, but ended up drying out the rest of my body.  Also, the bottle pump takes forever to start working!  I almost threw the pump away because I thought it didn&#x27;t work, then finally it started working.  The acne on my back has cleared up, but I only use the product on my back now.  It caused a great deal of itching and dry skin when used on the rest of my body, so I&#x27;d suggest using it only on target areas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the 3 step system for at least 10 years since I was I&#x27;m puberty, but one when I ran out I used this in my face....I actually prefer it!  Cheaper &amp; date than 3 separate treatments. Its the third time I&#x27;ve ordered it just to use as a face wash. I love it as a body wash too, leaves you feeling very clean.</li>
            <li> Easy to use pump style dispenser, plus good exfoliation.  A good alternative to the small-sized face scrub that is more commonly used in the ProActiv line.</li>
            <li> I love Proactiv Deep Cleansing Wash.  I am going to be 65 Years old soon and have been using this&lt;br /&gt;product for some time now.  It works to keep my complexion clean and clear.  If you haven&#x27;t tried it&lt;br /&gt;and you have problems with your  skin whether it is acne or age spots it really helps.</li>
            <li> grandson (teen) says great stuff for your skin. daughter uses it too. skin looks so much better. will buy again.thank you</li>
            <li> The pump on both bottles does not work.  So, you have to unscrew the pump lid and pull out some product.  Dumb.</li>
            <li> like this product wish it would get rid of my back acne for good!!! have to use all the time if u stop even once i feel like breakots pop up.. have bought several times and at this point i wish they made a gallon size... ha ha works great for me</li>
            <li> love it.  so great the size is bigger than I imagined and now I don&#x27;t have to fool with  the machines at the mall.....</li>
            <li> Use this product all the time.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Proactive Deep Cleasnsing Wash for several years.  It makes my skin feel smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> I have had this before and I love it. The only reason I did not give it five stars is because for some reason I cannot get the pump to work.</li>
            <li> Not happy. Send the product but its expired in 2 weeks.</li>
    </ol>
