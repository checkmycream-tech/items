            <li>The best clippers I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>best toe nail clippers I bought ,</li>
            <li>They look beautiful, great color schemes and metals colors.  </li>
            <li>This is a great toe nail clipper.</li>
            <li>The magnet is a nice touch but it can get in the way at times.  </li>
            <li>The nail clippers feel great and at home in a large hand.  </li>
            <li>It is a better design, but has one flaw still...</li>
            <li>Still better.</li>
            <li>These are just ok.  </li>
            <li>The rear portion of the handles contains a post with a strong magnet in it.</li>
            <li>The blades are sharp, nicely shaped, and the magnetic closure is great.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also fine for fingernail use.</li>
            <li>Overall, a great value for the price.</li>
            <li>I thought I finally found a great quality cutter.  </li>
            <li>I suppose the true, meat of the matter with nail clippers is how well they cut.  </li>
            <li>I have huge hands that love the feel of these clippers and nails that appreciate the solid approach when cut.  </li>
            <li>I found this to be well worth the money.</li>
            <li>The Premax clippers are very attractively designed, &amp; are lightweight, due to the open architecture of the design.</li>
            <li>On this premise, they do deliver a nice, clean edge on your nails--crimping the nail in such a way that they really wouldn&#x27;t need filing even if you are one to do so with your fingernails.  </li>
            <li>All in all, a great product for slightly too much money, just like a Mercedes.</li>
            <li>Love it, also bought one for my brother who has lost a few fingers and can&#x27;t hold most nail clippers.</li>
            <li>they work well and all, and the first was no doubt beautiful, but what i got is rather shoddily put together.</li>
            <li>The biggest advantage of the Premax is that it has very wide-opening jaws, which is useful for toenails.</li>
            <li>Magnet started rusting first and now the brand name (etched in two places on clipper body) is rusting too.</li>
            <li>the much touted &amp;#34;ring&amp;#34; that is to align the blades of the clipper together in what could and should, by engineered design, be near perfection has just enough play in it that if you don&#x27;t squeeze the clipper together perfectly, they won&#x27;t align perfectly--which is supposed to be the entire selling point to the whole &amp;#34;ring-lock&amp;#34; deal.  </li>
            <li>It looked cool and arrived quickly, but the magnetic feature on the back keeps this from being a useful product.  </li>
            <li>First &amp; foremost, it works very well.</li>
            <li>Bought these clippers to keep in the shower, thinking that they wouldn&#x27;t rust because they supposedly  were stainless steel.</li>
            <li>In addition, the rivets that hold this clipper together are smashed down--a product of too much force.  </li>
            <li>Work very well.</li>
            <li>All in all, a unique and sound design, but rather poorly executed in fit and finish.</li>
            <li>Opens wide and clips easily.</li>
            <li>They are easier to use than normal clippers though because the pieces you squeeze on are more parallel (some traditional nail clippers can be like 45 degrees</li>
            <li>Sharp and easy to use on toenails and fingernails.</li>
            <li>To release the handles, push the post to the left or right</li>
            <li>When the handles are pressed together, they stay tightly shut due to the magnet (this is a magnet that really works, unlike many that aren&#x27;t strong enough to do the job).</li>
            <li>The new design has a magnet that does not pivot as pictured.  </li>
            <li>They cut very, but not extremely, well.  </li>
            <li>It even does a great job on especially thick toenails.</li>
            <li>Premax claims to use a unique closure angle that results in better cutting, which I believe, based on the results.</li>
            <li>After a short time they&#x27;ve gotten some play in them and don&#x27;t cut as well as they did new.  </li>
            <li>I have tried numerous nail clippers over the past 30 years and this is the first one that really works well.  </li>
            <li>Also, they don&#x27;t seem to get a good &#x27;closure&#x27; when cutting.  </li>
            <li>The most disappointing thing is the magnetic closure in the rear of the clippers, it&#x27;s pivot point is a rivet which has been smashed and so swiveling it out of the way to ready the clipper for use</li>

            <li> The nail clippers feel great and at home in a large hand.  They are solid yet lightweight as a high-quality metal should feel.  They cut very, but not extremely, well.  They look beautiful, great color schemes and metals colors.  The magnet is a nice touch but it can get in the way at times.  Turning the &#x27;ring-lock&#x27; scars the metal that I was just bragging about and the magnet does the same.    I have huge hands that love the feel of these clippers and nails that appreciate the solid approach when cut.  All in all, a great product for slightly too much money, just like a Mercedes.</li>
            <li> Purchased it for my husband last year and he gave it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This nail clipper has a lot going for it. First &amp; foremost, it works very well. The blades are quite sharp, but not as sharp as more expensive Dovo or Pfeilring clippers, but almost on a par with Rubis (which is also more expensive). The biggest advantage of the Premax is that it has very wide-opening jaws, which is useful for toenails. It even does a great job on especially thick toenails. I don&#x27;t know of any other clipper that handles toenails as well, including the plier-type clippers that podiatrists use. Premax claims to use a unique closure angle that results in better cutting, which I believe, based on the results. They&#x27;re also fine for fingernail use. The rear portion of the handles contains a post with a strong magnet in it. When the handles are pressed together, they stay tightly shut due to the magnet (this is a magnet that really works, unlike many that aren&#x27;t strong enough to do the job). To release the handles, push the post to the left or right (it moves with a circular motion). The Premax clippers are very attractively designed, &amp; are lightweight, due to the open architecture of the design. My only concern is how well they&#x27;ll keep their sharpness. Overall, a great value for the price.</li>
            <li> Bought these clippers to keep in the shower, thinking that they wouldn&#x27;t rust because they supposedly  were stainless steel. Magnet started rusting first and now the brand name (etched in two places on clipper body) is rusting too. If only the magnet was rusting I would just take it off, but rusting on these \\&quot;stainless steel\\&quot; clippers logo makes these useless for keeping in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addendum to my initial review--Item did rust a little but still performing well.  Keep them in a canister in the shower where they would not leave a stain.</li>
            <li> This is a great toe nail clipper. I have problems with thick toenails and this does the job! The magnetic locking system is a pain...it gets in the way and keeps locking the clipper while you&#x27;re using it. I will cut it off.</li>
            <li> Although I like the wide opening jaws, I don&#x27;t like the pivoting magnet at the rear which holds the clippers closed for storage. It gets in the way preventing the cutters from closing all the way when it accidentally pivots back around. Also, if you have thick tough nails, the cutting lever has some bend to it which is not at all helpful. I have at times had to use both hands to squeeze cutters closed on tough nails. That shouldn&#x27;t be necessary either.</li>
            <li> The best clippers I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> best toe nail clippers I bought ,But Becareful when you cut very sharp!!!</li>
            <li> I thought I finally found a great quality cutter.  It looked cool and arrived quickly, but the magnetic feature on the back keeps this from being a useful product.  Also, they don&#x27;t seem to get a good &#x27;closure&#x27; when cutting.  I&#x27;m back to using my drug store dollar clippers and these are sitting in a drawer.</li>
            <li> Design has been redone, but I ordered from Boker, so not sure what you might get here (just an FYI).  The new design has a magnet that does not pivot as pictured.  It is a better design, but has one flaw still... The new magnet is adhered to body, but glue is not strong enough to hold it and can fail.  I ordered several as gifts, and one or two the magnet was loose.  I applied contact cement to strengthen magnet, but will probably fail long term.  Still better.</li>
            <li> I suppose the true, meat of the matter with nail clippers is how well they cut.  On this premise, they do deliver a nice, clean edge on your nails--crimping the nail in such a way that they really wouldn&#x27;t need filing even if you are one to do so with your fingernails.  I was a little disappointed with the fit and finish of these ultra expensive nail clippers though.  There is some deep pitting on mine, evidence of some shoddy forging.  In addition, the rivets that hold this clipper together are smashed down--a product of too much force.  The most disappointing thing is the magnetic closure in the rear of the clippers, it&#x27;s pivot point is a rivet which has been smashed and so swiveling it out of the way to ready the clipper for use is tough and involves grinding a groove into the clipper due to it being out of alignment.  Lastly. the much touted &amp;#34;ring&amp;#34; that is to align the blades of the clipper together in what could and should, by engineered design, be near perfection has just enough play in it that if you don&#x27;t squeeze the clipper together perfectly, they won&#x27;t align perfectly--which is supposed to be the entire selling point to the whole &amp;#34;ring-lock&amp;#34; deal.  All in all, a unique and sound design, but rather poorly executed in fit and finish.</li>
            <li> Sharp and easy to use on toenails and fingernails. Opens wide and clips easily. I found this to be well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Love it, also bought one for my brother who has lost a few fingers and can&#x27;t hold most nail clippers.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous nail clippers over the past 30 years and this is the first one that really works well.  The blades are sharp, nicely shaped, and the magnetic closure is great.  When you use the clippers you need to move the magnetic closure to the back of the clipper.</li>
            <li> they work well and all, and the first was no doubt beautiful, but what i got is rather shoddily put together.</li>
            <li> These are just ok.  After a short time they&#x27;ve gotten some play in them and don&#x27;t cut as well as they did new.  They are easier to use than normal clippers though because the pieces you squeeze on are more parallel (some traditional nail clippers can be like 45 degrees and it&#x27;s hard to squeeze without moving.)</li>
            <li> Work very well. Bigger than I thought.</li>
            <li> Not much to say, but it just demages youe nails. Terrible!!!</li>
