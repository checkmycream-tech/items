            <li>It burns and itches and it is nothing like Odaban that works so much better than this..</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li>If you use it like the instructions tell you, then you will be sweat free!</li>
            <li>Your body needs to sweat to be healthy.</li>
            <li>NOT anymore :)</li>
            <li>I keep touching them just to be sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would have gladly put up with some inital discomfort for theswe results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It sure beats getting deodorant stains on clothes or having damp armpits.</li>
            <li>I said its ok its just the lid</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!!!</li>
            <li>Just better than most products available in the States...</li>
            <li>It works very good and the transpiration in the area you applies it simply disappear.</li>
            <li>It is a powerful reliably antiperspirant with nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>but I strongly urge you never to use on all three areas.</li>
            <li>Ideal for that special occasions when you do not want to sweat in public.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it it was excellent but 2nd use didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>You will feel more confident after using this product and will notice the change after the first use.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, product works, can&#x27;t get better than that!</li>
            <li>Also, it is important to use it sparingly.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;- highly effective &#x3D; zero sweating for 3 whole days for me&lt;br</li>
            <li>My wife says it&#x27;s working good so far.</li>
            <li>The product is very powerful, and does what it promises.</li>
            <li>a bit of work but worth it... lay on teh bed for 20 seconds arms overhead to ensure it dries well...and voila!</li>
            <li>hear about your product and is true work</li>
            <li>Works better than most long time deodorants...</li>
            <li>recommend the product and this shop as many times and bought it for me the product arrived very well thanks</li>
            <li>IT WILL BE WORTH</li>
            <li>It works very well, Really!!!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe after all these years worried about my sweating problem, and all the things that i used on me and didn&#x27;t work and finally found this amazing product, It really works, you have to use as directed.</li>
            <li>I used it exactly as recommended and still experienced excessive sweating.</li>
            <li>you suffer from hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating), this might be very effective for you.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>shower, get dressed in a nice blouse etc and have wet stains on our shirt from no exertion.  </li>
            <li>but I tried it first.</li>
            <li>It was a bit itchy the first time I applied it</li>
            <li>I put it on the first night and it worked well, but my sweat is when I&#x27;m nervous</li>
            <li>Do not apply after a waxing session or shaving or any other kind of hair removal.</li>
            <li>I am a woman and seem to sweat more than my girlfriends, even just going about my day, without any particular physical exertion.</li>
            <li>,.... you don&#x27;t use it after a shower ...  what I found works well is to put it on at night just before bed... making sure my armpits were dry and using a hair dryer if required..</li>
            <li>Certainly it will help you with excesive transpiration issues.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I could not find certain dri in my area (montreal, canada)</li>
            <li>(I guess since I do sweat a lot, sweating less absolutely feels amazing already).</li>
            <li>Applying to the hands and feet is fine OR to the back</li>
            <li>If your like me,and REALLY want results,go with Certain Dri.</li>
            <li>She said that maybe I&#x27;m using to much, so I&#x27;m gonna try it again tonight and see how it goes.</li>
            <li>I should have stop by now, but i do want this to work as i sweat tooo much.</li>
            <li>This works really well if you stick to the instructions.</li>
            <li>And I will tell you that it really delivers results.</li>
            <li>I struggle my whole life with sweaty arm pits.</li>
            <li>very compact.</li>
            <li>I really recommend it.</li>
            <li>I must admit that I don&#x27;t normally sweat a lot, but it&#x27;s been an extremely hot summer</li>
            <li>I was really hoping this would be it.</li>
            <li>It sucks, it isn&#x27;t fair..</li>
            <li>I normally use certain dri roll on.</li>
            <li>It didnt last 1 full day.</li>
            <li>Highly revommended</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m actually on my way out right now to buy some new tops and blouses thanks to perspirex, I&#x27;m not even joking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not to mention that it came in an extremely small bottle,and cost 4x more than certain dri.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Underarms must be clean and dry and unbroken.</li>
            <li>Seller was great, but unfortunately the product did not work well for me.</li>
            <li>Just make sure your underarms are completely dry, then roll on, like you would a regular deodorant.</li>
            <li>It was ruining my shirts to the point where I&#x27;d buy many cheap ones so as not to ruin the expensive ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I began using this last summer because I noticed I sweat a lot more than other people.</li>
            <li>Perspirex is definitely worth the minor investment.</li>
            <li>did not experience any of the stinging that some users report when using products such as perspirex or certain dri etc .</li>
            <li>Your body needs to sweat, do not apply to your back and feet and underarms, that&#x27;s too much skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months and haven&#x27;t noticed any side effects so far.</li>
            <li>Im so busy thats why i didnt say anything or do anyhing about it.</li>
            <li>No regrets!!!</li>
            <li>My older sister had tried Drysol, a similar product.</li>
            <li>Unbelievable results asap and super affordable!  </li>
            <li>I sweat a lot, so this product has really helped me to keep dry.</li>
            <li>Tried several different over-the-counter anti-perspirants - this is one that really worked.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They would barely be sweating</li>
            <li>It is important to let the product dry completely, I usually use a fan to expedite this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Underarms must be washed with soap and water when you wake up.</li>
            <li>I was dry the whole day but other parts of my body compensates for the sweat.</li>
            <li>but it really does work (at least so far).</li>

            <li> Does the job well, nothing extraordinary (like little pit gnomes who scurry down with blotters to soak up glistening pit sweat).  </li>
            <li> , let me tell you, it&#x27;s only my second day using the product (applied at nights as the outlines say) and my underarms, despite the midsummer heat, are completely dry.</li>
            <li> I didnt realize that if you use certain dri while still wet from a shower,it burns a little.</li>
            <li> So only use it dry.</li>
            <li> only need use it about twice a week - my underarms are completely dry!</li>
            <li> After trying all kinds of overly priced American products, this European little thing actually does what is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I travel a lot and on long flights ...</li>
            <li> I tried this product thinking all I had to loose was a little money; but then  wow; it totaly works for me!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It keep you dry for a long time.</li>
            <li> She recommended the product and when i got it i was really excited about it, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> This product must be applied to dry armpits.</li>
            <li> dry pits for days...</li>
            <li> IF you don&#x27;t have dry arm pits when you apply...it will sting...</li>
            <li> No sweat is released, your underarms remain dry thus no odor.</li>
            <li> It does dry out your skin: it&#x27;ll feel itchy, but bearable.</li>
            <li> Saturday I stayed dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 30 years old and ever since I was a teenaged girl, I&#x27;ve suffered from excessive under arm sweating, not oder, just WETNESS.</li>
            <li> Your shirts will be dry where they would normally be wet.</li>
            <li> This product really works, I was skeptical initially, but after a couple of time use, it made the trick.</li>
            <li> The next few weeks, I think my body got accustomed to it</li>
            <li> Didnt work for me after using it everyday prior to going to bed.</li>
            <li> only have to use it every 4 days and no more wet armpits</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t use any other deodorant/anti-perspirant at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> product is not for average people, it is freedom for people with an extreme condition of overactive sweat glands.</li>
            <li> Obviously that doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t happen but just to let people know it doesnt happen to everybody.</li>
            <li> (some find it has a slightly chemical odor)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Product has a slight alcohol smell that goes away within 15 minutes of applying</li>
            <li> But it burns a little.</li>
            <li> and after a little research I chose Perspirex over Drysol hoping maybe it would help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> I received it in mail on Friday and used it that night it burns a little</li>
            <li> I felt a little moist under my arms</li>
            <li> But this is temporary which is why it lasts no longer than a few days.</li>
            <li> The point is to apply it when your sweat glands will be the least active.</li>
            <li> Aside from being embaressing, it&#x27;s forced me into wardrobe basically entirely of black, even during summer months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually apply before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> but my shirt wasn&#x27;t soaked like usually.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever waxed or sugared your underarms, you&#x27;re less likely to have a bad reaction because your underarms are less sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are afraid to lift your arms up in public because of sweat stains.. this is the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received the product with a broken lid....</li>
            <li> sadly, some of us get up,</li>
            <li> Look no more, give it a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> and I hate sweating PERIOD.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The first time I used it it was excellent but 2nd use didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> So why am I diving it 4 stars? Because I have a relative who uses the product and it works wonders for her. She recommended the product and when i got it i was really excited about it, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for me. I try 3 more times and all of them didn&#x27;t work, one of those times it burn my skin. She said that maybe I&#x27;m using to much, so I&#x27;m gonna try it again tonight and see how it goes. I should have stop by now, but i do want this to work as i sweat tooo much.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works! It reduces both sweating &amp; odour. The best deodorant I have ever used. (Remember to read the instructions.)</li>
            <li> This product is really amazing! It works very good and the transpiration in the area you applies it simply disappear.</li>
            <li> love this item. very effective. would definitely recommend to friends. hope to see this item in local grocery stores in the US.</li>
            <li> If you are afraid to lift your arms up in public because of sweat stains.. this is the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people sweat more than others.. I am not talking about the folks who go out for a run and come back sweaty... sadly, some of us get up, shower, get dressed in a nice blouse etc and have wet stains on our shirt from no exertion.  It sucks, it isn&#x27;t fair.. blah blah.. get over it.. and get this antiperspirant!! If you have let sweat drive your clothing choices etc..or walk around at work with TP stuck in under your shirt... it is time to be free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This deodorant is about $20 on a drugstore shelf.. and I would pay $50...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;sweat management\\&quot; requires a bit of effort...here is why....  This product must be applied to dry armpits. So.,.... you don&#x27;t use it after a shower ...  what I found works well is to put it on at night just before bed... making sure my armpits were dry and using a hair dryer if required.. a bit of work but worth it... lay on teh bed for 20 seconds arms overhead to ensure it dries well...and voila! dry pits for days...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2-3 times a week is plenty.... IF you don&#x27;t have dry arm pits when you apply...it will sting...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is not for average people, it is freedom for people with an extreme condition of overactive sweat glands.</li>
            <li> This is just what i need it, price wise is a cheap and came to my house just on time.</li>
            <li> Does the job well, nothing extraordinary (like little pit gnomes who scurry down with blotters to soak up glistening pit sweat).  Just better than most products available in the States...</li>
            <li> They claim it works for 3-5 days.It didnt last 1 full day.Very disappointed.I normally use certain dri roll on.But it burns a little.I didnt realize that if you use certain dri while still wet from a shower,it burns a little.So only use it dry.This Perspirex doesnt work at all for me.Not to mention that it came in an extremely small bottle,and cost 4x more than certain dri.If your like me,and REALLY want results,go with Certain Dri.</li>
            <li> I am really satisfied with this product, for many years  I suffered with sweat in excess , but now my problems are over, I can wear any clothing that I feel safe, I generally use 2 x week and works great!!!! perspirex is wonderful</li>
            <li> This works really well if you stick to the instructions.</li>
            <li> LOVE. No sweat, no hassle.</li>
            <li> recommend the product and this shop as many times and bought it for me the product arrived very well thanks</li>
            <li> This is the best antiperspirant ever!!! I bought this as a suggestion of a friend and I am really happy with the results. Certainly it will help you with excesive transpiration issues. You will feel more confident after using this product and will notice the change after the first use. Recommend it 100%. If needed would buy it again and again. No regrets!!!</li>
            <li> I tried this product thinking all I had to loose was a little money; but then  wow; it totaly works for me!&lt;br /&gt;I only have to use it every 4 days and no more wet armpits</li>
            <li> Works better than most long time deodorants...I travel a lot and on long flights ...it&#x27;s nice to have something that works so you don&#x27;t smell like you have been up 24 hours....pricey, but works!</li>
            <li> It burns and itches and it is nothing like Odaban that works so much better than this..it is tiny too.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s great; I like the effective result it gives.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to friends and family; It is very good!</li>
            <li> Very good seller. Highly revommended</li>
            <li> My daughter said it was wonderful and it works great. Will buy again in the future. Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. If you use it like the instructions tell you, then you will be sweat free!</li>
            <li> Visibly reduced my underarm pit sweat. This product really works, I was skeptical initially, but after a couple of time use, it made the trick.</li>
            <li> My first week of using it, I was very impressed. I was dry the whole day but other parts of my body compensates for the sweat. The next few weeks, I think my body got accustomed to it and I started to sweat again, lesser of course.  I can see this product as a must have if you have something big like a presentation or a function.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for quite some time. And I will tell you that it really delivers results. After trying all kinds of overly priced American products, this European little thing actually does what is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe after all these years worried about my sweating problem, and all the things that i used on me and didn&#x27;t work and finally found this amazing product, It really works, you have to use as directed. I&#x27;m very happy with it and now i can use any kind of clothes with confidence. Highly recommend!!!!!</li>
            <li> If you are dealing with hyperhydrosis, this is definitely the product for you. I have tried others, but none work as well as this product. Look no more, give it a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> thank you perspirex roll I am happy with the result is workin good for me .I hear about your product and is true work</li>
            <li> My older sister had tried Drysol, a similar product. She said it darkened her underarms. I told her about Perspirex but I tried it first. It was a bit itchy the first time I applied it but I did not experience any burning sensation. My sister did and it lasted for several hours. If you&#x27;ve ever waxed or sugared your underarms, you&#x27;re less likely to have a bad reaction because your underarms are less sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applying Perspirex anti-perspirant before going to bed is not a suggestion. The point is to apply it when your sweat glands will be the least active. Applying this during the day will only result in itching/burning/discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Underarms must be clean and dry and unbroken. Do not apply after a waxing session or shaving or any other kind of hair removal. They recommend 48 hours, I think 72 hours is safer. Also, it is important to use it sparingly. It&#x27;s a bit sticky so over-applying will also result in discomfort and possible stinging/itching. It is important to let the product dry completely, I usually use a fan to expedite this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Underarms must be washed with soap and water when you wake up. Perspirex works by the aluminium chloride reacting with the water from the sweat gland to form a plug, blocking the sweat from being released. No sweat is released, your underarms remain dry thus no odor. Your shirts will be dry where they would normally be wet. But this is temporary which is why it lasts no longer than a few days. I need to reapply every 3-4 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you suffer from hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating), this might be very effective for you. I began using this last summer because I noticed I sweat a lot more than other people. They would barely be sweating but my shirt would be quite damp. It was ruining my shirts to the point where I&#x27;d buy many cheap ones so as not to ruin the expensive ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- it&#x27;s odorless to me (some find it has a slightly chemical odor)&lt;br /&gt;- it won&#x27;t stain clothing&lt;br /&gt;- a little goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;- highly effective &#x3D; zero sweating for 3 whole days for me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Please do not abuse this product. Your body needs to sweat, do not apply to your back and feet and underarms, that&#x27;s too much skin. Your body needs to sweat to be healthy. Applying to the hands and feet is fine OR to the back but I strongly urge you never to use on all three areas.</li>
            <li> I use it once a week and underarm perspiration greatly reduced. If used every night it would stop almost all sweat</li>
            <li> Works great! Unbelievable results asap and super affordable!  I&#x27;m very pleased</li>
            <li> This product actually does what it claims to do: eliminate perspiration. I am a woman and seem to sweat more than my girlfriends, even just going about my day, without any particular physical exertion. I was struggling with underarm sweat stains. Tried several different over-the-counter anti-perspirants - this is one that really worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really simple to use. I usually apply before I go to bed. Just make sure your underarms are completely dry, then roll on, like you would a regular deodorant. Give it a minute to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months and haven&#x27;t noticed any side effects so far. It does dry out your skin: it&#x27;ll feel itchy, but bearable. Product has a slight alcohol smell that goes away within 15 minutes of applying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only need use it about twice a week - my underarms are completely dry! Now I don&#x27;t use any other deodorant/anti-perspirant at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very impressed with this product!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! It works very well, Really!!! I can&#x27;t believe it. It&#x27;s changed my life, now I can wear every color and stop worring me about stains!!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s perfect!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing product! This thing works great. I struggle my whole life with sweaty arm pits. NOT anymore :)</li>
            <li> My wife says it&#x27;s working good so far. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I put it on the first night and it worked well, but my sweat is when I&#x27;m nervous and I guess it couldn&#x27;t handle my sweat Becuase I still was sweating. However, it definitely does lessen the sweat.</li>
            <li> Best deodorant out there.One application lasts 3-5 days depending on the weather.Convenient ,compact,compact compact .Very  very compact.Can&#x27;t go wrong.Thats it!!</li>
            <li> It is a powerful reliably antiperspirant with nice fragrance. I am so satisfied and recommend it as a good product in its field</li>
            <li> I sweat a lot, so this product has really helped me to keep dry. My dermatologist recommended it to me and I am happy with it. I really recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 30 years old and ever since I was a teenaged girl, I&#x27;ve suffered from excessive under arm sweating, not oder, just WETNESS. Aside from being embaressing, it&#x27;s forced me into wardrobe basically entirely of black, even during summer months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not find certain dri in my area (montreal, canada) and after a little research I chose Perspirex over Drysol hoping maybe it would help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, let me tell you, it&#x27;s only my second day using the product (applied at nights as the outlines say) and my underarms, despite the midsummer heat, are completely dry. I cannnot believe it. I keep touching them just to be sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not experience any of the stinging that some users report when using products such as perspirex or certain dri etc . Obviously that doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t happen but just to let people know it doesnt happen to everybody. Still, given the results of this product, DONT let that stop you from trying it. IT WILL BE WORTH IT I PROMISE. I would have gladly put up with some inital discomfort for theswe results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m actually on my way out right now to buy some new tops and blouses thanks to perspirex, I&#x27;m not even joking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t find it sooner.</li>
            <li> I must admit that I don&#x27;t normally sweat a lot, but it&#x27;s been an extremely hot summer and I hate sweating PERIOD. A close friend of mine suggested Perspirex and I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot. I applied it twice a week at bed time and did NOT sweat at all. Now I use it once a week at bedtime and I have no issues. It sure beats getting deodorant stains on clothes or having damp armpits. Perspirex is definitely worth the minor investment.</li>
            <li> The product is very powerful, and does what it promises. One application will last for 2 / 3 day. Highly recommended. Also, the shipment was timely.</li>
            <li> As i remember i didnt used the said product because of some defect. I received the product with a broken lid....I said its ok its just the lid i can still use it but the problem is i couldnt even open the said product. Im so busy thats why i didnt say anything or do anyhing about it. since u ask me about the product then. Maybe this is the perfect time for me to say something.....</li>
            <li> Didnt work for me after using it everyday prior to going to bed. Just irritated my skin. I was really hoping this would be it. Have to keep looking.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for a smelly sweating.</li>
            <li> Ideal for that special occasions when you do not want to sweat in public. It keep you dry for a long time.</li>
            <li> I did reduce my arm wetness to the minimum (I guess since I do sweat a lot, sweating less absolutely feels amazing already). Fast shipping, product works, can&#x27;t get better than that!</li>
            <li> this product is amazing it&#x27;s helping  me a lot im so happy from the day i started to used .</li>
            <li> I received it in mail on Friday and used it that night it burns a little but it really does work (at least so far). Saturday I stayed dry I felt a little moist under my arms but my shirt wasn&#x27;t soaked like usually.</li>
            <li> Seller was great, but unfortunately the product did not work well for me. I used it exactly as recommended and still experienced excessive sweating.</li>
