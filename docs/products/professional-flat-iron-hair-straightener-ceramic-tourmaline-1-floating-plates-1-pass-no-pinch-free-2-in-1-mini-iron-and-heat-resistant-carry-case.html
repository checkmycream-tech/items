            <li>You gotta love that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been straightening my hair for many years.</li>
            <li>I am glad I purchased this</li>

            <li>If you don&#x27;t have hair like mine, you shouldn&#x27;t be concerned about cranking up the dial to get a better result.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot more aesthically pleasing then</li>
            <li>Flat iron works superb.</li>

            <li>I am impressed so far, let play with it on a few more clients, but I think I am falling in love with my toy. :D</li>
            <li>I can pretty much be a spokesperson for this iron, one of my best purchases of the year.</li>
            <li>Heats up veeeeery quick and stays warm.</li>
            <li>It is nice to know that there is a company out there that totally backs their product and goes out of their way to make their customers happy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s beautiful, professional, lightweight and really easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The second thing that was great is the short cord which is perfect for at home use.</li>
            <li>I have had lots of different straightening irons, but this is by far the best, not to mention a good value.  </li>
            <li>They have good even heat and handle very well.  </li>
            <li>I enjoyed using it, it was smooth and easy.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed using it, it was smooth and went through the hair easily.</li>
            <li>Light, easy to maneuver and works like magic.</li>
            <li>Very good straightener for the price especially with the free travel straightener and carry case.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really want to but another one because this flatiron is the best I have had thus far..</li>
            <li>Easy grip handle and heats up in seconds.</li>
            <li>I have used Chi flat irons and titanium straightners all my life and 6 Sense is superior to them both!  </li>
            <li>This iron is well made, light and just all around easy to use.</li>
            <li>So smooth and easy to use.</li>
            <li>This iron is so easy to use, works great, &amp; heats instantly.</li>
            <li>It was love at first sight!</li>
            <li>The mini-straightener looks like a 6th grade project made with a cheap plastic mold.  </li>
            <li>and it makes my hair feel really smooth.  </li>
            <li>smooth gliding.  </li>
            <li>the boxes/heat resistant carrying case are thoughtful additions.</li>
            <li>Have used Infrashine and GHD, but this is far superior.</li>
            <li>She has beautiful long curly hair.  </li>
            <li>First off, I&#x27;d like to mention that I have very fine hair.</li>
            <li>In North America to smooth straight style that lasts!!!</li>
            <li>If the buttons were on the top of the straightener right below the temperature display, or was placed inside, below the plates like the herstyler does</li>
            <li>I have high hopes for keeping this iron for many years to come !.</li>
            <li>This hair straightener (Sixth Sense FH-1 Flat Iron Hair Styler ) is great.</li>
            <li>Great working flat iron for both straightening and curling!</li>
            <li>This is a GREAT Flat Iron!!  </li>
            <li>I had originally came online to purchase a ghd straighter.</li>
            <li>Friendly customer service.</li>
            <li>Not disappointed in this one at all.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend to any one to purchase this great flat iron and to purchase anything from this company!!!!</li>
            <li>flat iron has a good adjustable heating range and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>I am glad I get to read the reviews from fellow reviewers (positive and negatives).</li>
            <li>The additional small iron and travel bag are a very nice bonus!</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t really do a nice curl with too many flat irons.</li>
            <li>I saw that the company gives excellent exchange ...there was a complimentary carry bag as well as a small, travel iron which fits into ones</li>
            <li>So far its been really nice</li>
            <li>It also makes my hair really straight and is easy to use, glides smoothly through hair without tugging on it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it is a good flat iron for the price.  </li>
            <li>I enjoyed my new iron!</li>
            <li>The straighter does leave your hair looking shiny, heats up quickly and doesn&#x27;t pull your hair.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>I carry it in my purse for quick touch ups.</li>
            <li>I choose the main iron specifically because tourmaline plates are better for the hair.</li>
            <li>ThIs is actually the best flat iron I have ever used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But the absolute best part is that I can straighten my hair with ONE SLOW, GENTLE STROKE, leaving my hair shiny and looking healthy.</li>
            <li>I love my new flatiron</li>
            <li>Bought this item mainly due to the good ratings and was quite excited when I got it....</li>
            <li>/&gt;I tested out the “curl your hair with a flat iron technique” as well, and this flat iron worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>First class business!</li>
            <li>Problem was, she wanted it straight!!  </li>
            <li>This flat iron is light weight, easy to use and feels comfortable in my hands.</li>
            <li>She has very curly hair and this straightener works fabulous on her hair.</li>
            <li>I am now completely spoiled after using this one and had to throw my old one out, even though it is still in good working condition.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>yeah, I would recommend this flat iron very much!! :)</li>
            <li>I have owned a number of flat irons and this one is by far the highest quality one I have personally experienced.  </li>
            <li>My first order did not arrive (stolen?), and the seller quickly sent a replacement before I had to travel.  </li>
            <li>I have the kind of hair cut where I have to flat iron it after every wash.</li>
            <li>AK Professionals sent me an email asking me if I received the flat iron and how I liked it.  </li>
            <li>I can use this one perhaps 1-2 times and get a satisfactory result when the heat isn&#x27;t all full potential (I don&#x27;t use full heat because of my fragile hair, I&#x27;m sure result would be better for those with hair who could tolerate it).  </li>
            <li>The actual flat iron is great.  </li>
            <li>It heats up just as fast and is hot!</li>
            <li>I wish the smaller one was of better quality and had a carry case.</li>
            <li>I plugged it up in the morning and the flatiron never got HOT</li>
            <li>The first thing that stood out to me was how the iron made my hair look and feel.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>The case also works as a pad to set the hot iron on while doing your hair.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t receive my first one ordered</li>
            <li>I think anyone who has normal/thicker hair won&#x27;t run into many of the same problems.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, if you’re looking for a nice flat iron to invest in, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The box is gorgeous and chic, and I loved that it has a magnetic closing.&lt;br /&gt;The little flat iron that comes with it for free is really cute and quite useful to just have in the purse for any needed fixings during the day without making my purse extra heavy or full.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recently replaced my old with this one and this is MUCH better!  </li>
            <li>Was a little more money than I originally wanted to spend but after experiencing the unit, I&#x27;m glad I paid the extra for it.  </li>
            <li>Love the styling results of this flat iron.</li>
            <li>I love these flat irons!  </li>
            <li>Love this flat iron!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m frequently on the go, traveling, so being able to quickly pocket a hot flat iron</li>
            <li>Straightens my dry frizzy hair pretty well, love it.</li>
            <li>It gets really hot, really fast.</li>
            <li>I received this in the mail quickly, shipped directly from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, especially for someone who has never owned one.</li>
            <li>The case doesn&#x27;t need to be as large as it is, but if space isn&#x27;t an issue for you then you won&#x27;t be bothered by it.  </li>
            <li>It heats up quickly, effortlessly glides through my hair, and rarely do I have to use a second pass to get my hair straight.</li>
            <li>The case having a thermal protection layer so that I can put the flat iron away before it even cools down is a great feature.</li>
            <li>And the handy heat case makes it safer to use with my little ones around, and to take on my carry on while I travel.</li>
            <li>The plates are so smooth and I only need to do 2 run-throughs and get pin straight hair.</li>
            <li>With the shorter cord, it is much easier to maneuver.</li>
            <li>I also really like that it is dual voltage</li>
            <li>The real test will be whether it lasts over time.</li>
            <li>This was the same issue I had with a conair which is a cheap straightner and is more expected to have your hair curl thoroughout day.</li>
            <li>iron itself works very well too.</li>
            <li>I really Really like it.</li>
            <li>a lot of irons claim to leave your hair shiny and this one really does.</li>
            <li>daughter wants to trade her Chi for my 6th Sense</li>
            <li>I use my flatiron daily, so it&#x27;s important to use a product that won&#x27;t damage my hair!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks 6th</li>
            <li>(and I like my hair really</li>
            <li>/&gt;It’s also very lightweight.</li>
            <li>I tried others and they burn my scalp, or have too much plastic around the edges</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone that straightens their hair!</li>
            <li>I was very suspicious buying it online, but decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>However, with this straightening iron is very silky.</li>
            <li>it fast...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>it works great on my (thin Hair)</li>
            <li>You go over your hair once for silky, shiney, straight hair.  </li>
            <li>I prefer my hair straight</li>
            <li>I really really wish I could use it, but I don&#x27;t want to risk damaging my hair.</li>
            <li>The smaller second iron and case are a nice bonus.</li>
            <li>A nice straightener, but it doesn&#x27;t feel as heavy duty as it looks in the pictures.</li>
            <li>Also, the digital display for the temperatures is neat and the colors to show how hot it is is so pretty!</li>
            <li>Also, the digital display for the temperatures is convenient and the colors to show how hot it is is so pretty!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this iron to anyone looking for high quality!</li>
            <li>Thanks AK Professional!!  </li>
            <li>I told them that I love it and the only thing was that one little light on the number display had went out.  </li>
            <li>It heats up super fast and I only have to go over my hair once for it to do the job.  </li>
            <li>It is light in weight, heats up fast, and cools down very fast as well.  </li>
            <li>My hair is long, extremely curly with a good bit of frizz.</li>
            <li>I love it works fantastic for my thick hair!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t pull and it leaves it looking much nicer than my other one did, very silky and smooth.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks straight, healthy and shiny - down to my ends!</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how fast it heated up and was ready for use.</li>
            <li>I mainly use it to curl my hair</li>
            <li>I have coarse thick hair and this product works great on it.</li>
            <li>Design - I was mostly pleased with the look and the feel of the straightener, though the cord falls just a tiny bit short for ease of maneuverability.</li>
            <li>High quality product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend buying one.</li>
            <li>This is a high quality product.  </li>
            <li>This flat iron has a dial on the side where you can adjust the temperature, and my favorite part, it stays consistent throughout the plates which prevents hot spots and uneven straightening power.</li>
            <li>Because of this I am extremely careful with how I treat my hair to avoid thinning it out more than it already has, and only use styling tools in moderation - such as for special occasions (holidays, etc.).</li>
            <li>With this straightener, it really gave my hair a soft and shinny appearance.</li>
            <li>I have natural VERY curly hair.</li>
            <li>Secondly, the item was worth the wait.  </li>
            <li>they have checked in a few times to make sure I received the unit and asking if there have been any issues.  </li>
            <li>The heat-proof carrying case is nice, but I would have preferred something a little smaller for travel.</li>
            <li>and I have to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>They told me that it was a malfunction and that they would send me a new one immediately.  </li>
            <li>This was on a Saturday night and by Monday I had the new one.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair very soft.</li>
            <li>So far I am satisfied with this iron as it does tame my hair and gives it a silky sleek look.</li>
            <li>once I put it off, it still showed a red color while it was still hot to help prevent getting burn.&lt;br</li>
            <li>once I turned it off, it still showed a red indicator while it was still hot to help prevent getting</li>
            <li>As a result, you can get that bone-straight look even from naturally curly hair!</li>
            <li>Love the small iron that came with it.  </li>
            <li>This flat iron gets hot enough and straightens my hair very fast.</li>
            <li>This flat iron works very fast so her hair isn&#x27;t damaged.</li>
            <li>little flat iron that comes with it for free is really cute and quite useful to just have in the purse for any needed fixings during the day without making my purse extra heavy or full.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Giving 2 star , As my wife used this flat iron for first 2 to 3 time and  </li>
            <li>I have really curly hair and am disappointed to say that even after blowing out my hair and then straightening it with the straightener my hair would look great right after but as the day went on I would eventually get crimps in it or like the curl would come back in some spots I also had the straightener on the highest heat setting and had to go over one strand of hair a couple times.</li>
            <li>In comparison to my old one:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it was cheaper than what I paid for a professional iron 15 years ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This flat iron got my hair just as straight as I like it</li>
            <li>I really like the carrying case and mini flat iron too.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not too big of a deal, however, as my main concern was with the straightening ability.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them and will purchase from them again in future.</li>
            <li>This puts me in a bit of a panic hoping I didn&#x27;t put the temperature too high, as drying out my hair is the very last thing I want to do.</li>
            <li>Perhaps I don&#x27;t have the temperature high enough, but given how my hair isI don&#x27;t want to risk additional damage.</li>
            <li>It saves me a lot of time instead of waiting for it to cool down!</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this flat iron and i am completely amazed at how well it works!!!!</li>
            <li>Not to mention the price is much less than its worth.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly, runs along the hair smoothly, no breakage.  </li>
            <li>Unlike many of the flat irons I have had in the past, this one grips my hair and almost sticks to it, making it difficult to pull through my hair while twisting in order to get a nice curl.</li>
            <li>The flat iron also left my hair feeling dry and frizzy rather than sleek and smooth, especially at the ends.</li>
            <li>Let me say that with my hair (a lot and curly), I cannot live without a flat iron.</li>
            <li>No regrets....</li>
            <li>My old straightening iron suddenly died so I read reviews</li>
            <li>(so it&#x27;s completely out of the way), it&#x27;d be much easier and less stressful to use.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the travel sized one yet but it is small enough to fit in my purse (it&#x27;s tiny).</li>
            <li>Al called me back immediately and we had new flat iron 2 days later.</li>
            <li>Between the consistent temperature of the plates and the plates themselves, I can straighten my hair in half the time it took with my CHI, since I didn&#x27;t have to keep unplugging it to let it cool down a little bit to avoid damaging my hair.</li>
            <li>I have very very long hair and thats the biggest problem I have with my old flatiron.</li>
            <li>I am mixed (half Caucasian half African American) with relatively fine hair, part of my hair is relaxed and part not.</li>
            <li>Since my hair was getting fried by my old flat iron ( I think it was way overdue), I did extensive research regarding flat iron for damaged hair.</li>
            <li>The small iron is quite handy for travel (especially the small bathrooms on cruise ships!)</li>
            <li>Much lighter than my previous straightener which makes it easier on the wrists (especially if it takes you an hour to straighten your big curly/frizzy mane like it does for me).  </li>
            <li>I have fine thin chemically treated hair</li>
            <li>unfortunately as I was very disappointed..... let&#x27;s start with the good points: it is nice looking, it really curls your hair and it heats fasts....</li>
            <li>My hair usually takes about an hour to straighten, and usually I need to go over the same piece 2 or 3 times for it to get straight, however with this straightener it worked the first time!</li>

            <li> I have been straightening my hair for many years.</li>

            <li> I am impressed so far, let play with it on a few more clients, but I think I am falling in love with my toy. :D</li>
            <li> I can pretty much be a spokesperson for this iron, one of my best purchases of the year.</li>
            <li> Heats up veeeeery quick and stays warm.</li>
            <li> It is nice to know that there is a company out there that totally backs their product and goes out of their way to make their customers happy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beautiful, professional, lightweight and really easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The second thing that was great is the short cord which is perfect for at home use.</li>
            <li> I have had lots of different straightening irons, but this is by far the best, not to mention a good value.  </li>
            <li> They have good even heat and handle very well.  </li>
            <li> I enjoyed using it, it was smooth and easy.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using it, it was smooth and went through the hair easily.</li>
            <li> Light, easy to maneuver and works like magic.</li>
            <li> Very good straightener for the price especially with the free travel straightener and carry case.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really want to but another one because this flatiron is the best I have had thus far..</li>
            <li> Easy grip handle and heats up in seconds.</li>
            <li> I have used Chi flat irons and titanium straightners all my life and 6 Sense is superior to them both!  </li>
            <li> This iron is well made, light and just all around easy to use.</li>
            <li> So smooth and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This iron is so easy to use, works great, &amp; heats instantly.</li>
            <li> It was love at first sight!</li>
            <li> The mini-straightener looks like a 6th grade project made with a cheap plastic mold.  </li>
            <li> and it makes my hair feel really smooth.  </li>
            <li> smooth gliding.  </li>
            <li> the boxes/heat resistant carrying case are thoughtful additions.</li>
            <li> Have used Infrashine and GHD, but this is far superior.</li>
            <li> She has beautiful long curly hair.  </li>
            <li> First off, I&#x27;d like to mention that I have very fine hair.</li>
            <li> In North America to smooth straight style that lasts!!!</li>
            <li> If the buttons were on the top of the straightener right below the temperature display, or was placed inside, below the plates like the herstyler does</li>
            <li> I have high hopes for keeping this iron for many years to come !.</li>
            <li> This hair straightener (Sixth Sense FH-1 Flat Iron Hair Styler ) is great.</li>
            <li> Great working flat iron for both straightening and curling!</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT Flat Iron!!  </li>
            <li> I had originally came online to purchase a ghd straighter.</li>
            <li> Friendly customer service.</li>
            <li> Not disappointed in this one at all.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend to any one to purchase this great flat iron and to purchase anything from this company!!!!</li>
            <li> flat iron has a good adjustable heating range and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I am glad I get to read the reviews from fellow reviewers (positive and negatives).</li>
            <li> The additional small iron and travel bag are a very nice bonus!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t really do a nice curl with too many flat irons.</li>
            <li> I saw that the company gives excellent exchange ...there was a complimentary carry bag as well as a small, travel iron which fits into ones</li>
            <li> So far its been really nice</li>
            <li> It also makes my hair really straight and is easy to use, glides smoothly through hair without tugging on it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall it is a good flat iron for the price.  </li>
            <li> I enjoyed my new iron!</li>
            <li> The straighter does leave your hair looking shiny, heats up quickly and doesn&#x27;t pull your hair.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I carry it in my purse for quick touch ups.</li>
            <li> I choose the main iron specifically because tourmaline plates are better for the hair.</li>
            <li> ThIs is actually the best flat iron I have ever used.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But the absolute best part is that I can straighten my hair with ONE SLOW, GENTLE STROKE, leaving my hair shiny and looking healthy.</li>
            <li> I love my new flatiron</li>
            <li> Bought this item mainly due to the good ratings and was quite excited when I got it....</li>
            <li> /&gt;I tested out the “curl your hair with a flat iron technique” as well, and this flat iron worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> First class business!</li>
            <li> Problem was, she wanted it straight!!  </li>
            <li> This flat iron is light weight, easy to use and feels comfortable in my hands.</li>
            <li> She has very curly hair and this straightener works fabulous on her hair.</li>
            <li> I am now completely spoiled after using this one and had to throw my old one out, even though it is still in good working condition.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> yeah, I would recommend this flat iron very much!! :)</li>
            <li> I have owned a number of flat irons and this one is by far the highest quality one I have personally experienced.  </li>
            <li> My first order did not arrive (stolen?), and the seller quickly sent a replacement before I had to travel.  </li>
            <li> I have the kind of hair cut where I have to flat iron it after every wash.</li>
            <li> AK Professionals sent me an email asking me if I received the flat iron and how I liked it.  </li>
            <li> I can use this one perhaps 1-2 times and get a satisfactory result when the heat isn&#x27;t all full potential (I don&#x27;t use full heat because of my fragile hair, I&#x27;m sure result would be better for those with hair who could tolerate it).  </li>
            <li> The actual flat iron is great.  </li>
            <li> It heats up just as fast and is hot!</li>
            <li> I wish the smaller one was of better quality and had a carry case.</li>
            <li> I plugged it up in the morning and the flatiron never got HOT</li>
            <li> The first thing that stood out to me was how the iron made my hair look and feel.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> The case also works as a pad to set the hot iron on while doing your hair.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive my first one ordered</li>
            <li> I think anyone who has normal/thicker hair won&#x27;t run into many of the same problems.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, if you’re looking for a nice flat iron to invest in, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The box is gorgeous and chic, and I loved that it has a magnetic closing.&lt;br /&gt;The little flat iron that comes with it for free is really cute and quite useful to just have in the purse for any needed fixings during the day without making my purse extra heavy or full.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recently replaced my old with this one and this is MUCH better!  </li>
            <li> Was a little more money than I originally wanted to spend but after experiencing the unit, I&#x27;m glad I paid the extra for it.  </li>
            <li> Love the styling results of this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I love these flat irons!  </li>
            <li> Love this flat iron!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m frequently on the go, traveling, so being able to quickly pocket a hot flat iron</li>
            <li> Straightens my dry frizzy hair pretty well, love it.</li>
            <li> It gets really hot, really fast.</li>
            <li> I received this in the mail quickly, shipped directly from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, especially for someone who has never owned one.</li>
            <li> The case doesn&#x27;t need to be as large as it is, but if space isn&#x27;t an issue for you then you won&#x27;t be bothered by it.  </li>
            <li> It heats up quickly, effortlessly glides through my hair, and rarely do I have to use a second pass to get my hair straight.</li>
            <li> The case having a thermal protection layer so that I can put the flat iron away before it even cools down is a great feature.</li>
            <li> And the handy heat case makes it safer to use with my little ones around, and to take on my carry on while I travel.</li>
            <li> The plates are so smooth and I only need to do 2 run-throughs and get pin straight hair.</li>
            <li> With the shorter cord, it is much easier to maneuver.</li>
            <li> I also really like that it is dual voltage</li>
            <li> The real test will be whether it lasts over time.</li>
            <li> This was the same issue I had with a conair which is a cheap straightner and is more expected to have your hair curl thoroughout day.</li>
            <li> iron itself works very well too.</li>
            <li> I really Really like it.</li>
            <li> a lot of irons claim to leave your hair shiny and this one really does.</li>
            <li> daughter wants to trade her Chi for my 6th Sense</li>
            <li> I use my flatiron daily, so it&#x27;s important to use a product that won&#x27;t damage my hair!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks 6th</li>
            <li> (and I like my hair really</li>
            <li> /&gt;It’s also very lightweight.</li>
            <li> I tried others and they burn my scalp, or have too much plastic around the edges</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone that straightens their hair!</li>
            <li> I was very suspicious buying it online, but decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> However, with this straightening iron is very silky.</li>
            <li> it fast...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> it works great on my (thin Hair)</li>
            <li> You go over your hair once for silky, shiney, straight hair.  </li>
            <li> I prefer my hair straight</li>
            <li> I really really wish I could use it, but I don&#x27;t want to risk damaging my hair.</li>
            <li> The smaller second iron and case are a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> A nice straightener, but it doesn&#x27;t feel as heavy duty as it looks in the pictures.</li>
            <li> Also, the digital display for the temperatures is neat and the colors to show how hot it is is so pretty!</li>
            <li> Also, the digital display for the temperatures is convenient and the colors to show how hot it is is so pretty!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this iron to anyone looking for high quality!</li>
            <li> Thanks AK Professional!!  </li>
            <li> I told them that I love it and the only thing was that one little light on the number display had went out.  </li>
            <li> It heats up super fast and I only have to go over my hair once for it to do the job.  </li>
            <li> It is light in weight, heats up fast, and cools down very fast as well.  </li>
            <li> My hair is long, extremely curly with a good bit of frizz.</li>
            <li> I love it works fantastic for my thick hair!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pull and it leaves it looking much nicer than my other one did, very silky and smooth.  </li>
            <li> My hair looks straight, healthy and shiny - down to my ends!</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how fast it heated up and was ready for use.</li>
            <li> I mainly use it to curl my hair</li>
            <li> I have coarse thick hair and this product works great on it.</li>
            <li> Design - I was mostly pleased with the look and the feel of the straightener, though the cord falls just a tiny bit short for ease of maneuverability.</li>
            <li> High quality product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend buying one.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality product.  </li>
            <li> This flat iron has a dial on the side where you can adjust the temperature, and my favorite part, it stays consistent throughout the plates which prevents hot spots and uneven straightening power.</li>
            <li> Because of this I am extremely careful with how I treat my hair to avoid thinning it out more than it already has, and only use styling tools in moderation - such as for special occasions (holidays, etc.).</li>
            <li> With this straightener, it really gave my hair a soft and shinny appearance.</li>
            <li> I have natural VERY curly hair.</li>
            <li> Secondly, the item was worth the wait.  </li>
            <li> they have checked in a few times to make sure I received the unit and asking if there have been any issues.  </li>
            <li> The heat-proof carrying case is nice, but I would have preferred something a little smaller for travel.</li>
            <li> and I have to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> They told me that it was a malfunction and that they would send me a new one immediately.  </li>
            <li> This was on a Saturday night and by Monday I had the new one.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my hair very soft.</li>
            <li> So far I am satisfied with this iron as it does tame my hair and gives it a silky sleek look.</li>
            <li> once I put it off, it still showed a red color while it was still hot to help prevent getting burn.&lt;br</li>
            <li> once I turned it off, it still showed a red indicator while it was still hot to help prevent getting</li>
            <li> As a result, you can get that bone-straight look even from naturally curly hair!</li>
            <li> Love the small iron that came with it.  </li>
            <li> This flat iron gets hot enough and straightens my hair very fast.</li>
            <li> This flat iron works very fast so her hair isn&#x27;t damaged.</li>
            <li> little flat iron that comes with it for free is really cute and quite useful to just have in the purse for any needed fixings during the day without making my purse extra heavy or full.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Giving 2 star , As my wife used this flat iron for first 2 to 3 time and  </li>
            <li> I have really curly hair and am disappointed to say that even after blowing out my hair and then straightening it with the straightener my hair would look great right after but as the day went on I would eventually get crimps in it or like the curl would come back in some spots I also had the straightener on the highest heat setting and had to go over one strand of hair a couple times.</li>
            <li> In comparison to my old one:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it was cheaper than what I paid for a professional iron 15 years ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This flat iron got my hair just as straight as I like it</li>
            <li> I really like the carrying case and mini flat iron too.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not too big of a deal, however, as my main concern was with the straightening ability.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them and will purchase from them again in future.</li>
            <li> This puts me in a bit of a panic hoping I didn&#x27;t put the temperature too high, as drying out my hair is the very last thing I want to do.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I don&#x27;t have the temperature high enough, but given how my hair isI don&#x27;t want to risk additional damage.</li>
            <li> It saves me a lot of time instead of waiting for it to cool down!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this flat iron and i am completely amazed at how well it works!!!!</li>
            <li> Not to mention the price is much less than its worth.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly, runs along the hair smoothly, no breakage.  </li>
            <li> Unlike many of the flat irons I have had in the past, this one grips my hair and almost sticks to it, making it difficult to pull through my hair while twisting in order to get a nice curl.</li>
            <li> The flat iron also left my hair feeling dry and frizzy rather than sleek and smooth, especially at the ends.</li>
            <li> Let me say that with my hair (a lot and curly), I cannot live without a flat iron.</li>
            <li> No regrets....</li>
            <li> My old straightening iron suddenly died so I read reviews</li>
            <li> (so it&#x27;s completely out of the way), it&#x27;d be much easier and less stressful to use.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the travel sized one yet but it is small enough to fit in my purse (it&#x27;s tiny).</li>
            <li> Al called me back immediately and we had new flat iron 2 days later.</li>
            <li> Between the consistent temperature of the plates and the plates themselves, I can straighten my hair in half the time it took with my CHI, since I didn&#x27;t have to keep unplugging it to let it cool down a little bit to avoid damaging my hair.</li>
            <li> I have very very long hair and thats the biggest problem I have with my old flatiron.</li>
            <li> I am mixed (half Caucasian half African American) with relatively fine hair, part of my hair is relaxed and part not.</li>
            <li> Since my hair was getting fried by my old flat iron ( I think it was way overdue), I did extensive research regarding flat iron for damaged hair.</li>
            <li> The small iron is quite handy for travel (especially the small bathrooms on cruise ships!)</li>
            <li> Much lighter than my previous straightener which makes it easier on the wrists (especially if it takes you an hour to straighten your big curly/frizzy mane like it does for me).  </li>
            <li> I have fine thin chemically treated hair</li>
            <li> unfortunately as I was very disappointed..... let&#x27;s start with the good points: it is nice looking, it really curls your hair and it heats fasts....</li>
            <li> My hair usually takes about an hour to straighten, and usually I need to go over the same piece 2 or 3 times for it to get straight, however with this straightener it worked the first time!</li>
            <li> Its hard for me to find the right straightener</li>
            <li> would definitely recommend this flat iron!</li>
            <li> Plus they send you an extra Flat Iron for traveling!</li>
            <li> and I can do my entire hair within 15 min with this flat iron!!</li>
            <li> I bought this Flat iron at the end of January</li>
            <li> The seller has emailed me and stated they will send another Flat iron and I am so grateful for that.</li>
            <li> This is what I was looking for in a flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;4.  </li>
            <li> this flat iron</li>
            <li> when I wear my hair in a ponytail, next day I need minor touch up if any&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li> I have used this flat iron for both straightening and creating waves.</li>
            <li> so not all flat iron are meant to be for my hair.</li>
            <li> with this super-hot flat</li>
            <li> I will be returning this flat iron.</li>
            <li> Everything about this flat iron is superb!&lt;br /&gt;Received</li>
            <li> Received my 6th Sense Flat Iron Hair Straightener and I am blown away by the performance of this unit.  </li>
            <li> The temperature control is on the side of the flat iron, where my hand grips, so I&#x27;m often hitting the buttons when I&#x27;m going through my hair.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any steam rising from the flat ironer, which is something I&#x27;ve dealt with before, so that was comforting.</li>
            <li> I have even placed past ones in the freezer to speed up the cool down process!</li>
            <li> and I always have a hard time waiting for my straightener to cool down.</li>
            <li> The mini included was a disappointment but the company has went above and beyond to make sure my satisfaction is met.</li>
            <li> I am living in the NE where there is a lot of humidity and this iron made my thick hair straight and sleek, plus it stayed that way throughout the entire day.  </li>
            <li> I just learned a technique to do a finger wave with a flat iron on a long hair client.</li>
            <li> Ladies, if you want salon quality hair everyday, get yourself a professional blow dryer and THIS flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and a lot of it.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s not actually the same material, I don&#x27;t understand how it&#x27;ll be of any use to people like me, which is a shame considering how often I travel and need touch-ups when down by the river or in humid weather.  </li>
            <li> Straighteners without floating plates will not press down firmly enough to make a difference in my hair without 4-5 swipes through, which causes damage and ultimately the dreaded frizz-head.</li>
            <li> half white -- so my hair is coarse and curly AND frizzy.</li>
            <li> Even before I started having problems with my hair, it was simply too hot and made a mess of my delicate curls.</li>
            <li> You can get the prettiest curls (that hold all day long!)</li>
            <li> it tells me the temperature in a digital display, vs. simply cranking up a little nob to the max hoping it wouldn&#x27;t fry my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I spent some time looking for an flat iron and found this one.</li>
            <li> I asked them if they wanted me to send the other one back</li>
            <li> it would give the dry and puffy hair</li>
            <li> I use Argan Hair oil treatment after shower and let air dry and straighten my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My old flat iron is bulky and hard to hold and my hair would get caught in it.</li>
            <li> is softer after use than when I use other flat irons</li>
            <li> have a GFI plug, only has a regular plug into the wall which is a safety concern for me, but then again every single CHI I&#x27;ve owned in the past the GFI plug stops working</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t control my problem areas too well, even with multiple passes.</li>
            <li> Thick natural hair glides through ceramic iron without snagging &amp; straightens with one pass.</li>
            <li> A million times better than the 20 dollar crap I got at my local Rite Aid.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m too scared to try the mini, so it seems like a bit of a waste even though the idea behind it was exciting.</li>
            <li> I was dumb to get by with a lower quality iron for years - I had purchased it at one of those mall carts with the high pressure sales reps that started off at about $165, and managed to &amp;#34;get a discount&amp;#34;, which I think was all part of the tactic, to $130.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thinned considerably in the past few years and I can&#x27;t see to rectify the issue which is probably stemming from my frequent bouts with common illnesses.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a constant and emotional battle with my hair the past few years, so I do all in my power to control it.</li>
            <li> My old iron took a few minutes of checking that stupid red light - is it green yet?</li>
            <li> I have very coarse, frizzy, and thick hair that takes a long time for me to straighten.</li>
            <li> The cord for my other straighteners always would get caught on the handles for the drawers in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> they &amp;#34;revise&amp;#34; a small travel flat iron, I hope I get put on the list for one to replace the one they shipped</li>
            <li> I have never used a flat iron before and was not really sure what I was going to get out of it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why flat  irons are so expensive, but this one has worked very well</li>
            <li> It usually takes so long to straighten but not with this iron.</li>
            <li> she complained about its not heating as before and also her hair stuck in temperature digital display area just planning to return this item.</li>
            <li> Since this is the case, I&#x27;ll begin with the cons which makes my experience with this product just a tad below the average user.  </li>
            <li> Just sucks to be in that percentage of people who have to constantly consider the well-being of their hair.</li>
            <li> Trust me my hair is thick and coarse</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a hard feature to find in a flat</li>
            <li> /&gt;Takes 1/2 the time with less heat&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li> prefer the shorter cord, less tangling</li>
            <li> half black,</li>
            <li> it was just a mess with my hair</li>
            <li> Evenly distributes heat to hair without hot n cold spots.  </li>
            <li> my hair is so long and thick.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t think I would like the little one it came with</li>
            <li> so I wasted 105.00..  </li>
            <li> What a waste of their company&#x27;s costs to even produce and ship this!&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> it heats up in a few seconds.</li>
            <li> is it green yet?</li>
            <li> So, not sure this is a CON&lt;br /&gt;The small &amp;#34;gift&amp;#34; free straightner you get with your flat iron is HORRIBLE!  </li>
            <li> It was 6 days late and then had to track it down at the post office where I had to pick it up.</li>
            <li> I tried to contact seller for replacement and its past the date to refund or exchange</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t heavy, so at least there&#x27;s that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The small iron looked used.</li>
            <li> - I know this was a bonus, but it doesn&#x27;t appear as though it&#x27;s made from the same tourmaline-ceramic plates (I could be wrong).</li>
            <li> The small hair strightner was beyond cheesy</li>
            <li> , I know it was a dumb move,</li>
            <li> I have very thick curly hair and it has to be used on it&#x27;s highest setting</li>
            <li> And less expensive to boot!  </li>
            <li> The customer service behind  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s inconvenient.</li>
            <li> 15-20 minutes isn&#x27;t bad considering how unruly my curls can be, and when the plates glide over my hair it doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m damaging it too badly.</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> but I just had a terrible experience with it.</li>
            <li> I went from the worst frizziest curly hair</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It work&#x27;s well, I have used it twice with no issues. I wish the smaller one was of better quality and had a carry case. If you are like me and buy this over others because of the additional mini, I would purchase a different set. I have very thick curly hair and it has to be used on it&#x27;s highest setting and I have to go over each strand 3-4 times.</li>
            <li> I bought this Flat iron at the end of January and it worked great. On 04/20/2015... I plugged it up in the morning and the flatiron never got HOT so I used a different socket and it still didn&#x27;t work.. I tried to contact seller for replacement and its past the date to refund or exchange so I wasted 105.00..  Follow up... I am so elated :)  The seller has emailed me and stated they will send another Flat iron and I am so grateful for that. I didn&#x27;t really want to but another one because this flatiron is the best I have had thus far.. I probably just got a defected flatiron and its probably a manufacturers issue.   Thanks AK Professional!!  :)</li>
            <li> I just received this hair straightener in the mail. It arrived in good packaging and was not damaged. I was surprised at how fast it heated up and was ready for use. My hair usually takes about an hour to straighten, and usually I need to go over the same piece 2 or 3 times for it to get straight, however with this straightener it worked the first time! My hair only took 20 min to straighten. I&#x27;m definitely going to be using this one from now on. And the handy heat case makes it safer to use with my little ones around, and to take on my carry on while I travel. Love this!</li>
            <li> I received this hair straightener as a gift and it is amazing! I used to use a Chi straightener, but ever since I began using this straightener, my Chi has just been collecting dust in my closet. The first thing that stood out to me was how the iron made my hair look and feel. I have very coarse, frizzy, and thick hair that takes a long time for me to straighten. With this straightener, it really gave my hair a soft and shinny appearance. It also allowed me to straighten in a shorter period of time! The different heat settings let me control the heat to allow the straightener to work with larger sections of hair. The second thing that was great is the short cord which is perfect for at home use. The cord for my other straighteners always would get caught on the handles for the drawers in my bathroom. With the shorter cord, it is much easier to maneuver. Lastly, I always tend to straighten my hair last minute before I leave on a trip and I always have a hard time waiting for my straightener to cool down. I have even placed past ones in the freezer to speed up the cool down process! The case having a thermal protection layer so that I can put the flat iron away before it even cools down is a great feature. It saves me a lot of time instead of waiting for it to cool down! I really love this straightener!</li>
            <li> LOVED THIS IRON!!! &amp;#60;3&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I was totally impressed by its neat packaging! The box is very nice and upscale looking, and I loved that it has the magnetic closing.&lt;br /&gt;The little flat iron that comes with it for free is really cute and quite useful to just have in the purse for any needed fixings during the day without making my purse extra heavy or full.&lt;br /&gt;The iron itself works great! I enjoyed using it, it was smooth and easy. Also, the digital display for the temperatures is neat and the colors to show how hot it is is so pretty! Also I like that once I put it off, it still showed a red color while it was still hot to help prevent getting burn.&lt;br /&gt;So yeah, I would recommend this flat iron very much!! :)</li>
            <li> Very good straightener for the price especially with the free travel straightener and carry case. Leaves my hair very soft. The plates are very smooth and flow through my hair nicely</li>
            <li> I received this in the mail quickly, shipped directly from Amazon.  Here is my opinion so far:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Internal Box looks like it has had some water damage, as it is warped and the glue is visibly brownish-yellow and it has some water staining.&lt;br /&gt;2.  The mini-straightener looks like a 6th grade project made with a cheap plastic mold.  I would never use it on my hair, and the fact that they put it in the box as an extra &amp;#34;gift&amp;#34; diminishes the quality of the brand.&lt;br /&gt;3.  The actual flat iron is great.  I was impressed by how quickly it heats and also how smooth it is when you run it through your hair.  There is no friction at all and it makes my hair feel really smooth.  This is what I was looking for in a flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;4.  I also really like that it is dual voltage so you can use it with a simple adapter.  It&#x27;s a hard feature to find in a flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;5.  The heat-proof carrying case is nice, but I would have preferred something a little smaller for travel. The case doesn&#x27;t need to be as large as it is, but if space isn&#x27;t an issue for you then you won&#x27;t be bothered by it.  It isn&#x27;t heavy, so at least there&#x27;s that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is a good flat iron for the price.  The real test will be whether it lasts over time. I&#x27;ll be updating with any issues I experience.</li>
            <li> I love these flat irons!  They have good even heat and handle very well.  The carry case is convenient.</li>
            <li> Great working flat iron for both straightening and curling! I am mixed (half Caucasian half African American) with relatively fine hair, part of my hair is relaxed and part not. I mainly use it to curl my hair it does such a great job to get beautiful curls! It also makes my hair really straight and is easy to use, glides smoothly through hair without tugging on it. I haven&#x27;t tried the travel sized one yet but it is small enough to fit in my purse (it&#x27;s tiny).</li>
            <li> Great! Good service of their staff. Flat iron works superb. My hair looks like silk when  I am done. I am very pleased and happy with my purchase. No regrets....</li>
            <li> I love it... It was 6 days late and then had to track it down at the post office where I had to pick it up. The small hair strightner was beyond cheesy I will never use it!</li>
            <li> My old straightening iron suddenly died so I read reviews and  chose this straightener.My hair is long, extremely curly with a good bit of frizz. I am pleased to say that this straightening iron is as advertized. It heats up quickly, effortlessly glides through my hair, and rarely do I have to use a second pass to get my hair straight. The smaller second iron and case are a nice bonus. I have high hopes for keeping this iron for many years to come !.</li>
            <li> I had originally came online to purchase a ghd straighter. My girlfriend had let me use it and I thought it was amazing! However I had seen that 6th sense was having a deal for 4th of July and everyone was raving about the straighter so I decided to give it a try. I have really curly hair and am disappointed to say that even after blowing out my hair and then straightening it with the straightener my hair would look great right after but as the day went on I would eventually get crimps in it or like the curl would come back in some spots I also had the straightener on the highest heat setting and had to go over one strand of hair a couple times. This was the same issue I had with a conair which is a cheap straightner and is more expected to have your hair curl thoroughout day. The straighter does leave your hair looking shiny, heats up quickly and doesn&#x27;t pull your hair. I give 3 stars because the company is nice and went out of their way to email me about sending me the newer addition of the mini straightener.  I had to return it and decided to go with the Ghd.</li>
            <li> The main iron arrived in perfect condition and is great. The small iron looked used.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my wife &amp; she said: &amp;#34;I was really impressed by its very nice packaging! The box is gorgeous and chic, and I loved that it has a magnetic closing.&lt;br /&gt;The little flat iron that comes with it for free is really cute and quite useful to just have in the purse for any needed fixings during the day without making my purse extra heavy or full.&lt;br /&gt;The iron itself works very well too. I enjoyed using it, it was smooth and went through the hair easily. Also, the digital display for the temperatures is convenient and the colors to show how hot it is is so pretty! Also I like that once I turned it off, it still showed a red indicator while it was still hot to help prevent getting burned.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this flat iron!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this flat iron and i am completely amazed at how well it works!!!! Not to mention the price is much less than its worth. A lot of researching and asking stylist which would work best led me to AK Professional. I will not buy from another company anymore. The mini included was a disappointment but the company has went above and beyond to make sure my satisfaction is met. I added a photo to show just how well it works. Just fyi I have natural VERY curly hair. LOVE IT!!!!!</li>
            <li> So far its been really nice</li>
            <li> Bought this item mainly due to the good ratings and was quite excited when I got it.... unfortunately as I was very disappointed..... let&#x27;s start with the good points: it is nice looking, it really curls your hair and it heats fasts.... however it dried my hair so much, it didn&#x27;t even shine (I even added some argan oil and still...it would give the dry and puffy hair look...horrible) a bit. it was just a mess with my hair so I returned it. Maybe it depends on the hair type..but I just had a terrible experience with it.</li>
            <li> I really Really like it. I like everything about it. it curls great. I just learned a technique to do a finger wave with a flat iron on a long hair client. So I will work on mastering the technique on a doll head and make a video. I think this iron will do the trick. You can&#x27;t really do a nice curl with too many flat irons. a lot of irons claim to leave your hair shiny and this one really does. I am impressed so far, let play with it on a few more clients, but I think I am falling in love with my toy. :D I will keep you posted.</li>
            <li> I have used Chi flat irons and titanium straightners all my life and 6 Sense is superior to them both!  I have fine thin chemically treated hair and I can&#x27;t begin to tell you how awesome of a job this flat iron does.&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Takes 1/2 the time with less heat&lt;br /&gt;Hair is softer after use than when I use other flat irons&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the shorter cord, less tangling&lt;br /&gt;Even when I wear my hair in a ponytail, next day I need minor touch up if any&lt;br /&gt;Hair doesn&#x27;t get pulled out like it did using my Chi&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t have a GFI plug, only has a regular plug into the wall which is a safety concern for me, but then again every single CHI I&#x27;ve owned in the past the GFI plug stops working and I have to buy a new one.  So, not sure this is a CON&lt;br /&gt;The small &amp;#34;gift&amp;#34; free straightner you get with your flat iron is HORRIBLE!  I wouldn&#x27;t use it if you paid me!  Looks like a kid&#x27;s toy.  What a waste of their company&#x27;s costs to even produce and ship this!&lt;br /&gt;My daughter wants to trade her Chi for my 6th Sense - NOT GOING TO HAPPEN!  LOL&lt;br /&gt;If they &amp;#34;revise&amp;#34; a small travel flat iron, I hope I get put on the list for one to replace the one they shipped me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone.  Told my hairdresser about it.  I&#x27;m a 6th Sense fan now!</li>
            <li> I loved it very cool ..</li>
            <li> Great straightener that heats fast. I have used this flat iron for both straightening and creating waves. It works well for both!</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. Great product. Friendly customer service. Overall, 5 stars</li>
            <li> great product! Heats up veeeeery quick and stays warm. my hair is around by mid back lenght and I can do my entire hair within 15 min with this flat iron!! Very happy with it!</li>
            <li> I use my flatiron daily, so it&#x27;s important to use a product that won&#x27;t damage my hair!&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and I love the mini flatiron!! I carry it in my purse for quick touch ups.</li>
            <li> Straightens my dry frizzy hair pretty well, love it. Thanks 6th sense :)</li>
            <li> This flat iron is light weight, easy to use and feels comfortable in my hands. My old flat iron is bulky and hard to hold and my hair would get caught in it. I am now completely spoiled after using this one and had to throw my old one out, even though it is still in good working condition.</li>
            <li> Great product! Heats up quickly, runs along the hair smoothly, no breakage.  I will be taking it to Europe for a month, using its dual voltage capability!  So far extremely happy! The additional small iron and travel bag are a very nice bonus!</li>
            <li> Works so well, especially for making curls. Great company</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron.</li>
            <li> Since my hair was getting fried by my old flat iron ( I think it was way overdue), I did extensive research regarding flat iron for damaged hair. I am glad I get to read the reviews from fellow reviewers (positive and negatives). I use Argan Hair oil treatment after shower and let air dry and straighten my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The flat iron has a good adjustable heating range and is easy to use. Trust me my hair is thick and coarse ( I used to cut chunks of my hair in my teenage, I know it was a dumb move, oh well I am blaming my teenage hormones), so not all flat iron are meant to be for my hair. So far I am satisfied with this iron as it does tame my hair and gives it a silky sleek look.</li>
            <li> This hair straightener (Sixth Sense FH-1 Flat Iron Hair Styler ) is great. It gets really hot, really fast. As a result, you can get that bone-straight look even from naturally curly hair! I am mixed -- half black, half white -- so my hair is coarse and curly AND frizzy. This flat iron got my hair just as straight as I like it (and I like my hair really straight).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested out the “curl your hair with a flat iron technique” as well, and this flat iron worked perfectly. If you’re wondering what I’m referring to, just search “how to curl your hair with a straightener” on YouTube. You can get the prettiest curls (that hold all day long!) with this super-hot flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s also very lightweight. Much lighter than my previous straightener which makes it easier on the wrists (especially if it takes you an hour to straighten your big curly/frizzy mane like it does for me).  I really like the carrying case and mini flat iron too.  Such a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you’re looking for a nice flat iron to invest in, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am what you would call a low maintenance girl.  I have never used a flat iron before and was not really sure what I was going to get out of it.  Well? I was very impressed by the results. It took no time to heat up and in minutes my hair looked salon perfect and not like a frazzled mommy! Quite happy with my new toy! !</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron! Have used Infrashine and GHD, but this is far superior.</li>
            <li> Excellent service via Prime trial membership. Item received in 1-day of ordering. High quality product. Thick natural hair glides through ceramic iron without snagging &amp; straightens with one pass. Rated 4-stars as product only used on 2-heads since receiving. Recommend making this investment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why flat  irons are so expensive, but this one has worked very well and I would say it is comparable to salon-grade models. Excellent follow-up by manufacturer to ensure I received the correct products. The small iron is quite handy for travel (especially the small bathrooms on cruise ships!), although its design works better as a curling iron.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! The customer service behind  it is incredible too! This iron is so easy to use, works great, &amp; heats instantly. I tried others and they burn my scalp, or have too much plastic around the edges so I cant straighten short hair. I am a male, with short hair, and want to spike it, or some times create a faux-hawk. This is perfect for that! Plus they send you an extra Flat Iron for traveling!</li>
            <li> My sister gave one to me as a gift and I love it! I have short wavy frizzy hair so I like to straighten it often. This flat iron gets hot enough and straightens my hair very fast. I like the shine it gives my hair too. I would highly recommend this to anyone that straightens their hair!</li>
            <li> Let me say that with my hair (a lot and curly), I cannot live without a flat iron. I was dumb to get by with a lower quality iron for years - I had purchased it at one of those mall carts with the high pressure sales reps that started off at about $165, and managed to &amp;#34;get a discount&amp;#34;, which I think was all part of the tactic, to $130. This was 15 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This ceramic, professional iron is the best purchase for my hair I have done in years. In comparison to my old one:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- it heats up in a few seconds. My old iron took a few minutes of checking that stupid red light - is it green yet? is it green yet? how about now?&lt;br /&gt;- it tells me the temperature in a digital display, vs. simply cranking up a little nob to the max hoping it wouldn&#x27;t fry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;- the color is elegant, it is light and fits perfectly in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;- it was cheaper than what I paid for a professional iron 15 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;- what about the adorable, cute, useful and brilliant mini portable iron? You gotta love that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the absolute best part is that I can straighten my hair with ONE SLOW, GENTLE STROKE, leaving my hair shiny and looking healthy. I can pretty much be a spokesperson for this iron, one of my best purchases of the year.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT Flat Iron!!  I recently replaced my old with this one and this is MUCH better!  And less expensive to boot!  It heats up super fast and I only have to go over my hair once for it to do the job.  It doesn&#x27;t pull and it leaves it looking much nicer than my other one did, very silky and smooth.  I&#x27;m very impressed and telling all my friends.</li>
            <li> The best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever tried - ever! Light, easy to maneuver and works like magic. My hair looks straight, healthy and shiny - down to my ends! The best hair tool buy I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
            <li> I have changed about 5 straightening irons this year, and finally found the 6th Sense here. I was very suspicious buying it online, but decided to give it a try. I love it! My hair is curly and stubborn. However, with this straightening iron is very silky. Highly recommend buying one.</li>
            <li> Works excellent on my thick curly hair and if you need to contact the company customer service is excellent .</li>
            <li> Great iron, I have stubborn hair and this is very nice quality. ThIs is actually the best flat iron I have ever used. One of my best purchases. I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I have been straightening my hair for many years. Unlike many of the flat irons I have had in the past, this one grips my hair and almost sticks to it, making it difficult to pull through my hair while twisting in order to get a nice curl. The flat iron also left my hair feeling dry and frizzy rather than sleek and smooth, especially at the ends. I will be returning this flat iron.</li>
            <li> Everything about this flat iron is superb!&lt;br /&gt;Received it fast...&lt;br /&gt;Once I opened it up I saw that the company gives excellent exchange ...there was a complimentary carry bag as well as a small, travel iron which fits into ones purse.&lt;br /&gt;The iron itself works so well! I have the kind of hair cut where I have to flat iron it after every wash. This iron is well made, light and just all around easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy grip handle and heats up in seconds. Evenly distributes heat to hair without hot n cold spots.  The Mini flat iron fits into my briefcase and is perfect for those in between touch-ups.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality product.  It&#x27;s beautiful, professional, lightweight and really easy to use.  I used it today and loved the result.  A million times better than the 20 dollar crap I got at my local Rite Aid.  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I spent some time looking for an flat iron and found this one. I am glad I purchased this it is wonderful and does the job well really like it</li>
            <li> I love my new flatiron</li>
            <li> I have coarse thick hair and this product works great on it. I would definitely recommend this product</li>
            <li> Firstly, I have to comment on the great customer service.  My first order did not arrive (stolen?), and the seller quickly sent a replacement before I had to travel.  Secondly, the item was worth the wait.  I am living in the NE where there is a lot of humidity and this iron made my thick hair straight and sleek, plus it stayed that way throughout the entire day.  I have had lots of different straightening irons, but this is by far the best, not to mention a good value.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Love it. Easy to use, especially for someone who has never owned one. The carrying case is such a plus for travel.</li>
            <li> Gift for my step daughter who goes back and forth between her mom&#x27;s and my house so the case is perfect. She has very curly hair and this straightener works fabulous on her hair. She loves it.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: the iron malfunctioned after 3 months of use. I sent a note to 6th sense about exchanging or repairing. Al called me back immediately and we had new flat iron 2 days later. First class business! I highly recommend them and will purchase from them again in future.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed my new iron! it works great on my (thin Hair)</li>
            <li> Love it! Didn&#x27;t think I would like the little one it came with but I love that too.  I have long hair and a lot of it. It usually takes so long to straighten but not with this iron.</li>
            <li> Ladies, if you want salon quality hair everyday, get yourself a professional blow dryer and THIS flat iron. It heats up in 30 seconds. You go over your hair once for silky, shiney, straight hair.  My hair is thick and wavy and this works great on my difficult hair. The case also works as a pad to set the hot iron on while doing your hair. Get. This. Now. Love it. Life changing.</li>
            <li> This is the best straightener I have ever used. I use it every day and it doesn&#x27;t burn my hair up. Its hard for me to find the right straightener bc my hair is so long and thick. Wonderful customer service as well. I didn&#x27;t receive my first one ordered (my neighbors probably picked it up) and they replaced my order with no problem. I definitely will be ordering again for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Giving 2 star , As my wife used this flat iron for first 2 to 3 time and  it gives her nice smooth strait hair and she was very happy and after the forth use she complained about its not heating as before and also her hair stuck in temperature digital display area just planning to return this item.</li>
            <li> Received my 6th Sense Flat Iron Hair Straightener and I am blown away by the performance of this unit.  it has adjustable heat settings.  I have mine set at 355 degrees which is in the mid-range.  Unit heats up in seconds.  smooth gliding.  Not disappointed in this one at all.  Was a little more money than I originally wanted to spend but after experiencing the unit, I&#x27;m glad I paid the extra for it.  I have owned a number of flat irons and this one is by far the highest quality one I have personally experienced.  It looks as though customer service will be excellent as well.  they have checked in a few times to make sure I received the unit and asking if there have been any issues.  Great product, great customer service.  A winning combination.</li>
            <li> A nice straightener, but it doesn&#x27;t feel as heavy duty as it looks in the pictures. I was a bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love the styling results of this flat iron. Can also do some curling where desired.</li>
            <li> So smooth and easy to use. I went from the worst frizziest curly hair In North America to smooth straight style that lasts!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these and I love it.  AK Professionals sent me an email asking me if I received the flat iron and how I liked it.  I told them that I love it and the only thing was that one little light on the number display had went out.  They told me that it was a malfunction and that they would send me a new one immediately.  They did just that.  This was on a Saturday night and by Monday I had the new one.  I asked them if they wanted me to send the other one back and they told me to keep it.  I think their customer service is outstanding.  It is nice to know that there is a company out there that totally backs their product and goes out of their way to make their customers happy.  I would recommend to any one to purchase this great flat iron and to purchase anything from this company!!!!</li>
            <li> Great service and great product. I love the way it smooths out my hair.</li>
            <li> It was love at first sight! So gorgeous, hair looks incredible, salon style. Besides, AK professionals and assistants - extremely kind. Wonderful experience!</li>
            <li> First off, I&#x27;d like to mention that I have very fine hair. It&#x27;s thinned considerably in the past few years and I can&#x27;t see to rectify the issue which is probably stemming from my frequent bouts with common illnesses. Because of this I am extremely careful with how I treat my hair to avoid thinning it out more than it already has, and only use styling tools in moderation - such as for special occasions (holidays, etc.). It&#x27;s been a constant and emotional battle with my hair the past few years, so I do all in my power to control it. I prefer my hair straight, I think it compliments my face better and I feel 100% more confident. Since this is the case, I&#x27;ll begin with the cons which makes my experience with this product just a tad below the average user.  Design - I was mostly pleased with the look and the feel of the straightener, though the cord falls just a tiny bit short for ease of maneuverability. I understand this was to avoid tangles and whatnot, but if it was just a tidbit longer it&#x27;d make it easier for me to use. That&#x27;s not too big of a deal, however, as my main concern was with the straightening ability. The temperature control is on the side of the flat iron, where my hand grips, so I&#x27;m often hitting the buttons when I&#x27;m going through my hair. This puts me in a bit of a panic hoping I didn&#x27;t put the temperature too high, as drying out my hair is the very last thing I want to do. It&#x27;s inconvenient. If the buttons were on the top of the straightener right below the temperature display, or was placed inside, below the plates like the herstyler does (so it&#x27;s completely out of the way), it&#x27;d be much easier and less stressful to use.  Mini Iron - I know this was a bonus, but it doesn&#x27;t appear as though it&#x27;s made from the same tourmaline-ceramic plates (I could be wrong). I choose the main iron specifically because tourmaline plates are better for the hair. I&#x27;m too scared to try the mini, so it seems like a bit of a waste even though the idea behind it was exciting. I really really wish I could use it, but I don&#x27;t want to risk damaging my hair. If it&#x27;s not actually the same material, I don&#x27;t understand how it&#x27;ll be of any use to people like me, which is a shame considering how often I travel and need touch-ups when down by the river or in humid weather.  Now for the PROS:  Floating Plates - This is big for me. Straighteners without floating plates will not press down firmly enough to make a difference in my hair without 4-5 swipes through, which causes damage and ultimately the dreaded frizz-head. I can use this one perhaps 1-2 times and get a satisfactory result when the heat isn&#x27;t all full potential (I don&#x27;t use full heat because of my fragile hair, I&#x27;m sure result would be better for those with hair who could tolerate it).  Temperature Control - My CHI only had one temperature: DEATH. Even before I started having problems with my hair, it was simply too hot and made a mess of my delicate curls. This flat iron has a dial on the side where you can adjust the temperature, and my favorite part, it stays consistent throughout the plates which prevents hot spots and uneven straightening power. I don&#x27;t have to worry about frying my hair, and with how it glides along the plates, there&#x27;s no snagging and yanking on individual strands.  Straightening Power - Between the consistent temperature of the plates and the plates themselves, I can straighten my hair in half the time it took with my CHI, since I didn&#x27;t have to keep unplugging it to let it cool down a little bit to avoid damaging my hair. 15-20 minutes isn&#x27;t bad considering how unruly my curls can be, and when the plates glide over my hair it doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m damaging it too badly. I haven&#x27;t seen any steam rising from the flat ironer, which is something I&#x27;ve dealt with before, so that was comforting. My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t control my problem areas too well, even with multiple passes. Perhaps I don&#x27;t have the temperature high enough, but given how my hair isI don&#x27;t want to risk additional damage. If you don&#x27;t have hair like mine, you shouldn&#x27;t be concerned about cranking up the dial to get a better result.  Design - It&#x27;s a lot more aesthically pleasing then the description image gives it credit for and the boxes/heat resistant carrying case are thoughtful additions. I&#x27;m frequently on the go, traveling, so being able to quickly pocket a hot flat iron is a nice touch.  Overall I really enjoy the product, it just can be difficult/stressful for me to use with my growing history of thin hair problems. I think anyone who has normal/thicker hair won&#x27;t run into many of the same problems. Just sucks to be in that percentage of people who have to constantly consider the well-being of their hair.</li>
            <li> Great flatiron! I love that you can choose the heat setting! Also, it doesn&#x27;t pull my hair at all when I&#x27;m using it! I would highly recommend this iron to anyone looking for high quality!</li>
            <li> Excellent I love it works fantastic for my thick hair!</li>
            <li> This is a well constructed quality flatiron. It is light in weight, heats up fast, and cools down very fast as well.  One plus for me is as my hair goes through the plates, they don&#x27;t pull my hair. I have very very long hair and thats the biggest problem I have with my old flatiron. BUT NOT WITH THIS ONE. The plates are so smooth and I only need to do 2 run-throughs and get pin straight hair. Product aside, they offer one of the best customer services in the online marketplace. I do 95% of my shopping online and have never come across a seller who in fact went above and beyond for their client. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This is a great iron!  Heats up super fast and works great!  Love the small iron that came with it.  It heats up just as fast and is hot!</li>
            <li> We bought this for our youngest daughter.  She has beautiful long curly hair.  Problem was, she wanted it straight!!  This flat iron works very fast so her hair isn&#x27;t damaged.</li>
