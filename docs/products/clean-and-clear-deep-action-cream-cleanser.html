            <li>I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS STUFF</li>
            <li>Best facewash I&#x27;ve ever had</li>
            <li>Very good product and service.</li>
            <li>With the marvelous tingling sensation on my face it has given me some great feeling skin.</li>
            <li>Remember after you cleanse you need a great moisturizer to nourish your face.</li>
            <li>When I purchased, it was two for $9 - a great deal.</li>
            <li>I use it with a Clairsonic Mia and get great results.</li>
            <li>This is a great product to use while in the shower.</li>
            <li>The price on amazon is amazing!</li>
            <li>and I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to suggest it to anyone who needs a good face wash.</li>
            <li>My skin doesn&#x27;t immediately feel like saran wrap on my skull after cleansing, so that&#x27;s also good.</li>
            <li>GOOD PRICE</li>
            <li>Very refreshing in the morning</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>The refreshing scent and cool feel of the cleanser worked wonders and was the best out of all of the cleansers out there that I tried (and believe me</li>
            <li>I loved the tingly clean feeling it gave my skin and seem to soak up quite a bit of oil.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite face wash</li>
            <li>this pack of 2 for just under 9 bucks is a phenomenal deal.</li>
            <li>but I was never as satisfied as I am with this cleanser</li>
            <li>Even though I no longer have much acne and oily skin, it still feels great on my face.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never tried this before, I would recommend giving it a try because even after about 15 years or so, this is still my favorite</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>For the price, I don&#x27;t know that you can do better.</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>I have used many products in the show to try and get rid of my acne.</li>
            <li>So, if you have more oily skin i would recommend this product</li>
            <li>Let it remain on your face while soaping up and be sure not to get any of it into your eyes, it does sting.</li>
            <li>Ok so I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for about a month now.</li>
            <li>I used to have oily skin and lots of acne ( before going on an intense acne treatment pill )and this was amazing!</li>
            <li>It is not harsh, but does a great job of removing make-up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve definitely had better, but the price was great</li>
            <li>Love the cool sensation on my face, always feel fresher and oil free after using.</li>
            <li>Really hard to find in Australia at a good price so happy to find on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great deal, especially when you sign up for Subscribe &amp; Save.</li>
            <li>I had red a lot of great reviews on this product for acne but knew it didn&#x27;t contain salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide</li>
            <li>It worked great for me then and even though it didn&#x27;t get rid of my acne, it really made my face feel much cleaner.</li>
            <li>I love the cool tingly feeling that leaves my face feeling fresh when I wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li>It keeps my face clean and prevents any unwanted breakouts or blemishes.</li>
            <li>The only good is that it gives a smooth feel to your skin and leaves it smelling like peppermint</li>
            <li>it got rid of all the grease and my skin would feel clean.</li>
            <li>I feel clean, but not &amp;#34;stripped&amp;#34; after washing my face.</li>
            <li>They say it doesn&#x27;t make their faces feel clean, either.</li>
            <li>Since we already have the Subscribe &amp; Save with Amazon, it was easy to add this to our shipment so we save even more money while still getting me my favorite facial cleanser!</li>
            <li>I suffer with mild acne breakouts.</li>
            <li>If youre not acne prone and have pretty normal skin, this is a nice product.</li>
            <li>If you have normal skin and love that tingle sensation</li>
            <li>I love that \\&quot;cool, fresh tingle,\\&quot; and it leaves my skin soft and clean.</li>
            <li>Clean &amp; Clear won&#x27;t compete with the boutique gel cleansers, but it&#x27;s an excellent everyday non-abrasive cream.</li>
            <li>Cleans very well and has a light mint smell/tingle to it.</li>
            <li>I very rarely get blemishes, and at age 51 I still have a smooth clear complexion.  </li>
            <li>I love the way this face wash makes my skin feel soft and so much cleaner than anything I&#x27;ve ever used before.</li>
            <li>AND I RECOMMENDED IT VERY MUCH</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many cleansers, and I keep going back to this one.</li>
            <li>The first couple weeks my skin did pretty well with this cleanser.</li>
            <li>Hot towel 6.</li>
            <li>My Teenage girls love it</li>
            <li>Throughout all of this time, and through some at times painful variation, I&#x27;ve now been able to integrate it mostly into this formula, that has served both myself and more importantly</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do much for my skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>am very satis fied</li>
            <li>For my skin type, not so much.</li>
            <li>So far, it&#x27;s working nicely, with an icy tingle I like in my cleansing products.</li>
            <li>Note I have tried other products and none have come close to my skin feeling and looking healthy as it does on this product.</li>
            <li>My face feels clean, fresh and there&#x27;s a slight cool tingling sensation for several minutes after it&#x27;s washed away, but nothing that&#x27;s uncomfortable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Today I am 32 and I am still using this product I actually swear by it, I have gotten lots of people to use it and they love it, plus I get compliments all the time about my skin when I meet new people whether professionally or socially.</li>
            <li>Big fan of the cleanser &amp; the fresh, tingly feeling after washing my face.</li>
            <li>These last couple weeks though my skin has become pretty oily and</li>
            <li>I started using Clean &amp; Clear Deep Action Cream Cleanser back when I was a teenager with acne and oily skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Johnson &amp; Johnson Clean &amp; Clear Oil Free Deep Action Cream Cleanser, on and off for at least two years.</li>
            <li>There is a sensitive skin version of this face wash if you need to try that too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product since I was 15 yrs old growing up in Toronto,</li>
            <li>I use this cleanser in combination with the dual action moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I used to have issues with adult acne, but no longer.</li>
            <li>2.Lather 3.Shave 4.Deep action cream 5.</li>
            <li>but this was the only new product I&#x27;ve added to beauty routine.</li>
            <li>Of course when you wash your face you are going to need a moisturizer and the product of choice for a 15 year old was Ponds back then.</li>
            <li>But now that i have normal to dry skin</li>
            <li>BUT if you have dry skin or even normal</li>
            <li>When you&#x27;re ready to rinse, this product rinses off clean and there&#x27;s no greasy residue left behind.</li>
            <li>I do have to scrub rather hard after wearing a face full of makeup</li>
            <li>Does the job, and it doesn&#x27;t over dry out my skin which I am sensitive to...</li>

            <li> When the container gets a little low, I sometimes have to shake it to mix the product up again.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s not a very macho thing to be doing, but it beats walking around with a faceful of zits.</li>
            <li> I usually pick up a tube or two from my local Military Exchange.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t remove all my eye makeup, but neither does any other cleanser I&#x27;ve tried.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is my favorite face wash and I have been using it for as long as I can remember. I love the cool tingly feeling that leaves my face feeling fresh when I wake up in the morning. It keeps my face clean and prevents any unwanted breakouts or blemishes. I do have to scrub rather hard after wearing a face full of makeup but it does eventually come off without using dedicated makeup remover. The price on amazon is amazing! Usually these cost about 6 bucks in CVS or another store.. this pack of 2 for just under 9 bucks is a phenomenal deal. I always order my face wash from amazon now! Plus, then I always have a backup for when I run out!</li>
            <li> I find this product fake.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product daily for probably 20 years (not exaggerating).  Every morning in the shower I put a little on a medium Buf Puf and scrub my face with it.  Result: I very rarely get blemishes, and at age 51 I still have a smooth clear complexion.  It&#x27;s not a very macho thing to be doing, but it beats walking around with a faceful of zits.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do much for my skin. I don&#x27;t have bad skin just the occasional breakouts but using this it made my skin breakout like I&#x27;ve never seen it all over my forehead. The only good is that it gives a smooth feel to your skin and leaves it smelling like peppermint but that&#x27;s it. This product sucks as far as acne and skin maintenance. I have combination skin by the way.</li>
            <li> I started using Clean &amp; Clear Deep Action Cream Cleanser back when I was a teenager with acne and oily skin. It worked great for me then and even though it didn&#x27;t get rid of my acne, it really made my face feel much cleaner. The refreshing scent and cool feel of the cleanser worked wonders and was the best out of all of the cleansers out there that I tried (and believe me, I tried A LOT). In recent years, I switched to other facial cleansers to try something new and save a little money but I was never as satisfied as I am with this cleanser so I have started using this again! Even though I no longer have much acne and oily skin, it still feels great on my face. I love the way this face wash makes my skin feel soft and so much cleaner than anything I&#x27;ve ever used before. There is a sensitive skin version of this face wash if you need to try that too. Since we already have the Subscribe &amp; Save with Amazon, it was easy to add this to our shipment so we save even more money while still getting me my favorite facial cleanser! If you&#x27;ve never tried this before, I would recommend giving it a try because even after about 15 years or so, this is still my favorite and I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to suggest it to anyone who needs a good face wash. I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product! I&#x27;ve been using this product since I was 15 yrs old growing up in Toronto, back then I had occasional breakouts but when I found this product it all went away. Of course when you wash your face you are going to need a moisturizer and the product of choice for a 15 year old was Ponds back then. Today I am 32 and I am still using this product I actually swear by it, I have gotten lots of people to use it and they love it, plus I get compliments all the time about my skin when I meet new people whether professionally or socially. I LOVE LOVE this product. Note I have tried other products and none have come close to my skin feeling and looking healthy as it does on this product. If I could share a picture on here before I started 17 years ago, I would. Remember after you cleanse you need a great moisturizer to nourish your face.</li>
            <li> For the price, I don&#x27;t know that you can do better. When I purchased, it was two for $9 - a great deal. Cleans very well and has a light mint smell/tingle to it. When the container gets a little low, I sometimes have to shake it to mix the product up again. Clean &amp; Clear won&#x27;t compete with the boutique gel cleansers, but it&#x27;s an excellent everyday non-abrasive cream. I use it with a Clairsonic Mia and get great results.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry, acne-prone skin, so finding an acne cleanser that doesn&#x27;t overly dry my face is a must. I used this in combination with the Clarisonic Mia 2 exfoliating face brush once a day, at night. So far, it&#x27;s working nicely, with an icy tingle I like in my cleansing products. I had some existing blemishes, and they shrank after a couple days of using this. My skin doesn&#x27;t immediately feel like saran wrap on my skull after cleansing, so that&#x27;s also good. The only complaint I have is that cleanser smells a bit unpleasant, but considering that fragrances have a tendency to do something bad to my skin, it&#x27;s a negligible complaint.</li>
            <li> Bought a face scrubber and this off of here and I love it</li>
            <li> Excellent product for the price.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years now. With the marvelous tingling sensation on my face it has given me some great feeling skin. I only use it once every 3-4 days but this is my preferred &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; when I shave my face.</li>
            <li> I have used many products in the show to try and get rid of my acne. This tingles and sometimes is a bit over bearing but you know its deep cleaning.</li>
            <li> This product is for people with oily skin! I used to have oily skin and lots of acne ( before going on an intense acne treatment pill )and this was amazing! it got rid of all the grease and my skin would feel clean. But now that i have normal to dry skin this doesn&#x27;t work at all! It makes my feel skin feel dryer and actually makes me brake out. So, if you have more oily skin i would recommend this product BUT if you have dry skin or even normal i would definitely not recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many cleansers, and I keep going back to this one. I love that \\&quot;cool, fresh tingle,\\&quot; and it leaves my skin soft and clean. It doesn&#x27;t remove all my eye makeup, but neither does any other cleanser I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s a great deal, especially when you sign up for Subscribe &amp; Save.</li>
            <li> Not as abrasive as you may think... Does the job, and it doesn&#x27;t over dry out my skin which I am sensitive to...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a month now and see no difference in it and any other cleanser.</li>
            <li> I use this cleanser in combination with the dual action moisturizer. I used to have issues with adult acne, but no longer. It is not harsh, but does a great job of removing make-up. I feel clean, but not &amp;#34;stripped&amp;#34; after washing my face.</li>
            <li> Been using this cleanser for years. Really hard to find in Australia at a good price so happy to find on Amazon. Love the cool sensation on my face, always feel fresher and oil free after using.</li>
            <li> Big fan of the cleanser &amp; the fresh, tingly feeling after washing my face. Came across it when borrowing it from a friend.  Very refreshing in the morning</li>
            <li> Very good product and service. The ítems arrived in time and the price was the best in that moment.&lt;br /&gt;I am very satis fied</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Johnson &amp; Johnson Clean &amp; Clear Oil Free Deep Action Cream Cleanser, on and off for at least two years. I usually pick up a tube or two from my local Military Exchange. This is a great product to use while in the shower. Just squeeze out a dab about the size of a quarter into the palm of your hand, whip it up, apply and massage all over your face. Let it remain on your face while soaping up and be sure not to get any of it into your eyes, it does sting. When you&#x27;re ready to rinse, this product rinses off clean and there&#x27;s no greasy residue left behind. My face feels clean, fresh and there&#x27;s a slight cool tingling sensation for several minutes after it&#x27;s washed away, but nothing that&#x27;s uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please rate this review if you found it helpful.</li>
            <li> Ok so I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for about a month now. If you have normal skin and love that tingle sensation this cream cleanser is for you. For my skin type, not so much. I have oily acne prone skin. I suffer with mild acne breakouts. I had red a lot of great reviews on this product for acne but knew it didn&#x27;t contain salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide but i thought I&#x27;d give it a shot.The first couple weeks my skin did pretty well with this cleanser. I loved the tingly clean feeling it gave my skin and seem to soak up quite a bit of oil. These last couple weeks though my skin has become pretty oily and and I&#x27;m getting pimples all over my forehead that I&#x27;ve never really had before!! Not sure what happened but this was the only new product I&#x27;ve added to beauty routine. Guess I&#x27;ll be going back to proactive!</li>
            <li> Were the United States government not so inclined to over-classify everything, it wouldn&#x27;t be very difficult to discover from various embassies around the world that I&#x27;ve routinely used this product since the late &#x27;90s, and that to this date it remains a sturdy (or &amp;#34;stalwart&amp;#34; as my dermatologist routinely kept suggesting ,unsolicited mind you, in a few initial drafts of this) pillar in my facial regimen. Throughout all of this time, and through some at times painful variation, I&#x27;ve now been able to integrate it mostly into this formula, that has served both myself and more importantly my public, quite efficiently. As follows to those concerned :1.Hot towel 2.Lather 3.Shave 4.Deep action cream 5. Hot towel 6. Rinse.</li>
            <li> Both of my girls have used this and hated it. It has menthol in it, which is supposed to make your skin &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34;, but it actually makes it sting. They say it doesn&#x27;t make their faces feel clean, either.</li>
            <li> I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS STUFF, REACH BEFORE I WAS EXPECTING, GOOD PRICE AND I RECOMMENDED IT VERY MUCH</li>
            <li> My Teenage girls love it</li>
            <li> Best facewash I&#x27;ve ever had</li>
            <li> If youre not acne prone and have pretty normal skin, this is a nice product. I&#x27;ve definitely had better, but the price was great and I dont regret it.</li>
