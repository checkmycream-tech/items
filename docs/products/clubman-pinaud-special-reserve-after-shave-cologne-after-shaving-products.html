            <li>Once and always the best.</li>
            <li>The best way I can describe the scent is: this is what I imagine Indiana Jones smelled like after a shave.  </li>

            <li>awesome product</li>
            <li>best recommendation is that if you tend to shave and run out of the house in a hurry, then save this one for another time.</li>
            <li>This smells suave and wonderful.  </li>

            <li>It was then he realized, that Netherfield was not  his beautiful house, our mum, was not his beautiful wife.  </li>
            <li>This gives me excellent application as well as good strength of the scent WITHOUT being overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the scent?</li>
            <li>stuff is excellent and I will be ordering more when I run out, which considering its strength, won&#x27;t be any time soon!</li>

            <li>A great perfume company for the guys who don&#x27;t want to be overwhelmed with smell.  </li>
            <li>Happy with the service.</li>
            <li>After reading some great reviews, I picked this up and....</li>
            <li>It has a sort of learthery smell that mixes great with Brut stick deodorant.  </li>
            <li>it is a great smelling aftershave/cologne.</li>
            <li>Smells like your great grandmother and grandpa after they procreated.</li>
            <li>But the box smelled great...</li>
            <li>Another great Clubman product.</li>
            <li>This one has a great smell and the wife enjoys it, but it isn&#x27;t varied.</li>
            <li>They have a great \\&quot;classic\\&quot; scent to them that makes me feel like I&#x27;m shaving like my grandfathers did.    </li>
            <li>Smells great</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s great value for the price.</li>
            <li>great smells....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one I&#x27;m happy to add to my collection of aftershaves.</li>
            <li>Scent lasts all day, and smells great.</li>
            <li>all Pinaud products are great.</li>
            <li>if you like it your going to be happy.  </li>
            <li>, it has a great &amp;#34;old fashioned&amp;#34; barber shop scent and soothes your skin after a shave.</li>
            <li>Pinaud is great aftershave for&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought this stuff is great.</li>
            <li>all in one bottle at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very nice</li>
            <li>Pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Fragrance is pleasant to me and others and not over powering.</li>
            <li>I also do not find the scent as pleasant as Clubmen &amp;#34;Original&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>and I am glad it lingers for hours because it is very pleasant.    </li>
            <li>Very good would love to see it in a lotion form.</li>
            <li>At the time, my  father was mourning his beloved Scottish Deerhound, Chauncey.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a good winter time after shave.  </li>
            <li>Well it gets really good as it sets in.</li>
            <li>Give it a fair shot.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li>I regard all CLUBMAN products as superior......  </li>
            <li>Good burn when applied after a close shave.  </li>
            <li>Good stuff</li>
            <li>This does not smell good.</li>
            <li>this sent would cover the B.O., but not in a good way.</li>
            <li>Not as good a smell as Clubman Hairspray.</li>
            <li>It smells so good for an inexpensive aftershave.</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>Wife likes the scent, so all good.</li>
            <li>Still, a good buy and a manly scent.</li>
            <li>Smell good and has good strength but its not at an intolerable level undiluted.  </li>
            <li>It makes my work shop smell good though.</li>
            <li>It was good.</li>
            <li>Good stuff, will buy again.</li>
            <li>Good product and the price cannot be beat.</li>
            <li>This is good stuff been using it off and on for years.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve had Clubman Pinaud, then you know how good of a product they make.  </li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>shave you get with a good DE razor.</li>
            <li>I like the scent, good value.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a good quality after-shave product</li>
            <li>But my experience was not as good as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>All in all, a good addition to the Clubman line.</li>
            <li>This is a very unique (and very good) cologne/aftershave.</li>
            <li>The original scent is awesome</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used their original Clubman aftershave for quite a while and have also started using the Citrus Musk (both are also excellent).</li>
            <li>I get a kind of matte feeling to my skin which is rather pleasant.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t it&#x27;s just now a pleasant smell to be honest.</li>
            <li>Very smooth after shave and another great Pinaud product.  </li>
            <li>Great smell, clean feel and great price.</li>
            <li>Great aftershave love it.</li>
            <li>A lot of people love it, which is great, but</li>
            <li>powerful, wonderful stuff.</li>
            <li>very satisfied with this purchase</li>
            <li>Did not like the razor they used to do detail trim around the ears, but loved the smell of this kind of after shave they put on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just my favorite aftershave -- at any price!.  </li>
            <li>If you like me are searching for that scent that walks the fine line between Dapper Gentleman and Lumberjack, this is a great start.</li>
            <li>Very good product and worth the price</li>
            <li>I put this on and I couldn&#x27;t figure if liked it or not .</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t honestly tell you that I smell leather, as others have claimed.</li>
            <li>and i smelled the top, and i got this good smell of manliness.</li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>and I liked them.</li>
            <li>but after I put it on she liked it.  </li>
            <li>The scent is nice and it gets even nicer as the day goes by.</li>
            <li>I liked the smell of this.</li>
            <li>a nice plus.</li>
            <li>Nice musky fragrance.</li>
            <li>This scent lasts and has a nice linger throughout the day.</li>
            <li>BUT this stuff is nice..</li>
            <li>and it settles into a nice scent that lasts all day.</li>
            <li>but it mellows out nicely.</li>
            <li>none of friends liked it</li>
            <li>CLUBMAN RESERVE COMPLEMENT MY CLIENTS HAIRCUT WITH A NICE SPICYSCENT</li>
            <li>Aftershave\\&quot; and started wearing it when my wife discovered she liked it.</li>
            <li>nice alcohol burn after shaving, tones your skin,</li>
            <li>nice slap in the face to wake you up and take on the day.  </li>
            <li>This is well made product with a nice balance of aromas, and it stays with you.  </li>
            <li>Kind of reminded me of my Dr&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li>Give it a try you may like it, to each his own.</li>
            <li>This stuff smell&#x27;s nice</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s also an aftershave that feels great on the skin and gives a good tingle after a fresh shave.</li>
            <li>I bought this expecting a nice leather smell based on reviews.</li>
            <li>After two hours I liked the scent.</li>
            <li>You will not find a more refreshing and great smelling than this.</li>
            <li>Its kind of woodsy but in a smokehouse sort of way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;burns</li>
            <li>Not the kind of scent I was expecting</li>
            <li>With so many people talking about how great it is, I figured it was a safe bet</li>
            <li>I got this as a gift for my brother, kind of as a gag sort of thing.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say I&#x27;ve never smelled an aftershave like this.</li>
            <li>I started with the original Pinaud Clubman scent, and it was great.  </li>
            <li>Okay, first off, this stuff smells great!</li>
            <li>This one is nice, though a very strong scent.</li>
            <li>This is great, smells smoky, its a pleasant scent, Stings a lot if you have a nick(thats how you know its a real aftershave).</li>
            <li>After it had been on for about 30 minutes it took on a very pleasant smell that my wife really likes.</li>
            <li>A gift your man will appreciate and you both will enjoy the pleasant aroma when he wears this.</li>
            <li>; Simply put, this is a good product, with a wonderful smell.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel great, but I can&#x27;t help but feel super self-conscience about the over powering scent at work.</li>
            <li>Very strong scent.  </li>
            <li>FETCH ME MY CLUBMAN SPECIAL RESERVE!!  </li>
            <li>I splash this on after shaving for a clean fresh feeling and a wonderful fragrance.</li>
            <li>Special Reserve is a heavier yet sophisticated scent-wonderful after a shave and smells great 4-5 hours after I put it on.</li>
            <li>Ceder, Ceder, Ceder, love it, warm ceder, clove mix.....</li>
            <li>So far, I am very happy with it</li>
            <li>You see, this stuff is STRONG!</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t think it was as good as the bay rum or the original scent.</li>
            <li>it really started smelling good!  </li>
            <li>great scent and worth much more than the price.</li>
            <li>It is not only a great smell, but it is also great as a toning after shave.</li>
            <li>Once you put it on and let it mingle with your own body chemistry, it really eases up and turns into a very nice spicy/smokey scent.  </li>
            <li>These are great for decanting &amp;#34;drug store&amp;#34; after shaves out of their plastic bottles to remove that plastic funkiness that all Pinaud&#x27;s seem to have at first.  </li>
            <li>I feel that it is more suitable as a cologne, not an aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s fine by me!  </li>
            <li>Gives a very smooth, close feel to your shave.  </li>
            <li>While the original Clubman is a great aftershave and a great scent, its bygone popularity leads it to being considered an &#x27;old man&#x27;s&#x27; smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She very much favored the original but was not put off by the Special Reserve at all.</li>
            <li>The aftershave itself works fine - nice tingle without drying skin - but it is the smell I do not like.  </li>
            <li>Okay let me start off my review by saying this is one of those hit-or-miss scents.</li>
            <li>I love the smell</li>
            <li>Not my favorite smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to say it&#x27;s Sandalwood, and quite potent.  </li>
            <li>A generally nice and thrifty product line of which I do enjoy.</li>
            <li>There are layers to this after shave - so many scents you can pick up on.  </li>
            <li>Love its&#x27; \\&quot;Old-Fashioned\\&quot; aroma...</li>
            <li>I love this after shave.</li>
            <li>It is potent and lasts for hours.</li>
            <li>I know there are many people out there who love this cologne.  </li>
            <li>and I think that most guys my age would probably do well to stay away from it.</li>
            <li>It is my favorite of all the Pinaud scents.  </li>
            <li>Those perfumes are really better suited for women.  </li>
            <li>I cant praise this wonderful aftershave enough tho</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many brands to be sure.....  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I get many compliments on this after shave.</li>
            <li>Refreshing, never overpowers.  </li>
            <li>Most are too perfumy and aggravate my allergies.</li>
            <li>One of the most refined gentlemanly scents I have used and I have used a lot.</li>
            <li>despite all the&lt;br /&gt;other notes mentioned by others, i sense an interesting vegetal, celery-like note.</li>
            <li>I love this robust scent.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;M GLAD</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S BECOME ONE OF MY FAVORITE AFTER SHAVE/COLOGNES.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, I read many reviews of the manly, woodsy, smokey scent and felt that this was what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>This, is stronger and the smell is more robust.</li>
            <li>I stuck with it for three days, and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>This is one of my all time favorite fragrances.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m fairly sure that this is what my grandpa wore,</li>
            <li>To my nose, it&#x27;s a combination of the best elements of Brut and English Leather.</li>
            <li>It is bolder, more leathery and musky, with overtones of tobacco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent soothing aftershave that has a lasting fragrance so don&#x27;t expect to be able to use another cologne over it.</li>
            <li>More of a cologne smell than aftershave and sticks with you for a while.  </li>
            <li>Go for the straight Clubman aftershave; it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>HOW EVER MOST WILL KID AROUND WITH YOU</li>
            <li>I love Clubman products.  </li>
            <li>You my love it though.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite aftershaves.</li>
            <li>This is a surprisingly potent composition from House of Pinaud...</li>
            <li>what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li>I love Clubman products.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this stuff.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m getting creative.</li>
            <li>I love Pinaud&#x27;s aftershave.  </li>
            <li>I used more this time</li>
            <li>and I do love that one.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it now, and so does my gf.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic after shave!  </li>
            <li>and I love them all</li>
            <li>I love all the Pinaud scents so it was no surprise that I like this one.</li>
            <li>On top of being a cologne</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not so sure if I&#x27;m a fan of this or not.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t mind the scent and enjoyed the change of pace.  </li>
            <li>, this scent is truly a manly scent, I love it...</li>
            <li>but i love it</li>
            <li>Takes the sting off your face love this stuff</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t describe it any better.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re around or over thirty, like myself, it&#x27;s perfect for that scent that your dad or gramps most likely had.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned from experience that many women will compliment it and ask what it is.</li>
            <li>I would call it &amp;#34;vegetal&amp;#34; for lack of a better discription.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Wish there would have been a better description</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE Clubman by Pinaud</li>
            <li>Love all the Pinaud stuff ..</li>
            <li>is more preferable and attracts women more.</li>
            <li>I too would love this stuff.</li>
            <li>This aftershave smells a lot better after you let it mellow out for an hour or so.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s just a pansy for not being able to take the heat.</li>
            <li>My wife likes it better than the Clubman bay rum.</li>
            <li>I love the scent although will admit that it may not be for everyone.</li>
            <li>This is an exceptional product at a very affordable price!!  </li>
            <li>Smells good, although it isn&#x27;t super strong, so</li>
            <li>This is a very original scent that I put on whenever I want to make an impression.</li>
            <li>It is unique, it does smell nice.  </li>
            <li>Smelling it from the bottle it had a nice rich scent that reminded me of cologne that my grandfather used to wear.  </li>
            <li>Always liked the clean smell.</li>
            <li>Great classic aftershave.</li>
            <li>Warm, woody,  sweet, smokey, sexy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a good scent to wear to work or to sweat it off at the gym on a hot day.</li>
            <li>Pretty good price for what you get.</li>
            <li>it gives you a nice cool feeling</li>
            <li>feels good on your face, but to musky smelling for me If you want to get a headache first thing in the morning</li>
            <li>It can seem quite strong at first, but then settles into a pleasant spicy scent.</li>
            <li>To me it smells okay, a strong smokey, leathery fragrance, but my wife loves it.</li>
            <li>Okay, so this one is a bit strong for my taste..</li>
            <li>here!&lt;br /&gt;It goes on a tad strong but mellows out into the scent you would expect after taking a dame to the talkies and grabbing a couple of sidecar nightcaps at your favorite gin joint.</li>
            <li>I enjoy many of the Cluman scents, this is my favorite at the moment.</li>
            <li>I liked it back then, in the sixties, so I think this one will make me happy too.  </li>
            <li>CLUBMAN Special Reserve is a wonderful blend that smells something similar to Halston with more of a spiced woodsy overtone to it.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure if we liked it at first, but love it on my husband and price</li>
            <li>Great old school scent!</li>
            <li>sure on someone else it might smell fine - just doesn&#x27;t ring well in my nose out of the bottle or on my skin with a 15 minute drydown.</li>
            <li>, I decanted about 5 ounces into a glass bottle with shaker top that Amazon sells for those folks who make and bottle their own hot sauce.  </li>
            <li>At first  I wasn&#x27;t sure if I liked this .</li>
            <li>and when it hits your face it has the traditional clubman sting but than it transforms itself into a breath of sweetness and spicy majesty that is incredible.</li>
            <li>great old time spice aroma.</li>
            <li>great smell, like the barber shops of old.</li>
            <li>Reasonable cost, smells great, reminds me of the good old barbershop days gone by.</li>
            <li>Although I don&#x27;t possess the sophisticated sniffer that others do, the main scent that I notice is &amp;#34;tobacco.&amp;#34; It reminds me pleasantly of a humidor filled with cigars, *not* an overflowing ashtray.</li>
            <li>This IS Special!</li>
            <li>Just be sure you like the scent before you buy, it&#x27;s very powerful.</li>
            <li>The more I smell this on myself, the more I&#x27;m loving this aftershave and this will be added to my weekly rotation of classic, timeless scents.</li>
            <li>I had used this Special Reserve formulation for many years, decades really, since my college years, and I LOVED it.</li>
            <li>Love the original scent and thought I&#x27;d give this a try.</li>
            <li>but I prefer the original a bit better.</li>
            <li>I recommend the original scent which I love.</li>
            <li>The original is still my favorite,,, if that gives you a hint to my preferences,,,,but</li>
            <li>However, it is not a scent for those who like bright and vibrant scents.</li>
            <li>It has a strong smell almost like cinnamon</li>
            <li>Strong so I dilute it with water.</li>
            <li>It is not so strong that I cannot wear another EDP as well.</li>
            <li>It is strong going on</li>
            <li>For one, it says, \\&quot;aftershave cologne\\&quot;, it should be ranked up there as eau de toilette because it is really strong.</li>
            <li>It is strong stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To me, it had a strong character of sandalwood.  </li>
            <li>The scents coming off it are a myriad of spices, some clove and some sweetness, with a strong leather backbone.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smells like strong musk, I get notes of elk piss, possum breath, and moose</li>
            <li>Musky and too strong.</li>
            <li>Strong, musky, and persistent.  </li>
            <li>It is strong and does not seem to go away.  </li>
            <li>In fact, after trying countless colognes over the years, I&#x27;ve settled on what are the two cheapest as also being the two best: Special Reserve and the original Pinaud Clubman.</li>
            <li>The Special Reserve is probably my favorite.</li>
            <li>THIS IS A SPECIAL SCENT BY PINAUD, WHICH IS REFRESHINGLY MANLY AND LONG-LASTING.</li>
            <li>I like Pinuad&#x27;s line of products and love the Clubman aftershave, but I do not like the Special Reserve aftershave.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong at first, but then mellows nicely.</li>
            <li>yet it almost immediately dissipates into a very smooth, robust smell with a bold full bodied smell that hints at many flavors that you can&#x27;t quite put your finger on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soothing, and smells very manly &amp; very sophisticated.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s old school smells great, works great smell last all day but isn&#x27;t overpowering you&#x27;ll just catch a wiff of it from time to time to remind you</li>
            <li>It goes well with crisp, almost warm weather.</li>
            <li>Special Reserve is a very unique scent.  </li>
            <li>The calm happy grandpas smell that comes from Clubman Vanilla, Bay Rum, or Classic</li>
            <li>The aftershave itself is fine,</li>
            <li>This one smells better than the original IMO, but the original lasts a bit longer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I listened to all the reviews saying to give it a chance before making too quick of a judgement.  </li>
            <li>To me it is a pleasant, masculine scent that is not overpowering but stays with you all day.  </li>
            <li>I tend to gravitate towards Musk if it is light and not too strong and prefer citrus-like odors over ones that are floral or botanical.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not entirely unpleasant, and I like the leathery tones it has, but I just can&#x27;t recommend it after one too many headaches.</li>
            <li>Like another reviewer said, very strong when you first out it on.</li>
            <li>Very strong and smokey when the bottle is first opened.</li>
            <li>Nothing like original clubman.&lt;br /&gt;very strong leathery muscky type smell.</li>
            <li>This was a huge exception, though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not made from scorpion venom or the gonads of a great white shark.  </li>
            <li>I like it too, but we all know her opinion is the important one.</li>
            <li>any case, I do enjoy the smell and use it every so often</li>
            <li>Smooth for the aftershave splash.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>and it last almost all day great product</li>
            <li>used lightly.</li>
            <li>BYPLE claims to sell this product with FREE shipping.</li>
            <li>Cheap garbage.</li>
            <li>After sending them the code from the bottom of the bottle, they said the bottle was &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; and therefore had changed, perhaps b/c of exposure to heat or light.</li>
            <li>it being sold as cheap as it is</li>
            <li>like scents that are manly and also smell fresh or dare I even say refreshing.</li>
            <li>It still lasts forever though, so definitely a good buy for guys who don&#x27;t want to smell like ten year olds any more.</li>
            <li>As an elderly man I have never, ever received so many compliments in over 40 years of shaving on how good I smell, as I do when wearing Clubman Pinaud aftershaves... especially from the Mom&#x27;s of the dance studio where I take my Grandson.....</li>
            <li>I still prefer the original clubman scent which carries that good old fashioned barbershop quality.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very powerful scent and smells like someones</li>
            <li>Ok so I made this waaay better by mixing it with Clubman Classic Vanilla.</li>
            <li>Trust me its like a light musk meets the original clubman and out came perfection.</li>
            <li>I find both scents to be pleasingly light and clean.</li>
            <li>Has real alcohol in it so expect a bit of a burn if you managed to nick yourself pretty good while shaving.</li>
            <li>Super inexpensive and strong manly fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I find nothing Special about it, and as there is an unlimited supply and available to non-insiders of Clubman, why is it a reserve?  </li>
            <li>a fairly powerful fragrance with a worthy longevity, respectable sillage (when applied judiciously) being sold at what could be considered &amp;#34;bargain basement&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Have original clubman and vanilla .</li>
            <li>but I prefer the original blend.</li>
            <li>Basically,same as the original.</li>
            <li>Unique aroma and</li>
            <li>I think I will stick with either the Bay Rum or Original Clubman scent.</li>
            <li>Actually, if a stronger more lasting version of this was made it would be a perfect evening cologne    </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t make the mistake of thinking that this is like the original Clubman where you can splash it on your face and the scent will fade.</li>
            <li>Maybe this was because I am used to the original Clubman where I splash my face with it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the original Clubman for a couple years now.</li>
            <li>I would stick to the original scent</li>
            <li>My best description would be &amp;#34;leathery overtones.&amp;#34;  Not sure what else to say about it.</li>
            <li>stick  with original.</li>
            <li>Sticking with the original sent.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard people describe it as smoky, musky, floral, rich.</li>
            <li>I like it a lot more now than I did at first.</li>
            <li>The initial smell is bit well strange but after a refreshing splash on the face and a minute later the aromas blend very nicely and leave a very very pleasant smell to enjoy for the day.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the Virgin Island Bay Rum, Classic Clubman, and the Vanilla, and enjoyed them all (especially the Vanilla, that stuff is great).  </li>
            <li>I like to get this one when I want a change-fresh and clean smell.</li>
            <li>I have both the Original and the Special Reserve.</li>
            <li>Compared to the original Clubman, I find the Special reserve to be much better, but that is just because I really didn&#x27;t like the Original at all.</li>
            <li>, I AM HERE, not the Special Reserve.  </li>
            <li>The Special Reserve is something I will keep around when the mood hits me.</li>
            <li>There is not a hint of daffodils and strawberries in Clubman Special Reserve.  </li>
            <li>The special reserve gave me a headache</li>
            <li>so I wanted to try the Special Reserve.</li>
            <li>so when I splashed on the Special Reserve and the scent came forth</li>
            <li>Clubman PInaud Special Reserve</li>
            <li>After Shave, not the Special Reserve.</li>
            <li>In trying to change up the medicine cabinet I tried the Special Reserve.  </li>
            <li>When I saw this Special Reserve</li>
            <li>Not &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; but nothing special.</li>
            <li>I had never heard of Special Reserve before, so I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Right on!</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this purchase and no other after shave will come in contact with my face except Pinaud.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a LOT stronger than I&#x27;d expected, but the scent is great.</li>
            <li>My opinion is that it&#x27;s hits the nose good bit stronger than the regular clubman scent.</li>
            <li>Instead, it smells a bit sweet and perfumy but it is not obnoxious or cloying.</li>
            <li>Good enough for me.</li>
            <li>The scent is unique and reminds me of my very first after shave years ago.</li>
            <li>The smell is like old fashion kind.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend immediately said she liked it and said wow.</li>
            <li>Good product but quantity (6ozs) seem a bit ON the short side.</li>
            <li>i bought my husband two colognes to go with his straight razor, and this one is his favorite.</li>
            <li>You get notes of cloves, coffee, sweet spices, bourbon.</li>
            <li>Stronger than the regular Clubman and in a good way.</li>
            <li>So Sweet</li>
            <li>Not bad</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s not bad.  </li>
            <li>but it is pleasant, will not offend due to strong odor those around you.  </li>
            <li>I love the classic barber shop smell of the Original Clubman.  </li>
            <li>Definitely a strong masculine fragrance even though it does smell sweet and spicey at first; and it kind of reminds me of an aftershave a man would wear out during the winter or at night when he&#x27;s going out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After this pleasant experience I decided to try a few more of the Clubman line of aftershaves.</li>
            <li>It may seem really strong at first when you put it on, but it dissipates and blends well without being overpowering.</li>
            <li>Pretty strong scent.  </li>
            <li>It was really strong the first hour then started to mellow out.</li>
            <li>you like bold, classic scents like Aqua Velva and Brut, you&#x27;ll LOVE Special Reserve.</li>
            <li>I know most of you do not care what my preferences are, however by sharing this it will explain why I didn&#x27;t like the Special reserve and if you have similar likes, then you may avoid this product for something more your style.</li>
            <li>This stuff (like the other Clubman products I&#x27;ve tried) is great.</li>
            <li>It is strong at first but quickly disperses, leaving a mild fragrance.</li>
            <li>I guess it diffuses quickly so others don&#x27;t smell it</li>
            <li>After trying the Original and Bay Rum (My favorite so far) scent I wanted to try the Special Reserve.</li>
            <li>I have read so many posts on Shaving forums (yes, these do exist) that special reserve seems to be a HUGE favorite within the wet shaving community.</li>
            <li>A friend had the greenish version which blew me away; when I purchased my own bottle, I evidently received a new batch.  </li>
            <li>Bottle is pretty cheap.  </li>
            <li>The scent is strong, bold, and very manly.    </li>
            <li>The Special Reserve smells woodsy and musky right out of the bottle</li>
            <li>Its really unique and may take a certain brand of &amp;#34;dude&amp;#34; to pull it off!</li>
            <li>me, an aftershave should be bracing, bold and fresh.</li>
            <li>Bought this and loved it, last long, smells strong BUT NOT overpowering or overwhelming..</li>
            <li>Whether you&#x27;re dressed down for &amp;#34;The Treasure of the Sierra Madres&amp;#34; or up for &amp;#34;Casablanca&amp;#34; - you will have that perfect blend of masculine strength and dapper fashion-sense.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy Clubman original, Classic Vanilla and Virgin Island Bay Rum.  </li>
            <li>I also have the original Pinaud aftershave that I like pretty well, but this stuff while I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on it</li>
            <li>I REALLY like it!!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this aftershave, its unlike any others in a very special way.</li>
            <li>if you personally like this strong odor, keep in mind that most folks around you will find it foul and offensive.</li>
            <li>My brother didn&#x27;t much care for it because it is alcohol based, but it&#x27;s fine by me.</li>
            <li>This is a great inexpensive cologne for everyday use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The woodsy smell of the laurel bay evaporates after a few hours, but you&#x27;ll still smell great - the scent evolves throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Love the old school scent</li>
            <li>The scent and feel just seem to &amp;#34;go&amp;#34; with colder temps as opposed to the menthol after shaves like Floid Blue which are definitely warm weather after shaves.  </li>
            <li>Good delivered as expected.</li>
            <li>I have really liked the fresh feel on my shaved face and the similar fragrance to that patted on by the barber.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not your grand pa&#x27;s Old Spice or Hi Karate.  </li>
            <li>not disappointing in the least...as it develops, there is alot of complexity while it mellows.</li>
            <li>Reminds me of some of the scents I came across in highschool that I felt were for more mature men.  </li>
            <li>It does last all day, so that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>You will love this if you still go to a barber shop, remember Harley&#x27;s with seats that held two and the tri five Chevys, still have one of each, all in all a very pleasent scent and very manly, and I often get complements on from the ladies</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite aftershave, and I am a collector of colognes and aftershaves.  </li>
            <li>Powerful scent that lasts for hours.</li>
            <li>Will buy another one of a different kind.  </li>
            <li>so far my favorite.</li>
            <li>It has a powerful scent, and not one that I found too favorable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth a try for those who haven&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>When you want a darker more masculine scent.</li>
            <li>This is like a good Aftershave that&#x27;s been aged for years.  </li>
            <li>May not be for everyone but might be worth a try at this price.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s definitely lighter and a nice change of pace once in a while.   </li>
            <li>This scent is also STRONG so be mindful of that with this particular aftershave.  </li>
            <li>Many wet shavers love the original Clubman because it has a timeless barber-shoppy scent that just smells good, refreshing, a little powdery and yet is masculine.</li>
            <li>Very powerful, very manly,</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a more gentle bay-rum scent, however, it is a very strong and spicy scent--much more pungent than Old Spice, and less sweet.  </li>
            <li>I also received the Musk and Vanilla in the same order and love those two as well as the Original...</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m able to smell more of the smokey and cedar scent that other reviews have stated.</li>
            <li>Very different...quite unique fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I really like the original scent</li>
            <li>These and other &amp;#34;modern day&amp;#34; douchebags would be wise to avoid any clubman product.</li>
            <li>I compare it thusly: when a man gets ready for work in the morning, he wears Clubman Original.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re in the right mood, then you&#x27;ll like it.  </li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>this is right there with it in my cabinet..</li>
            <li>If you want a cologne that has a distinctly masculine scent this is an excellent one to try and will cost you very little.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, I am a huge fan of the classic Clubman \\&quot;barber shop\\&quot; products: Aftershave, talc &amp; shampoo.  </li>
            <li>This product was a decent buy and has a light scent and was just what was advertised in the ad.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cologne, and an excellent one at that, which smells and lasts much better than some very expensive colognes and eau de toilettes I&#x27;ve worn.</li>
            <li>Supremely old school with the bay rum- perfect for evenings out as it has a little more spice than regular Clubman.</li>
            <li>I would much prefer to wear these than the Special Reserve.  </li>
            <li>But, perhaps I have been punched in the nose too many times or maybe I have had a stroke that I didn&#x27;t know about because I find this to be more of a powdery, slightly floral scent when applied to my face.</li>
            <li>At first it&#x27;s fresh.</li>
            <li>say you bathed in aftershave and give you a funny look because of the distinct scent.</li>
            <li>Special Reserve has a clean, masculine scent.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of classic aftershaves, and an avid CLUBMAN fan</li>
            <li>It calms down my face after a good DE Safety razor shave.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is NOT like the classic barbershop scent of the original.</li>
            <li>Strong and spicy at first, 2 hour later it is perfect and subtle</li>
            <li>As a long time user of the classic Clubman, this is my first purchase of the Special Reserve, and I absolutely love the scent!</li>
            <li>but this scent has grown on me and will sit on the shelf next to my Original Pinaud Clubman, Old Spice, and soon two nice bottles of Pinaud Clubman Vanilla and Bay Rum.</li>
            <li>IT HAS A VERY PLEASENT MASCULINE AROMA WITHOUT BEING OVER POWERING AND LADIES SEEM TO LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>Be warned it has a Strong and Powerful Scent but after hearing such strong approval from the ladies I&#x27;m going to make it my main</li>
            <li>but I doubt I will purchase it again, though I do like its old smell, but it is really strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product, but I will try a different scent next time...</li>
            <li>On the other hand, this Special Reserve was a lot more masculine, and had a more spicy and musky scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong at first, much like the Classic, so be a bit conservative with your &amp;#34;splash&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>My normal go-to AS is the original Clubman, but this one may even surpass that.</li>
            <li>This has gone right up to the top of the list along with the regular Clubman Pinaud.  </li>
            <li>It may be perfect for you, not strong enough for you, depends on your tastes.  </li>
            <li>On first whiff, I detected a strong nearly acrid woody scent.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe I put too high of expectations on the Special Reserve.</li>
            <li>A true classic.</li>
            <li>BUT I loved the other scents so much that I decided to hang on to it and try it again.</li>
            <li>Their Virgin Island Bay Rum leaps out of the bottle and in the first minutes shouts to the world</li>
            <li>Upon opening the plastic bottle and smelling it I feared that this was the first Pinaud that I would regret buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Vanilla is still my favorite Pinaud, but this is a close second.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t handle the intense somewhat synthetic leather scent, so it is a rare one that I dumped out.</li>
            <li>Definitely some of my favorite aftershave.  </li>
            <li>My first thought was,</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if it is more diluted in this later production, or not?</li>
            <li>It certainly has the right notes coming off my chemistry.  </li>
            <li>If you do buy this stuff, make sure you have enough Holy Water to shower with as it tends to possess you skin and doesn&#x27;t come off without the Lords Prayer and a Brillo-Pad!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I first opened the bottle, I knew that I was going to like it.</li>
            <li>Cloves was the first thing that came to mind when I smelled it.</li>
            <li>When my wife first smelled it, she kinda turned up her nose.</li>
            <li>Very manly scent!</li>
            <li>It took my breath away at first, and I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>&quot; Imagine this: A bucket of day-old clams, sitting in the hot August sun.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hot on the face, too.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost the same from start to finish with most changes happening immediately after applying.</li>
            <li>It smelled okay when sniffing the bottle, but after applying it to my face, it smelled eerily like the EconoLodge room I stayed in last weekend.</li>
            <li>It actually smells interesting.</li>
            <li>but it IS what I ordered...not the sellers fault, this is just for the folks that want to try this for the first time.</li>
            <li>hey, it was cheap, and it&#x27;ll be a lifetime supply in just one bottle if it doesn&#x27;t show some unexpected use as a bug repellant or self defense spray.</li>
            <li>Very manly-oldtyme and economical.</li>
            <li>The leather and the damask rose compete for attention until you get an aged leather ending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>how my wife described me when I wore it the first time.  </li>
            <li>My issue is with the first seller that shows up.</li>
            <li>This is the first one I immediately did not like.</li>
            <li>My first impression was garbage.</li>
            <li>My second try was also not too enjoyable.</li>
            <li>But a funny thing happened on the way to the trash can...</li>
            <li>This is a potent after shave that I would not use daily or put on running errands on the weekend.</li>
            <li>and so does the wife ;)</li>
            <li>Definitely stings a bit more than others but nothing to be worried about.  </li>
            <li>(Though this smells nothing like English Leather, which to my nose is more spice than leather).</li>
            <li>if you like Clubman products,,,you will love this...very traditional fragrance...</li>
            <li>Thought I would give this a try after enjoying the regular version.  </li>
            <li>but you sure as shootin&#x27;-from-the-hip can go about your day smelling like you just got a straight-razor shave from a barber who&#x27;s seen it all, heard it all, and still has a hand steadier than American virtue.&lt;br</li>
            <li>While, we still can&#x27;t quite place our finger on the exact scents.  </li>
            <li>The drain smelled good for a few days.</li>
            <li>I picked up a bottle of Special Reserve from Amazon, and a bottle of the old school Original Clubman from my local pharmacy (wish they were all available there).</li>
            <li>I was really expecting an old time scent and something strong..</li>
            <li>It definitely has a distinct and strong fragrance, and it sticks with you all day.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little too floral/musky for my taste, but I am sure it&#x27;s a fine scent for some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve come to understand there are actually two versions of Special Reserve - the old batches which have a greenish tint to them, and newer batches, that are more reddish brown.  </li>
            <li>As a frequent user of Clubman Pinaud and Virgin Island Bay Rum aftershaves I was interested in giving their Pinaud Special Reserve aftershave cologne a try.  </li>
            <li>but once on my skin it mellows out to a very woodsy, masculine scent that I enjoy (as well as my girlfriend).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try the product to give a more meaningful review of how it smells, but for now, avoid BYPLE to avoid getting screwed for a charge they&#x27;re not honest about.</li>
            <li>If you want to smell like you spend your time thinking deeply about things that matter like beards and War, then you good friends need look no further than this.  </li>
            <li>though the fragrance is strong initially I find that it fades away very fast.</li>
            <li>I usually use Royal Copenhagen Musk which I find to be a good balance of clean and refreshing yet slightly musky.</li>
            <li>It was less than a dollar an ounce, it didn&#x27;t smell as great as some of my more expensive after shaves, but it was definitely a great daily use after shave with a pleasant smell and ridiculously affordable.</li>
            <li>Special Reserve is a masculine, leathery scent that is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Pinaud Special Reserve is masculine, like mellow tobacco and leather.  </li>
            <li>Bought this and the Bay rum solely based on the number of positive reviews that both of them have received on this site but am disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Afterward, you are left with an aroma that is pleasant, masculine, and evident without being apparent.  </li>
            <li>very musky at first</li>
            <li>, i rotate this bay rum and eau de quinine on a regular basis, pinaud is still doing great on unique scents even if it has changed a little, well worth the cheap price!, not a cheap product at all, beats out some expensive aftershaves i use, it will burn if you just shaved fyi its a old school real mans product, put it in a spray bottle and it works great as cologne too!</li>
            <li>I normally love Pinaud products, especially their normal Clubman and Bay Rum lines.</li>
            <li>it stay&#x27;s pretty much the whole day,</li>
            <li>I was expecting a very fragile plastic bottle but should say it is a fairly strong.</li>
            <li>It is way to strong on initial application.</li>
            <li>The dispensing cap smartly prevents inadvespills and drips.</li>
            <li>Ive purchased the Original Clubman and the Lime Sec aftershaves but they dont compare with the Special Reserves scent and toning features.  </li>
            <li>This product works really good as aftershave, does not stings like a aqua velva (which is terrific! 5Stars), but makes do.&lt;br /&gt;Scent is very pleasant, honestly, do not listen to those reviews claiming that this stinks, if that was true, this Special Reserve would never had made it to production.&lt;br /&gt;Smells</li>
            <li>I personally like musk and when I first smelled the product I was amazed by the woody original smell of it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be the first to say it, after shave scents are highly subjective.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of regular clubman.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I am a HUGE fan of Pinaud Clubman, and this was a bit of a letdown, but it was close enough to passable that I had to ask the Mrs. to validate my impression.  </li>
            <li>and I really like it.     </li>
            <li>but I really like this scent</li>
            <li>is extremely reasonable for product.</li>
            <li>The burn is there, but it&#x27;s not too much.</li>
            <li>Smell doesn&#x27;t fade away too fast.</li>
            <li>I really like this aftershave.</li>
            <li>Really?).  </li>
            <li>Try pulling a hair from your nose before applying, then it won&#x27;t hurt so much.</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This the real aromatherapy.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been using the regular Clubman and enjoy both the aroma and the sting.</li>
            <li>The smell is something that doesnt really grow on you, you either like it or you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>This stuff works really well.  </li>
            <li>Just a add on to what I have on my counter works very well</li>
            <li>stuff is MUCH heavier.</li>
            <li>Very barbershop.</li>
            <li>HEY GET READY TO HAVE THE FAMILY JOIN IN.</li>
            <li>She said very manly, but she has to be close to smell it.</li>
            <li>Will buy again because my wife likes it so much.</li>
            <li>so use of a quality aftershave is absolutely mandatory.  </li>
            <li>Old timey fun</li>
            <li>do enjoy regular Clubman, but I&#x27;ll pass on this.</li>
            <li>Make sure you leave your hands and face wet after your shave when applying it to cut the potency.</li>
            <li>Really woodsy.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much though</li>
            <li>I really did not like this when I put it on, but give it time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a barber shop secret, and a great discovery.</li>
            <li>Very manly scent.</li>
            <li>I really recommend this to any man.</li>
            <li>be too much.</li>
            <li>Just like a real man does.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very musky pungent odor</li>
            <li>and it seems like no matter how much you put on people</li>
            <li>Well, maybe I let the hype convince me into buying something I really didn&#x27;t want.</li>
            <li>It had a very floral and powdery scent.</li>
            <li>But I really do like it.</li>
            <li>Lingers much longer.</li>
            <li>and I have to admit the smell is really growing on me.</li>
            <li>I own quite a few Clubman products.</li>
            <li>This cologne has a completely different scent from their standard aftershave - a warm, musky scent.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t personally care for it as much as the original</li>
            <li>Special Reserve will last five or six hours if you splash a couple teaspoons or so on your neck and shoulders, and after that a pleasant but subtle whiff will remain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I do like most other clubman products.</li>
            <li>I smelled this on someone other than myself and was able to fully appreciate its complexity, sophistication, and nuances.</li>
            <li>It is Pinaud in name only and is nothing like the Original formula in feel and smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments from other women as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a familiar behavioral pattern among American companies.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a definite difference from Clubman Original: darker, muskier, spicier, notes of wood and leather.</li>
            <li>But then I&#x27;m not &#x27;surprised&#x27; at this fine aftershave as after all:  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a sweet, spicey, woody, herbal scent that slowly fades and leaves a deeper more musky and (leathery?)</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent that seems to last for a long time.</li>
            <li>Not hardly!</li>
            <li>The new stuff is a greenish color with a different aroma altogether and one does not need to hold the bottle up to the light to see thru the solution.</li>
            <li>recently purchased a bottle of Clubman Special Reserve after shave.</li>
            <li>Unlike the Virgin Island Bay Rum product, this Special Reserve cologne should be applied sparingly and will last all day.  </li>
            <li>Not over powering, a subtle pleasantness that is clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li>The next morning after a nice single edge razor shave I tried it.</li>
            <li>Lasts long, cheap thrill just to put it on in the morning.</li>
            <li>Then, having loved the feel and aroma of SP, I gave Clubman Pinaud a second chance and ordered a second bottle from Amazon and had the same outcome.</li>
            <li>might smell like regular Clubman with maybe a whiskey, leather, or other masculine top note, but when I applied it, I smelled like a combination of a hospital sanitizer and really, really cheap baby powder.  </li>
            <li>Another Made in the USA product all true American patriots should be buying</li>
            <li>Not necessarily bad, but it just appeals to a smaller crowd.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be the first to admit that I don&#x27;t particularly like the smell directly from the bottle</li>
            <li>It is reminiscent of old spice and english leather, but definitely its own animal!</li>
            <li>Has same strength as about any other cologne with a good old fashioned smell.</li>
            <li>Actually mixed in the bottle, something happens and the good leather and tobacco stays there, while the gross spicy floral old lady goes away and is replaced by a kind of polo-black-ish smell (which isn&#x27;t very prominent, but it&#x27;s a way nicer base than old lady spicy flowers .</li>
            <li>I have paid a lot more for a lot less.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 30, so this isn&#x27;t meant to disrespect anyone who may be older than me and has fond memories of the smell and so forth.  </li>
            <li>I like Old Spice, Bay Rum, Sandalwood and your so called cheap aftershaves like English Leather, Stetson etc.</li>
            <li>But that could just be that my family did not us this particular scent.</li>
            <li>I guess I had hoped for something spicier than the Classic Pinaud Clubman, this was not it.</li>
            <li>The smell on this is decent.</li>
            <li>It also works better than most expensive aftershaves in is ability to sooth my face after a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t even smell particularly manly in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It is smoky, has a bit of leather, some musk, traces of the classic Clubman...</li>
            <li>Another classic Clubman product.</li>
            <li>Most definitely not - it has a very strong odor that gets worse</li>
            <li>This Special Reserve is very close to several of the Floris scents I have tried at a much lower price:  spicy, warm undertones with a moderately pungent floral character, but thankfully less floral than Floris!  </li>
            <li>It definitely has lasting power, but the scent is clean, masculine, not at all floral or sweet.  </li>
            <li>She may have been being a touch dramatic, but I could tell I was wearing it several hours after applying the original and vanilla scents work best for me, but I plan to try some of the other ones too.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve compared it to several other sandalwood scents that I own, and this is stronger than all of them.  </li>
            <li>Leather, tobacco, some other spices which I can&#x27;t pinpoint, but the overall scent is warm and manly.  </li>
            <li>It is a powerful scent that has long and strong staying power (for better or worse).</li>
            <li>Not one of my favorite scents; a little too earthy for my taste.</li>
            <li>All I can say is WOW !!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK but a little bit like 3 &amp;1 oil smell.</li>
            <li>WOW!!</li>
            <li>It does smell old timey, but in a very distinguished,clean and classic way.</li>
            <li>Enjoy the smell a little bit pungent at first.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Clubman Special reserve never really developed this reputation.</li>
            <li>Very unmistakably masculine smell.</li>
            <li>; fragrance is designed for the &amp;#34;Metro-Sexual&amp;#34; young man who wants his mother, (with whom he lives), to like how he smells.  </li>
            <li>The scent is overwhelmingly powerful and gives me a low-grade headache for the entire day.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;You are such an accomplished poet; use your skills as a wordsmith to tell us exactly what this product smells</li>
            <li>It is strong enough to last all day, so</li>
            <li>It could be because of the tropical climate where I live.  </li>
            <li>Like a brand new Leather motorcycle jacket.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll switch back to the original Pinaud, which I give 5 stars to, the special reserve is a little spicy on the scent for my tastes.</li>
            <li>It has pretty strong green tobacco and cedar components, and a rich, dark, masculine scent.</li>
            <li>Something between leather and the outdoors in a serious kind of way.</li>
            <li>I personally don&#x27;t like how it is packaged in a plastic bottle, however it doesn&#x27;t really detract that much.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it is meant to be used as an aftershave, even though that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s labeled as, but nevertheless, a brilliant reminder of more manly times (think MAD MEN).</li>
            <li>However, I like this smell very much and only wish it was offered in glass</li>
            <li>very old school manly scent</li>
            <li>My favorite scent so far, a classic spice scent that reminds me of times past.</li>
            <li>My significant other loves it.</li>
            <li>I know this is inexpensive, however, to me, the original smelled like a more expensive product.</li>
            <li>As attested to by the varied reviews, people have very different experiences with not only this, but many different scents.</li>
            <li>I like the scent, but not sure I love it.  </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>When you first open this bottle you may not like what you smell, but don&#x27;t let that put you off.</li>
            <li>I have just about the entire Clubman line of aftershaves and colognes, and, second to the almighty Clubman Original, this one is my favorite.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells like the warm naugahyde of a freshly vacated booth in a shady diner just shut down by the health</li>
            <li>This one is a little too strong for me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve personally been searching far and wide for products to upgrade my manly arsenal, and have been grabbing a hold of any product that is economical (and with a list price of $6.89 it seemed worth a shot).</li>
            <li>When that same man then goes out to his local gentleman&#x27;s club, discussing politicis and religion, smoking a cigar and having a brandy with his fellows, he wears Special Reserve.</li>
            <li>when I&#x27;m about to apply the witch hazel, I&#x27;ll pour the tiny amount of it in my hand, then splash into the same hand a bit of the Special Reserve, rub hands together and THEN apply.</li>
            <li>original Clubman is sometimes derided as being an \\&quot;old man&#x27;s\\&quot; scent because it was used in barber shops for so many years, but Special Reserve is a less-known scent, a very well-kept secret in fact, so few people will recognize it, and it therefore carries no such stigma.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m pretty sure it smells like the old Estee Lauder perfume that everyone and I mean everyone&#x27;s grandma used to wear!</li>
            <li>There are other fragrance notes, but i can&#x27;t identify them except to say that none of them is sweet; even so, they blend together</li>
            <li>I find that strange because it smells strong to me for a long time, but</li>
            <li>I do not dislike or overly like it compared to my other stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Seems a little stronger than my other scents and smells better aired out more.</li>
            <li>so nick cuts and abrasions are minimal and perhaps that is why no big slap in the face experience using this for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me...not STRONG, it is detectable, it is &#x27;soft&#x27; ins scent, bit of leather but not musk,</li>
            <li>I must agree with several other reviewers: Special Reserve is an unusual fragrance, especially if you are accustomed to modern after shaves that leave you smelling like a floral arrangement or a basket of fruit.</li>
            <li>Other brands ( LUCKY TIGER)  OFFER (16oz) bottles.</li>
            <li>I very much liked this fragrance and my other half doesn&#x27;t have any complaints about it.</li>
            <li>Clubman Special Reserve Cologne is a dark, smoky, masculine scent that lasts for hours.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fairly young guy who has been on a quest for the old school masculine scents.</li>
            <li>Old school musk scent, with lasting power for a fraction of what modern colognes/ eau de toilette&#x27;s cost.  </li>
            <li>It does smell like old man.</li>
            <li>I really like those last two.</li>
            <li>It is distinctly masculine without the slightest hint of metro-sexual.  </li>
            <li>THIS IS ONE OF PINAUDS OLD FASHION BARBERSHOP SCENTS STILL IN USE TODAY.</li>
            <li>The smell reminds me of the cologne that an old man from India would wear.  </li>
            <li>THESE will take you back to the time when your father or grandfather took you to a REAL BARBER SHOP.</li>
            <li>As an aftershave, it has the enough alcohol to give you a tingle after a shave which is really why I purchased the product.  </li>
            <li>Like an old cologne that&#x27;s 50 years old.  </li>
            <li>I just started using Clubman products, and, thus far, I like them all.  </li>
            <li>the old Barber Shop smells like Taylor of Old Bond St. does, Geo F. Trumper etc.</li>
            <li>Old world barbershop aftershave.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing old or spicy about this one.  </li>
            <li>Some may call it an &amp;#34;old man&amp;#34; smell (as they do others in the Pinaud line); I call it ADULT.</li>
            <li>Of all the Clubman Pinaud scents I&#x27;ve tried, this is the only one I absolutely can&#x27;t stand.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really that simple.</li>
            <li>Well here goes very woody and earthy with a touch of English leather</li>
            <li>that I never like, a bit closer to wild country in that way.</li>
            <li>Really really enjoy this one, although the bottle is green, not orange as shown in the picture.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s old school, ultra masculine, leathery and woody.  </li>
            <li>If you a sensitive lady boy, you may be offended by my review.</li>
            <li>This regular one is much closer to what the barbers use.</li>
            <li>and you sit near the fire and the smoke saturates your clothes?</li>
            <li>This is a classy scent for cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>well, if you like old, manly tastes this is for you.</li>
            <li>I really like the regular scent as well as the vanilla.</li>
            <li>wow</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a very smoky, deep scent.</li>
            <li>Again, I like it, and I wear it frequently.</li>
            <li>Used so far as an aftershave.  </li>
            <li>Definitely old time barber shop smell.  </li>
            <li>and if you meet a young gal that you&#x27;re keen on, wait until you have her hooked to bust this manliness out</li>
            <li>It really has a longevity and complexity that put similarly priced Aftershaves to shame.</li>
            <li>Takes me back to childhood going to a real barber.</li>
            <li>Many people do like this, so I wouldn&#x27;t want to discourage anyone from at least trying it.  </li>
            <li>THE ITEM RECEIVED WAS:BACH RESCUE REMEDY NATURAL STRESS RELIEF DROPS.</li>
            <li>Last a more than few hours.</li>
            <li>because on the days I use the Special Reserve, I have to change it up slightly.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, though, and my wife can&#x27;t tolerate it even when applied very lightly.  </li>
            <li>It had a slight sting, very quick, nothing to note actually</li>
            <li>let this stuff dry down first if this is a first time experince as it becomes an amazing smell on dry down!</li>
            <li>A nice musky scent, is a touch of English Leather, with a kiss of dirty diaper full of Indian food.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m typically not a fan of aftershave products.</li>
            <li>This is a definite classic scent, even if you&#x27;ve never smelled it before.</li>
            <li>The stuff is too sweet -- in a cheap, drugstore-like way --  and at 5 PM the aroma is unfortunately still there.</li>
            <li>I do not prefer this to the regular clubman after shave (which is a classic), in neither feel nor smell.  </li>
            <li>I mixed it about 2/3 or 3/4 SR to 1/3 or 1/4 Classic Vanilla.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is complex: it seems too loud when you first splash it on, but it soon settles down to a nice chamber orchestra instead of a street band, and after an hour or two it&#x27;s a string quartet with different instruments taking a solo from time to time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>is my review part - now, my question on the name which has nothing to do perhaps with the product.&lt;br /&gt;Companies and products historically reserve the phrases &amp;#34;Reserve&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Special Reserve&amp;#34; to denote that it is a limited release and availability, commands a higher price due to this AND that there indeed is something special about it.  </li>
            <li>After Shave Lotion, 6 Ounce]]Easily my favorite and the scent is very long lasting compared to the other brands I have reviewed here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t put too much on, it goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t what I expected at first</li>
            <li>Normally, I wouldn&#x27;t buy anything that I don&#x27;t put past the smell test, but based on all the positive reviews, and the fact this particular bottle was factory sealed, I pulled the trigger and bought a bottle.</li>
            <li>It instantly reminded me of Aramis, only a bit different (much like the Classic</li>
            <li>It will calm down.</li>
            <li>but it does calm down.</li>
            <li>The original SP had a very dark brown color which one could hardly see thru if the bottle were held up to the light.</li>
            <li>It is hard to place the elements of this aftershave, some say it is STRONG</li>
            <li>For about $7, I&#x27;d definitely give it a shot especially if you enjoy other Clubman products.</li>
            <li>But most people either will love it or hate it (except me, of course, as I am decidedly undecided).  </li>
            <li>This is a refreshing, every day aftershave that is so reasonably priced that you would be silly to not give it a try.  </li>
            <li>I see how this could be a love or hate thing, but man, do I love it.</li>
            <li>It pretty much stays exactly that way through a fairly long and subtle &amp;#34;fade-out&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>In the past I&#x27;ve tried samples of the various scents from Floris - an English company that was a favorite of Ian Flemming, who used (if memory serves)</li>
            <li>The scent is a lot more firm then some of the other clubman products i use.</li>
            <li>This recent one seems to be weaker in that regard than the older one, although the same fragrance.</li>
            <li>A few days later I took the plunge and splashed some Special Reserve on after a shave.  </li>
            <li>I generally like the smell of this stuff.</li>
            <li>I am a fan of Pinaud products in general.  </li>
            <li>Will last a long time since you don&#x27;t need much unless maybe you didn&#x27;t shower.</li>
            <li>This one reminds me of the old English Leather aroma.  </li>
            <li>My wife thought it smelled like medicinal and gross old man when I opened the bottle</li>
            <li>If your looking to buy a terrific Clubman scent, may I direct you to Clubman Virgin Island Bay Rum Aftershave.</li>
            <li>It definitely takes some getting used to and is a masculine scent, but it&#x27;s a bit too floral for my liking.  </li>
            <li>It caught my attention as an old scent that I may have actually smelled someone using it when I was a child and haven&#x27;t smelled it again since.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s up to you whether you find this scent manly, or reminiscent of an old incontinent guy in a nursing home -</li>
            <li>and you will be rewarded with a scent that is masculine and different.</li>
            <li>Like Old Spice, English Leather, Speed Stick, Vitalis, talcum powder and wood all mingling together...</li>
            <li>If your looking for an aftershave that isn&#x27;t the same old same old, this is it.</li>
            <li>I actually bought three of these and gave two of them to an old WWII vet that uses the stuff.  </li>
            <li>I mean seriously dark) floral profile, wherein damask rose is the dominant note.</li>
            <li>Once applied, it quickly settled into a mature complex aroma.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it has strong powdery notes,</li>
            <li>I agree with others that it starts strong (almost gamey) then mellows into a scent that you love or hate.</li>
            <li>Reading through the other reviews, there are many scents to which this product has been compared: Tobacco, Leather, Clove, Cedar, Smokey Cinnamon, Sandalwood, A Humidor of Cigars (better than just tobacco), and badly scented soap.  </li>
            <li>The standard Clubman is more subdued on the leather with I think a few other blending notes there too.</li>
            <li>Very long lasting and unique scent, cannot pin it down to any one.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how other Clubman products smell, but this to me is absolutely repulsive.  </li>
            <li>For the record, I do not like this as much as I do the other Clubman aftershaves.  </li>
            <li>Not completely unpleasant, but not enjoyable to me.  </li>
            <li>; while sniffing the bottle, then nuzzled up and asked what I was wearing after a shower and shave 20 minutes later, surprised it was the same product.  </li>
            <li>Initially I was worried it would be an old man smell, I&#x27;m only 30</li>
            <li>She said that my aroma was only a step above Old Spice.</li>
            <li>However, if you prefer a more floral, spicy, and heavier scent that is less likely to fade or get too weak, then you might really like this one.</li>
            <li>Because the first sniff had me a little worried.  </li>
            <li>Not too strong, not too weak...</li>
            <li>Not in a bad way at all, but if you apply it in the same amount you apply other aftershaves, it will be too strong for most of the day.</li>
            <li>Very complex smoky, woodsy, strong scent.</li>
            <li>This cologne has a scent that is a cross between a brand new leather jacket, new car smell, Ivory soap, and a touch of cinnamon to round it all out.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s classic clean scent is nostalgic and bracing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One comment in common with many is that what it smells like in the bottle has little to do with what it smells like after it is applied.  </li>

            <li> Pleasant.  </li>
            <li> Fragrance is pleasant to me and others and not over powering.</li>
            <li> I also do not find the scent as pleasant as Clubmen &amp;#34;Original&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> and I am glad it lingers for hours because it is very pleasant.    </li>
            <li> Very good would love to see it in a lotion form.</li>
            <li> At the time, my  father was mourning his beloved Scottish Deerhound, Chauncey.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a good winter time after shave.  </li>
            <li> Well it gets really good as it sets in.</li>
            <li> Give it a fair shot.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li> I regard all CLUBMAN products as superior......  </li>
            <li> Good burn when applied after a close shave.  </li>
            <li> Good stuff</li>
            <li> This does not smell good.</li>
            <li> this sent would cover the B.O., but not in a good way.</li>
            <li> Not as good a smell as Clubman Hairspray.</li>
            <li> It smells so good for an inexpensive aftershave.</li>
            <li> Good price.</li>
            <li> Wife likes the scent, so all good.</li>
            <li> Still, a good buy and a manly scent.</li>
            <li> Smell good and has good strength but its not at an intolerable level undiluted.  </li>

            <li> I like the scent, good value.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a good quality after-shave product</li>
            <li> But my experience was not as good as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> All in all, a good addition to the Clubman line.</li>
            <li> This is a very unique (and very good) cologne/aftershave.</li>
            <li> The original scent is awesome</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used their original Clubman aftershave for quite a while and have also started using the Citrus Musk (both are also excellent).</li>
            <li> I get a kind of matte feeling to my skin which is rather pleasant.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t it&#x27;s just now a pleasant smell to be honest.</li>
            <li> Very smooth after shave and another great Pinaud product.  </li>
            <li> Great smell, clean feel and great price.</li>
            <li> Great aftershave love it.</li>
            <li> A lot of people love it, which is great, but</li>
            <li> powerful, wonderful stuff.</li>
            <li> very satisfied with this purchase</li>
            <li> Did not like the razor they used to do detail trim around the ears, but loved the smell of this kind of after shave they put on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just my favorite aftershave -- at any price!.  </li>
            <li> If you like me are searching for that scent that walks the fine line between Dapper Gentleman and Lumberjack, this is a great start.</li>
            <li> Very good product and worth the price</li>
            <li> I put this on and I couldn&#x27;t figure if liked it or not .</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t honestly tell you that I smell leather, as others have claimed.</li>
            <li> and i smelled the top, and i got this good smell of manliness.</li>
            <li> Nice.</li>
            <li> and I liked them.</li>
            <li> but after I put it on she liked it.  </li>
            <li> The scent is nice and it gets even nicer as the day goes by.</li>
            <li> I liked the smell of this.</li>
            <li> a nice plus.</li>
            <li> Nice musky fragrance.</li>
            <li> This scent lasts and has a nice linger throughout the day.</li>
            <li> BUT this stuff is nice..</li>
            <li> and it settles into a nice scent that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> but it mellows out nicely.</li>
            <li> none of friends liked it</li>
            <li> CLUBMAN RESERVE COMPLEMENT MY CLIENTS HAIRCUT WITH A NICE SPICYSCENT</li>
            <li> Aftershave\\&quot; and started wearing it when my wife discovered she liked it.</li>
            <li> nice alcohol burn after shaving, tones your skin,</li>
            <li> nice slap in the face to wake you up and take on the day.  </li>
            <li> This is well made product with a nice balance of aromas, and it stays with you.  </li>
            <li> Kind of reminded me of my Dr&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li> Give it a try you may like it, to each his own.</li>
            <li> This stuff smell&#x27;s nice</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s also an aftershave that feels great on the skin and gives a good tingle after a fresh shave.</li>
            <li> I bought this expecting a nice leather smell based on reviews.</li>
            <li> After two hours I liked the scent.</li>
            <li> You will not find a more refreshing and great smelling than this.</li>
            <li> Its kind of woodsy but in a smokehouse sort of way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;burns</li>
            <li> Not the kind of scent I was expecting</li>
            <li> With so many people talking about how great it is, I figured it was a safe bet</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my brother, kind of as a gag sort of thing.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say I&#x27;ve never smelled an aftershave like this.</li>
            <li> I started with the original Pinaud Clubman scent, and it was great.  </li>
            <li> Okay, first off, this stuff smells great!</li>
            <li> This one is nice, though a very strong scent.</li>
            <li> This is great, smells smoky, its a pleasant scent, Stings a lot if you have a nick(thats how you know its a real aftershave).</li>
            <li> After it had been on for about 30 minutes it took on a very pleasant smell that my wife really likes.</li>
            <li> A gift your man will appreciate and you both will enjoy the pleasant aroma when he wears this.</li>
            <li> ; Simply put, this is a good product, with a wonderful smell.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel great, but I can&#x27;t help but feel super self-conscience about the over powering scent at work.</li>
            <li> Very strong scent.  </li>
            <li> FETCH ME MY CLUBMAN SPECIAL RESERVE!!  </li>
            <li> I splash this on after shaving for a clean fresh feeling and a wonderful fragrance.</li>
            <li> Special Reserve is a heavier yet sophisticated scent-wonderful after a shave and smells great 4-5 hours after I put it on.</li>
            <li> Ceder, Ceder, Ceder, love it, warm ceder, clove mix.....</li>
            <li> So far, I am very happy with it</li>
            <li> You see, this stuff is STRONG!</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t think it was as good as the bay rum or the original scent.</li>
            <li> it really started smelling good!  </li>
            <li> great scent and worth much more than the price.</li>
            <li> It is not only a great smell, but it is also great as a toning after shave.</li>
            <li> Once you put it on and let it mingle with your own body chemistry, it really eases up and turns into a very nice spicy/smokey scent.  </li>
            <li> These are great for decanting &amp;#34;drug store&amp;#34; after shaves out of their plastic bottles to remove that plastic funkiness that all Pinaud&#x27;s seem to have at first.  </li>
            <li> I feel that it is more suitable as a cologne, not an aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s fine by me!  </li>
            <li> Gives a very smooth, close feel to your shave.  </li>
            <li> While the original Clubman is a great aftershave and a great scent, its bygone popularity leads it to being considered an &#x27;old man&#x27;s&#x27; smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She very much favored the original but was not put off by the Special Reserve at all.</li>
            <li> The aftershave itself works fine - nice tingle without drying skin - but it is the smell I do not like.  </li>
            <li> Okay let me start off my review by saying this is one of those hit-or-miss scents.</li>
            <li> I love the smell</li>
            <li> Not my favorite smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to say it&#x27;s Sandalwood, and quite potent.  </li>
            <li> A generally nice and thrifty product line of which I do enjoy.</li>
            <li> There are layers to this after shave - so many scents you can pick up on.  </li>
            <li> Love its&#x27; \\&quot;Old-Fashioned\\&quot; aroma...</li>
            <li> I love this after shave.</li>
            <li> It is potent and lasts for hours.</li>
            <li> I know there are many people out there who love this cologne.  </li>
            <li> and I think that most guys my age would probably do well to stay away from it.</li>
            <li> It is my favorite of all the Pinaud scents.  </li>
            <li> Those perfumes are really better suited for women.  </li>
            <li> I cant praise this wonderful aftershave enough tho</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many brands to be sure.....  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I get many compliments on this after shave.</li>
            <li> Refreshing, never overpowers.  </li>
            <li> Most are too perfumy and aggravate my allergies.</li>
            <li> One of the most refined gentlemanly scents I have used and I have used a lot.</li>
            <li> despite all the&lt;br /&gt;other notes mentioned by others, i sense an interesting vegetal, celery-like note.</li>
            <li> I love this robust scent.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;M GLAD</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S BECOME ONE OF MY FAVORITE AFTER SHAVE/COLOGNES.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, I read many reviews of the manly, woodsy, smokey scent and felt that this was what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This, is stronger and the smell is more robust.</li>
            <li> I stuck with it for three days, and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> This is one of my all time favorite fragrances.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m fairly sure that this is what my grandpa wore,</li>
            <li> To my nose, it&#x27;s a combination of the best elements of Brut and English Leather.</li>
            <li> It is bolder, more leathery and musky, with overtones of tobacco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent soothing aftershave that has a lasting fragrance so don&#x27;t expect to be able to use another cologne over it.</li>
            <li> More of a cologne smell than aftershave and sticks with you for a while.  </li>
            <li> Go for the straight Clubman aftershave; it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> HOW EVER MOST WILL KID AROUND WITH YOU</li>
            <li> I love Clubman products.  </li>
            <li> You my love it though.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> One of my favorite aftershaves.</li>
            <li> This is a surprisingly potent composition from House of Pinaud...</li>
            <li> what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> I love Clubman products.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this stuff.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m getting creative.</li>
            <li> I love Pinaud&#x27;s aftershave.  </li>
            <li> I used more this time</li>
            <li> and I do love that one.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it now, and so does my gf.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic after shave!  </li>
            <li> and I love them all</li>
            <li> I love all the Pinaud scents so it was no surprise that I like this one.</li>
            <li> On top of being a cologne</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so sure if I&#x27;m a fan of this or not.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t mind the scent and enjoyed the change of pace.  </li>
            <li> , this scent is truly a manly scent, I love it...</li>
            <li> but i love it</li>
            <li> Takes the sting off your face love this stuff</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t describe it any better.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re around or over thirty, like myself, it&#x27;s perfect for that scent that your dad or gramps most likely had.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned from experience that many women will compliment it and ask what it is.</li>
            <li> I would call it &amp;#34;vegetal&amp;#34; for lack of a better discription.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Wish there would have been a better description</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE Clubman by Pinaud</li>
            <li> Love all the Pinaud stuff ..</li>
            <li> is more preferable and attracts women more.</li>
            <li> I too would love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This aftershave smells a lot better after you let it mellow out for an hour or so.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s just a pansy for not being able to take the heat.</li>
            <li> My wife likes it better than the Clubman bay rum.</li>
            <li> I love the scent although will admit that it may not be for everyone.</li>
            <li> This is an exceptional product at a very affordable price!!  </li>
            <li> Smells good, although it isn&#x27;t super strong, so</li>
            <li> This is a very original scent that I put on whenever I want to make an impression.</li>
            <li> It is unique, it does smell nice.  </li>
            <li> Smelling it from the bottle it had a nice rich scent that reminded me of cologne that my grandfather used to wear.  </li>
            <li> Always liked the clean smell.</li>
            <li> Great classic aftershave.</li>
            <li> Warm, woody,  sweet, smokey, sexy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a good scent to wear to work or to sweat it off at the gym on a hot day.</li>
            <li> Pretty good price for what you get.</li>
            <li> it gives you a nice cool feeling</li>
            <li> feels good on your face, but to musky smelling for me If you want to get a headache first thing in the morning</li>
            <li> It can seem quite strong at first, but then settles into a pleasant spicy scent.</li>
            <li> To me it smells okay, a strong smokey, leathery fragrance, but my wife loves it.</li>
            <li> Okay, so this one is a bit strong for my taste..</li>
            <li> here!&lt;br /&gt;It goes on a tad strong but mellows out into the scent you would expect after taking a dame to the talkies and grabbing a couple of sidecar nightcaps at your favorite gin joint.</li>
            <li> I enjoy many of the Cluman scents, this is my favorite at the moment.</li>
            <li> I liked it back then, in the sixties, so I think this one will make me happy too.  </li>
            <li> CLUBMAN Special Reserve is a wonderful blend that smells something similar to Halston with more of a spiced woodsy overtone to it.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure if we liked it at first, but love it on my husband and price</li>
            <li> Great old school scent!</li>
            <li> sure on someone else it might smell fine - just doesn&#x27;t ring well in my nose out of the bottle or on my skin with a 15 minute drydown.</li>
            <li> , I decanted about 5 ounces into a glass bottle with shaker top that Amazon sells for those folks who make and bottle their own hot sauce.  </li>
            <li> At first  I wasn&#x27;t sure if I liked this .</li>
            <li> and when it hits your face it has the traditional clubman sting but than it transforms itself into a breath of sweetness and spicy majesty that is incredible.</li>
            <li> great old time spice aroma.</li>
            <li> great smell, like the barber shops of old.</li>
            <li> Reasonable cost, smells great, reminds me of the good old barbershop days gone by.</li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t possess the sophisticated sniffer that others do, the main scent that I notice is &amp;#34;tobacco.&amp;#34; It reminds me pleasantly of a humidor filled with cigars, *not* an overflowing ashtray.</li>
            <li> This IS Special!</li>
            <li> Just be sure you like the scent before you buy, it&#x27;s very powerful.</li>
            <li> The more I smell this on myself, the more I&#x27;m loving this aftershave and this will be added to my weekly rotation of classic, timeless scents.</li>
            <li> I had used this Special Reserve formulation for many years, decades really, since my college years, and I LOVED it.</li>
            <li> Love the original scent and thought I&#x27;d give this a try.</li>
            <li> but I prefer the original a bit better.</li>
            <li> I recommend the original scent which I love.</li>
            <li> The original is still my favorite,,, if that gives you a hint to my preferences,,,,but</li>
            <li> However, it is not a scent for those who like bright and vibrant scents.</li>
            <li> It has a strong smell almost like cinnamon</li>
            <li> Strong so I dilute it with water.</li>
            <li> It is not so strong that I cannot wear another EDP as well.</li>
            <li> It is strong going on</li>
            <li> For one, it says, \\&quot;aftershave cologne\\&quot;, it should be ranked up there as eau de toilette because it is really strong.</li>
            <li> It is strong stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To me, it had a strong character of sandalwood.  </li>
            <li> The scents coming off it are a myriad of spices, some clove and some sweetness, with a strong leather backbone.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smells like strong musk, I get notes of elk piss, possum breath, and moose</li>
            <li> Musky and too strong.</li>
            <li> Strong, musky, and persistent.  </li>
            <li> It is strong and does not seem to go away.  </li>
            <li> In fact, after trying countless colognes over the years, I&#x27;ve settled on what are the two cheapest as also being the two best: Special Reserve and the original Pinaud Clubman.</li>
            <li> The Special Reserve is probably my favorite.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A SPECIAL SCENT BY PINAUD, WHICH IS REFRESHINGLY MANLY AND LONG-LASTING.</li>
            <li> I like Pinuad&#x27;s line of products and love the Clubman aftershave, but I do not like the Special Reserve aftershave.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong at first, but then mellows nicely.</li>
            <li> yet it almost immediately dissipates into a very smooth, robust smell with a bold full bodied smell that hints at many flavors that you can&#x27;t quite put your finger on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soothing, and smells very manly &amp; very sophisticated.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s old school smells great, works great smell last all day but isn&#x27;t overpowering you&#x27;ll just catch a wiff of it from time to time to remind you</li>
            <li> It goes well with crisp, almost warm weather.</li>
            <li> Special Reserve is a very unique scent.  </li>
            <li> The calm happy grandpas smell that comes from Clubman Vanilla, Bay Rum, or Classic</li>
            <li> The aftershave itself is fine,</li>
            <li> This one smells better than the original IMO, but the original lasts a bit longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I listened to all the reviews saying to give it a chance before making too quick of a judgement.  </li>
            <li> To me it is a pleasant, masculine scent that is not overpowering but stays with you all day.  </li>
            <li> I tend to gravitate towards Musk if it is light and not too strong and prefer citrus-like odors over ones that are floral or botanical.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not entirely unpleasant, and I like the leathery tones it has, but I just can&#x27;t recommend it after one too many headaches.</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer said, very strong when you first out it on.</li>
            <li> Very strong and smokey when the bottle is first opened.</li>
            <li> Nothing like original clubman.&lt;br /&gt;very strong leathery muscky type smell.</li>
            <li> This was a huge exception, though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not made from scorpion venom or the gonads of a great white shark.  </li>
            <li> I like it too, but we all know her opinion is the important one.</li>
            <li> any case, I do enjoy the smell and use it every so often</li>
            <li> Smooth for the aftershave splash.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> and it last almost all day great product</li>
            <li> used lightly.</li>
            <li> BYPLE claims to sell this product with FREE shipping.</li>
            <li> Cheap garbage.</li>
            <li> After sending them the code from the bottom of the bottle, they said the bottle was &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; and therefore had changed, perhaps b/c of exposure to heat or light.</li>
            <li> it being sold as cheap as it is</li>
            <li> like scents that are manly and also smell fresh or dare I even say refreshing.</li>
            <li> It still lasts forever though, so definitely a good buy for guys who don&#x27;t want to smell like ten year olds any more.</li>
            <li> As an elderly man I have never, ever received so many compliments in over 40 years of shaving on how good I smell, as I do when wearing Clubman Pinaud aftershaves... especially from the Mom&#x27;s of the dance studio where I take my Grandson.....</li>
            <li> I still prefer the original clubman scent which carries that good old fashioned barbershop quality.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very powerful scent and smells like someones</li>
            <li> Ok so I made this waaay better by mixing it with Clubman Classic Vanilla.</li>
            <li> Trust me its like a light musk meets the original clubman and out came perfection.</li>
            <li> I find both scents to be pleasingly light and clean.</li>
            <li> Has real alcohol in it so expect a bit of a burn if you managed to nick yourself pretty good while shaving.</li>
            <li> Super inexpensive and strong manly fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I find nothing Special about it, and as there is an unlimited supply and available to non-insiders of Clubman, why is it a reserve?  </li>
            <li> a fairly powerful fragrance with a worthy longevity, respectable sillage (when applied judiciously) being sold at what could be considered &amp;#34;bargain basement&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Have original clubman and vanilla .</li>
            <li> but I prefer the original blend.</li>
            <li> Basically,same as the original.</li>
            <li> Unique aroma and</li>
            <li> I think I will stick with either the Bay Rum or Original Clubman scent.</li>
            <li> Actually, if a stronger more lasting version of this was made it would be a perfect evening cologne    </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t make the mistake of thinking that this is like the original Clubman where you can splash it on your face and the scent will fade.</li>
            <li> Maybe this was because I am used to the original Clubman where I splash my face with it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the original Clubman for a couple years now.</li>
            <li> I would stick to the original scent</li>
            <li> My best description would be &amp;#34;leathery overtones.&amp;#34;  Not sure what else to say about it.</li>
            <li> stick  with original.</li>
            <li> Sticking with the original sent.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard people describe it as smoky, musky, floral, rich.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot more now than I did at first.</li>
            <li> The initial smell is bit well strange but after a refreshing splash on the face and a minute later the aromas blend very nicely and leave a very very pleasant smell to enjoy for the day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Virgin Island Bay Rum, Classic Clubman, and the Vanilla, and enjoyed them all (especially the Vanilla, that stuff is great).  </li>
            <li> I like to get this one when I want a change-fresh and clean smell.</li>
            <li> I have both the Original and the Special Reserve.</li>
            <li> Compared to the original Clubman, I find the Special reserve to be much better, but that is just because I really didn&#x27;t like the Original at all.</li>
            <li> , I AM HERE, not the Special Reserve.  </li>
            <li> The Special Reserve is something I will keep around when the mood hits me.</li>
            <li> There is not a hint of daffodils and strawberries in Clubman Special Reserve.  </li>
            <li> The special reserve gave me a headache</li>
            <li> so I wanted to try the Special Reserve.</li>
            <li> so when I splashed on the Special Reserve and the scent came forth</li>
            <li> Clubman PInaud Special Reserve</li>
            <li> After Shave, not the Special Reserve.</li>
            <li> In trying to change up the medicine cabinet I tried the Special Reserve.  </li>
            <li> When I saw this Special Reserve</li>
            <li> Not &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; but nothing special.</li>
            <li> I had never heard of Special Reserve before, so I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Right on!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this purchase and no other after shave will come in contact with my face except Pinaud.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a LOT stronger than I&#x27;d expected, but the scent is great.</li>
            <li> My opinion is that it&#x27;s hits the nose good bit stronger than the regular clubman scent.</li>
            <li> Instead, it smells a bit sweet and perfumy but it is not obnoxious or cloying.</li>
            <li> Good enough for me.</li>
            <li> The scent is unique and reminds me of my very first after shave years ago.</li>
            <li> The smell is like old fashion kind.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend immediately said she liked it and said wow.</li>
            <li> Good product but quantity (6ozs) seem a bit ON the short side.</li>
            <li> i bought my husband two colognes to go with his straight razor, and this one is his favorite.</li>
            <li> You get notes of cloves, coffee, sweet spices, bourbon.</li>
            <li> Stronger than the regular Clubman and in a good way.</li>
            <li> So Sweet</li>
            <li> Not bad</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not bad.  </li>
            <li> but it is pleasant, will not offend due to strong odor those around you.  </li>
            <li> I love the classic barber shop smell of the Original Clubman.  </li>
            <li> Definitely a strong masculine fragrance even though it does smell sweet and spicey at first; and it kind of reminds me of an aftershave a man would wear out during the winter or at night when he&#x27;s going out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After this pleasant experience I decided to try a few more of the Clubman line of aftershaves.</li>
            <li> It may seem really strong at first when you put it on, but it dissipates and blends well without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> Pretty strong scent.  </li>
            <li> It was really strong the first hour then started to mellow out.</li>
            <li> you like bold, classic scents like Aqua Velva and Brut, you&#x27;ll LOVE Special Reserve.</li>
            <li> I know most of you do not care what my preferences are, however by sharing this it will explain why I didn&#x27;t like the Special reserve and if you have similar likes, then you may avoid this product for something more your style.</li>
            <li> This stuff (like the other Clubman products I&#x27;ve tried) is great.</li>
            <li> It is strong at first but quickly disperses, leaving a mild fragrance.</li>
            <li> I guess it diffuses quickly so others don&#x27;t smell it</li>
            <li> After trying the Original and Bay Rum (My favorite so far) scent I wanted to try the Special Reserve.</li>
            <li> I have read so many posts on Shaving forums (yes, these do exist) that special reserve seems to be a HUGE favorite within the wet shaving community.</li>
            <li> A friend had the greenish version which blew me away; when I purchased my own bottle, I evidently received a new batch.  </li>
            <li> Bottle is pretty cheap.  </li>
            <li> The scent is strong, bold, and very manly.    </li>
            <li> The Special Reserve smells woodsy and musky right out of the bottle</li>
            <li> Its really unique and may take a certain brand of &amp;#34;dude&amp;#34; to pull it off!</li>
            <li> me, an aftershave should be bracing, bold and fresh.</li>
            <li> Bought this and loved it, last long, smells strong BUT NOT overpowering or overwhelming..</li>
            <li> Whether you&#x27;re dressed down for &amp;#34;The Treasure of the Sierra Madres&amp;#34; or up for &amp;#34;Casablanca&amp;#34; - you will have that perfect blend of masculine strength and dapper fashion-sense.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy Clubman original, Classic Vanilla and Virgin Island Bay Rum.  </li>
            <li> I also have the original Pinaud aftershave that I like pretty well, but this stuff while I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on it</li>
            <li> I REALLY like it!!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this aftershave, its unlike any others in a very special way.</li>
            <li> if you personally like this strong odor, keep in mind that most folks around you will find it foul and offensive.</li>
            <li> My brother didn&#x27;t much care for it because it is alcohol based, but it&#x27;s fine by me.</li>
            <li> This is a great inexpensive cologne for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The woodsy smell of the laurel bay evaporates after a few hours, but you&#x27;ll still smell great - the scent evolves throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Love the old school scent</li>
            <li> The scent and feel just seem to &amp;#34;go&amp;#34; with colder temps as opposed to the menthol after shaves like Floid Blue which are definitely warm weather after shaves.  </li>
            <li> Good delivered as expected.</li>
            <li> I have really liked the fresh feel on my shaved face and the similar fragrance to that patted on by the barber.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not your grand pa&#x27;s Old Spice or Hi Karate.  </li>
            <li> not disappointing in the least...as it develops, there is alot of complexity while it mellows.</li>
            <li> Reminds me of some of the scents I came across in highschool that I felt were for more mature men.  </li>
            <li> It does last all day, so that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> You will love this if you still go to a barber shop, remember Harley&#x27;s with seats that held two and the tri five Chevys, still have one of each, all in all a very pleasent scent and very manly, and I often get complements on from the ladies</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite aftershave, and I am a collector of colognes and aftershaves.  </li>
            <li> Powerful scent that lasts for hours.</li>
            <li> Will buy another one of a different kind.  </li>
            <li> so far my favorite.</li>
            <li> It has a powerful scent, and not one that I found too favorable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth a try for those who haven&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> When you want a darker more masculine scent.</li>
            <li> This is like a good Aftershave that&#x27;s been aged for years.  </li>
            <li> May not be for everyone but might be worth a try at this price.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s definitely lighter and a nice change of pace once in a while.   </li>
            <li> This scent is also STRONG so be mindful of that with this particular aftershave.  </li>
            <li> Many wet shavers love the original Clubman because it has a timeless barber-shoppy scent that just smells good, refreshing, a little powdery and yet is masculine.</li>
            <li> Very powerful, very manly,</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a more gentle bay-rum scent, however, it is a very strong and spicy scent--much more pungent than Old Spice, and less sweet.  </li>
            <li> I also received the Musk and Vanilla in the same order and love those two as well as the Original...</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m able to smell more of the smokey and cedar scent that other reviews have stated.</li>
            <li> Very different...quite unique fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I really like the original scent</li>
            <li> These and other &amp;#34;modern day&amp;#34; douchebags would be wise to avoid any clubman product.</li>
            <li> I compare it thusly: when a man gets ready for work in the morning, he wears Clubman Original.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re in the right mood, then you&#x27;ll like it.  </li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> this is right there with it in my cabinet..</li>
            <li> If you want a cologne that has a distinctly masculine scent this is an excellent one to try and will cost you very little.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, I am a huge fan of the classic Clubman \\&quot;barber shop\\&quot; products: Aftershave, talc &amp; shampoo.  </li>
            <li> This product was a decent buy and has a light scent and was just what was advertised in the ad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cologne, and an excellent one at that, which smells and lasts much better than some very expensive colognes and eau de toilettes I&#x27;ve worn.</li>
            <li> Supremely old school with the bay rum- perfect for evenings out as it has a little more spice than regular Clubman.</li>
            <li> I would much prefer to wear these than the Special Reserve.  </li>
            <li> But, perhaps I have been punched in the nose too many times or maybe I have had a stroke that I didn&#x27;t know about because I find this to be more of a powdery, slightly floral scent when applied to my face.</li>
            <li> At first it&#x27;s fresh.</li>
            <li> say you bathed in aftershave and give you a funny look because of the distinct scent.</li>
            <li> Special Reserve has a clean, masculine scent.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of classic aftershaves, and an avid CLUBMAN fan</li>
            <li> It calms down my face after a good DE Safety razor shave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is NOT like the classic barbershop scent of the original.</li>
            <li> Strong and spicy at first, 2 hour later it is perfect and subtle</li>
            <li> As a long time user of the classic Clubman, this is my first purchase of the Special Reserve, and I absolutely love the scent!</li>
            <li> but this scent has grown on me and will sit on the shelf next to my Original Pinaud Clubman, Old Spice, and soon two nice bottles of Pinaud Clubman Vanilla and Bay Rum.</li>
            <li> IT HAS A VERY PLEASENT MASCULINE AROMA WITHOUT BEING OVER POWERING AND LADIES SEEM TO LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> Be warned it has a Strong and Powerful Scent but after hearing such strong approval from the ladies I&#x27;m going to make it my main</li>
            <li> but I doubt I will purchase it again, though I do like its old smell, but it is really strong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, but I will try a different scent next time...</li>
            <li> On the other hand, this Special Reserve was a lot more masculine, and had a more spicy and musky scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong at first, much like the Classic, so be a bit conservative with your &amp;#34;splash&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> My normal go-to AS is the original Clubman, but this one may even surpass that.</li>
            <li> This has gone right up to the top of the list along with the regular Clubman Pinaud.  </li>
            <li> It may be perfect for you, not strong enough for you, depends on your tastes.  </li>
            <li> On first whiff, I detected a strong nearly acrid woody scent.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe I put too high of expectations on the Special Reserve.</li>
            <li> A true classic.</li>
            <li> BUT I loved the other scents so much that I decided to hang on to it and try it again.</li>
            <li> Their Virgin Island Bay Rum leaps out of the bottle and in the first minutes shouts to the world</li>
            <li> Upon opening the plastic bottle and smelling it I feared that this was the first Pinaud that I would regret buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Vanilla is still my favorite Pinaud, but this is a close second.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t handle the intense somewhat synthetic leather scent, so it is a rare one that I dumped out.</li>
            <li> Definitely some of my favorite aftershave.  </li>
            <li> My first thought was,</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it is more diluted in this later production, or not?</li>
            <li> It certainly has the right notes coming off my chemistry.  </li>
            <li> If you do buy this stuff, make sure you have enough Holy Water to shower with as it tends to possess you skin and doesn&#x27;t come off without the Lords Prayer and a Brillo-Pad!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I first opened the bottle, I knew that I was going to like it.</li>
            <li> Cloves was the first thing that came to mind when I smelled it.</li>
            <li> When my wife first smelled it, she kinda turned up her nose.</li>
            <li> Very manly scent!</li>
            <li> It took my breath away at first, and I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> &quot; Imagine this: A bucket of day-old clams, sitting in the hot August sun.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hot on the face, too.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost the same from start to finish with most changes happening immediately after applying.</li>
            <li> It smelled okay when sniffing the bottle, but after applying it to my face, it smelled eerily like the EconoLodge room I stayed in last weekend.</li>
            <li> It actually smells interesting.</li>
            <li> but it IS what I ordered...not the sellers fault, this is just for the folks that want to try this for the first time.</li>
            <li> hey, it was cheap, and it&#x27;ll be a lifetime supply in just one bottle if it doesn&#x27;t show some unexpected use as a bug repellant or self defense spray.</li>
            <li> Very manly-oldtyme and economical.</li>
            <li> The leather and the damask rose compete for attention until you get an aged leather ending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> how my wife described me when I wore it the first time.  </li>
            <li> My issue is with the first seller that shows up.</li>
            <li> This is the first one I immediately did not like.</li>
            <li> My first impression was garbage.</li>
            <li> My second try was also not too enjoyable.</li>
            <li> But a funny thing happened on the way to the trash can...</li>
            <li> This is a potent after shave that I would not use daily or put on running errands on the weekend.</li>
            <li> and so does the wife ;)</li>
            <li> Definitely stings a bit more than others but nothing to be worried about.  </li>
            <li> (Though this smells nothing like English Leather, which to my nose is more spice than leather).</li>
            <li> if you like Clubman products,,,you will love this...very traditional fragrance...</li>
            <li> Thought I would give this a try after enjoying the regular version.  </li>
            <li> but you sure as shootin&#x27;-from-the-hip can go about your day smelling like you just got a straight-razor shave from a barber who&#x27;s seen it all, heard it all, and still has a hand steadier than American virtue.&lt;br</li>
            <li> While, we still can&#x27;t quite place our finger on the exact scents.  </li>
            <li> The drain smelled good for a few days.</li>
            <li> I picked up a bottle of Special Reserve from Amazon, and a bottle of the old school Original Clubman from my local pharmacy (wish they were all available there).</li>
            <li> I was really expecting an old time scent and something strong..</li>
            <li> It definitely has a distinct and strong fragrance, and it sticks with you all day.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too floral/musky for my taste, but I am sure it&#x27;s a fine scent for some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve come to understand there are actually two versions of Special Reserve - the old batches which have a greenish tint to them, and newer batches, that are more reddish brown.  </li>
            <li> As a frequent user of Clubman Pinaud and Virgin Island Bay Rum aftershaves I was interested in giving their Pinaud Special Reserve aftershave cologne a try.  </li>
            <li> but once on my skin it mellows out to a very woodsy, masculine scent that I enjoy (as well as my girlfriend).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try the product to give a more meaningful review of how it smells, but for now, avoid BYPLE to avoid getting screwed for a charge they&#x27;re not honest about.</li>
            <li> If you want to smell like you spend your time thinking deeply about things that matter like beards and War, then you good friends need look no further than this.  </li>
            <li> though the fragrance is strong initially I find that it fades away very fast.</li>
            <li> I usually use Royal Copenhagen Musk which I find to be a good balance of clean and refreshing yet slightly musky.</li>
            <li> It was less than a dollar an ounce, it didn&#x27;t smell as great as some of my more expensive after shaves, but it was definitely a great daily use after shave with a pleasant smell and ridiculously affordable.</li>
            <li> Special Reserve is a masculine, leathery scent that is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Pinaud Special Reserve is masculine, like mellow tobacco and leather.  </li>
            <li> Bought this and the Bay rum solely based on the number of positive reviews that both of them have received on this site but am disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Afterward, you are left with an aroma that is pleasant, masculine, and evident without being apparent.  </li>
            <li> very musky at first</li>
            <li> , i rotate this bay rum and eau de quinine on a regular basis, pinaud is still doing great on unique scents even if it has changed a little, well worth the cheap price!, not a cheap product at all, beats out some expensive aftershaves i use, it will burn if you just shaved fyi its a old school real mans product, put it in a spray bottle and it works great as cologne too!</li>
            <li> I normally love Pinaud products, especially their normal Clubman and Bay Rum lines.</li>
            <li> it stay&#x27;s pretty much the whole day,</li>
            <li> I was expecting a very fragile plastic bottle but should say it is a fairly strong.</li>
            <li> It is way to strong on initial application.</li>
            <li> The dispensing cap smartly prevents inadvespills and drips.</li>
            <li> Ive purchased the Original Clubman and the Lime Sec aftershaves but they dont compare with the Special Reserves scent and toning features.  </li>
            <li> This product works really good as aftershave, does not stings like a aqua velva (which is terrific! 5Stars), but makes do.&lt;br /&gt;Scent is very pleasant, honestly, do not listen to those reviews claiming that this stinks, if that was true, this Special Reserve would never had made it to production.&lt;br /&gt;Smells</li>
            <li> I personally like musk and when I first smelled the product I was amazed by the woody original smell of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be the first to say it, after shave scents are highly subjective.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of regular clubman.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I am a HUGE fan of Pinaud Clubman, and this was a bit of a letdown, but it was close enough to passable that I had to ask the Mrs. to validate my impression.  </li>
            <li> and I really like it.     </li>
            <li> but I really like this scent</li>
            <li> is extremely reasonable for product.</li>
            <li> The burn is there, but it&#x27;s not too much.</li>
            <li> Smell doesn&#x27;t fade away too fast.</li>
            <li> I really like this aftershave.</li>
            <li> Really?).  </li>
            <li> Try pulling a hair from your nose before applying, then it won&#x27;t hurt so much.</li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This the real aromatherapy.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using the regular Clubman and enjoy both the aroma and the sting.</li>
            <li> The smell is something that doesnt really grow on you, you either like it or you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This stuff works really well.  </li>
            <li> Just a add on to what I have on my counter works very well</li>
            <li> stuff is MUCH heavier.</li>
            <li> Very barbershop.</li>
            <li> HEY GET READY TO HAVE THE FAMILY JOIN IN.</li>
            <li> She said very manly, but she has to be close to smell it.</li>
            <li> Will buy again because my wife likes it so much.</li>
            <li> so use of a quality aftershave is absolutely mandatory.  </li>
            <li> Old timey fun</li>
            <li> do enjoy regular Clubman, but I&#x27;ll pass on this.</li>
            <li> Make sure you leave your hands and face wet after your shave when applying it to cut the potency.</li>
            <li> Really woodsy.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use too much though</li>
            <li> I really did not like this when I put it on, but give it time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a barber shop secret, and a great discovery.</li>
            <li> Very manly scent.</li>
            <li> I really recommend this to any man.</li>
            <li> be too much.</li>
            <li> Just like a real man does.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very musky pungent odor</li>
            <li> and it seems like no matter how much you put on people</li>
            <li> Well, maybe I let the hype convince me into buying something I really didn&#x27;t want.</li>
            <li> It had a very floral and powdery scent.</li>
            <li> But I really do like it.</li>
            <li> Lingers much longer.</li>
            <li> and I have to admit the smell is really growing on me.</li>
            <li> I own quite a few Clubman products.</li>
            <li> This cologne has a completely different scent from their standard aftershave - a warm, musky scent.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t personally care for it as much as the original</li>
            <li> Special Reserve will last five or six hours if you splash a couple teaspoons or so on your neck and shoulders, and after that a pleasant but subtle whiff will remain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I do like most other clubman products.</li>
            <li> I smelled this on someone other than myself and was able to fully appreciate its complexity, sophistication, and nuances.</li>
            <li> It is Pinaud in name only and is nothing like the Original formula in feel and smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments from other women as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a familiar behavioral pattern among American companies.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a definite difference from Clubman Original: darker, muskier, spicier, notes of wood and leather.</li>
            <li> But then I&#x27;m not &#x27;surprised&#x27; at this fine aftershave as after all:  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a sweet, spicey, woody, herbal scent that slowly fades and leaves a deeper more musky and (leathery?)</li>
            <li> It has a nice scent that seems to last for a long time.</li>
            <li> Not hardly!</li>
            <li> The new stuff is a greenish color with a different aroma altogether and one does not need to hold the bottle up to the light to see thru the solution.</li>
            <li> recently purchased a bottle of Clubman Special Reserve after shave.</li>
            <li> Unlike the Virgin Island Bay Rum product, this Special Reserve cologne should be applied sparingly and will last all day.  </li>
            <li> Not over powering, a subtle pleasantness that is clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li> The next morning after a nice single edge razor shave I tried it.</li>
            <li> Lasts long, cheap thrill just to put it on in the morning.</li>
            <li> Then, having loved the feel and aroma of SP, I gave Clubman Pinaud a second chance and ordered a second bottle from Amazon and had the same outcome.</li>
            <li> might smell like regular Clubman with maybe a whiskey, leather, or other masculine top note, but when I applied it, I smelled like a combination of a hospital sanitizer and really, really cheap baby powder.  </li>
            <li> Another Made in the USA product all true American patriots should be buying</li>
            <li> Not necessarily bad, but it just appeals to a smaller crowd.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be the first to admit that I don&#x27;t particularly like the smell directly from the bottle</li>
            <li> It is reminiscent of old spice and english leather, but definitely its own animal!</li>
            <li> Has same strength as about any other cologne with a good old fashioned smell.</li>
            <li> Actually mixed in the bottle, something happens and the good leather and tobacco stays there, while the gross spicy floral old lady goes away and is replaced by a kind of polo-black-ish smell (which isn&#x27;t very prominent, but it&#x27;s a way nicer base than old lady spicy flowers .</li>
            <li> I have paid a lot more for a lot less.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 30, so this isn&#x27;t meant to disrespect anyone who may be older than me and has fond memories of the smell and so forth.  </li>
            <li> I like Old Spice, Bay Rum, Sandalwood and your so called cheap aftershaves like English Leather, Stetson etc.</li>
            <li> But that could just be that my family did not us this particular scent.</li>
            <li> I guess I had hoped for something spicier than the Classic Pinaud Clubman, this was not it.</li>
            <li> The smell on this is decent.</li>
            <li> It also works better than most expensive aftershaves in is ability to sooth my face after a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t even smell particularly manly in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It is smoky, has a bit of leather, some musk, traces of the classic Clubman...</li>
            <li> Another classic Clubman product.</li>
            <li> Most definitely not - it has a very strong odor that gets worse</li>
            <li> This Special Reserve is very close to several of the Floris scents I have tried at a much lower price:  spicy, warm undertones with a moderately pungent floral character, but thankfully less floral than Floris!  </li>
            <li> It definitely has lasting power, but the scent is clean, masculine, not at all floral or sweet.  </li>
            <li> She may have been being a touch dramatic, but I could tell I was wearing it several hours after applying the original and vanilla scents work best for me, but I plan to try some of the other ones too.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve compared it to several other sandalwood scents that I own, and this is stronger than all of them.  </li>
            <li> Leather, tobacco, some other spices which I can&#x27;t pinpoint, but the overall scent is warm and manly.  </li>
            <li> It is a powerful scent that has long and strong staying power (for better or worse).</li>
            <li> Not one of my favorite scents; a little too earthy for my taste.</li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW !!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK but a little bit like 3 &amp;1 oil smell.</li>
            <li> WOW!!</li>
            <li> It does smell old timey, but in a very distinguished,clean and classic way.</li>
            <li> Enjoy the smell a little bit pungent at first.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Clubman Special reserve never really developed this reputation.</li>
            <li> Very unmistakably masculine smell.</li>
            <li> ; fragrance is designed for the &amp;#34;Metro-Sexual&amp;#34; young man who wants his mother, (with whom he lives), to like how he smells.  </li>
            <li> The scent is overwhelmingly powerful and gives me a low-grade headache for the entire day.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;You are such an accomplished poet; use your skills as a wordsmith to tell us exactly what this product smells</li>
            <li> It is strong enough to last all day, so</li>
            <li> It could be because of the tropical climate where I live.  </li>
            <li> Like a brand new Leather motorcycle jacket.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll switch back to the original Pinaud, which I give 5 stars to, the special reserve is a little spicy on the scent for my tastes.</li>
            <li> It has pretty strong green tobacco and cedar components, and a rich, dark, masculine scent.</li>
            <li> Something between leather and the outdoors in a serious kind of way.</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t like how it is packaged in a plastic bottle, however it doesn&#x27;t really detract that much.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is meant to be used as an aftershave, even though that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s labeled as, but nevertheless, a brilliant reminder of more manly times (think MAD MEN).</li>
            <li> However, I like this smell very much and only wish it was offered in glass</li>
            <li> very old school manly scent</li>
            <li> My favorite scent so far, a classic spice scent that reminds me of times past.</li>
            <li> My significant other loves it.</li>
            <li> I know this is inexpensive, however, to me, the original smelled like a more expensive product.</li>
            <li> As attested to by the varied reviews, people have very different experiences with not only this, but many different scents.</li>
            <li> I like the scent, but not sure I love it.  </li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> When you first open this bottle you may not like what you smell, but don&#x27;t let that put you off.</li>
            <li> I have just about the entire Clubman line of aftershaves and colognes, and, second to the almighty Clubman Original, this one is my favorite.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells like the warm naugahyde of a freshly vacated booth in a shady diner just shut down by the health</li>
            <li> This one is a little too strong for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve personally been searching far and wide for products to upgrade my manly arsenal, and have been grabbing a hold of any product that is economical (and with a list price of $6.89 it seemed worth a shot).</li>
            <li> When that same man then goes out to his local gentleman&#x27;s club, discussing politicis and religion, smoking a cigar and having a brandy with his fellows, he wears Special Reserve.</li>
            <li> when I&#x27;m about to apply the witch hazel, I&#x27;ll pour the tiny amount of it in my hand, then splash into the same hand a bit of the Special Reserve, rub hands together and THEN apply.</li>
            <li> original Clubman is sometimes derided as being an \\&quot;old man&#x27;s\\&quot; scent because it was used in barber shops for so many years, but Special Reserve is a less-known scent, a very well-kept secret in fact, so few people will recognize it, and it therefore carries no such stigma.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m pretty sure it smells like the old Estee Lauder perfume that everyone and I mean everyone&#x27;s grandma used to wear!</li>
            <li> There are other fragrance notes, but i can&#x27;t identify them except to say that none of them is sweet; even so, they blend together</li>
            <li> I find that strange because it smells strong to me for a long time, but</li>
            <li> I do not dislike or overly like it compared to my other stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Seems a little stronger than my other scents and smells better aired out more.</li>
            <li> so nick cuts and abrasions are minimal and perhaps that is why no big slap in the face experience using this for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me...not STRONG, it is detectable, it is &#x27;soft&#x27; ins scent, bit of leather but not musk,</li>
            <li> I must agree with several other reviewers: Special Reserve is an unusual fragrance, especially if you are accustomed to modern after shaves that leave you smelling like a floral arrangement or a basket of fruit.</li>
            <li> Other brands ( LUCKY TIGER)  OFFER (16oz) bottles.</li>
            <li> I very much liked this fragrance and my other half doesn&#x27;t have any complaints about it.</li>
            <li> Clubman Special Reserve Cologne is a dark, smoky, masculine scent that lasts for hours.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fairly young guy who has been on a quest for the old school masculine scents.</li>
            <li> Old school musk scent, with lasting power for a fraction of what modern colognes/ eau de toilette&#x27;s cost.  </li>
            <li> It does smell like old man.</li>
            <li> I really like those last two.</li>
            <li> It is distinctly masculine without the slightest hint of metro-sexual.  </li>
            <li> THIS IS ONE OF PINAUDS OLD FASHION BARBERSHOP SCENTS STILL IN USE TODAY.</li>
            <li> The smell reminds me of the cologne that an old man from India would wear.  </li>
            <li> THESE will take you back to the time when your father or grandfather took you to a REAL BARBER SHOP.</li>
            <li> As an aftershave, it has the enough alcohol to give you a tingle after a shave which is really why I purchased the product.  </li>
            <li> Like an old cologne that&#x27;s 50 years old.  </li>
            <li> I just started using Clubman products, and, thus far, I like them all.  </li>
            <li> the old Barber Shop smells like Taylor of Old Bond St. does, Geo F. Trumper etc.</li>
            <li> Old world barbershop aftershave.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing old or spicy about this one.  </li>
            <li> Some may call it an &amp;#34;old man&amp;#34; smell (as they do others in the Pinaud line); I call it ADULT.</li>
            <li> Of all the Clubman Pinaud scents I&#x27;ve tried, this is the only one I absolutely can&#x27;t stand.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really that simple.</li>
            <li> Well here goes very woody and earthy with a touch of English leather</li>
            <li> that I never like, a bit closer to wild country in that way.</li>
            <li> Really really enjoy this one, although the bottle is green, not orange as shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s old school, ultra masculine, leathery and woody.  </li>
            <li> If you a sensitive lady boy, you may be offended by my review.</li>
            <li> This regular one is much closer to what the barbers use.</li>
            <li> and you sit near the fire and the smoke saturates your clothes?</li>
            <li> This is a classy scent for cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> well, if you like old, manly tastes this is for you.</li>
            <li> I really like the regular scent as well as the vanilla.</li>
            <li> wow</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a very smoky, deep scent.</li>
            <li> Again, I like it, and I wear it frequently.</li>
            <li> Used so far as an aftershave.  </li>
            <li> Definitely old time barber shop smell.  </li>
            <li> and if you meet a young gal that you&#x27;re keen on, wait until you have her hooked to bust this manliness out</li>
            <li> It really has a longevity and complexity that put similarly priced Aftershaves to shame.</li>
            <li> Takes me back to childhood going to a real barber.</li>
            <li> Many people do like this, so I wouldn&#x27;t want to discourage anyone from at least trying it.  </li>
            <li> THE ITEM RECEIVED WAS:BACH RESCUE REMEDY NATURAL STRESS RELIEF DROPS.</li>
            <li> Last a more than few hours.</li>
            <li> because on the days I use the Special Reserve, I have to change it up slightly.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, though, and my wife can&#x27;t tolerate it even when applied very lightly.  </li>
            <li> It had a slight sting, very quick, nothing to note actually</li>
            <li> let this stuff dry down first if this is a first time experince as it becomes an amazing smell on dry down!</li>
            <li> A nice musky scent, is a touch of English Leather, with a kiss of dirty diaper full of Indian food.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m typically not a fan of aftershave products.</li>
            <li> This is a definite classic scent, even if you&#x27;ve never smelled it before.</li>
            <li> The stuff is too sweet -- in a cheap, drugstore-like way --  and at 5 PM the aroma is unfortunately still there.</li>
            <li> I do not prefer this to the regular clubman after shave (which is a classic), in neither feel nor smell.  </li>
            <li> I mixed it about 2/3 or 3/4 SR to 1/3 or 1/4 Classic Vanilla.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is complex: it seems too loud when you first splash it on, but it soon settles down to a nice chamber orchestra instead of a street band, and after an hour or two it&#x27;s a string quartet with different instruments taking a solo from time to time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> is my review part - now, my question on the name which has nothing to do perhaps with the product.&lt;br /&gt;Companies and products historically reserve the phrases &amp;#34;Reserve&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Special Reserve&amp;#34; to denote that it is a limited release and availability, commands a higher price due to this AND that there indeed is something special about it.  </li>
            <li> After Shave Lotion, 6 Ounce]]Easily my favorite and the scent is very long lasting compared to the other brands I have reviewed here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t put too much on, it goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected at first</li>
            <li> Normally, I wouldn&#x27;t buy anything that I don&#x27;t put past the smell test, but based on all the positive reviews, and the fact this particular bottle was factory sealed, I pulled the trigger and bought a bottle.</li>
            <li> It instantly reminded me of Aramis, only a bit different (much like the Classic</li>
            <li> It will calm down.</li>
            <li> but it does calm down.</li>
            <li> The original SP had a very dark brown color which one could hardly see thru if the bottle were held up to the light.</li>
            <li> It is hard to place the elements of this aftershave, some say it is STRONG</li>
            <li> For about $7, I&#x27;d definitely give it a shot especially if you enjoy other Clubman products.</li>
            <li> But most people either will love it or hate it (except me, of course, as I am decidedly undecided).  </li>
            <li> This is a refreshing, every day aftershave that is so reasonably priced that you would be silly to not give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I see how this could be a love or hate thing, but man, do I love it.</li>
            <li> It pretty much stays exactly that way through a fairly long and subtle &amp;#34;fade-out&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve tried samples of the various scents from Floris - an English company that was a favorite of Ian Flemming, who used (if memory serves)</li>
            <li> The scent is a lot more firm then some of the other clubman products i use.</li>
            <li> This recent one seems to be weaker in that regard than the older one, although the same fragrance.</li>
            <li> A few days later I took the plunge and splashed some Special Reserve on after a shave.  </li>
            <li> I generally like the smell of this stuff.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of Pinaud products in general.  </li>
            <li> Will last a long time since you don&#x27;t need much unless maybe you didn&#x27;t shower.</li>
            <li> This one reminds me of the old English Leather aroma.  </li>
            <li> My wife thought it smelled like medicinal and gross old man when I opened the bottle</li>
            <li> If your looking to buy a terrific Clubman scent, may I direct you to Clubman Virgin Island Bay Rum Aftershave.</li>
            <li> It definitely takes some getting used to and is a masculine scent, but it&#x27;s a bit too floral for my liking.  </li>
            <li> It caught my attention as an old scent that I may have actually smelled someone using it when I was a child and haven&#x27;t smelled it again since.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s up to you whether you find this scent manly, or reminiscent of an old incontinent guy in a nursing home -</li>
            <li> and you will be rewarded with a scent that is masculine and different.</li>
            <li> Like Old Spice, English Leather, Speed Stick, Vitalis, talcum powder and wood all mingling together...</li>
            <li> If your looking for an aftershave that isn&#x27;t the same old same old, this is it.</li>
            <li> I actually bought three of these and gave two of them to an old WWII vet that uses the stuff.  </li>
            <li> I mean seriously dark) floral profile, wherein damask rose is the dominant note.</li>
            <li> Once applied, it quickly settled into a mature complex aroma.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it has strong powdery notes,</li>
            <li> I agree with others that it starts strong (almost gamey) then mellows into a scent that you love or hate.</li>
            <li> Reading through the other reviews, there are many scents to which this product has been compared: Tobacco, Leather, Clove, Cedar, Smokey Cinnamon, Sandalwood, A Humidor of Cigars (better than just tobacco), and badly scented soap.  </li>
            <li> The standard Clubman is more subdued on the leather with I think a few other blending notes there too.</li>
            <li> Very long lasting and unique scent, cannot pin it down to any one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how other Clubman products smell, but this to me is absolutely repulsive.  </li>
            <li> For the record, I do not like this as much as I do the other Clubman aftershaves.  </li>
            <li> Not completely unpleasant, but not enjoyable to me.  </li>
            <li> ; while sniffing the bottle, then nuzzled up and asked what I was wearing after a shower and shave 20 minutes later, surprised it was the same product.  </li>
            <li> Initially I was worried it would be an old man smell, I&#x27;m only 30</li>
            <li> She said that my aroma was only a step above Old Spice.</li>
            <li> However, if you prefer a more floral, spicy, and heavier scent that is less likely to fade or get too weak, then you might really like this one.</li>
            <li> Because the first sniff had me a little worried.  </li>
            <li> Not too strong, not too weak...</li>
            <li> Not in a bad way at all, but if you apply it in the same amount you apply other aftershaves, it will be too strong for most of the day.</li>
            <li> Very complex smoky, woodsy, strong scent.</li>
            <li> This cologne has a scent that is a cross between a brand new leather jacket, new car smell, Ivory soap, and a touch of cinnamon to round it all out.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s classic clean scent is nostalgic and bracing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One comment in common with many is that what it smells like in the bottle has little to do with what it smells like after it is applied.  </li>
            <li> I could have sworn I heard the distinct sound of the evil pipe organ of the House of Usher and Vincent Prices ghoulish laugh as I lifted the cap off.</li>
            <li> Not the usual brirght, clean scent of other Clubman</li>
            <li> /&gt;Types who will enjoy: Lumbermen, Soldiers, Welders, Steel workers, Machinists, EMS , Fire, Police, Mercenaries,coal miners,farmers, deep sea fishermen,and any other hard working man who provides for themselves and their families without government</li>
            <li> My wife hates it when I put it on, but after it dries and the &amp;#34;old man smell&amp;#34; dissipates, she finds my smooth face with subtle scent irresistible!</li>
            <li> Just astringent enough while still being somewhat soothing, but I mix with a little pure aloe gel because my skin gets dry.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine anyone other than a smoker, or someone whose olfactory sense is otherwise compomised (by old age or illness), to tolerate this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s hard to give a cologne a certain number of stars because each persons taste is different, but I decided to give this cologne 5 stars because I think it accomplishes the goal of such a cologne.  </li>
            <li> I applied to my face right after a cold water cool down from my double edge shave.  </li>
            <li> smell doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> Sent does not last all day long.</li>
            <li> It last a long time as well.</li>
            <li> Last long but not to overpowering.</li>
            <li> , this is a strange one, a very strange, mysteriously good and bad cologne.</li>
            <li> But soon the very heavy, spicy scent kicks in and really lingers.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it unless you want to smell like a little old lady!</li>
            <li> Also i like the rapid way it stops bleeding from the odd and occasional nik tho since I&#x27;ve switched to straight razors I have a lot less niks than when I was using Safety Razors believe it or not.  </li>
            <li> a lot like Paco Rabanne old green bottle, which I personally do like, although there must be people who will not like this, for those there is Axe and stuff.</li>
            <li> I have been returning back to wet shaving and using a double edge razor</li>
            <li> The smell was really truly bad not even like aftershave more like some kind of bathroom cleaner or something similar and was just as bad after the dry down.</li>
            <li> Scent is so highly subjective, it&#x27;s really almost unfair to try to rate it.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical when all the reviews insisted that special reserve had a smell complex enough to be priced very high-</li>
            <li> It still starts out lousy and cheap, but after some time it becomes...sexy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cut above the average aftershave, or no aftershave for that matter, but I still think regular Clubman is the gold</li>
            <li> Imagine a leather saddle rubbed with some mysterious emulsion fragrant with outdoor smells such as wood (cypress?), moss, and maybe a dark herb or floral hint (lavender?), and you&#x27;ll get some idea.</li>
            <li> Myself, and my girlfriend are not really that big of fans.</li>
            <li> But it looks different than the picture, the label is askew, and the barcode sticker was stuck across the front, so when I tried to remove it, it ripped the already tacky looking label.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for my Dad some after shave for a long time because he likes the non-lotion type.  </li>
            <li> Let it air out a bit or shake bottle a few times for the first few times you use it.</li>
            <li> As much as I love Bond, I couldn&#x27;t quite get past the heavy, thick floral character the Floris samples almost universally had.  </li>
            <li> I just received a bottle of Special Reserve today and right off the bat hate it.</li>
            <li> This scent comes off mysterious, hard to place, maybe pine or some woodsy scent that immediately reminded me of an antique library with some very old books.</li>
            <li> Very pleasing &amp; long lasting, I find it hard to reach for any of my other splashes!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I placed a small dab of the original on one wrist and a small dab of this on the other then asked my wife which she preferred.</li>
            <li> Will continue to use this and other clubman products whoever possible!</li>
            <li> I am trying each product for a day or two, independent of any other products just so I can get feel for each one.</li>
            <li> I bought this due to a comment that its scent was similar to the long-lost-and-mourned Jovan Grass Oil.</li>
            <li> turpenols with an immediate dry leather snap upon alcohol evaporation.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Put some on and let it dry</li>
            <li> Super sweet, to the point of being sickening.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving the cologne the same average it had, so as not to change it.</li>
            <li> (sorry, but it&#x27;s true).  </li>
            <li> I initially watered this down with witch hazel</li>
            <li> At first I did not like this stuff so much, it wasn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a classic and subtle</li>
            <li> I feel like I need to put a little extra on.  </li>
            <li> then you&#x27;re only out a little money.</li>
            <li> and the rest promptly flushed down the toilet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several bottles of this bought a few years ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really fond of this scent.  </li>
            <li> My dog ran outside, and my kinds started crying.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of a postal/delivery mix up, it finally arrived.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a wet shaver.</li>
            <li> You either love Pinaud or hate it, there is no middle ground</li>
            <li> and I had the vision of the flesh colored liquid of embalming fluid slowly traveling up the tube on route to its final resting place.  </li>
            <li> One may love it and the next may hate it.  </li>
            <li> NOT A COMPLETE LET DOWN</li>
            <li> At first whiff, I was like whoa what the hell…this is a nasty strong musk.  </li>
            <li> It tends to last a while, and is not a strong irritant as a splash aftershave.  </li>
            <li> After Shave Lotion is a rather linear and yet at the same time complex fragrance upon first generous splashes (DO NOT over-splash with this one) with heavy top-notes of base dark spice and ceylon cinnamon along with pine tar and light burnt</li>
            <li> There is nothing subtle or layered about it -- it is cloying, a masculine version of an old-lady flowery perfume.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d put this behind classic Clubman-</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Although I have not noticed the alcohol drying my skin out badly as other after shaves will do.  </li>
            <li> I keep my blade sharp and shave well</li>
            <li> , what is it supposed to be a &amp;#34;Special Reserve&amp;#34; of, which of the other products is the parent scent?  </li>
            <li> I have bought Clubman aftershave before but in other cents</li>
            <li> i HAVE USED OTHER PINAUD PRODUCTS OVER THE YEARS, BUT NEVER TRIED THIS.</li>
            <li> While I like all of their other products this has a scent that I just don&#x27;t know how to describe other than I can&#x27;t stand it.</li>
            <li> All of the other Clubman properties are there...</li>
            <li> I have other clubman after shaves</li>
            <li> maybe i got the wrong product but the bottle said exactly what&#x60;s on picture and similarities end there.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s exact words were, &amp;#34;Honey, what is wrong with the bathroom?&amp;#34;  when she smelled the aftermath of my application.</li>
            <li> This is not like other Pinaud style.</li>
            <li> I use it in my weekly rotation with other Clubman aftershaves.</li>
            <li> While there are no obvious moisturizing or healing ingredients that I can see on the label, but my face doesn&#x27;t feel dried out or overly tight when using this.  </li>
            <li> Thinking I was perhaps crazy, I conducted a little test and confirmed that I AM crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Today was my first day with the Special Reserve and I must tell you I think its smells awful.</li>
            <li> After the purchase of the second bottle, I knew that the Pinaud Customer Relations rep had just plain lied to me (and wasted my time to add insult to injury).</li>
            <li> Certainly smells expensive.</li>
            <li> i smelled it, it seemed fairly average the after i shaved in the morning</li>
            <li> settles into a dark (and</li>
            <li> , It&#x27;s a sort of dark, leather scent.</li>
            <li> Some hate it, some love it, and some don&#x27;t care either way.</li>
            <li> The price they charge in stores for cologne can sometimes be outrageous but this is a good one.</li>
            <li> It seems to be a love it or hate it proposition.</li>
            <li> Ok, I don&#x27;t hate it</li>
            <li> And the reactions you get will be either people hate it or people love it.</li>
            <li> I did put some on my wrist to see if it settles down or changes odor somewhat</li>
            <li> but with all colognes and after shaves it will dissipate and settle down, and it won&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li> After that, I usually rub down a bit with witch hazel and let that dry while I comb my hair, then apply aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure why the general concensus of hate on Clubman Special Reserve, but I feel it&#x27;s unwarranted.</li>
            <li> I would be less upset about this if it wasn&#x27;t a gift, but it is, and I am now  bit embarrassed to give it to my Dad.</li>
            <li> but kinda regret doing so as the smell is cut in half.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be a slightly musky, woodsy, leather-like scent.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use an after shave (just use witch hazel if I nick my skin), and frankly this has a too complex and lasting fragrance to waste as an after shave anyway.</li>
            <li> it with water for less abrasive smell.</li>
            <li> In fact, I feared this might just be a watered down version of the (in)famous Lilac Vegetal with just a little less urine smell.  </li>
            <li> The only thing special about this product is how bad it is!</li>
            <li> Cap seals tight.    </li>
            <li> A little vanilla, musk and a hint of sandalwood</li>
            <li> A little musk with eucalyptus and wood might have been how she described it.  </li>
            <li> but the reason for 4 stars instead of five is a little complicated.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just a little bit is all you need.</li>
            <li> little too subdued.</li>
            <li> I have to say I was a little disappointed with the Special Reserve.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I am afraid to splash on too much for fear I might not like the way I smell.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Be warned that it will linger for a few hours, so if you don&#x27;t like that</li>
            <li> If I could not shower or wash at all for a few weeks</li>
            <li> heavy fragrance</li>
            <li> I got tired of smelling like a middle school boy after using Axe deodorant, and I wanted something a bit manlier.  </li>
            <li> Shave\\&quot; should be eliminated from the name for this heavy, cheap-smelling stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That scent is absolutely terrific and if it hadnt been for the broken plastic bottle upon arrival to my house, id be wearing it now.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s harsh.</li>
            <li> (I thought she was a bit harsh).  </li>
            <li> which was just to heavy and flowery.  </li>
            <li> This is not free.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like it then give it some time and a few chances.</li>
            <li> In fact, this has almost inspired me to take that dusty bottle of Lilac Vegetal out of the bathroom cabinet and actually try sprinkling some on... almost.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, just think, how old are Pinaud products?</li>
            <li> mine came green colored and smeled like perfumed vodka.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I treat this $6.89 on par if not better then my $50 bottles of cologne.</li>
            <li> For about $6 a bottle, the risk on investment was small.  </li>
            <li> No more of that</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still not sure how I feel.</li>
            <li> Not sure why retailers are not carrying this product on their shelves.</li>
            <li> They soothe my face without any uncomfortable burn, but just enough sting to relieve any itchy feeling that sometimes accompanies the ultraclose</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for us this aftershave was used only once</li>
            <li> Bracing feeling from the alcohol base which is a little too much for me.</li>
            <li> It is subdued, but you can tell you are wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soft tones of leather, a bit of soap...not flowery, just hard to place.  </li>
            <li> I was hard pressed to give a review of this because I am still uncertain of how I feel about it.</li>
            <li> have since used it again and put a few drops on the back of my neck and had no real problems, maybe a little bit of a sinus issue, but nothing terrible.</li>
            <li> Even my 4 yr old son commented on how bad I smelled.  </li>
            <li> somewhere near the bay rum or the lilac vegetal put out by Pinaud, that means alcohol and that means burn, which isn&#x27;t as bad as it</li>
            <li> It will not be my go to aftershave just something to change up with or perhaps after-splash late in the day before going out for the evening.  </li>
            <li> It is not as complex yet way under priced.  </li>
            <li> ; I complained to Customer Relations (of Clubman Pinaud).</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have the sort of educated nose that can identify every scent in a complex fragrance, but I do detect leather.</li>
            <li> then you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;special reserve\\&quot; is an awful scent.  </li>
            <li> Well, both my wife and I hated this smell upon first whiff.  </li>
            <li> Seriously.)</li>
            <li> Hard to find in the stores (if you can even find it!).</li>
            <li> A bit too heavy with a rather unpleasant, not refreshing</li>
            <li> There might be an underlying and subtle spice scent that seems to come out later, what I think some people call a base</li>
            <li> This is a tough product to comment on.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t bad, but not what I expected.</li>
            <li> This stuff straight up smells terrible!</li>
            <li> Smells awful, tried to give it away and no one wants it, so in the trash it went.</li>
            <li> If you tell them it&#x27;s some terribly expensive eau de toilette called l&#x27;homme de gobble de gook they will probably believe you, but if you tell them that it&#x27;s one of the least expensive colognes on the market, they probably won&#x27;t believe you.</li>
            <li> Especially as I&#x27;m tired of weak and watered down ladies cologne relabelled and sold as men&#x27;s aftershave.  </li>
            <li> This aftershave is by far THE WORST EVER.</li>
            <li> Minutes later she had an allergy to it and told me she hated</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> I noticed a faint smoky cinnamon, clove and cedar scent.</li>
            <li> I feel guilty about how inexpensive it is so that is also a plus.</li>
            <li> WTF?</li>
            <li> I can not recommend this product to anyone without feeling guilty.</li>
            <li> But, sorry to say, not this stuff.</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with Pinaud</li>
            <li> A nostalgic and olde-timey scent.</li>
            <li> or it&#x27;s faint.</li>
            <li> I thought Amazon had sent this to the wrong place or it had been stolen from my drop box.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want another stale knockoff.  </li>
            <li> It is difficult to describe a scent in words.  </li>
            <li> Note: Almost all very expensive &amp;#34;modern&amp;#34</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost impossible to find anything around here besides three brands that remind me of a man in a nursing home</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying it is bad, just not for me.</li>
            <li> THAT MIGHT NOT BE ALL BAD.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping I got a bad bottle of this.</li>
            <li> Again I must have gotten a bad bottle.</li>
            <li> You wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> dont know how to describe it, but you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I had nightmares about this crap.</li>
            <li> crap.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t HATE it.  </li>
            <li> Absolutley sick and disgusting floral spicy scent that does not wash off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m considering trying to see whether it will serve as squirrel repellent....</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t mind the scent, but my wife absolutely hated it.</li>
            <li> The smell was a bit sharper with hints of mosquito repellent.  </li>
            <li> Smells awful, threw it away.</li>
            <li> If not, you may have to hire a Paranormal investigator, psychic and priest to cleanse your house of evil spirits once you crack the seal of underworld.  </li>
            <li> WHILE THIS IS WORST SMELLING COLOGNE</li>
            <li> , THIS STUFF IS NASTY SMELLING.</li>
            <li> The wife described it as nasty.</li>
            <li> i put some on and was so disgusted i had to shower again to get</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s disgusting smell off.</li>
            <li> REALLY awful.  </li>
            <li> It gave me a nasty headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This smells awful!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It does smell like old man. Sorry.</li>
            <li> Okay let me start off my review by saying this is one of those hit-or-miss scents. Some hate it, some love it, and some don&#x27;t care either way. I love the smell, it&#x27;s a sweet, spicey, woody, herbal scent that slowly fades and leaves a deeper more musky and (leathery?) scent. Definitely a strong masculine fragrance even though it does smell sweet and spicey at first; and it kind of reminds me of an aftershave a man would wear out during the winter or at night when he&#x27;s going out. Wasn&#x27;t what I expected at first but this scent has grown on me and will sit on the shelf next to my Original Pinaud Clubman, Old Spice, and soon two nice bottles of Pinaud Clubman Vanilla and Bay Rum.</li>
            <li> This does contain alcohol, contrary to some of the descriptions I&#x27;ve seen on this product.  Although I have not noticed the alcohol drying my skin out badly as other after shaves will do.  My wife hates it when I put it on, but after it dries and the &amp;#34;old man smell&amp;#34; dissipates, she finds my smooth face with subtle scent irresistible!</li>
            <li> Love the original scent and thought I&#x27;d give this a try. Smells awful, threw it away. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve personally been searching far and wide for products to upgrade my manly arsenal, and have been grabbing a hold of any product that is economical (and with a list price of $6.89 it seemed worth a shot). I personally like musk and when I first smelled the product I was amazed by the woody original smell of it. However that feeling would be nothing compared to when I actually put it on. It has a strong smell almost like cinnamon yet it almost immediately dissipates into a very smooth, robust smell with a bold full bodied smell that hints at many flavors that you can&#x27;t quite put your finger on. This is a very original scent that I put on whenever I want to make an impression. I treat this $6.89 on par if not better then my $50 bottles of cologne. I would highly recommend this aftershave, its unlike any others in a very special way.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite smell.</li>
            <li> A gift your man will appreciate and you both will enjoy the pleasant aroma when he wears this. Not over powering, a subtle pleasantness that is clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li> It is hard to place the elements of this aftershave, some say it is STRONG but I did not find it so.  Their Virgin Island Bay Rum leaps out of the bottle and in the first minutes shouts to the world, I AM HERE, not the Special Reserve.  It is subdued, but you can tell you are wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soft tones of leather, a bit of soap...not flowery, just hard to place.  It is unique, it does smell nice.  It will not be my go to aftershave just something to change up with or perhaps after-splash late in the day before going out for the evening.  I applied to my face right after a cold water cool down from my double edge shave.  It had a slight sting, very quick, nothing to note actually but it does have alcohol so expect a bit of this after a shave.  I keep my blade sharp and shave well so nick cuts and abrasions are minimal and perhaps that is why no big slap in the face experience using this for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me...not STRONG, it is detectable, it is &#x27;soft&#x27; ins scent, bit of leather but not musk, a sweetness smell to it.  Is that &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; ?  Well, not to me but it is pleasant, will not offend due to strong odor those around you.  It may be perfect for you, not strong enough for you, depends on your tastes.  For me, I will keep it around and use it up, but it will not be my signature scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is my review part - now, my question on the name which has nothing to do perhaps with the product.&lt;br /&gt;Companies and products historically reserve the phrases &amp;#34;Reserve&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Special Reserve&amp;#34; to denote that it is a limited release and availability, commands a higher price due to this AND that there indeed is something special about it.  I have Clubman product, as this is a stand alone release, what is it supposed to be a &amp;#34;Special Reserve&amp;#34; of, which of the other products is the parent scent?  I find nothing Special about it, and as there is an unlimited supply and available to non-insiders of Clubman, why is it a reserve?  Reserved for who ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, end of questions.</li>
            <li> NOT A COMPLETE LET DOWN BUT I WILL NOT WRITTE HOME TO TEL MY MOM.  I WILL NOT RECOMMEND TO MY ENEMIES</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to say it&#x27;s Sandalwood, and quite potent.  My opinion is that it&#x27;s hits the nose good bit stronger than the regular clubman scent. I&#x27;ve compared it to several other sandalwood scents that I own, and this is stronger than all of them.  I would not splash this on, but a dab or two is enough.  If you&#x27;re in the right mood, then you&#x27;ll like it.  I still prefer the original clubman scent which carries that good old fashioned barbershop quality.  The Special Reserve is something I will keep around when the mood hits me.</li>
            <li> Very smooth after shave and another great Pinaud product.  The scent is of old academia with aged wooden desks, leather furniture, pipe tobacco, and a flower garden outside an open window.  It goes well with crisp, almost warm weather.</li>
            <li> Excellent leather scent; great value.  Goes well as is or layered with Elsha 1776 cologne.</li>
            <li> Love the old school scent</li>
            <li> Manly? Not hardly! There must be some shills on here promoting this after shave. Don&#x27;t buy it unless you want to smell like a little old lady!</li>
            <li> Reminds me of one summer when my family was on holiday.  We rented an estate called Netherfield.  At the time, my  father was mourning his beloved Scottish Deerhound, Chauncey.  It was then he realized, that Netherfield was not  his beautiful house, our mum, was not his beautiful wife.  As he stormed outside, he suddenly collapsed to his knees with heartbreak!!  \\&quot;Curse you Mr. Darcy!!  Rot in H-E-DOUBLE TOOTHPICKS!!!\\&quot;    As our father staggered to his feet, he roared, \\&quot;BOY!!  FETCH ME MY CLUBMAN SPECIAL RESERVE!!  The 6 oz  bottle, you hear me?!?!\\&quot;  We never heard from him again.</li>
            <li> You either love Pinaud or hate it, there is no middle ground it seems.  I&#x27;ve tried the Virgin Island Bay Rum, Classic Clubman, and the Vanilla, and enjoyed them all (especially the Vanilla, that stuff is great).  So I gave this one a try after reading the favorable reviews.  For about $6 a bottle, the risk on investment was small.  Upon opening the plastic bottle and smelling it I feared that this was the first Pinaud that I would regret buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, I decanted about 5 ounces into a glass bottle with shaker top that Amazon sells for those folks who make and bottle their own hot sauce.  These are great for decanting &amp;#34;drug store&amp;#34; after shaves out of their plastic bottles to remove that plastic funkiness that all Pinaud&#x27;s seem to have at first.  A few days later I took the plunge and splashed some Special Reserve on after a shave.  It instantly reminded me of Aramis, only a bit different (much like the Classic reminds me of Brut, only different).  It&#x27;s strong at first, much like the Classic, so be a bit conservative with your &amp;#34;splash&amp;#34;.  Leather, tobacco, some other spices which I can&#x27;t pinpoint, but the overall scent is warm and manly.  It definitely has lasting power, but the scent is clean, masculine, not at all floral or sweet.  I can smell this stuff from the time I splash it on, through the rest of my morning routine, getting dressed, making coffee, and then during my drive to work in the car.  About an hour or so.  Then, it starts to fade, to the point where I no longer perceive it but I get whiffs of it throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good winter time after shave.  The scent and feel just seem to &amp;#34;go&amp;#34; with colder temps as opposed to the menthol after shaves like Floid Blue which are definitely warm weather after shaves.  While there are no obvious moisturizing or healing ingredients that I can see on the label, but my face doesn&#x27;t feel dried out or overly tight when using this.  I get a kind of matte feeling to my skin which is rather pleasant.  Overall, this has become part of my rotation, especially in the colder weather now.  The Vanilla is still my favorite Pinaud, but this is a close second.</li>
            <li> Another of Clubman&#x27;s great AS.  I enjoy many of the Cluman scents, this is my favorite at the moment.</li>
            <li> At first  I wasn&#x27;t sure if I liked this . Have original clubman and vanilla . both great. I put this on and I couldn&#x27;t figure if liked it or not . Well it gets really good as it sets in. great scent and worth much more than the price.</li>
            <li> smell doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t handle the intense somewhat synthetic leather scent, so it is a rare one that I dumped out. The drain smelled good for a few days. The standard Clubman is more subdued on the leather with I think a few other blending notes there too. I am using that as well as their Virgin Islands Bay Rum and Osage Rub. I really like those last two. A generally nice and thrifty product line of which I do enjoy. Just not this one..</li>
            <li> Got this in a shipment yesterday and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out. The initial smell is bit well strange but after a refreshing splash on the face and a minute later the aromas blend very nicely and leave a very very pleasant smell to enjoy for the day.  There are layers to this after shave - so many scents you can pick up on.  A little vanilla, musk and a hint of sandalwood it seems.  Very pleased with this purchase and no other after shave will come in contact with my face except Pinaud.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to give a cologne a certain number of stars because each persons taste is different, but I decided to give this cologne 5 stars because I think it accomplishes the goal of such a cologne.  This cologne has a scent that is a cross between a brand new leather jacket, new car smell, Ivory soap, and a touch of cinnamon to round it all out.  It&#x27;s definitely not trying to be one of the scents you find at the mens section in the mall.  It is distinctly masculine without the slightest hint of metro-sexual.  This cologne is a keeper in the lineup.</li>
            <li> Love its&#x27; \\&quot;Old-Fashioned\\&quot; aroma...as do ALL my girl/lady friends! And gets the gents thinking &#x27;bout forming a barber shoppe quartet. Labels one as being manly, not effeminate. This IS Special!</li>
            <li> At first I did not like this stuff so much, it wasn&#x27;t bad but I didn&#x27;t think it was as good as the bay rum or the original scent. After 2 or 3 uses it actually grew in me and I really like it.     I can&#x27;t honestly tell you that I smell leather, as others have claimed. Instead, it smells a bit sweet and perfumy but it is not obnoxious or cloying. Be warned that it will linger for a few hours, so if you don&#x27;t like that then it might not be for you. I am not one to wear cologne or want an aftershave to linger but I really like this scent and I am glad it lingers for hours because it is very pleasant.    Give it a fair shot.</li>
            <li> THIS IS ONE OF PINAUDS OLD FASHION BARBERSHOP SCENTS STILL IN USE TODAY. IT HAS A VERY PLEASENT MASCULINE AROMA WITHOUT BEING OVER POWERING AND LADIES SEEM TO LOVE IT. TAKE MY WORD ON THAT.</li>
            <li> Very different...quite unique fragrance.  Wasn&#x27;t sure if we liked it at first, but love it on my husband and price is extremely reasonable for product.</li>
            <li> Wish they sold this stuff in stores.  Definitely some of my favorite aftershave.  Supremely old school with the bay rum- perfect for evenings out as it has a little more spice than regular Clubman.</li>
            <li> I love this after shave. It has pretty strong green tobacco and cedar components, and a rich, dark, masculine scent. It is potent and lasts for hours. The scent evolves and opens up over time. I think it is excellent.</li>
            <li> Ceder, Ceder, Ceder, love it, warm ceder, clove mix.....</li>
            <li> Not bad but I prefer the original blend.</li>
            <li> NOT AT ALL what I was looking for in an after shave.  The smell reminds me of the cologne that an old man from India would wear.  I travel through Dubai alot since I work in the Middle East and I know the smell.  This after shave actually gace me a headache.  Go with the regular Clubman or some Bay Rum.  THESE will take you back to the time when your father or grandfather took you to a REAL BARBER SHOP.</li>
            <li> Good delivered as expected.</li>
            <li> I know there are many people out there who love this cologne.  After reading the reviews and in search of something different, I ordered a bottle.  It arrived yesterday.  I don&#x27;t know how other Clubman products smell, but this to me is absolutely repulsive.  My wife couldn&#x27;t stand it.  Even my 4 yr old son commented on how bad I smelled.  I&#x27;m 30, so this isn&#x27;t meant to disrespect anyone who may be older than me and has fond memories of the smell and so forth.  It just happens to not smell very good on me and I think that most guys my age would probably do well to stay away from it.</li>
            <li> Very unmistakably masculine smell. If you&#x27;re used to flowery colognes, you&#x27;re in for a surprise. My significant other loves it. The burn is there, but it&#x27;s not too much. Smell doesn&#x27;t fade away too fast. Great aftershave.</li>
            <li> Clubman Special Reserve Cologne is a dark, smoky, masculine scent that lasts for hours.  It is my favorite of all the Pinaud scents.  I just wish they would offer it in a 12 ounce size!</li>
            <li> When i got this i opened the bottle and i smelled the top, and i got this good smell of manliness. After my shave i applied on my face, and i could still smell it hours later. This is great, smells smoky, its a pleasant scent, Stings a lot if you have a nick(thats how you know its a real aftershave). This is how Aftershaves should be like</li>
            <li> Not one of my favorite scents; a little too earthy for my taste.</li>
            <li> Opeining the bottle and nosing the scent left me thinking I had got a bottle of musk. The next morning after a nice single edge razor shave I tried it. My first thought was, \\&quot;hmmmm different\\&quot;. I noticed a faint smoky cinnamon, clove and cedar scent. It wasn&#x27;t bad, but not what I expected. After it had been on for about 30 minutes it took on a very pleasant smell that my wife really likes. It does smell old timey, but in a very distinguished,clean and classic way. I really like this aftershave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several bottles of this bought a few years ago. I have really liked the fresh feel on my shaved face and the similar fragrance to that patted on by the barber. This recent one seems to be weaker in that regard than the older one, although the same fragrance. Don&#x27;t know if it is more diluted in this later production, or not?</li>
            <li> Always liked the clean smell.</li>
            <li> Like I said MY WIFE LOVES THIS STUFF.  Yours will too.  It&#x27;s not your grand pa&#x27;s Old Spice or Hi Karate.  Try it you&#x27;ll like, so will your Ole Lady.</li>
            <li> This is a tough product to comment on.  Reading through the other reviews, there are many scents to which this product has been compared: Tobacco, Leather, Clove, Cedar, Smokey Cinnamon, Sandalwood, A Humidor of Cigars (better than just tobacco), and badly scented soap.  Not to mention comparisons to English Leather and Canoe. (Canoe?  Citrus?  Really?).  One comment in common with many is that what it smells like in the bottle has little to do with what it smells like after it is applied.  That I can confirm.  On first whiff, I detected a strong nearly acrid woody scent.  Once applied, it quickly settled into a mature complex aroma.  I imagine, that it is one of those scents that will emanate a different note on different men.  It certainly has the right notes coming off my chemistry.  My wife decidedly claimed it was &amp;#34;stinky soap&amp;#34; while sniffing the bottle, then nuzzled up and asked what I was wearing after a shower and shave 20 minutes later, surprised it was the same product.  As an aftershave, it has the enough alcohol to give you a tingle after a shave which is really why I purchased the product.  Afterward, you are left with an aroma that is pleasant, masculine, and evident without being apparent.  Nice. Note: Almost all very expensive &amp;#34;modern&amp;#34; fragrance is designed for the &amp;#34;Metro-Sexual&amp;#34; young man who wants his mother, (with whom he lives), to like how he smells.  Those perfumes are really better suited for women.  They are flowery or sweet-musky or citrus.  That is about it.  There is not a hint of daffodils and strawberries in Clubman Special Reserve.  That&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li> This is a great scent! Manly and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> This one&#x27;s a &amp;#34;stinker&amp;#34;.  Like an old cologne that&#x27;s 50 years old.  Pass this one up!</li>
            <li> I cant praise this wonderful aftershave enough tho I&#x27;ve tried many brands to be sure.....  Be warned it has a Strong and Powerful Scent but after hearing such strong approval from the ladies I&#x27;m going to make it my main Go To Aftershave.  Especially as I&#x27;m tired of weak and watered down ladies cologne relabelled and sold as men&#x27;s aftershave.  Also i like the rapid way it stops bleeding from the odd and occasional nik tho since I&#x27;ve switched to straight razors I have a lot less niks than when I was using Safety Razors believe it or not.  But then I&#x27;m not &#x27;surprised&#x27; at this fine aftershave as after all:  I regard all CLUBMAN products as superior......  They speak for themselves.  And only from AMAZON!.  Indiana ED</li>
            <li> I have bought Clubman aftershave before but in other cents and I liked them. The special reserve gave me a headache and I couldn&#x27;t get the smell off of my hands. It actually ruined my lunch that day.</li>
            <li> The best of all Pinaud. I can&#x27;t place the scent, but it&#x27;s got me intrigued. Certainly smells expensive. All I can say is WOW !!</li>
            <li> I just started using Clubman products, and, thus far, I like them all.  This one reminds me of the old English Leather aroma.  I liked it back then, in the sixties, so I think this one will make me happy too.  Good burn when applied after a close shave.  If you are a tenderfoot (face-wise), you should be prepared to have watery eyes.  Try pulling a hair from your nose before applying, then it won&#x27;t hurt so much.</li>
            <li> Love it. I own quite a few Clubman products. The Special Reserve is probably my favorite. If you want a manly smell, this is it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really fond of this scent.  I&#x27;m not saying it is bad, just not for me.</li>
            <li> I know this is inexpensive, however, to me, the original smelled like a more expensive product. Personal preference, I guess.</li>
            <li> This stuff straight up smells terrible! I&#x27;m a fairly young guy who has been on a quest for the old school masculine scents. I like the old Barber Shop smells like Taylor of Old Bond St. does, Geo F. Trumper etc. I like Old Spice, Bay Rum, Sandalwood and your so called cheap aftershaves like English Leather, Stetson etc. I also have the original Pinaud aftershave that I like pretty well, but this stuff while I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on it, I&#x27;m pretty sure it smells like the old Estee Lauder perfume that everyone and I mean everyone&#x27;s grandma used to wear! Why this would be considered a man&#x27;s scent I haven&#x27;t the slightest clue!</li>
            <li> Gents &amp; Shaman&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently purchased a bottle of Clubman Special Reserve after shave. Normally, I wouldn&#x27;t buy anything that I don&#x27;t put past the smell test, but based on all the positive reviews, and the fact this particular bottle was factory sealed, I pulled the trigger and bought a bottle. Additionally, I am a huge fan of the classic Clubman \\&quot;barber shop\\&quot; products: Aftershave, talc &amp; shampoo.  Well, I got home, unwrapped the seal and unscrewed the cap....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I can say is, \\&quot;NO!\\&quot; My wife, who was at one point standing next to me, ran away. My dog ran outside, and my kinds started crying. I could have sworn I heard the distinct sound of the evil pipe organ of the House of Usher and Vincent Prices ghoulish laugh as I lifted the cap off. I saw several translucint spirits waft from the bottle as I held it to my nose and I had the vision of the flesh colored liquid of embalming fluid slowly traveling up the tube on route to its final resting place.  Bottom line, for me--this stuff is horrible--and all the rave reviews must be a conspirators gag on the rest of us... well done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gentlemen: Please, Please, Please smell this stuff before you purchase.  If not, you may have to hire a Paranormal investigator, psychic and priest to cleanse your house of evil spirits once you crack the seal of underworld.  If you do buy this stuff, make sure you have enough Holy Water to shower with as it tends to possess you skin and doesn&#x27;t come off without the Lords Prayer and a Brillo-Pad!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have been warned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peace be with you all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MM</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s in a name? Special Reserve is a masculine, leathery scent that is not overpowering. I splash this on after shaving for a clean fresh feeling and a wonderful fragrance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not made from scorpion venom or the gonads of a great white shark.  But most people either will love it or hate it (except me, of course, as I am decidedly undecided).  Give it a whirl. You&#x27;re only risking seven bucks!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t reek  Bottle is pretty cheap.  Cap seals tight.    Mrs likes the scent. Good enough for me.</li>
            <li> Basically,same as the original.</li>
            <li> Special Reserve has a clean, masculine scent. It cools my face and neck, and the scent lasts for hours. I get many compliments on this after shave.</li>
            <li> It has a hint of barbershops when I was a kid.</li>
            <li> Traditional. Pleasant.  Old world barbershop aftershave.  If you like aftershaves, add this one to your supply.  Refreshing, never overpowers.  Gives a great finishing touch to a shave.</li>
            <li> If you are into leather scents...this puts a lot of the pricey EDT to shame. It is not as complex yet way under priced.  A true classic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m typically not a fan of aftershave products. Most are too perfumy and aggravate my allergies. This stuff (like the other Clubman products I&#x27;ve tried) is great. It has a nice scent that seems to last for a long time. It can seem quite strong at first, but then settles into a pleasant spicy scent. I&#x27;m really impressed.</li>
            <li> I could bath in this stuff ..... One of the most refined gentlemanly scents I have used and I have used a lot. Any Pinaud user needs this in their rotation period. Trust me its like a light musk meets the original clubman and out came perfection.</li>
            <li> I like it as it is quite retro, but I don&#x27;t acctually recognize the scent as one from my youth.  But that could just be that my family did not us this particular scent.</li>
            <li> Like how it feels after shaving!</li>
            <li> not disappointing in the least...as it develops, there is alot of complexity while it mellows. despite all the&lt;br /&gt;other notes mentioned by others, i sense an interesting vegetal, celery-like note.</li>
            <li> Very good would love to see it in a lotion form.</li>
            <li> Was hoping for same scent as talcum powder.</li>
            <li> Initially I was worried it would be an old man smell, I&#x27;m only 30 so we can&#x27;t have any of that. My wife thought it smelled like medicinal and gross old man when I opened the bottle but after I put it on she liked it.  A little musk with eucalyptus and wood might have been how she described it.  I like it too, but we all know her opinion is the important one.</li>
            <li> The scent is nice and it gets even nicer as the day goes by. I am looking forward to wearing this on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing old or spicy about this one.  It&#x27;s just my favorite aftershave -- at any price!.  It&#x27;s soothing, and smells very manly &amp; very sophisticated.</li>
            <li> Unique aroma and it grows on you as you use it.</li>
            <li> Do you want to smell like a man? Then this is the scent for you!!! Very pleasing &amp; long lasting, I find it hard to reach for any of my other splashes!</li>
            <li> This is a very good after shave lotion. The aroma lingers but it is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I must agree with several other reviewers: Special Reserve is an unusual fragrance, especially if you are accustomed to modern after shaves that leave you smelling like a floral arrangement or a basket of fruit. Although I don&#x27;t possess the sophisticated sniffer that others do, the main scent that I notice is &amp;#34;tobacco.&amp;#34; It reminds me pleasantly of a humidor filled with cigars, *not* an overflowing ashtray.There are other fragrance notes, but i can&#x27;t identify them except to say that none of them is sweet; even so, they blend together very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Special Reserve is definitely an old-school/classic scent. Some may call it an &amp;#34;old man&amp;#34; smell (as they do others in the Pinaud line); I call it ADULT. I like it a lot, but I don&#x27;t think its distinctive fragrance would appeal to everybody</li>
            <li> Ordered in error. Not dissapointed</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know what to expect.  I love this robust scent.  Reminds me of some of the scents I came across in highschool that I felt were for more mature men.  Now this fits me perfectly.  I feel guilty about how inexpensive it is so that is also a plus.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A SPECIAL SCENT BY PINAUD, WHICH IS REFRESHINGLY MANLY AND LONG-LASTING. i HAVE USED OTHER PINAUD PRODUCTS OVER THE YEARS, BUT NEVER TRIED THIS. I&#x27;M GLAD I DID--IT&#x27;S BECOME ONE OF MY FAVORITE AFTER SHAVE/COLOGNES. AMAZON HAD AN EXCELLENT PRICE, AND SHIPPED IT WELL AHEAD OF SCHEDULE.</li>
            <li> I really like the original scent so I wanted to try the Special Reserve. So far, I am very happy with it but the reason for 4 stars instead of five is a little complicated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I read many reviews of the manly, woodsy, smokey scent and felt that this was what I was looking for. Now, keep in mind that different scents work with different peoples chemistry differently so I didn&#x27;t know what to expect. When I first opened the bottle, I knew that I was going to like it. And I do! But, perhaps I have been punched in the nose too many times or maybe I have had a stroke that I didn&#x27;t know about because I find this to be more of a powdery, slightly floral scent when applied to my face. I perceive it as similar in scent as the Pinaud Talcum Powder. Completely opposite of what others have written. Thinking I was perhaps crazy, I conducted a little test and confirmed that I AM crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I placed a small dab of the original on one wrist and a small dab of this on the other then asked my wife which she preferred. She very much favored the original but was not put off by the Special Reserve at all. When asked why, she replied that is was a bit too smokey for her taste. WTF? Am I the only nut job in the world that does not smell the wood or the smoke? There might be an underlying and subtle spice scent that seems to come out later, what I think some people call a base note.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, I do enjoy the smell and use it every so often but I prefer the original a bit better. As attested to by the varied reviews, people have very different experiences with not only this, but many different scents. For the price, it will not hurt you to try it out.</li>
            <li> This is a refreshing, every day aftershave that is so reasonably priced that you would be silly to not give it a try.  I was hesitant after reading some of the reviews, but it has become one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> Of all the Clubman Pinaud scents I&#x27;ve tried, this is the only one I absolutely can&#x27;t stand.  The scent is overwhelmingly powerful and gives me a low-grade headache for the entire day.  There&#x27;s just something off about the way it smells.  It&#x27;s not entirely unpleasant, and I like the leathery tones it has, but I just can&#x27;t recommend it after one too many headaches.</li>
            <li> One sniff and you are walking into a barber shop in Brooklyn in 1949. This the real aromatherapy.</li>
            <li> WHILE THIS IS WORST SMELLING COLOGNE I HAVE EVER BOUGHT,  THAT MIGHT NOT BE ALL BAD. DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH PEOPLE CROWDING IN ON YOU WHILE YOU ARE IN LINE - THEN WEAR THIS COLOGNE - PROBLEM SOLVED/ DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH SOMEONE ALWAYS BUMMING A RIDE OFF YOU - WEAR THIS COLOGNE - PROBLEM SOLVED.  DO WANT PEOPLE TO LEAVE YOU ALONE - WEAR THIS COLOGNE - PROBLEM SOLVED.  I THINK YOU GET THE IDEA, THIS STUFF IS NASTY SMELLING. IF YOU PUT ENOUGH ON YOUR BOSS MIGHT EVEN GIVE YOU THE REST OF THE DAY OFF.</li>
            <li> Cloves was the first thing that came to mind when I smelled it. Like it&#x27;s cousin, the regular Clubman aftershave, it smells totally different in the bottle than it does on the skin. It&#x27;s strong at first, but then mellows nicely. When my wife first smelled it, she kinda turned up her nose. Then she smelled it again, and she was intrigued. Next thing you know, she&#x27;s smelling it again and again. It&#x27;s got this scent that grabs your attention and keeps it. It demands that you sit up and take notice, however it&#x27;s not bossy and arrogant. Very manly scent! I REALLY like it!!</li>
            <li> Special Reserve is a heavier yet sophisticated scent-wonderful after a shave and smells great 4-5 hours after I put it on. It is a woodsy, leather infused scent, slightly similar notes to English Leather but a bit stronger. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> A great perfume company for the guys who don&#x27;t want to be overwhelmed with smell.  Smooth for the aftershave splash.  Good stuff</li>
            <li> This does not smell good. It smells similar to urinal cakes mixed with mothballs and cloves. Super sweet, to the point of being sickening. If I could not shower or wash at all for a few weeks this sent would cover the B.O., but not in a good way. It does last all day, so that&#x27;s nice. I can not recommend this product to anyone without feeling guilty. I do like most other clubman products.</li>
            <li> I read a review here where someone said it smells like a baseball mitt. Right on! Manly, unlike the junk at the stores. Strong so I dilute it with water. Makes it last longer too. May try to put it in glass like some do. Try it!</li>
            <li> I liked the smell of this. I&#x27;d been using the regular Clubman and enjoy both the aroma and the sting. This, is stronger and the smell is more robust. I have no way of describing it. The missus did not care for the scent. She said that my aroma was only a step above Old Spice. So I went back to the regular Clubman, which she tolerates.</li>
            <li> Happy with the service. Did not like the after shave.</li>
            <li> I see how this could be a love or hate thing, but man, do I love it. It took my breath away at first, and I didn&#x27;t like it. I stuck with it for three days, and I am glad I did. It is not only a great smell, but it is also great as a toning after shave. I look forward to having some for the rest of my life, great stuff!</li>
            <li> This is a great inexpensive cologne for everyday use.  Used for years at barbershops.  The price they charge in stores for cologne can sometimes be outrageous but this is a good one.</li>
            <li> Strong and spicy at first, 2 hour later it is perfect and subtle the rest of the day</li>
            <li> heavy fragrance and it has to be diluted prior to application. I have been used to lighter aftershaves and this is the heaviest I have worn.</li>
            <li> This is one of my all time favorite fragrances. I use this on a daily basis. It is not so strong that I cannot wear another EDP as well.</li>
            <li> Once and always the best. This is what my Dad used, and I have gone back to it. No sting and not over whelming.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic.  I got tired of smelling like a middle school boy after using Axe deodorant, and I wanted something a bit manlier.  After reading some great reviews, I picked this up and....WOW.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m fairly sure that this is what my grandpa wore, and that&#x27;s fine by me!  It has a sort of learthery smell that mixes great with Brut stick deodorant.  Smells good, although it isn&#x27;t super strong, so I feel like I need to put a little extra on.  It still lasts forever though, so definitely a good buy for guys who don&#x27;t want to smell like ten year olds any more.</li>
            <li> Great aftershave love it. Enjoy the smell a little bit pungent at first. Need to be used outside the bottle on skin do not try to smell from the bottle. Sent does not last all day long.</li>
            <li> This is a definite classic scent, even if you&#x27;ve never smelled it before. To my nose, it&#x27;s a combination of the best elements of Brut and English Leather. Definitely masculine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is NOT like the classic barbershop scent of the original. It is bolder, more leathery and musky, with overtones of tobacco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like bold, classic scents like Aqua Velva and Brut, you&#x27;ll LOVE Special Reserve. It&#x27;s really that simple.</li>
            <li> This stuff has been helping men get laid for like 7 generations.  Pick some up yourself and continue the tradition.</li>
            <li> Very long lasting and unique scent, cannot pin it down to any one. Well here goes very woody and earthy with a touch of English leather and my wife says a touch of Canoe. If you get your hair cut in a salon this might might not be for you, but man up and try it. You will love this if you still go to a barber shop, remember Harley&#x27;s with seats that held two and the tri five Chevys, still have one of each, all in all a very pleasent scent and very manly, and I often get complements on from the ladies</li>
            <li> This is an exceptional product at a very affordable price!!  Will continue to use this and other clubman products whoever possible!</li>
            <li> The smell is something that doesnt really grow on you, you either like it or you don&#x27;t. Myself, and my girlfriend are not really that big of fans.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite aftershave, and I am a collector of colognes and aftershaves.  It has a moderate wood scent with a touch of smoke and musk that tapers off but lasts throughout the day.  The dispensing cap smartly prevents inadvespills and drips.</li>
            <li> Nothing I can say adds anything to the reviews already posted about this product. It seems to be a love it or hate it proposition. I love it.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent soothing aftershave that has a lasting fragrance so don&#x27;t expect to be able to use another cologne over it. You wouldn&#x27;t want to anyway...it is a great smelling aftershave/cologne. My wife loves it...a nice plus.</li>
            <li> This stuff works really well.  It calms down my face after a good DE Safety razor shave.  More of a cologne smell than aftershave and sticks with you for a while.  I like this but I don&#x27;t think I will be buying it again.  I think I will stick with either the Bay Rum or Original Clubman scent.</li>
            <li> For the record, I do not like this as much as I do the other Clubman aftershaves.  But it&#x27;s not bad.  I would give this 3.5 stars, so I rounded up.  It smells like a stronger version of their musk scent.</li>
            <li> This product was a decent buy and has a light scent and was just what was advertised in the ad.</li>
            <li> I was really expecting an old time scent and something strong.. though the fragrance is strong initially I find that it fades away very fast. It could be because of the tropical climate where I live.  Bought this and the Bay rum solely based on the number of positive reviews that both of them have received on this site but am disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All my knowledge of this product is based on the reviews here. I was expecting a very fragile plastic bottle but should say it is a fairly strong.</li>
            <li> I like the regular Clubman, but this is simply a vile brown-tinged admixture that smells like burnt molasses or incinerated maple syrup. The stuff is too sweet -- in a cheap, drugstore-like way --  and at 5 PM the aroma is unfortunately still there. Go for the straight Clubman aftershave; it&#x27;s great. But, sorry to say, not this stuff.</li>
            <li> Powerful scent that lasts for hours. Love it.</li>
            <li> I generally like the smell of this stuff. I&#x27;m a huge fan of regular clubman.  My only complaint is that it has strong powdery notes, that I never like, a bit closer to wild country in that way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like bay rum with woodsy and leathery overtones.  Very nice and it lasts almost all day.  I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll switch back to the original Pinaud, which I give 5 stars to, the special reserve is a little spicy on the scent for my tastes.</li>
            <li> The original scent is awesome so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. Smells awful, tried to give it away and no one wants it, so in the trash it went.</li>
            <li> Really really enjoy this one, although the bottle is green, not orange as shown in the picture. The scent is unique and reminds me of my very first after shave years ago. It may seem really strong at first when you put it on, but it dissipates and blends well without being overpowering. Has real alcohol in it so expect a bit of a burn if you managed to nick yourself pretty good while shaving.</li>
            <li> Not as good a smell as Clubman Hairspray. It&#x27;s OK but a little bit like 3 &amp;1 oil smell.</li>
            <li> Just a add on to what I have on my counter works very well it is a stronger scent. It reminds me of the barber shop as a child. No more of that now I cut my hair now.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of Bay Rum aftershave. It&#x27;s classic clean scent is nostalgic and bracing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is MUCH heavier. At first it&#x27;s fresh. But soon the very heavy, spicy scent kicks in and really lingers. There is nothing subtle or layered about it -- it is cloying, a masculine version of an old-lady flowery perfume. I can&#x27;t imagine anyone other than a smoker, or someone whose olfactory sense is otherwise compomised (by old age or illness), to tolerate this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you personally like this strong odor, keep in mind that most folks around you will find it foul and offensive. Loners and misanthropes might not mind that, but if you make your living being around others, you might want to think twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me, an aftershave should be bracing, bold and fresh. \\&quot;After Shave\\&quot; should be eliminated from the name for this heavy, cheap-smelling stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;But wait, Dr. Ashbless,\\&quot; my dedicated readers have implored me. \\&quot;You are such an accomplished poet; use your skills as a wordsmith to tell us exactly what this product smells like.\\&quot; Imagine this: A bucket of day-old clams, sitting in the hot August sun. Yes, that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> Nice musky fragrance. Bracing feeling from the alcohol base which is a little too much for me. Fragrance is pleasant to me and others and not over powering.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of classic aftershaves, and an avid CLUBMAN fan so when I splashed on the Special Reserve and the scent came forth I was blown away.     CLUBMAN Special Reserve is a wonderful blend that smells something similar to Halston with more of a spiced woodsy overtone to it. The scent is strong, bold, and very manly.    Once again CLUBMAN delivers with their products. The more I smell this on myself, the more I&#x27;m loving this aftershave and this will be added to my weekly rotation of classic, timeless scents. Actually, if a stronger more lasting version of this was made it would be a perfect evening cologne    The only downfall?  They don&#x27;t make this in the larger sizes.</li>
            <li> Stout. I&#x27;m still not sure how I feel. It&#x27;s a woodsy smell. Very barbershop.</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with Pinaud Reserve.&lt;br /&gt;It is one of the lowest cost scents in the bathroom but it stands tall and proud.&lt;br /&gt;It is a good scent to wear to work or to sweat it off at the gym on a hot day.</li>
            <li> Bought one for my son&#x27;s birthday &amp; one for my husband. It smells so good for an inexpensive aftershave. Everytime my husband wears it he gets compliments at work or from friends.</li>
            <li> A bit too &amp;#34;leathery&amp;#34; for my taste. Gave it to my son. He loves it!</li>
            <li> I could smell this in the package. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I do not prefer this to the regular clubman after shave (which is a classic), in neither feel nor smell.  It&#x27;s hot on the face, too.</li>
            <li> This aftershave is by far THE WORST EVER. Smells like your great grandmother and grandpa after they procreated. Absolutley sick and disgusting floral spicy scent that does not wash off. I had nightmares about this crap. If your looking to buy a terrific Clubman scent, may I direct you to Clubman Virgin Island Bay Rum Aftershave. That scent is absolutely terrific and if it hadnt been for the broken plastic bottle upon arrival to my house, id be wearing it now. But the box smelled great...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cut above the average aftershave, or no aftershave for that matter, but I still think regular Clubman is the gold standard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve come to understand there are actually two versions of Special Reserve - the old batches which have a greenish tint to them, and newer batches, that are more reddish brown.  A friend had the greenish version which blew me away; when I purchased my own bottle, I evidently received a new batch.  It definitely takes some getting used to and is a masculine scent, but it&#x27;s a bit too floral for my liking.  I&#x27;ll stick with regular Clubman from here on out.</li>
            <li> The smell is like old fashion kind. Good price. Will buy another one of a different kind.  1 2 3</li>
            <li> Great classic aftershave. Just astringent enough while still being somewhat soothing, but I mix with a little pure aloe gel because my skin gets dry. Wife likes the scent, so all good.</li>
            <li> Man this stuff puts the Sass in Sasquatch!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a LOT stronger than I&#x27;d expected, but the scent is great. Just be sure you like the scent before you buy, it&#x27;s very powerful.</li>
            <li> My favorite scent so far, a classic spice scent that reminds me of times past. This scent lasts and has a nice linger throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I just received a bottle of Special Reserve today and right off the bat hate it. Unlike some others that say it has a woodsy/musky smell... I don&#x27;t smell it. To me it almost smells like deer urine,if you a deer hunter then you know what I mean. I did put some on my wrist to see if it settles down or changes odor somewhat but it didn&#x27;t/doesn&#x27;t. To me it smell like you have BO and are trying to mask it with this cologne. Definitely not a clean,crisp smell at all. I also received the Musk and Vanilla in the same order and love those two as well as the Original...so far my favorite. Bay Rum is in route and will review that as well.I will update my review if anything changes but I don&#x27;t think it will because I don&#x27;t see myself keeping this stuff.</li>
            <li> The aftershave itself is fine, (I can&#x27;t speak to the scent, as it&#x27;s a gift for my father.) But it looks different than the picture, the label is askew, and the barcode sticker was stuck across the front, so when I tried to remove it, it ripped the already tacky looking label. I would be less upset about this if it wasn&#x27;t a gift, but it is, and I am now  bit embarrassed to give it to my Dad.</li>
            <li> HEY GET READY TO HAVE THE FAMILY JOIN IN. HOW EVER MOST WILL KID AROUND WITH YOU AND IF IT HAPPENS YES YOU JUST TOOK THE FAMILY ON THE TIME EXPRESS.</li>
            <li> I love Clubman products.  This one is a little too strong for me.  I like the scent if it was just a bit lighter.  You my love it though.</li>
            <li> NEVER write reviews or anything and I don&#x27;t know the perticular terminology used when describing an aftershave BUT this stuff is nice.. I had always been a clubman guy but thought maybe it was time to switch up.. Bought this and loved it, last long, smells strong BUT NOT overpowering or overwhelming..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this</li>
            <li> I have several versions of this brand of aftershave. It is strong at first but quickly disperses, leaving a mild fragrance. I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> This cologne has a completely different scent from their standard aftershave - a warm, musky scent.  It tends to last a while, and is not a strong irritant as a splash aftershave.  Not my cup of tea, but it could be yours.  Pretty good price for what you get.</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer said, very strong when you first out it on. Leather and cedar smell. Give it 10 minutes and it settles into a nice scent that lasts all day. Another great Clubman product.</li>
            <li> This is the manliest smelling thing I have ever smelled.  The best way I can describe the scent is: this is what I imagine Indiana Jones smelled like after a shave.  It&#x27;s old school, ultra masculine, leathery and woody.  I love it.  My wife says &amp;#34;it belongs in a museum!&amp;#34;  But I just put on my fedora and bullwhip and travel to my next adventure.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. It is strong going on but it mellows out nicely.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would smell like the hawleywood&#x27;s rockabilly aftershave. It doesn&#x27;t it&#x27;s just now a pleasant smell to be honest. I didn&#x27;t like it none of friends liked it I couldn&#x27;t wait to take a shower after the 1st application.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too floral/musky for my taste, but I am sure it&#x27;s a fine scent for some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have heard it described as Oakmoss or leathery - couldn&#x27;t tell you about the Oakmoss, but the scent does not remind me of leather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a HUGE fan of Pinaud Clubman, and this was a bit of a letdown, but it was close enough to passable that I had to ask the Mrs. to validate my impression.  We both voted \\&quot;no\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure on someone else it might smell fine - just doesn&#x27;t ring well in my nose out of the bottle or on my skin with a 15 minute drydown.</li>
            <li> Very strong scent.  Don&#x27;t put too much on, it goes a long way.  It last a long time as well.</li>
            <li> smells wonderful and works as promised</li>
            <li> CLUBMAN RESERVE COMPLEMENT MY CLIENTS HAIRCUT WITH A NICE SPICYSCENT</li>
            <li> One of my favorite aftershaves. I only find it here. Women always compliment the scent.</li>
            <li> Clubman PInaud Special Reserve After Shave Lotion is a rather linear and yet at the same time complex fragrance upon first generous splashes (DO NOT over-splash with this one) with heavy top-notes of base dark spice and ceylon cinnamon along with pine tar and light burnt rubber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mid-notes offer up a heavier smoldering amber ember, well-worn leather, balsam fir and mandarin orange. It pretty much stays exactly that way through a fairly long and subtle &amp;#34;fade-out&amp;#34; dry-down. This is a surprisingly potent composition from House of Pinaud...a fairly powerful fragrance with a worthy longevity, respectable sillage (when applied judiciously) being sold at what could be considered &amp;#34;bargain basement&amp;#34; pricing all adds up to a must-have...believe me, get it and you&#x27;ll agree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A value-oriented and timeless fragrance from Edouard Pinaud that&#x27;s within everybody&#x27;s budget ...what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> While I like all of their other products this has a scent that I just don&#x27;t know how to describe other than I can&#x27;t stand it. The wife described it as nasty.</li>
            <li> I love Clubman products. This one has a great smell and the wife enjoys it, but it isn&#x27;t varied. It&#x27;s almost the same from start to finish with most changes happening immediately after applying. Still, a good buy and a manly scent.</li>
            <li> I normally love Pinaud products, especially their normal Clubman and Bay Rum lines. They have a great \\&quot;classic\\&quot; scent to them that makes me feel like I&#x27;m shaving like my grandfathers did.    This was a huge exception, though. It smelled okay when sniffing the bottle, but after applying it to my face, it smelled eerily like the EconoLodge room I stayed in last weekend. I don&#x27;t care for that smell one bit.</li>
            <li> I initially watered this down with witch hazel but kinda regret doing so as the smell is cut in half.  Smell good and has good strength but its not at an intolerable level undiluted.  Has same strength as about any other cologne with a good old fashioned smell.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this stuff. Hard to find in the stores (if you can even find it!). Get it and use it.</li>
            <li> Smells great and it last almost all day great product</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of a postal/delivery mix up, it finally arrived.&lt;br /&gt;I like the &amp;#34;Old School&amp;#34; barber shop smell...used lightly. I like&lt;br /&gt;the smell.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and the night before i used it i smelled it, it seemed fairly average the after i shaved in the morning i put some on and was so disgusted i had to shower again to get it&#x27;s disgusting smell off.</li>
            <li> Always go back to this as a standard. Never disappoints. Great smell, clean feel and great price. I have paid a lot more for a lot less.</li>
            <li> I agree with others that it starts strong (almost gamey) then mellows into a scent that you love or hate. Ok, I don&#x27;t hate it but I also don&#x27;t want to smell like it. It smells like spicy leather. My wife didn&#x27;t care for it either. It makes my work shop smell good though. I can&#x27;t return it because it is flammable so I&#x27;m getting creative. I do however like \\&quot;Pinaud Clubman Aftershave\\&quot; and started wearing it when my wife discovered she liked it.</li>
            <li> Okay, first off, this stuff smells great! It is reminiscent of old spice and english leather, but definitely its own animal! This is a MAN&#x27;S aftershave/cologne. If you a sensitive lady boy, you may be offended by my review. Oh well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Types who will enjoy: Lumbermen, Soldiers, Welders, Steel workers, Machinists, EMS , Fire, Police, Mercenaries,coal miners,farmers, deep sea fishermen,and any other hard working man who provides for themselves and their families without government assistance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also be prepared to be a generous lover while wearing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Types who will not enjoy: Metrosexuals, Gender confused, thugs, frat boys, prius owners, blue oyster bar patrons, skinny jeans wearing, fallout boy listening, emo&#x27;s, goths, flat brim hat wearing, living in parents basements, food stamp receiving , non child support paying, AXE wearing, cosmopolitan drinking, spoiler on import with a loud gay exhaust tip drivers. These and other &amp;#34;modern day&amp;#34; douchebags would be wise to avoid any clubman product.</li>
            <li> I was hard pressed to give a review of this because I am still uncertain of how I feel about it. For one, it says, \\&quot;aftershave cologne\\&quot;, it should be ranked up there as eau de toilette because it is really strong. Don&#x27;t make the mistake of thinking that this is like the original Clubman where you can splash it on your face and the scent will fade. It won&#x27;t. It is a powerful scent that has long and strong staying power (for better or worse). So, this should not be classified as aftershave. It is strong stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly the scent. Many wet shavers love the original Clubman because it has a timeless barber-shoppy scent that just smells good, refreshing, a little powdery and yet is masculine. This scent comes off mysterious, hard to place, maybe pine or some woodsy scent that immediately reminded me of an antique library with some very old books. It caught my attention as an old scent that I may have actually smelled someone using it when I was a child and haven&#x27;t smelled it again since. A nostalgic and olde-timey scent. It actually smells interesting. You have to hand it to Pinaud for originality. This IS original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, shortly after I used it, I had some sort of reaction to it and my sinuses went berserk. Maybe this was because I am used to the original Clubman where I splash my face with it and when I tried this, I did it in a similar fashion. Big mistake. And even after washing it off and washing my hands, I just could not get the smell off my hands. I literally had to take a shower to get this off of me completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since used it again and put a few drops on the back of my neck and had no real problems, maybe a little bit of a sinus issue, but nothing terrible. I will probably use the rest of the bottle but I doubt I will purchase it again, though I do like its old smell, but it is really strong. And the reactions you get will be either people hate it or people love it. My girlfriend immediately said she liked it and said wow. Minutes later she had an allergy to it and told me she hated it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this is a strange one, a very strange, mysteriously good and bad cologne. Do not make the mistake of thinking it is an aftershave.</li>
            <li> Amazon want me to rate the transaction. It was good. Item came on time, no leaks and well packaged. So the seller gets the four stars, after all I did order the product...so what&#x27;s the problem?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are thinking of trying this and have never smelled it before...it&#x27;s harsh. I have to take an allergy pill to stop sneezing...but it IS what I ordered...not the sellers fault, this is just for the folks that want to try this for the first time. Try the Clubman Pinaud After Shave, not the Special Reserve. This regular one is much closer to what the barbers use.</li>
            <li> Smells like the warm naugahyde of a freshly vacated booth in a shady diner just shut down by the health department.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But hey, it was cheap, and it&#x27;ll be a lifetime supply in just one bottle if it doesn&#x27;t show some unexpected use as a bug repellant or self defense spray.</li>
            <li> Like the regular clubman, but not as powdery. Good stuff, will buy again.</li>
            <li> Ive purchased the Original Clubman and the Lime Sec aftershaves but they dont compare with the Special Reserves scent and toning features.  The Special Reserve smells woodsy and musky right out of the bottle and when it hits your face it has the traditional clubman sting but than it transforms itself into a breath of sweetness and spicy majesty that is incredible. [[ASIN:B000053L6Y Clubman Pinaud After Shave Lotion, 6 Ounce]]Easily my favorite and the scent is very long lasting compared to the other brands I have reviewed here on Amazon. Please give it a try.  You wont be disappointed. Very manly-oldtyme and economical.</li>
            <li> Special Reserve is a very unique scent.  I&#x27;ll be the first to admit that I don&#x27;t particularly like the smell directly from the bottle but once on my skin it mellows out to a very woodsy, masculine scent that I enjoy (as well as my girlfriend).  All of the other Clubman properties are there...nice alcohol burn after shaving, tones your skin, nice slap in the face to wake you up and take on the day.  For about $7, I&#x27;d definitely give it a shot especially if you enjoy other Clubman products.</li>
            <li> Very strong and smokey when the bottle is first opened. Let it air out a bit or shake bottle a few times for the first few times you use it. It will calm down. To me it smells okay, a strong smokey, leathery fragrance, but my wife loves it. She said very manly, but she has to be close to smell it. I find that strange because it smells strong to me for a long time, but it I guess it diffuses quickly so others don&#x27;t smell it or it&#x27;s faint. Will buy again because my wife likes it so much.</li>
            <li> This is a very unique (and very good) cologne/aftershave. However, it is not a scent for those who like bright and vibrant scents. I feel that it is more suitable as a cologne, not an aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is its scent profile:&lt;br /&gt;Opening-  turpenols with an immediate dry leather snap upon alcohol evaporation.&lt;br /&gt;This settles into a dark (and I mean seriously dark) floral profile, wherein damask rose is the dominant note. The leather and the damask rose compete for attention until you get an aged leather ending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If needed, I will update this description.</li>
            <li> Scent is so highly subjective, it&#x27;s really almost unfair to try to rate it.  In the past I&#x27;ve tried samples of the various scents from Floris - an English company that was a favorite of Ian Flemming, who used (if memory serves) their No. 89, which was reportedly James Bonds preferred scent.  As much as I love Bond, I couldn&#x27;t quite get past the heavy, thick floral character the Floris samples almost universally had.  This Special Reserve is very close to several of the Floris scents I have tried at a much lower price:  spicy, warm undertones with a moderately pungent floral character, but thankfully less floral than Floris!  This is well made product with a nice balance of aromas, and it stays with you.  It&#x27;s up to you whether you find this scent manly, or reminiscent of an old incontinent guy in a nursing home - how my wife described me when I wore it the first time.  (I thought she was a bit harsh).  For me, the jury is still out.  I like the scent, but not sure I love it.  But it is growing on me, and I prefer it to the very similar, but more expensive No. 89 which was just to heavy and flowery.  I do think Bond would go for this one in a pinch.</li>
            <li> I love Pinaud&#x27;s aftershave.  It&#x27;s a classic and subtle scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this smells like something you&#x27;d expect on a sleazy used car salesman.  It gave me a headache.  I ended up throwing it out--in a ziploc bag so the residual scent on the bottle didn&#x27;t permeate my trashcan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving the cologne the same average it had, so as not to change it. My issue is with the first seller that shows up. BYPLE claims to sell this product with FREE shipping. They don&#x27;t have a dictionary, as they don&#x27;t know the meaning of the word. On adding the item to my cart, they slap on about a $6 shipping charge. This is not free. I&#x27;ll try the product to give a more meaningful review of how it smells, but for now, avoid BYPLE to avoid getting screwed for a charge they&#x27;re not honest about.</li>
            <li> Good product but quantity (6ozs) seem a bit ON the short side. Other brands ( LUCKY TIGER)  OFFER (16oz) bottles.</li>
            <li> I am on a bit of tear, trying all the &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; barber shop products. I am trying each product for a day or two, independent of any other products just so I can get feel for each one. This is the first one I immediately did not like. You know when you go camping and you sit near the fire and the smoke saturates your clothes? Or you&#x27;re grilling and it gets away from you and get covered in smoke? That is what this smells like, smoky hair and clothes from a campfire. I don&#x27;t get the leather comments at all. If anything it settles into an alcohol scent. I guess I had hoped for something spicier than the Classic Pinaud Clubman, this was not it. If you are looking for spice, try the Virgin Island Bay Rum. Others may like this, just not for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of all the Clubman products. This one is nice, though a very strong scent. Just a little bit is all you need.</li>
            <li> Update: 5 stars now. I smelled this on someone other than myself and was able to fully appreciate its complexity, sophistication, and nuances. This is a classy scent for cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll start with a 4 star and update later. After trying the Original and Bay Rum (My favorite so far) scent I wanted to try the Special Reserve. I noticed a bottle at my barber&#x27;s shop and wanted to support the local business so I purchased it. My first impression was garbage. Cheap garbage. BUT I loved the other scents so much that I decided to hang on to it and try it again. My second try was also not too enjoyable. I just had my third try and this time it&#x27;s different. I used more this time and I&#x27;m able to smell more of the smokey and cedar scent that other reviews have stated. It still starts out lousy and cheap, but after some time it becomes...sexy. Warm, woody,  sweet, smokey, sexy. Give it at try. If you don&#x27;t like it then give it some time and a few chances. If you still don&#x27;t like it then you&#x27;re only out a little money.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s not the most expensive brand of men&#x27;s cologne, but it makes you smell like you just stepped out of an old-timey barber shop. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> My wife gave me an ultimatum: me or the cologne; I&#x27;m still in the house and the cologne is outside in the garbage!</li>
            <li> Because the first sniff had me a little worried.  In fact, I feared this might just be a watered down version of the (in)famous Lilac Vegetal with just a little less urine smell.  I manned up, splashed some on, and was immediately tempted to wash it off.  But a funny thing happened on the way to the trash can... it really started smelling good!  To me, it had a strong character of sandalwood.  I&#x27;m glad I listened to all the reviews saying to give it a chance before making too quick of a judgement.  This has gone right up to the top of the list along with the regular Clubman Pinaud.  In fact, this has almost inspired me to take that dusty bottle of Lilac Vegetal out of the bathroom cabinet and actually try sprinkling some on... almost.</li>
            <li> Hello. This product works really good as aftershave, does not stings like a aqua velva (which is terrific! 5Stars), but makes do.&lt;br /&gt;Scent is very pleasant, honestly, do not listen to those reviews claiming that this stinks, if that was true, this Special Reserve would never had made it to production.&lt;br /&gt;Smells a lot like Paco Rabanne old green bottle, which I personally do like, although there must be people who will not like this, for those there is Axe and stuff. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, just think, how old are Pinaud products? well, if you like old, manly tastes this is for you. If you prefer newer sweeter scents, brand aside, to all of this Pinaud products.</li>
            <li> Okay, so this one is a bit strong for my taste..Kind of reminded me of my Dr&#x27;s office.  I&#x27;d still wear it though.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of Pinaud products in general.  I have been returning back to wet shaving and using a double edge razor so use of a quality aftershave is absolutely mandatory.  I started with the original Pinaud Clubman scent, and it was great.  In trying to change up the medicine cabinet I tried the Special Reserve.  SR is a very different scent.  It has hints of leather and wood and a citrus background. I don&#x27;t personally care for it as much as the original but it does have a place.  Give it a try you may like it, to each his own.</li>
            <li> If you want to smell like you spend your time thinking deeply about things that matter like beards and War, then you good friends need look no further than this.  If you like me are searching for that scent that walks the fine line between Dapper Gentleman and Lumberjack, this is a great start. And it&#x27;s great value for the price.</li>
            <li> the reason I don&#x27;t know is because I never received this bottle, I got 2 of the vanilla instead of this fragrance. I did&#x27;nt want the hassle of returning the order so I just kept the 2 bottles.</li>
            <li> I really like the regular scent as well as the vanilla. I&#x27;m hoping I got a bad bottle of this. The pictures always show an amber color but mine was gray like diluted ink.  The smell was really truly bad not even like aftershave more like some kind of bathroom cleaner or something similar and was just as bad after the dry down. I read reviews that said smoky, cedar, clove, cinnamon, leather, similar to Halston,  English Leather etc. Again I must have gotten a bad bottle. My Dad used English leather my entire childhood and I have some Halston but this had none of those smells. The only smell was similar to bathroom cleaner.</li>
            <li> This is predominantly musk scent and almost like a cologne rather than an after shave. It is Pinaud in name only and is nothing like the Original formula in feel and smell. However, I like this smell very much and only wish it was offered in glass bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent is close to Aramis.</li>
            <li> Old timey fun right here!&lt;br /&gt;It goes on a tad strong but mellows out into the scent you would expect after taking a dame to the talkies and grabbing a couple of sidecar nightcaps at your favorite gin joint.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the original Clubman for a couple years now. When I saw this Special Reserve wow maybe something that will last a bit longer I&#x27;ll get that. Today was my first day with the Special Reserve and I must tell you I think its smells awful. I would stick to the original scent and I do love that one.</li>
            <li> i bought my husband two colognes to go with his straight razor, and this one is his favorite. its mine too. dont know how to describe it, but you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. At first whiff, I was like whoa what the hell…this is a nasty strong musk.  Once you put it on and let it mingle with your own body chemistry, it really eases up and turns into a very nice spicy/smokey scent.  I absolutely love it now, and so does my gf.  I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments from other women as well. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;special reserve\\&quot; is an awful scent.  REALLY awful.  Works well as lighter fluid though.  I recommend the original scent which I love.</li>
            <li> A lot of people love it, which is great, but WOW! It has a powerful scent, and not one that I found too favorable. It gave me a nasty headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do enjoy regular Clubman, but I&#x27;ll pass on this.</li>
            <li> This stuff smell&#x27;s nice it stay&#x27;s pretty much the whole day, but with all colognes and after shaves it will dissipate and settle down, and it won&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li> Fantastic after shave!  Does what it&#x27;s supposed to, well.  I was hoping for a more gentle bay-rum scent, however, it is a very strong and spicy scent--much more pungent than Old Spice, and less sweet.  It&#x27;s a great product, but I will try a different scent next time...</li>
            <li> Good product and the price cannot be beat.</li>
            <li> I have other clubman after shaves and I love them all great smells....this is no exception, perfect for a night out.</li>
            <li> I love all the Pinaud scents so it was no surprise that I like this one. However, I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s for everyone. It&#x27;s got a very smoky, deep scent. It&#x27;s got a hint of spice and is a multi-layered scent on the skin. Again, I like it, and I wear it frequently. On top of being a cologne it&#x27;s also an aftershave that feels great on the skin and gives a good tingle after a fresh shave. It&#x27;s definitely worth a try for those who haven&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It was spoiled when I opened it I threw it out in&lt;br /&gt;My shed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so sure if I&#x27;m a fan of this or not.  It definitely has a distinct and strong fragrance, and it sticks with you all day.  It&#x27;s musky.  It&#x27;s not offensive, and my wife seems to like it.  It just has an aroma that not everyone is going to like.</li>
            <li> I had used this Special Reserve formulation for many years, decades really, since my college years, and I LOVED it. Then they reformulated it and ruined everything about it that made it &amp;#34;Special.&amp;#34; I complained to Customer Relations (of Clubman Pinaud). After sending them the code from the bottom of the bottle, they said the bottle was &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; and therefore had changed, perhaps b/c of exposure to heat or light. That bottle was purchased from a local barber shop. Then, having loved the feel and aroma of SP, I gave Clubman Pinaud a second chance and ordered a second bottle from Amazon and had the same outcome.The original SP had a very dark brown color which one could hardly see thru if the bottle were held up to the light. The new stuff is a greenish color with a different aroma altogether and one does not need to hold the bottle up to the light to see thru the solution. After the purchase of the second bottle, I knew that the Pinaud Customer Relations rep had just plain lied to me (and wasted my time to add insult to injury). The stuff you can buy today is NOT that of yesteryear. It&#x27;s a familiar behavioral pattern among American companies.</li>
            <li> The scent definitely is one that requires some getting used to.  My best description would be &amp;#34;leathery overtones.&amp;#34;  Not sure what else to say about it.</li>
            <li> I very much liked this fragrance and my other half doesn&#x27;t have any complaints about it. Try it, you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
            <li> When you first open this bottle you may not like what you smell, but don&#x27;t let that put you off. Put some on and let it dry and you will be rewarded with a scent that is masculine and different. Don&#x27;t put on a lot, you don&#x27;t need it, but you will grow to like it.</li>
            <li> mine came green colored and smeled like perfumed vodka. crap. dont bother to buy it. stick  with original. maybe i got the wrong product but the bottle said exactly what&#x60;s on picture and similarities end there.</li>
            <li> I thought Amazon had sent this to the wrong place or it had been stolen from my drop box. It showed up about 3 months later! I didn&#x27;t mind the scent and enjoyed the change of pace.  My wife didn&#x27;t care for it.  Its really unique and may take a certain brand of &amp;#34;dude&amp;#34; to pull it off! The scent is a lot more firm then some of the other clubman products i use.</li>
            <li> This is a potent after shave that I would not use daily or put on running errands on the weekend. This is red carpet, tuxedo stuff.  Very complex smoky, woodsy, strong scent. You get notes of cloves, coffee, sweet spices, bourbon. It&#x27;s awesome. Make sure you leave your hands and face wet after your shave when applying it to cut the potency. Use sparingly...powerful, wonderful stuff.</li>
            <li> When you want a darker more masculine scent.</li>
            <li> I try to use a clubman scent daily..&lt;br /&gt;I bought this just to change from the yellow standard clubman..&lt;br /&gt;Well, this scent is truly a manly scent, I love it...</li>
            <li> Nothing like original clubman.&lt;br /&gt;very strong leathery muscky type smell.</li>
            <li> Read the review on this and was intrigued by the &amp;#34;smells like Aramis&amp;#34; angle.  Aramis is my winter scent but it&#x27;s always pricey.  I didn&#x27;t want another stale knockoff.  Boy was I suprised.  Pinaud Special Reserve is masculine, like mellow tobacco and leather.  A little goes a long way.  Used so far as an aftershave.  Rather than a body &amp;#34;splash on&amp;#34;  just a poke or two.  I&#x27;d by it again.  The wife likes it too.</li>
            <li> Smells like Aramis but not Aramis price.. Last a more than few hours.</li>
            <li> great old time spice aroma.</li>
            <li> As a frequent user of Clubman Pinaud and Virgin Island Bay Rum aftershaves I was interested in giving their Pinaud Special Reserve aftershave cologne a try.  It is difficult to describe a scent in words.  It seems to be a slightly musky, woodsy, leather-like scent.  To me it is a pleasant, masculine scent that is not overpowering but stays with you all day.  Unlike the Virgin Island Bay Rum product, this Special Reserve cologne should be applied sparingly and will last all day.  If you want a cologne that has a distinctly masculine scent this is an excellent one to try and will cost you very little.  It&#x27;s one I&#x27;m happy to add to my collection of aftershaves.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t HATE it.  I also do not find the scent as pleasant as Clubmen &amp;#34;Original&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> very old school manly scent, i rotate this bay rum and eau de quinine on a regular basis, pinaud is still doing great on unique scents even if it has changed a little, well worth the cheap price!, not a cheap product at all, beats out some expensive aftershaves i use, it will burn if you just shaved fyi its a old school real mans product, put it in a spray bottle and it works great as cologne too! let this stuff dry down first if this is a first time experince as it becomes an amazing smell on dry down! very musky at first but i love it A plus and beyond</li>
            <li> I bought this due to a comment that its scent was similar to the long-lost-and-mourned Jovan Grass Oil.Most definitely not - it has a very strong odor that gets worse the longer you smell it. Like opening decades-old avon bottles.I&#x27;m considering trying to see whether it will serve as squirrel repellent....</li>
            <li> Not sure why the general concensus of hate on Clubman Special Reserve, but I feel it&#x27;s unwarranted. I have just about the entire Clubman line of aftershaves and colognes, and, second to the almighty Clubman Original, this one is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a definite difference from Clubman Original: darker, muskier, spicier, notes of wood and leather. I compare it thusly: when a man gets ready for work in the morning, he wears Clubman Original. When that same man then goes out to his local gentleman&#x27;s club, discussing politicis and religion, smoking a cigar and having a brandy with his fellows, he wears Special Reserve.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s old school smells great, works great smell last all day but isn&#x27;t overpowering you&#x27;ll just catch a wiff of it from time to time to remind you you got it on. Takes the sting off your face love this stuff and so does the wife ;)</li>
            <li> Excellent stuff.  Very powerful, very manly, all the stuff you&#x27;ve heard before.  Definitely stings a bit more than others but nothing to be worried about.  Gives a very smooth, close feel to your shave.  Scent lasts all day, and smells great.</li>
            <li> I actually like the heavier duty one.  Definitely old time barber shop smell.  I use it on my beard as antiseptic</li>
            <li> Very good product and worth the price</li>
            <li> great smell, like the barber shops of old. Not too strong, not too weak...all Pinaud products are great. love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this expecting a nice leather smell based on reviews. I don&#x27;t get that at all. This stuff smells like Barbasol.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff been using it off and on for years.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve had Clubman Pinaud, then you know how good of a product they make.  This is like a good Aftershave that&#x27;s been aged for years.  Really woodsy.  Pretty strong scent.  Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t describe it any better. Like Old Spice, English Leather, Speed Stick, Vitalis, talcum powder and wood all mingling together... just like grandpa&#x27;s bathroom. Don&#x27;t use too much though or you&#x27;ll end up getting that Sex Panther reaction. If you&#x27;re around or over thirty, like myself, it&#x27;s perfect for that scent that your dad or gramps most likely had. Of course if you are on the thirty year line or younger you probably won&#x27;t get flocked by women. But use it anyway and if you meet a young gal that you&#x27;re keen on, wait until you have her hooked to bust this manliness out (it&#x27;s too intimidating for this generation).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use an after shave (just use witch hazel if I nick my skin), and frankly this has a too complex and lasting fragrance to waste as an after shave anyway. It&#x27;s a cologne, and an excellent one at that, which smells and lasts much better than some very expensive colognes and eau de toilettes I&#x27;ve worn. In fact, after trying countless colognes over the years, I&#x27;ve settled on what are the two cheapest as also being the two best: Special Reserve and the original Pinaud Clubman. This one smells better than the original IMO, but the original lasts a bit longer. Special Reserve will last five or six hours if you splash a couple teaspoons or so on your neck and shoulders, and after that a pleasant but subtle whiff will remain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have the sort of educated nose that can identify every scent in a complex fragrance, but I do detect leather. (Though this smells nothing like English Leather, which to my nose is more spice than leather). Imagine a leather saddle rubbed with some mysterious emulsion fragrant with outdoor smells such as wood (cypress?), moss, and maybe a dark herb or floral hint (lavender?), and you&#x27;ll get some idea. The fragrance is complex: it seems too loud when you first splash it on, but it soon settles down to a nice chamber orchestra instead of a street band, and after an hour or two it&#x27;s a string quartet with different instruments taking a solo from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original Clubman is sometimes derided as being an \\&quot;old man&#x27;s\\&quot; scent because it was used in barber shops for so many years, but Special Reserve is a less-known scent, a very well-kept secret in fact, so few people will recognize it, and it therefore carries no such stigma. I&#x27;ve learned from experience that many women will compliment it and ask what it is. If you tell them it&#x27;s some terribly expensive eau de toilette called l&#x27;homme de gobble de gook they will probably believe you, but if you tell them that it&#x27;s one of the least expensive colognes on the market, they probably won&#x27;t believe you.</li>
            <li> I really did not like this when I put it on, but give it time. It was really strong the first hour then started to mellow out. After two hours I liked the scent. It starts off like leather. Like a brand new Leather motorcycle jacket. but it does calm down.</li>
            <li> if you like Clubman products,,,you will love this...very traditional fragrance...The original is still my favorite,,, if that gives you a hint to my preferences,,,,but this is right there with it in my cabinet..(with all the others)...&lt;br /&gt;  I like them all...</li>
            <li> I like this overall but the scent is very different from anything else I have.  May not be for everyone but might be worth a try at this price.  I would call it &amp;#34;vegetal&amp;#34; for lack of a better discription.</li>
            <li> Buy all the high-end colognes and after shaves you want. You will not find a more refreshing and great smelling than this. I get compliments all the time, but no-one has any idea what it is. It&#x27;s a barber shop secret, and a great discovery.</li>
            <li> WOW!! As a long time user of the classic Clubman, this is my first purchase of the Special Reserve, and I absolutely love the scent! This has now become my go to aftershave Not sure why retailers are not carrying this product on their shelves.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> This after shave smells like Awesomeness. Very manly scent. It can be a bit powdery in the bottle, but once it&#x27;s on skin it changes and settles in to a leathery, tobacco-ey smell.</li>
            <li> Great “cowboy – scent!”  Something between leather and the outdoors in a serious kind of way.</li>
            <li> The smell on this is decent. I do not dislike or overly like it compared to my other stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Seems a little stronger than my other scents and smells better aired out more.</li>
            <li> Great old school scent! Love this product. Last long but not to overpowering. Helps heal the face after shaving- it gives you a nice cool feeling</li>
            <li> This is one of the Pinaud scents that stayed out of the drugstore. While the original Clubman is a great aftershave and a great scent, its bygone popularity leads it to being considered an &#x27;old man&#x27;s&#x27; smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clubman Special reserve never really developed this reputation. The scents coming off it are a myriad of spices, some clove and some sweetness, with a strong leather backbone. I was skeptical when all the reviews insisted that special reserve had a smell complex enough to be priced very high- but I&#x27;d agree with that assessment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of soothing the post shave period- I&#x27;d put this behind classic Clubman- somewhere near the bay rum or the lilac vegetal put out by Pinaud, that means alcohol and that means burn, which isn&#x27;t as bad as it sounds.&lt;br /&gt;With it being sold as cheap as it is I really recommend this to any man. It really has a longevity and complexity that put similarly priced Aftershaves to shame.</li>
            <li> I have both the Original and the Special Reserve. I find both scents to be pleasingly light and clean. They soothe my face without any uncomfortable burn, but just enough sting to relieve any itchy feeling that sometimes accompanies the ultraclose shave you get with a good DE razor.</li>
            <li> I like the scent, good value.</li>
            <li> Takes me back to childhood going to a real barber. Did not like the razor they used to do detail trim around the ears, but loved the smell of this kind of after shave they put on. I thought it was only something barbers could buy, because I never saw it in stores. Lasts long, cheap thrill just to put it on in the morning.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the smell at all. Wish there would have been a better description</li>
            <li> I love the classic barber shop smell of the Original Clubman.  I&#x27;ve read that this has a leather/tobacco scent to it, but it just smells like burnt rubber to me.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t mind the scent, but my wife absolutely hated it. She said it was too spicy and that it made her eyes burn. She may have been being a touch dramatic, but I could tell I was wearing it several hours after applying the original and vanilla scents work best for me, but I plan to try some of the other ones too.</li>
            <li> feels good on your face, but to musky smelling for me If you want to get a headache first thing in the morning this is for you.</li>
            <li> A nice musky scent, is a touch of English Leather, with a kiss of dirty diaper full of Indian food.</li>
            <li> I like to get this one when I want a change-fresh and clean smell.</li>
            <li> This one might be an acquired scent.  My wife says it has a leather like impression with no flowery smell.  It is strong enough to last all day, so if you like it your going to be happy.  If your on the fence like me, it can be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a good quality after-shave product but I am afraid to splash on too much for fear I might not like the way I smell.</li>
            <li> This after shave reminds me of the barber shop I went to with my Dad, it has a great &amp;#34;old fashioned&amp;#34; barber shop scent and soothes your skin after a shave.</li>
            <li> As an elderly man I have never, ever received so many compliments in over 40 years of shaving on how good I smell, as I do when wearing Clubman Pinaud aftershaves... especially from the Mom&#x27;s of the dance studio where I take my Grandson..... awesome product</li>
            <li> Smelling it from the bottle it had a nice rich scent that reminded me of cologne that my grandfather used to wear.  I thought I was going to like it.  The problem was that when I put it on, it didn&#x27;t have quite the same smell.  The smell was a bit sharper with hints of mosquito repellent.  Not completely unpleasant, but not enjoyable to me.  I really enjoy Clubman original, Classic Vanilla and Virgin Island Bay Rum.  I would much prefer to wear these than the Special Reserve.  Many people do like this, so I wouldn&#x27;t want to discourage anyone from at least trying it.  But my experience was not as good as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE Clubman by Pinaud so I thought &amp;#34;Special Reserve&amp;#34; might smell like regular Clubman with maybe a whiskey, leather, or other masculine top note, but when I applied it, I smelled like a combination of a hospital sanitizer and really, really cheap baby powder.  My wife&#x27;s exact words were, &amp;#34;Honey, what is wrong with the bathroom?&amp;#34;  when she smelled the aftermath of my application.</li>
            <li> The only thing special about this product is how bad it is!</li>
            <li> Here are the facts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells like strong musk, I get notes of elk piss, possum breath, and moose musk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dilute it with water for less abrasive smell. Its kind of woodsy but in a smokehouse sort of way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;burns like HELL FIRE. ha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;yup!</li>
            <li> My wife likes the fragrance.  I&#x27;ve never seen this in a store.  Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Sticking with the original sent.  Musky and too strong.</li>
            <li> Super inexpensive and strong manly fragrance.  Will last a long time since you don&#x27;t need much unless maybe you didn&#x27;t shower.</li>
            <li> Ok so I made this waaay better by mixing it with Clubman Classic Vanilla. Actually mixed in the bottle, something happens and the good leather and tobacco stays there, while the gross spicy floral old lady goes away and is replaced by a kind of polo-black-ish smell (which isn&#x27;t very prominent, but it&#x27;s a way nicer base than old lady spicy flowers . I mixed it about 2/3 or 3/4 SR to 1/3 or 1/4 Classic Vanilla.</li>
            <li> Thought I would give this a try after enjoying the regular version.  My wife threatened to leave me after one use and so did the animals!</li>
            <li> Not the kind of scent I was expecting, It&#x27;s a sort of dark, leather scent. Not the usual brirght, clean scent of other Clubman products.&lt;br /&gt;A little too subdued. Not &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; but nothing special.</li>
            <li> Love all the Pinaud stuff .. Reasonable cost, smells great, reminds me of the good old barbershop days gone by.</li>
            <li> I like this for occasions when I want to have an aftershave last several hours but using a cologne&lt;br /&gt;would be too much. Another Made in the USA product all true American patriots should be buying&lt;br /&gt;instead of the outsourced junk they push on us now from all directions. Pinaud is great aftershave for&lt;br /&gt;the price--try some when you want the classical air about you.</li>
            <li> This is not like other Pinaud style. A bit too heavy with a rather unpleasant, not refreshing sent. I don&#x27;t know what it smells like long-term; had to wash it off after initial splash.</li>
            <li> Whether you&#x27;re dressed down for &amp;#34;The Treasure of the Sierra Madres&amp;#34; or up for &amp;#34;Casablanca&amp;#34; - you will have that perfect blend of masculine strength and dapper fashion-sense. No one rocked a fedora like Bogey. You can&#x27;t pull off the fedora (You can&#x27;t. Don&#x27;t try. Seriously.) but you sure as shootin&#x27;-from-the-hip can go about your day smelling like you just got a straight-razor shave from a barber who&#x27;s seen it all, heard it all, and still has a hand steadier than American virtue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The woodsy smell of the laurel bay evaporates after a few hours, but you&#x27;ll still smell great - the scent evolves throughout the day. Just like a real man does.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 3 starts because I can see it&#x27;s merit, but it&#x27;s just not for me. It&#x27;s a very powerful scent and smells like someones Grandpa may, but not the Grandpa I want to smell like. It&#x27;s a very musky pungent odor and it seems like no matter how much you put on people say you bathed in aftershave and give you a funny look because of the distinct scent. The calm happy grandpas smell that comes from Clubman Vanilla, Bay Rum, or Classic is more preferable and attracts women more. This is a powerful odor that you either will love or hate. Not necessarily bad, but it just appeals to a smaller crowd.</li>
            <li> After getting a bottle of Clubman Virgin Island Bay Rum I thought this stuff is great. It was less than a dollar an ounce, it didn&#x27;t smell as great as some of my more expensive after shaves, but it was definitely a great daily use after shave with a pleasant smell and ridiculously affordable. It also works better than most expensive aftershaves in is ability to sooth my face after a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After this pleasant experience I decided to try a few more of the Clubman line of aftershaves. Heck why not? At 5 bucks a bottle what do you have to lose? I picked up a bottle of Special Reserve from Amazon, and a bottle of the old school Original Clubman from my local pharmacy (wish they were all available there). I have to say I was a little disappointed with the Special Reserve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I put too high of expectations on the Special Reserve. I have read so many posts on Shaving forums (yes, these do exist) that special reserve seems to be a HUGE favorite within the wet shaving community. With so many people talking about how great it is, I figured it was a safe bet I too would love this stuff. After all, I did like Clubman Bay Rum a lot. Well, maybe I let the hype convince me into buying something I really didn&#x27;t want. Compared to the original Clubman, I find the Special reserve to be much better, but that is just because I really didn&#x27;t like the Original at all. It didn&#x27;t even smell particularly manly in my opinion. It had a very floral and powdery scent. On the other hand, this Special Reserve was a lot more masculine, and had a more spicy and musky scent. It&#x27;s not labeled as a musk but it definitely has musk-like smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like scents that are manly and also smell fresh or dare I even say refreshing. I tend to gravitate towards Musk if it is light and not too strong and prefer citrus-like odors over ones that are floral or botanical. I usually use Royal Copenhagen Musk which I find to be a good balance of clean and refreshing yet slightly musky.I know most of you do not care what my preferences are, however by sharing this it will explain why I didn&#x27;t like the Special reserve and if you have similar likes, then you may avoid this product for something more your style. However, if you prefer a more floral, spicy, and heavier scent that is less likely to fade or get too weak, then you might really like this one. Its not an offensive smell, just not my cup of tea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My best recommendation is that if you tend to shave and run out of the house in a hurry, then save this one for another time. This aftershave smells a lot better after you let it mellow out for an hour or so. It is way to strong on initial application. Slap it on, let it stew, then go out once its had time to breath. Your date will appreciate the consideration.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my brother, kind of as a gag sort of thing. I wanted to make him feel &amp;#34;old timey.&amp;#34; Simply put, this is a good product, with a wonderful smell. I personally don&#x27;t like how it is packaged in a plastic bottle, however it doesn&#x27;t really detract that much. My brother didn&#x27;t much care for it because it is alcohol based, but it&#x27;s fine by me. He&#x27;s just a pansy for not being able to take the heat.</li>
            <li> Man.&lt;br /&gt;That is all.&lt;br /&gt;Want to smell like a man?&lt;br /&gt;Want to increase your testosterone 10,000x?&lt;br /&gt;Buy this.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a slightly different type of Pinaud Clubman aftershave.  But I really do like it. Strong, musky, and persistent.  You can put it on the morning and still detect traces of it when you come home from work.  All in all, a good addition to the Clubman line.</li>
            <li> Stronger than the regular Clubman and in a good way. Lingers much longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a longtime user of Pinaud products. I&#x27;ve used their original Clubman aftershave for quite a while and have also started using the Citrus Musk (both are also excellent). I had never heard of Special Reserve before, so I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the setup:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a wet shaver. My daily routine usually consists of a hot shower followed by face lathering with an Arko stick and a boar brush followed by my Parker 99R with an Astra SP. After that, I usually rub down a bit with witch hazel and let that dry while I comb my hair, then apply aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mention all that because on the days I use the Special Reserve, I have to change it up slightly. You see, this stuff is STRONG! Not in a bad way at all, but if you apply it in the same amount you apply other aftershaves, it will be too strong for most of the day. What I have found is when I&#x27;m about to apply the witch hazel, I&#x27;ll pour the tiny amount of it in my hand, then splash into the same hand a bit of the Special Reserve, rub hands together and THEN apply. This gives me excellent application as well as good strength of the scent WITHOUT being overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the scent? It is smoky, has a bit of leather, some musk, traces of the classic Clubman... in short, it&#x27;s part lumberjack, part James Bond all in one bottle at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is excellent and I will be ordering more when I run out, which considering its strength, won&#x27;t be any time soon!</li>
            <li> This smells awful! Will not purchase this again!!!</li>
            <li> Old school musk scent, with lasting power for a fraction of what modern colognes/ eau de toilette&#x27;s cost.  Not sure if it is meant to be used as an aftershave, even though that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s labeled as, but nevertheless, a brilliant reminder of more manly times (think MAD MEN).</li>
            <li> I NEVER RECEIVED IT. THE ITEM RECEIVED WAS:BACH RESCUE REMEDY NATURAL STRESS RELIEF DROPS.</li>
            <li> very satisfied with this purchase</li>
            <li> Another classic Clubman product. I use it in my weekly rotation with other Clubman aftershaves. I would say the scent is a blend between bay rum and their pinaud scent.</li>
            <li> Ahhhhhhhh ! ! !  So Sweet Yet so Spicy....</li>
            <li> If your looking for an aftershave that isn&#x27;t the same old same old, this is it. I can honestly say I&#x27;ve never smelled an aftershave like this. I&#x27;ve heard people describe it as smoky, musky, floral, rich. I think these people are smoking this stuff not wearing it. Think baby powder meets talc powder. That&#x27;s it, simple.    My wife likes it better than the Clubman bay rum. I don&#x27;t. But it&#x27;s definitely lighter and a nice change of pace once in a while.   Edit: 2/21/15  I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now and I have to admit the smell is really growing on me. I like it a lot more now than I did at first.</li>
            <li> I personally like the \\&quot;classic\\&quot; scent of this after shave.  A little goes a long way, though, and my wife can&#x27;t tolerate it even when applied very lightly.  I actually bought three of these and gave two of them to an old WWII vet that uses the stuff.  I guess I&#x27;ll be giving him my container, too.</li>
            <li> This is now one of my favorites. My normal go-to AS is the original Clubman, but this one may even surpass that. I love the scent although will admit that it may not be for everyone. For me it&#x27;s a winner.</li>
            <li> It is a &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; scent, but not so robust as to drive people away. I will use it in my rotation of after shaves and colognes.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel great, but I can&#x27;t help but feel super self-conscience about the over powering scent at work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for my Dad some after shave for a long time because he likes the non-lotion type.  It&#x27;s almost impossible to find anything around here besides three brands that remind me of a man in a nursing home (sorry, but it&#x27;s true).  This smells suave and wonderful.  My mom loves it on him too!</li>
            <li> The aroma is quite pungent. I personally like it; it&#x27;s musky, manly. My girlfriend does not seem to care for it, which is the only reason it&#x27;s not getting 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be the first to say it, after shave scents are highly subjective.  One may love it and the next may hate it.  Well, both my wife and I hated this smell upon first whiff.  What is &amp;#34;Special Reserve&amp;#34;?  While, we still can&#x27;t quite place our finger on the exact scents.  A bit of cotton, maybe some shaving cream, a hint of leather all come to mind.  This scent is also STRONG so be mindful of that with this particular aftershave.  Unfortunately for us this aftershave was used only once and the rest promptly flushed down the toilet.</li>
            <li> I like Pinuad&#x27;s line of products and love the Clubman aftershave, but I do not like the Special Reserve aftershave.  The aftershave itself works fine - nice tingle without drying skin - but it is the smell I do not like.  It is strong and does not seem to go away.  I don&#x27;t know if anyone else can smell it on me or not, but even later in the afternoon I can smell it on my hands (even after handwashing).  I do see now that the product is advertised as \\&quot;after shave Cologne\\&quot; ... I wish I had realized that before I ordered it.  I&#x27;ll stick with Clubman.</li>
