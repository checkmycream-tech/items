            <li> It&#x27;s the same 212 I&#x27;ve picked up in perfume outlets without having to gag through the haze of 100 other perfumes.</li>
            <li> I ordered this on a Tuesday it arrived Friday - 3 business days before it was expected.</li>
            <li> Smells identical, looks identical, and lasts just as long as any previous bottle when applied.</li>
            <li> 10 minutes at most... just stupid.</li>
            <li> Not sure what the other reviewers complaining about this product received, but this was the legit, retail version of the 212 which we have purchased at Macy&#x27;s in the past.</li>

            <li> My mom just loves this perfume.  The fragance is nice and lasts all the long. It is an original perfume. You can count on that</li>
            <li> I ordered this on a Tuesday it arrived Friday - 3 business days before it was expected. It&#x27;s the same 212 I&#x27;ve picked up in perfume outlets without having to gag through the haze of 100 other perfumes. Packaging was great - it was well-protected. Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it my favorite!!!!</li>
            <li> Todo salio bien, el producto llego intacto y es original. como esperaba, y en corto tiempo a pesar de la Ã©poca dicembrina</li>
            <li> I actually tried to return this upon opening, but amazon couldn&#x27;t take it back so they refunded me for it.  It smells like pure alcohol.  unless Carolina Herrera has changed their product, it can&#x27;t be the real thing.  I have to load it on in order to smell like this perfume.  I have been wearing 212 for about 12 years and I&#x27;ve never had to put on this much before for it to be effective.</li>
            <li> very respectfull, I recommend it</li>
            <li> Excellent, 100% Recomended</li>
            <li> This was a hit. My gf loves it. Not sure what the other reviewers complaining about this product received, but this was the legit, retail version of the 212 which we have purchased at Macy&#x27;s in the past. Smells identical, looks identical, and lasts just as long as any previous bottle when applied. As long as you purchase the version sold and fulfilled by Amazon you should be good to go.</li>
            <li> This is a good parfum!</li>
            <li> Delivered very fast.thank you</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fix on skin at all !!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Use this perfume for years and this was the first time it didn&#x27;t last long. 10 minutes at most... just stupid.</li>
            <li> I am glad to find something I can give my daughter in law that  she will enjoy and that will not cause any friction with members of her family.</li>
            <li> The scent is amazing, my wife goes through this stuff about once every 6mo, very floral with a sweet finish. Not overpowering at all and last throughout the entire day. This is something that can be worn for a classy event or something informal such as amazon surfing. Haha</li>
            <li> lo recomiendo muy bueno y excelente lo mejor en producto la mejor compra buen servicio y envio del mismo excelente</li>
            <li> This is my one and only perfume. It goes perfectly with my chemistry and I get many compliments each time. It is not overpowering yet noticeable. I love it</li>

            <li> I have been using 212 for about 10 years and always come back to it.  People are always complimenting me on how great I smell.  The price I found on Amazon was also great!  Love my 212 and my Amazon!</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite scent!</li>
            <li> Se la regale a mi esposa y le encanto, una fragancia fresca y con un envase muy original y veratil.</li>
