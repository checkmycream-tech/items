            <li>This has a really strong scent.</li>
            <li>Refreshing fragrance that is not a floral or overly sweet smell</li>
            <li>This bar soap is very good for cleaning and moisturizing dry skin...</li>
            <li>and this is fine, what else can you say about soap?</li>
            <li>I enjoy the smell - it is a unisex scent</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these for a few years, very happy.</li>
            <li>Good for my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It has a lovely, mild lemon-herbal scent, and leaves your skin smelling fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it rinses clean and that it is a glycerin soap since the dermatologist advised my husband not to use deodorant soaps.</li>
            <li>It gives the clean feeling of dial, without the skin drying effects.</li>
            <li>Dial concocted the right recipe to hit my brain&#x27;s like button with this variety!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I also have extremely sensitive skin, but have never had any kind of allergy problem with this soap.  </li>
            <li>These have a nice natural fragrance that does not blast you out.  </li>
            <li>mild on the skin.</li>
            <li>A nice change from the regular Dial soap that&#x27;s available here.</li>
            <li>and my husband uses it and likes the fresh smell, too.</li>
            <li>Nicely scented, rinses off quickly and doesn&#x27;t dry the skin.</li>
            <li>When this product finally does disappear from the market I will need to find something new, but with this purchase I should be good for a couple of years.</li>
            <li>It is mild, has a gentle scent and doesn&#x27;t feel as if a residue remains on my skin.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite body soap b/c it leaves my skin moisturized instead of dry &amp; itchy.</li>
            <li>The scent is clean and refreshing, not heavy and perfumed like other Dial soaps.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t lather as much as I would like.</li>
            <li>Kind of a green apple aroma.  </li>
            <li>They smell nice, and bubble up well, and they don&#x27;t dry up the skin, but they don&#x27;t last very long, a bar of soap lasted one week for two adults, they melt very quickly.</li>
            <li>This green hand soap bar is fabulous!  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t get this stuff in smalltown USA where I live.</li>
            <li>the only thing is it melts down very fast other than that they are good</li>
            <li>Some of these Dial soaps are so powerfully perfumed that I can not be in the same room with them for days after I open a new bar.  </li>
            <li>Cleans very well, does not leave a film on your body, does not dry like regular soap.  </li>
            <li>Decent enough of a product though for the price I paid, but not positive I would buy it again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a while now &amp; would recommend it to anyone with dry, flaky or sensitive skin to give it a try.</li>

            <li> Very greasy and hard to rinse off.</li>
            <li> It is gentle to my skin and rinses well in our hard Fresno water.  </li>
            <li> have not found it greasy or hard to rinse off at all, although if your water is soft enough</li>
            <li> Not that I&#x27;ve ever had dry skin, but this seems to keep my skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> It is a shame that my supermarket recently stopped carrying Dial Lemongrass Glycerin soap, but then again it is cheaper by half buying it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try some of the other Dial varieities.</li>

            <li> Not sure about the lemon grass.  </li>
            <li> hard to find these days.</li>
            <li> I had to give away the rest of the soap in the package, because after using once, I was disappointed.</li>

            <li> This green hand soap bar is fabulous!  It has a lovely, mild lemon-herbal scent, and leaves your skin smelling fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not found it greasy or hard to rinse off at all, although if your water is soft enough, I suppose that could be possible with any soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have extremely sensitive skin, but have never had any kind of allergy problem with this soap.  I&#x27;ve been using it for more than a year now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the nicest smelling Dial soap ever!  You should definitely try it!</li>
            <li> This variety of Dial glycerin soap is my favorite. I like that it rinses clean and that it is a glycerin soap since the dermatologist advised my husband not to use deodorant soaps. I enjoy the smell - it is a unisex scent so we can both use the same variety of soap. Dial concocted the right recipe to hit my brain&#x27;s like button with this variety!</li>
            <li> hard to find these days. wonderful smelling and effective</li>
            <li> I like this soap a lot!  It is mild, has a gentle scent and doesn&#x27;t feel as if a residue remains on my skin.  Good for my sensitive skin and my husband uses it and likes the fresh smell, too.</li>
            <li> Like the availability - Like the price - like the convenience</li>
            <li> Some of these Dial soaps are so powerfully perfumed that I can not be in the same room with them for days after I open a new bar.  These have a nice natural fragrance that does not blast you out.  Kind of a green apple aroma.  Not sure about the lemon grass.

            <li> I do like glycerin soap. mild on the skin. and this is fine, what else can you say about soap?</li>
            <li> Refreshing fragrance that is not a floral or overly sweet smell so it is a nice scent for a guy. It rinses off well so you don&#x27;t feel like it is leaving a residue/soap film on you.  Not that I&#x27;ve ever had dry skin, but this seems to keep my skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> This is the only soap I will use in the winter!  It gives the clean feeling of dial, without the skin drying effects.</li>
            <li> They smell nice, and bubble up well, and they don&#x27;t dry up the skin, but they don&#x27;t last very long, a bar of soap lasted one week for two adults, they melt very quickly.</li>

            <li> I bought these on sale for less then $5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice citrus scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleans well, rinses off easily, no residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great deal when on sale.</li>
            <li> This my favorite bar none.</li>
            <li> This bar soap is very good for cleaning and moisturizing dry skin...nice fresh/clean scent too...not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I just love the Dial glycerin soap. I can never find them in stores. When I found them on Amazon, I thought I had died and gone to heaven. I love both the fragrance and the feel of them. They are great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This has a really strong scent. Great if you like perfumed soaps, maybe but I didn&#x27;t expect it. I gave it away.</li>
            <li> Nicely scented, rinses off quickly and doesn&#x27;t dry the skin. I use it for face and body.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get this stuff in smalltown USA where I live. A nice change from the regular Dial soap that&#x27;s available here. The scent is pleasant and appealing. I can&#x27;t wait to try some of the other Dial varieities.</li>
            <li> love need to get more couldn&#x27;t find in stores Every thing ells makes me itch</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t lather as much as I would like. Decent enough of a product though for the price I paid, but not positive I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I had to give away the rest of the soap in the package, because after using once, I was disappointed. Very greasy and hard to rinse off. Used on face and made it break out. Would never buy again.</li>
            <li> Dial is good &amp; the glycerin soap is nice &amp; smells good the only thing is it melts down very fast other than that they are good</li>
            <li> I bought this soap once in a store in my town because it was a bargain. I feel in love with it immediately. The soap smells great and leaves you feeling clean. Now I can&#x27;t get it anywhere in my town I ordered it here. My only gripe is one bar doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long.</li>
            <li> Bought many times and always happy with the service and the product!</li>
            <li> It is a shame that my supermarket recently stopped carrying Dial Lemongrass Glycerin soap, but then again it is cheaper by half buying it on Amazon.  It makes me nervous that this might be a discontinued item, so I am stocking up.  The scent is clean and refreshing, not heavy and perfumed like other Dial soaps.  And it has no triclosan, so one does not need to worry about that. It is gentle to my skin and rinses well in our hard Fresno water.  And finally, it fits the color scheme of my bathroom which makes my wife happy lol.  When this product finally does disappear from the market I will need to find something new, but with this purchase I should be good for a couple of years.</li>
