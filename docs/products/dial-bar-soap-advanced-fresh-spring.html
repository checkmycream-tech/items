            <li>my skin and smelled good too.</li>
            <li>I love this soap!  </li>
            <li>The soap is great ... smells good, rinses clean vs. feeling like it leaves a film, doesn&#x27;t leave the soapy muck in the soap dish.  </li>
            <li>Smells great, and rinses off easily, which is just what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>Nice smell</li>
            <li>Dial has discontinued this favorite kind of bar soap in stores.</li>
            <li>i can wash my face with no brake out love the snit.</li>
            <li>Was pleased to see it on Amazon ...</li>
            <li>The fragrance is nice and light, and the soap rinces away well.</li>
            <li>Really love this soap.  </li>
            <li>I love this soap.</li>
            <li>And, while I recognize that fragrance is subjective, I find this too strong.</li>
            <li>I hope this soap is always available.  </li>
            <li>Came up under catagory &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34; only reason I ordered it.. Wasnt happy when I saw perfume on the label.</li>
            <li>It has  a great lather and the glycerin provided better moisturizing then other soaps....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a really bad fragrance, just too strong.</li>
            <li>I just loved how it left me feeling after a shower</li>
            <li>Mildly scented and rinsed well.</li>
            <li>This is also a more natural type soap too.  </li>
            <li>However, it leaves my skin more dry than most soaps, and really dries out my face.</li>
            <li>The only problem is that that there aren&#x27;t many stores that seem to carry it ...</li>
            <li>I love this deal as it gives me enough for the year.</li>
            <li>Be nice if someone made some basic soap that didnt cost a fortune and actually is fragrance free.</li>
            <li>It has a nice soft scent that even when male family members stay they comment on how much they like it.</li>
            <li>Really was looking for a totally fragrance free product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this soap!</li>
            <li>and i tell them thanks for have it in stock.</li>
            <li>Works ok, a little too much fragrance than I was expecting.</li>
            <li>First, it&#x27;s a great deodorant soap, but it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin like the regular deodorant soap does, so you can use it year round!  </li>
            <li>but I know I can tell a difference especially when scrubbing the residual deodorant from under my arms, the other dial soaps would not cut through as good as the White tea!</li>
            <li>I tried it because it was new to me and glycerin and hopefully would not be too scented.</li>
            <li>The other soaps do not feel they get me as clean either</li>
            <li>, skin feels soft and helped with itching.  </li>
            <li>I was extremely dissapointed to find out that after searching for this particular Dial soap, thinking I had ordered this package.  </li>

            <li> I was extremely dissapointed to find out that after searching for this particular Dial soap, thinking I had ordered this package.  </li>
            <li> I do live in a dry climate, but don&#x27;t usually have problems with dry skin and do not usually use lotion.</li>
            <li> and when I could only do sink baths due to an accident, the extra soap left on ,y skin didn&#x27;t, dry me out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the other glycerin soaps from dial and they just do not compare to the white tea.  </li>

            <li> hard ti find in store</li>
            <li> Is a delicate scent, so don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll smell like zest or lever 2000.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not so bad that I&#x27;ll be throwing it out, but I won&#x27;t be buying it again when it&#x27;s finally done.</li>
            <li> Does not have overpowering or weak fragrance.</li>
            <li> Another product I am sad to see go.</li>

            <li> I love this soap!  First, it&#x27;s a great deodorant soap, but it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin like the regular deodorant soap does, so you can use it year round!  I highly recommend this soap!</li>
            <li> hard ti find in store it&#x27;s good on the skin i can wash my face with no brake out love the snit. everyone wont to no ware i get it from and i tell them thanks for have it in stock.</li>
            <li> The soap is great ... smells good, rinses clean vs. feeling like it leaves a film, doesn&#x27;t leave the soapy muck in the soap dish.  The only problem is that that there aren&#x27;t many stores that seem to carry it ... so I have to stock up when I find it.  Was pleased to see it on Amazon ... but then see it&#x27;s listed as \\&quot;item currently unavailable\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> Works ok, a little too much fragrance than I was expecting. Really was looking for a totally fragrance free product.</li>
            <li> Held me all day and just great feel/ lather. Does not have overpowering or weak fragrance. I would buy it again</li>
            <li> I tried it because it was new to me and glycerin and hopefully would not be too scented. It was good soap. Mildly scented and rinsed well. It just didn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
            <li> Dial has discontinued this favorite kind of bar soap in stores. Found it on amazon.com. It produces  lots of suds and smells wonderful, not too perfumy.</li>
            <li> I was extremely dissapointed to find out that after searching for this particular Dial soap, thinking I had ordered this package.  It was not the same one, I could have bought what I received in my local Target.  I have been trying to return it for the past 3 weeks with NO luck.  I will not be ordering again from this person.</li>
            <li> delivered as expected</li>
            <li> This works well for my body. The fragrance is nice and light, and the soap rinces away well. However, it leaves my skin more dry than most soaps, and really dries out my face. I do live in a dry climate, but don&#x27;t usually have problems with dry skin and do not usually use lotion. I need to after showering with this soap.</li>
            <li> Looking for anything to help the winter dry skin.  Really love this soap.  Nice smell, skin feels soft and helped with itching.  Delivered as promised time frame</li>
            <li> Another product I am sad to see go. This soap was so good om my skin and smelled good too. I just loved how it left me feeling after a shower and when I could only do sink baths due to an accident, the extra soap left on ,y skin didn&#x27;t, dry me out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the other glycerin soaps from dial and they just do not compare to the white tea.  The other soaps do not feel they get me as clean either, I don&#x27;t believe the formula is different but I know I can tell a difference especially when scrubbing the residual deodorant from under my arms, the other dial soaps would not cut through as good as the White tea!</li>
            <li> I love this soap. I use both to bath with, but also to shave with.  It has a nice soft scent that even when male family members stay they comment on how much they like it. Is a delicate scent, so don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll smell like zest or lever 2000.  It has  a great lather and the glycerin provided better moisturizing then other soaps.... Hence why I like to use to shave with.  This is also a more natural type soap too.  I hope this soap is always available.  It can be hard to find at times, but occasionally I locate it at Target.  I love this deal as it gives me enough for the year.</li>
            <li> This soap is not as transparent as the picture on the package would lead you to believe. And, while I recognize that fragrance is subjective, I find this too strong. It&#x27;s not a really bad fragrance, just too strong. It&#x27;s not so bad that I&#x27;ll be throwing it out, but I won&#x27;t be buying it again when it&#x27;s finally done.</li>
            <li> Smells great, and rinses off easily, which is just what I wanted.  I will order it again.</li>
            <li> Came up under catagory &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34; only reason I ordered it.. Wasnt happy when I saw perfume on the label. Be nice if someone made some basic soap that didnt cost a fortune and actually is fragrance free.</li>
