            <li>I use this one more than 20 years, and never can&#x27;t stop to buy it, if you have any pimple on your face, just try this one abt 2-3 days, and then you won&#x27;t see anything on your face.</li>

            <li>Gives your face moisture and diminishes fine lines.</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous product that my husband and I have used for years.</li>
            <li>Great Product,  Works especially well on kitchen burns !</li>
            <li>It feels light and cool and works well on my oily skin.</li>
            <li>After reading a lot of positive reviews about how it helped many with their acne, I decided to give it a go.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great as a lightweight facial moisturizer, I&#x27;ve never broken out using it.</li>
            <li>My Skin glows and it actually tights the skin to have a more youthful glow!</li>
            <li>I tried it with other aloe gel, non worked as good as this one.  </li>
            <li>The trick is to use it right away.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always a huge challege to find oil free moisturizers that actually hydrates without making my face oily.</li>
            <li>I use it at night only as a moisturizer and all it does is give me a refreshing feel, but nothing else.</li>
            <li>it also allows BB cream and compact to set in really well!</li>
            <li>and it started getting better the next day.</li>
            <li>, my grandparents always put this good smelling green slime on my burns and it would always make it feel</li>
            <li>:) I haven&#x27;t had a dry face</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how much this product helped.  </li>
            <li>For those who have really acne prone skin, I don&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li>Was a gift and was very well received</li>
            <li>, I rinse it 3 minutes after I apply it and doesn&#x27;t work as it is supose to Work , thanks</li>
            <li>I asked them if this for sure was the green slime because it USED to be sold in a jar, now it&#x27;s in a squeeze bottle type thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have seen big improvement and I will definitely buy another once I finish more of the skin gels I have left.</li>
            <li>This supplements moisture underneath the intense facial moisturizer I use (CeraVe) and my face feels supple and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I remember when I was 5 years old</li>
            <li>It provides good facial hydration and a base for easily applying foundation,</li>
            <li>Nu Skin uses a cold process method which is a good thing.</li>
            <li>Dry spots are completely gone after one use.</li>
            <li>I have an extreme combination skin where it is pretty oily but extremely dry at the same time.</li>

            <li> It is alright doesn&#x27;t last on the moisture doesn&#x27;t dry the skin or anything</li>
            <li> definitely will purchase again once my bottle runs dry!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this as everyday moisturizer, only as emergency, it can work as moisturizer during the summer, but during winter it&#x27;s definitely not enough.  </li>
            <li> Only downside to it is that it could feel a little sticky but that does not worry me at all.</li>
            <li> In cold, dry weather I use it to clean my face.  </li>
            <li> (now I know it&#x27;s lavendar causing these minor but troubling irritations- little pus bumps on the face).  </li>
            <li> Nourishing enough for me while eliminating the excessive oil and shine on my face.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what this is supposed to do, but it feels terrific when I put it on my face in the morning.</li>
            <li> And when I&#x27;m too lazy to take my makeup off properly at night I use Enhancer with a moist wash cloth.</li>
            <li> This is the one and only thing I kept repurchasing over that past 10 years...</li>
            <li> I just recently realized I have rosacea, and never knew what irritates my skin in the past.</li>
            <li> That being said, it does sting a little if you have &amp;#34;open</li>
            <li> This gel leaves a very soothing feeling like your skin got pressed with cold ice.</li>
            <li> It cools the skin and health in a few days.</li>
            <li> I asked my grandparents if they still had the green slime</li>
            <li> I recently got a really nasty sunburn on my shoulders &amp; upper back.  </li>
            <li> For a small bottle,it lasts up to a couple of months</li>
            <li> , but it doesn&#x27;t make the skin worse, it always help me settle the problem after 3-5 days depending the severity of my problem.  </li>
            <li> Sadly I didn&#x27;t see no results.</li>
            <li> when I kept on using wrong items</li>
            <li> I reapplied and reapplied and although it doesn&#x27;t take the sting away from sunburn, it does a lot to prevent the nasty peeling.</li>
            <li> Once I had a nasty bug bite on my leg</li>

            <li> Great product.  Update on product:  I recently got a really nasty sunburn on my shoulders &amp; upper back.  I can&#x27;t tell you how much this product helped.  I used it 2 to 3 times a day.  It helped take the burn out of my skin &amp; I didn&#x27;t peel.  The trick is to use it right away.  My sister &amp; I both keep this product on hand.  I am allergic to aloe vera if it is heat processed.  Nu Skin uses a cold process method which is a good thing.</li>
            <li> its the most amazing product in nuskin</li>
            <li> My aunt actually bought this me and this is the best skin gel for acne! I have seen big improvement and I will definitely buy another once I finish more of the skin gels I have left. This gel leaves a very soothing feeling like your skin got pressed with cold ice. Lastly,I have been very impressed with this product. For a small bottle,it lasts up to a couple of months</li>
            <li> Fabulous product! I have used it for years!! My Skin glows and it actually tights the skin to have a more youthful glow! The price of this product is worth the results!!</li>
            <li> Great product. Keeps skin feeling hydrated all day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for sunburn recovering and feels smoothing and soothing.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin, so I was looking for something that I can put on at night after my nightly regime that wouldn&#x27;t clog up my pores. After reading a lot of positive reviews about how it helped many with their acne, I decided to give it a go. Sadly I didn&#x27;t see no results. I use it at night only as a moisturizer and all it does is give me a refreshing feel, but nothing else. For those who have really acne prone skin, I don&#x27;t recommend this. I think it honestly clogged up some of my pores even more.</li>
            <li> I have been using this about 2 month now. My face is getting softer than before.</li>
            <li> It feels light and cool and works well on my oily skin. It&#x27;s a must have especially for the summer.</li>
            <li> I have an extreme combination skin where it is pretty oily but extremely dry at the same time. It&#x27;s always a huge challege to find oil free moisturizers that actually hydrates without making my face oily. This supplements moisture underneath the intense facial moisturizer I use (CeraVe) and my face feels supple and hydrated. Only downside to it is that it could feel a little sticky but that does not worry me at all. My face is thirsty and it feels like the moisture sticks and retained. it also allows BB cream and compact to set in really well!</li>
            <li> Great great great product!!!  Nourishing enough for me while eliminating the excessive oil and shine on my face.  I love the refreshing feeling of this gel on face.  Will definitely keep buying it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for sunburns or general moisturizing. My husband uses it after shaving.  Like aloe Vera but somehow much better than aloe.</li>
            <li> My husband loves the conditioning gel after he shaves. Works Great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nu Skin since I was a child. While the packaging has changed, the product is consistently effective. It&#x27;s the best sunburn relief I&#x27;ve had - without any allergens or added nonsense.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this product over 20 years now and there is nothing better against sun burn or cuts. It cools the skin and health in a few days.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product!!! It hydrates without leaving any residue.Dry spots are completely gone after one use.</li>
            <li> Was a gift and was very well received</li>
            <li> I would like to know if I should leave it on my Face or rinse it , I rinse it 3 minutes after I apply it and doesn&#x27;t work as it is supose to Work , thanks</li>
            <li> I remember when I was 5 years old and I would get sunburned while at the beach in Florida, my grandparents always put this good smelling green slime on my burns and it would always make it feel better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;25 years later, I got a sunburn from spending 14 &amp;#34;fun&amp;#34; hours at Disney World. I asked my grandparents if they still had the green slime (because I never knew what it was called) and they handed me this bottle. I asked them if this for sure was the green slime because it USED to be sold in a jar, now it&#x27;s in a squeeze bottle type thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on my sunburn and felt wonderful. I reapplied and reapplied and although it doesn&#x27;t take the sting away from sunburn, it does a lot to prevent the nasty peeling. I don&#x27;t get sunburned a lot but I did purchase this product and I put a tiny dab about the size of a dime on my hand and I rub it onto my face :) I haven&#x27;t had a dry face since!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely will purchase again once my bottle runs dry!</li>
            <li> Not sure what this is supposed to do, but it feels terrific when I put it on my face in the morning. Just takes a dab. Nice smell too.</li>
            <li> Just what I ordered and it was a good price.</li>
            <li> I use this one more than 20 years, and never can&#x27;t stop to buy it, if you have any pimple on your face, just try this one abt 2-3 days, and then you won&#x27;t see anything on your face.</li>
            <li> I love this, I use it in the summer after a day in the sun. Once I had a nasty bug bite on my leg I tried medicines but it didn&#x27;t help, so I tried this and it started getting better the next day. It is a good thing to keep at home</li>
            <li> Excelent, Bether imposible</li>
            <li> I have used Enhancer for almost 15 years. In cold, dry weather I use it to clean my face.  It&#x27;s great as a lightweight facial moisturizer, I&#x27;ve never broken out using it. And when I&#x27;m too lazy to take my makeup off properly at night I use Enhancer with a moist wash cloth. I love this product.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product that my husband and I have used for years. It provides good facial hydration and a base for easily applying foundation,</li>
            <li> Good sales, fast shipping</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!!! Gives your face moisture and diminishes fine lines. It provides a healthy glow and tightens sagging skin. I apply it liberally to the neck as well. Definitely 5 stars!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> Great Product,  Works especially well on kitchen burns !</li>
            <li> This is the one and only thing I kept repurchasing over that past 10 years... I just recently realized I have rosacea, and never knew what irritates my skin in the past. Whenever I have flareups and breakouts, I stop using all other products and diligently use this aloe conditioning gel for 3-4 days, it&#x27;ll clear up my irritation. I tried it with other aloe gel, non worked as good as this one.  If I knew I had rosacea earlier, I probably won&#x27;t go through all these &amp;#34;flareups&amp;#34; when I kept on using wrong items (now I know it&#x27;s lavendar causing these minor but troubling irritations- little pus bumps on the face).  Now I always keep one bottle of conditioning gel on hand just in case my skin acts up again. I don&#x27;t use this as everyday moisturizer, only as emergency, it can work as moisturizer during the summer, but during winter it&#x27;s definitely not enough.  Also, when my skin is fragile, having some readness but not full blown flareup or breakout, I also use it as a first layer (like a barrier) before I apply other lotion/cream. During winter time, using this before a cream also helps seal in the moisture as well if the cream itself is not enough.  That being said, it does sting a little if you have &amp;#34;open wounds- like acne, pimple that got poped, or flare ups of rosacea&amp;#34; , but it doesn&#x27;t make the skin worse, it always help me settle the problem after 3-5 days depending the severity of my problem.  A must keep aloe staple for me.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product with a fair price . 2 day delivery on time with no issues.</li>
            <li> It is alright doesn&#x27;t last on the moisture doesn&#x27;t dry the skin or anything I wouldn&#x27;t call it conditioning at all.</li>
            <li> This order was not meant to become an &amp;#34;ADR&amp;#34; (automatic delivery monthly.  I simply want to order it as needed.  I do not know how to cancel the ADR</li>
