            <li>I wish Norelco would make a device like this, using the razor mechanism in their BodyGroom, that would be a great product.</li>
            <li>This was honestly one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m seriously so happy I could vomit.  </li>
            <li>Well designed, well constructed, and works great.</li>
            <li>So after reading all of these GREAT reviews I figured I would buy another one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great idea</li>
            <li>It really is great once you master it.</li>
            <li>For $40 this is a great product.</li>
            <li>Mangroomer is a great product that I&#x27;ve been using for a couple of years now.</li>

            <li>In fact, I had been using Nair (which works great, too)  but at $6 a bottle</li>
            <li>I was greatly dissappointed by this product.</li>
            <li>in all, a truly great product.</li>
            <li>This product is great.</li>
            <li>This is a great product that does</li>

            <li>Great manscaper.</li>
            <li>I used it from neck-to-toe with great ease.  </li>
            <li>this thing literally cuts as close and a razor...keep it oiled and use good batteries and should be good to go!</li>
            <li>ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li>Still, it&#x27;s very very effective</li>
            <li>Still, it&#x27;s very very effective</li>
            <li>This is a very effective product.  </li>
            <li>Doesnt telescope very nicely at all.</li>
            <li>Great, practical, and it is so nice to be groomed!  </li>
            <li>Until something better comes along, this looks like the best thing out there if you want to shave solo.    </li>
            <li>In fairness, I have to start off by saying that I had this product for over a year and used it successfully 15-20 times.  </li>
            <li>Great product, good idea, and design.  </li>
            <li>:) Best of luck to all my hairy-backed friends!</li>
            <li>great product, good deal.</li>
            <li>I was a skeptic, to be sure, but I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I am a hairy guy and the the product is a very welcome tool to make myself more presentable.</li>
            <li>Good luck and happy grooming, my testosterone-rich and folically-blessed brethren.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more than impressed with this razor.</li>
            <li>Nice!</li>
            <li>AND IN PERFECT CONDITION  My son says that it works great and is easily used</li>
            <li>The blade is awesome and I even used it to shave my chest (also very hairy) and it did a great job!  </li>
            <li>To my pleasant surprise it arrived 3 days after I ordered it.  </li>
            <li>It was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this item it does a great job</li>
            <li>but it works perfectly and the hair falls away easily.</li>
            <li>THE GOOD NEWS:  </li>
            <li>The product cleans up the body perfectly and you will find yourself as smooth as a peach.</li>
            <li>That makes it a good purchase.</li>
            <li>The good reviews are correct.  </li>
            <li>But after using it twice, the lightweight helps reduce arm strain, and it didn&#x27;t feel cheap at all, and I&#x27;m impressed with the design.  </li>
            <li>This is a good item</li>
            <li>but it does not cut hair as good as I thought.  </li>
            <li>Once the judge ruled in my favor, the blades did a good job of shredding the nests, but the minced feathers can make you sneeze, so you may want to wear a face</li>
            <li>Good grip/durable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
            <li>It does a good job.</li>
            <li>The shave you get is surprisingly close.  </li>
            <li>it is a good value.  </li>
            <li>Price is good</li>
            <li>It shaved it fairly close.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>I loved</li>
            <li>hey..it has a good reach..</li>
            <li>Good price too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joe Schmoe</li>
            <li>A fair value</li>
            <li>But this thing is so good</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s as good as it got.  </li>
            <li>this product is all about appearance and feeling good about the way</li>
            <li>but it works and has good length to get to all areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All the good reviews here must be made by the Mangroomer folks themselves...</li>
            <li>the Mangroomer does a good job of reaching all those hard-to-reach areas, but once it gets there, WATCH OUT.  </li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>Take good care of it</li>

            <li>did&#x27;nt do a good job.</li>
            <li>- as I say, design concept is good.  </li>

            <li>This thing is amazing...</li>
            <li>This product is a great idea, but cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>It did however cut kind of close.</li>
            <li>Note that I said kind of.</li>
            <li>You kind of have to feel where you&#x27;re moving it.</li>
            <li>It kind of feels nice.</li>
            <li>had it for two years till i broke it, it didnt break on its own.</li>
            <li>You can remove the hair in the privacy of your own home, without the need to ask someone to do it for you.</li>
            <li>From design stand point, it is a nice concept</li>
            <li>Battery operated is sufficient, nice design.  </li>
            <li>However, the product support is great and the folks at Manpower will bend over backwards to make sure you are satisfied.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s sooo pleased, so I&#x27;m happy, :), and he&#x27;ll probably be writing his own review too, hehe.&lt;br /&gt;Happy</li>
            <li>Nice to purchase a product that works like it</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that I wish I bought this product sooner.</li>
            <li>Dudes, its just straight up perfect yo.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the way to go to keep yourself trimmed up nicely with minimum fuss and inconvenience.</li>
            <li>best of all it cut very close and cause no irritation at all.  </li>
            <li>Product works good, however the top keeps poping off.</li>
            <li>Good product, I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that it dosen&#x27;t cut into you like a blade</li>
            <li>It does not work, the idea is great and if it had a real razor attached it would be great.</li>
            <li>Requires some care &amp; practice to use effectively without scratching or nicking yourself.</li>
            <li>Make sure you have a couple of good mirrors, though.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled at the result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is nicely balanced, cuts hair without pulling, gives a close shave, and is lightweight.</li>
            <li>I really liked this product.</li>
            <li>He was able to groom without having to ask me to help and that is a good thing.</li>
            <li>I got many many great shaved from it for the price</li>
            <li>Nice handle</li>
            <li>It costs more but has a rubber-like coating that improves your grip, if getting a good grip is a problem.</li>
            <li>This is a handy gadget that will, over time, become part of your routine.  </li>
            <li>Nice and close shave lasts like 2-3 weeks.  </li>
            <li>so it works effectively and efficiently.  </li>
            <li>Suprisingly effective</li>
            <li>And it requires some good hand eye coordination. :)</li>
            <li>It works fairly well and there has been no issues yet but could be constructed better in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>It cuts nice and close, runs on batteries (2 AA)</li>
            <li>what kind of response they might see.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;You&#x27;ve ruined your own lands, you&#x27;ll not ruin mine!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being</li>
            <li>Fully functional and effective.</li>
            <li>It does trim nicely.</li>
            <li>you can the best clean back and best part</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t remove hair completely smooth like you just waxed or use a hair removal cream, but it still does a very very nice job.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the product and the easy ordering process and impressed by the quick delivery time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with this purchase worth every penny!</li>

            <li>I wanted a product that was easy to use and that would keep my hair trimmed and this one did the job as promised at a good price.</li>
            <li>It has a good design, and was easy to use.</li>
            <li>Lightweight and easy to use, not a shaver but a good trimmer.</li>
            <li>This is a good, easy, painless way to get rid of that hair.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>

            <li>I find the product very easy to use.</li>
            <li>No feeling self-conscious in a tank top this summer! :)</li>
            <li>Bought our first one about 5 years ago and LOVED it!  </li>
            <li>This is the best option I have seen thus far!</li>
            <li>Perfect grooming tool for an old silverback gorilla like me.</li>
            <li>the mangroomer and have to say it is by far the best on the market.  </li>
            <li>This thing is great, worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Requires batteries, so make sure you have 2 AAs sitting around, otherwise I believe the pro version has a rechargeable battery which is a nice feature.</li>
            <li>I have purchased a number of items for hair removal, this is the best I have used so far when it comes to&lt;br /&gt;reaching</li>
            <li>Okay, guys -- let&#x27;s be honest.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been impressed by how good it looks, and I&#x27;ve been really happy that I&#x27;ve had such good results at a fraction of the cost of a professional treatment.    </li>
            <li>I think you will find this a great tool to have around and worth the price.</li>
            <li>me this is by far the best solution I have seen...</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve now moved on to a Phillips Bodygroom Pro and am very happy with it so far.  </li>
            <li>The shaver is amazing to help get rid of some of that unwanted hair in places where you might not be able to reach.</li>
            <li>It does a good job and the handle extension is very useful.  </li>
            <li>It is a great value and does the job right.</li>
            <li>Works great for one month, then quits working right after the Amazon return policy expires.</li>
            <li>Do not buy this thing unless you have very fine, unnoticeable hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Using this thing is so easy!</li>
            <li>Very handy and useful</li>
            <li>Happy to report that after reading some mixed reviews -- this is a great gadget.</li>
            <li>this product helps a lot especially when you are in a hurry and don&#x27;t have the patients  the best of its kind</li>
            <li>The first time I used this, I knew this was a great product.</li>
            <li>This product was great for the first six months.  </li>
            <li>I just used this for the first time though, and it works great.</li>
            <li>Product feels very cheap and flimsy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>but the product is made VERY Cheap...</li>
            <li>Did what it should but was very cheap.</li>
            <li>The item is very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very light in color.</li>
            <li>This thing is VERY cheaply made.</li>
            <li>The product didnt even work and it was very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>It uses 2 AA batteries and is very light weight.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very smooth.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;- very cheaply made, feels like it will break any day</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product and it got mostly all of the hair, it&#x27;s just if I wanted a smooth clean feeling I would need to use a razor after I was done with the mangroomer.</li>
            <li>Good power and does what its supposed to quick.</li>
            <li>But over all it is easy to use and the adjustable length handle is handy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy and effective.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and effective.  </li>
            <li>All the positive reviews affirm  that this is a great product.</li>
            <li>The cutter is nice and wide,and it shaves surprisingly close and gets most hair on the first pass.  </li>
            <li>Holy cow, this thing is awesome, shaves pretty much everywhere, doesn&#x27;t get a perfect cut, but it does the bulk of the work amazingly!</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re better off or get your wife to do it</li>
            <li>It really does a great job.</li>
            <li>I have used this 4 times and the more I use it the better and faster</li>
            <li>am really pleased with this product and thank everyone here for helping me make my decision.</li>
            <li>and I used it more than three weeks ago.</li>
            <li>With more practice it will probably go faster and more smoother.     </li>
            <li>so I got it thinking anything would be better than what its been.</li>
            <li>Works ok.</li>
            <li>enjoy!</li>
            <li>The hair you shave off seems attracted to the plastic like static.</li>
            <li>and they seldom lasted more than a year.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for better.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I can quit spending</li>
            <li>While I did run into problems with product, I was able to get a replacement from their customer service department.</li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>So until I find a better made alternative I will use this product.</li>
            <li>Using a mirror can be tricky, so for the most part I do it by feel, and check my results periodically.</li>
            <li>Okay, I&#x27;m really pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping and Great delivery.</li>
            <li>and i love the rubber grip.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s it, now you have a razor with an extended handle at the perfect angle for shaving your back.</li>
            <li>It works 10 times better than this product in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve finally tried it out and it seems to work perfectly, with none of the problems I was experiencing before.</li>
            <li>Halfway through, the top part with the razor fell off.  </li>
            <li>It appears the motion of the blades broke off both bottom front anchors that help to hold the top surface on.  </li>
            <li>I taped the top portion on, and was able to finish.  </li>
            <li>If this were a plug-in appliance, it would be much better.</li>
            <li>It has cut me many, many times.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;Another improvement would be to place the head at a better angle</li>
            <li>The quality of this item could be much better.  </li>
            <li>Go to Bed, Bath and Beyond and use their $10 off coupon on purchases of $30 or more.</li>
            <li>OK just used this item, tried the hair remover cream, tried the razor stapped to hanger (myself)</li>
            <li>I think the shaver should have better blades for thicker hair.</li>
            <li>Defective junk, isn&#x27;t much better than a $4.99 microtouch on a stick.</li>
            <li>The best part is the handle obviously</li>
            <li>Love this product ...</li>
            <li>This is your best option for personal</li>
            <li>I am so glad i don&#x60;t have to do that anymore..</li>
            <li>I did get some irritation but most went away after showering.</li>
            <li>This is the reason many (including myself) are complaigning about irritation and the feel of pulled hairs.  </li>
            <li>The profit they must be making off of each one of these must be outstanding, because the money is not going to materials.</li>
            <li>This product CLEARLY is remarkable and does EXACTLY what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Sincerely,                                                      Jim</li>
            <li>But I was not about to spend $80 or more every three months and decided to give the Mangroomer a shot.  </li>
            <li>I love this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Just ordered another one until I find something better.</li>
            <li>The size of the head trimmer is appropriate for the task and two AA batteries (not included)</li>
            <li>Way better than any alternatives I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>And to top it off, the gave me a free t-shirt!</li>
            <li>I am glad to have the product on the market-</li>
            <li>I just hope they make it better.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, I CAN DO IT MYSELF!</li>
            <li>Ive love it.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;Mangroomer\\&quot; allows me to do it myself with the use of mirrors to make sure I did not miss any spots.</li>
            <li>and I was pleased</li>
            <li>I like many others wasn&#x27;t sure about buying this and spending 40 bucks for it.  </li>
            <li>and I feel better.  </li>
            <li>, I wish it were made of a more durable material.  </li>
            <li>So until someone comes up with a better made groomer this might be it.</li>
            <li>but it could be a better product</li>
            <li>If anyone of you have back hair and want it removed by shaving it this is the best product.</li>
            <li>I am able to do it myself about once a month even with 2 torn rotator cuffs in my shoulders.</li>
            <li>This shaver bends around perfectly to get every part of my back.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it, and the fact that I can do my back myslef, is just awesome.  </li>
            <li>My friend Dana, is also extrememly grateful, as it used to be her job to do this...&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Both Mangroomer and Amazon were very helpful and provided great customer service.      </li>
            <li>Found it works better to go by feel than look in the mirror.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li>but he says he satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>and it would be more durable.</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why they couldn&#x27;t have used a more sophisticated and better-designed razor, the one that&#x27;s</li>
            <li>sincerely apologize for the problems you are having with your shaver.</li>
            <li>We would like to provide you with a replacement at once as you should never have had any problems with your shaver and it is our responsibility to be sure you are always 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li>Your satisfaction with our product is our top priority.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you and kindest regards,&lt;br /&gt;The MANGROOMER Team&lt;</li>
            <li>I would recommend you try the product even if it didn&#x27;t work for me, given that the most you will lose is shipping.  </li>
            <li>It worked even better than I had anticipated.</li>
            <li>(One wax treatment I had done before cost me more).</li>
            <li>I was most worried about (the somewhat flimsy feeling plastic shell).</li>
            <li>Wish I could have gotten more for what I paid for.</li>
            <li>and i realize there is a better version out now</li>
            <li>I wold like to tell you this works great,but I can&#x27;t My first Mangroomer worked ok at best at first.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way better than the 15 plus years of frustration leading up to when I found the mangroomer...</li>
            <li>Most people you would ask to do this job will not volunteer to do it so this device provides an alternative.</li>
            <li>All in all this is an innovative device.  </li>
            <li>For this money, they should be able to deliver a top notch</li>
            <li>TOP POINTS for that</li>
            <li>Norelco is much, much better product.  </li>
            <li>Worked ok for about 10 seconds</li>
            <li>OK,</li>
            <li>(note to MANGROOMER - higher quality blades would be nice!).  </li>
            <li>The handle is ingenious.  </li>
            <li>There was a bit of stubble, but nothing you could see from more than 3 feet away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m somewhere between a 6-7 on a scale of 1-10, I&#x27;ve seen guys more hairy than me.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m thinking ok this has got some power</li>
            <li>I would spend your money on a better trimmer.</li>
            <li>If they would make one with a stronger motor and it plugged into the wall it would be a better product</li>
            <li>He handles it himself, and now it is smooth sailing!  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This product is an excellent solution to an embarrassing problem, back hair!</li>
            <li>The telescoping plastic arm rattles around more, the more you extend it.   </li>
            <li>Glad I got it</li>
            <li>Im sure if you drop it... it will break...</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li>I have gotten much better values from Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>innovative design?</li>
            <li>I wanted to give the Mangroomer 1 more chance</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like $10 more</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than hacking up furballs.</li>
            <li>and if this one continues to work, I might invest in a better version.  </li>
            <li>i walked away with more than one scratch marks on my shoulders</li>
            <li>have used it for about 8 weeks now without issue, I am glad i went with this one and not the rechargeable version.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t come with any assorted guards and the blades don&#x27;t adjust but for getting rid of back hair, the setup it perfect as is.</li>
            <li>Buy at own risk but if you want to be perfectly smooth in terms of body hair, you should probably go with a wax.</li>
            <li>While it folds up nicely into a compact size, it does look fairly cheap.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Then I gave it a try and thought a disposable razor would be much more efficient.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>The design is better than anything I&#x27;ve used and my wife doesn&#x27;t have to help anymore.</li>
            <li>in all - it could not be better.</li>
            <li>I have been able to get this to stay with an epoxy treatment.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>but you will need to shave more often because it is not a close shave.</li>
            <li>A genius created a gadget that solves SO many manly problems.  </li>
            <li>Anyone thinking about purchasing this as a gift or for themselves don&#x27;t think twice, you&#x27;ll be glad you bought it.</li>
            <li>Husband is pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>Worked ok (the product itself does have the \\&quot;Made in</li>
            <li>so you will have to shave slightly more often.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been generally satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>Best product I&#x27;ve found for do-it-yourself back hair removal.  </li>
            <li>Ok, so it pulls some hair.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve got more hair than just fuzz.</li>
            <li>I use my webcam and laptop to see how I&#x27;m doing or have done with this product :)</li>
            <li>But for the price that&#x27;s okay, I suppose.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Putting some clippers on a stick is not what I&#x27;d call an engineering feat and in fact, I but you could make a better one with a stick and some duct tape...</li>
            <li>Battery use makes it more portable and easier to manuver.</li>
            <li>or I&#x27;m sure it will crack.  </li>
            <li>Joint in handle could have a greater range of motion, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>and I love still love it.</li>
            <li>but if you have to this looks and feels cheap as well and now that i warned you, you are on your own.</li>
            <li>I will gladly recommend this product to any man with hair on their backs.</li>
            <li>The word &#x27;smooth&#x27; isn&#x27;t the word I&#x27;d use to describe it, the shaver itself also does feel kind of flimsy from a build quality</li>
            <li>Static on the plastic handle collects clipped hair.  </li>
            <li>I used it on my arms, legs, feet, back, stomach, chest, its great for everywhere and doesn&#x27;t hurt one bit!</li>
            <li>have purchased the pro version of this item to see if it&#x27;s any better.  </li>
            <li>I have never had problems with Amazon before, but will make sure I check the return policy before buying something like this again.</li>
            <li>IM SO SEXY</li>
            <li>Be sure to pick up 2 AA batteries.</li>
            <li>Definitely glad I purchased this,</li>
            <li>As I get better at it I think it would not take longer than 6 or 7 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I am better off with a razor.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great design.</li>
            <li>It does help to be in front of a mirror to be able to see what you are doing.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>So the angle works wonderfully for my mans back.</li>
            <li>He uses it and is satisfied with the quality of shave</li>
            <li>Ive found the holy grail, this is the next best invention after fire.  </li>
            <li>the blade is way too close to the skin and makes it look like you made love with a wolverine when you&#x27;re done, then you go to take a shower</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s the most excruciating shower you&#x27;ll probably ever have.    </li>
            <li>(sure I have some, but I&#x27;m not sasquatch) seemed to also take a layer of skin with it...</li>
            <li>but that was not my intention, nor do i feel it will be the intention of most of you.</li>
            <li>There seemed to be more pulling then clipping</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>but I am hairier then most men.</li>
            <li>Mangroomer, understandably, wanted to make sure I wasn&#x27;t using the device improperly.  </li>
            <li>Thank goodness.:)</li>
            <li>Update: Keeping the hair shorter lets the unit work much better.  </li>
            <li>and I was able to dispose of the unwanted hair on my back.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>If that is not a horrible disease I do not know what is.</li>
            <li>But since getting the knack of using it, the results have been more than satisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the cheaper FYI shaver had a better blade, but they don&#x27;t make them anymore.  </li>
            <li>it would be even better if the blades would trim easier.</li>
            <li>overall a good product, the trimmers work great for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m totally satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t get more than a year.</li>
            <li>So glad I came across it online.</li>
            <li>A well groomed body is just more appealing.  </li>
            <li>The blades are set up in a way that will not harm you, unlike many trimmers not specifically designed for this purpose.</li>
            <li>Not as close as I would like, but better than others.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s better to buy it here online.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ll go away in a day and best of all your back will have no hair anyway.</li>
            <li>I got it, used it and love it.  </li>
            <li>Makes him feel more confident without his shirt.  </li>
            <li>It seems like a good product, but it doesn&#x27;t work right.  </li>
            <li>I really needed this!!!!</li>
            <li>I was very excited to put it to use when it was delivered.</li>
            <li>I was given this as a gift, and was very excited...</li>
            <li>Over 6 years - I&#x27;ve used this shaver every 6 - 8 weeks (more often in summer - shirtless weather) for over 6 years, and I thought I should update my original review: NO problems!  </li>
            <li>(I made sure good batteries were in it first).</li>
            <li>This is the most impressive product design I have seen in a long time.  </li>
            <li>He was becoming more and more withdrawn, until one his friends recommended this product.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to order the mangroomer, it seemed like the perfect solution to a long time problem.  </li>
            <li>Very clean and smoothing.  </li>
            <li>I took a chance on this, and have to say it worked pretty good.</li>
            <li>For all others it&#x27;s a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li>$5 a session compared to what waxing costs is still a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li>Pretty good considering design/ergonomic difficulties with product like this.</li>
            <li>Worked pretty good but stopped shaving?</li>
            <li>Does a pretty good job.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s pretty good</li>
            <li>but you can do a pretty good job without even looking in a mirrior.</li>
            <li>Some attention should also be given to protecting skin from carving, but as for closeness it&#x27;s a pretty darned good shave.</li>
            <li>good news is that Mangroomer appears to really want to make sure their customers are satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Works pretty good.</li>
            <li>Correspondence with the company was quick, courteous, and generous.</li>
            <li>Love it ...very easy to use and keeps me well groomed....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did, it&#x27;s easy to operate and works well.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband and he was happy he could take care of his back on his own.</li>
            <li>It worked PERFECTLY well and much better than expected.</li>
            <li>It would be more user friendly if it had more than one head, a trimmer head and a shaver head.  </li>
            <li>Batteries last very good.</li>
            <li>but, my unit works fine and cuts good- actually too good..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not going to give you 100% smooth results but does a pretty good job once you get used to it.</li>
            <li>: It feels cheap as it is made of mostly plastic.</li>
            <li>They were more noticeable in a nice hot shower.  </li>
            <li>However, this thing is one of the most cheaply constructed, flimsy products I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Nice design that would be better with higher quality materials</li>
            <li>So far this is the one, Great improvements, check it out even if you don&#x27;t think you would use it that often I would recommend[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m happy to say that I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>The BG2020 is more comfortable and the razor probably shaves a bit closer.  </li>
            <li>My husband is 6&#x27;2\\&quot; and also not very flexible, so this groomer has a perfect reach for him.  </li>
            <li>My first Mangroomer seemed to have been effective over 2 years, or more.</li>
            <li>So simple, yet so brilliant.  </li>
            <li>Great reaching capability, feels soft on the skin.</li>
            <li>These newer models are significantly better in terms of their capability to cut smoothly and without nicking or grabing you skin.  </li>
            <li>so i may review in better light after i try the replacement.</li>
            <li>It takes AA batteries, so if for some bizarre reason you wanted one, this would be the better buy over the costlier rechargeable version.</li>
            <li>The handle works great to reach areas, the shaver itself is complete garbage.</li>
            <li>I really could not belive how good a job that this product delivered.</li>
            <li>For all the adjustable handle is good and it folds away neatly for your convenience, the end result is really what I was looking for when I bought this item, and it just didn&#x27;t deliver what I was lead to hope it</li>
            <li>This product sort of threw me for a loop because of all the good reviews it got.&lt;br /&gt;Right out of the box it felt very flimsy.</li>
            <li>it fired right up!!  </li>
            <li>I originally had an issue with this product, however when I talked to the customer service about it they were more than helpful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not interested in paying for waxing, or the bumps that show up afterward, so this product is perfect.</li>
            <li>I love this little awesome shaver.</li>
            <li>Other than that, really great product!</li>
            <li>works great, easy to use and does a great job reaching those hard to reach places.</li>
            <li>It easily takes off hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>me just say this thing is a great product, I was able to easily reach all my back hair.</li>
            <li>I was releived that it was so easy to make this change.</li>
            <li>it should be easy to groom yourself.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another last warning; if you fly with your mangroomer, make sure you take the batteries out before you check your bag.  </li>
            <li>its really easy to use</li>
            <li>The battery cover falls off easily and when it doesn&#x27;t, hair trimmings enter the battery compartment.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the most effective whole body shaver I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It is just that easy.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be pleased at how great your back feels.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and saves you a lot of money and pain.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Did the job easily.</li>
            <li>This shaver is easy and painless.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, just takes a time or two to get the feel.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It works and it&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The Mangrommer worked flawlessy and easily reach any area...  </li>
            <li>(On a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the hairiest, I&#x27;m easily a 7).</li>
            <li>It is constructed out of flimsy plastic and it looks and feels like it could break quite easily.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to use and got the job done.  </li>
            <li>Not as clean of a job as waxing but substantially easier and more convenient.</li>
            <li>It is easy to get to the &amp;#34;hard to get [laces&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Because I also have the rechargeable model, I have removed the folding part of the handle, (an easy job).</li>
            <li>yes, the mangroomer is not a sturdy product, and if you drop it, it probably will break easily.</li>
            <li>When I got the Mangroomer, it was easy to put the batteries in and easy to figure out how to use it.</li>
            <li>Another plus is that it reaches all areas fairly easily.  </li>
            <li>Easy do it yourself item.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t fold easy.  </li>
            <li>The handle enables easy reach to all locations.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was as easy as one, two and three.</li>
            <li>The product itself is easy to use and</li>
            <li>Does the job, easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Reaching every spot was easy and I gathered the shaved hair from the bottom of the tub so the drain won&#x27;t clog.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is easily the poorest quality item I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>and they are still going strong.</li>
            <li>strongly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>but it is handy and the adjustability of the handle is good though it feels fragile.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>of fair skin, I have a rather decent amount of moles.  </li>
            <li>Its compact, very easy to use and is quite powerful.  </li>
            <li>Nothing really special about it, but I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>and I must say Im suprised it cleans it up pretty nicely.</li>
            <li>but I gets easy quick!</li>
            <li>Handy and efficient, does exactly what it describes.</li>
            <li>These last for years, give a nice close shave, and are by far the best option I have found.</li>
            <li>Save the $40 for something more exciting and useful like a waxing!!</li>
            <li>Hands down the best thing I&#x27;ve EVER purchased.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so quick and easy to use compared to anything else I&#x27;ve been able to think of or that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Not that impressed with product at first... but fired it up, easily trimmed my back............</li>
            <li>You need good, new batteries</li>
            <li>The handle piece works fine, although it seems a tad flimsy.  </li>
            <li>Mine works fine.  </li>
            <li>But this is fine for maitenance.</li>
            <li>and it is light weight for easy handling.</li>
            <li>For me, about once per month works fine.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll do fine.</li>
            <li>and it worked perfectly fine out of the box.</li>
            <li>Maybe I should have read the fine print on that one, so it&#x27;s on me.</li>
            <li>you will be fine.  </li>
            <li>Light and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>Once I got sort of the hang of it, it was fine.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re fine.  </li>
            <li>Fine....</li>
            <li>Its light and easy to use...</li>
            <li>if i had some peach fuzz on my arms, this would probably be fine, but i&#x27;m a man.</li>
            <li>It cuts great pretty much every</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an easy 5 minute task once a week to keep smooth.</li>
            <li>I just tried it out, and it works fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also light and easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li>It started to work just fine</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this trimmer and it worked wonderfully the first time I tried.  </li>
            <li>Works great, AND you kind of get your own back scratching that is better than those bamboo back scratching sticks ...</li>
            <li>I use it bi-weekly and it&#x27;s holding up fine.</li>
            <li>I found this product more than adequate.</li>
            <li>It did not give a close shave and it clogged up quickly!  </li>
            <li>Cricks the neck a little, but that&#x27;s what a nice hot shower afterwards is for :D</li>
            <li>I found that slow and easy, and with a very light pressure works best.  </li>
            <li>Very useful, easy to use once you get the hang of looking in the mirror.</li>
            <li>This shaver is great for removing back hair easily.</li>
            <li>Also worth note, is the weight of the product - very light, and the reach and flexibility it gives you with one hand.</li>
            <li>It is battery operated and cheap plastic, but it works fine.</li>
            <li>I just used this unique back shaver for the first time and I am impressed.</li>
            <li>I was a little dubious about this product but it did the job perfectly.</li>
            <li>Battery life is great, very very safe and efficient, blades needed no maintenance, only cleaning after use, very ergonomic (being an Industrial Engineer, I have some idea of Ergonomics), user friendly and prefectly priced as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does take a little while to get use to tilting the head correctly to shave the hair effectively, but once you get the hang of it, it works great.     </li>
            <li>is very cheaply built,the handle cracked the first time I used it so it is now taped.is fairly easy to use but for the money I think it was over priced.....</li>
            <li>It felt great to be back hair free with just a 5 min shave.</li>
            <li>It seems people are only happy with it for light touch ups.  </li>
            <li>The mangroomer looks like a great idea, and it is contructed well enough, though it seems a bit light, however, I found it to be well made.  </li>
            <li>This is a great way to get a smooth feel to the area you want to rid hair from if using an actual razor blade won&#x27;t work for you.</li>
            <li>cheap product casing.</li>
            <li>This is a great product that should be in the hygine aisle of every big box store.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for the man with an overly hairy back.  </li>
            <li>The quality does seem a bit cheap, so I&#x27;ll see how well it holds up after time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product is light and made out of plastic but don&#x27;t let that fool you.</li>
            <li>The Mangroomer do it yourself electric back hair shaver is truly a great invention.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t put in words how happy I am to remove my back hair!!!!</li>
            <li>He has a light growth all over those areas</li>
            <li>If you have light hair...</li>
            <li>Finally...some reviews indicate that this item is lightweight and cheap...</li>
            <li>which is important...</li>
            <li>The important thing to do is to relax and take your time.</li>
            <li>The important thing to do is to relax and take your time.</li>
            <li>Sometimes, I could get it going by push-starting the blade with a pencil or something, but mostly it wanted fresh batteries to get going.      </li>
            <li>They also provide a free ear and nose trimmer.</li>
            <li>It is cheaply constructed, which is concerning.</li>
            <li>Although for the money it is cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>Since ive been using the mangroomer I can walk into the gym proud with no guilt and embarrassment of no longer having a hairy back.</li>
            <li>This version that&#x27;s available on Amazon is battery-operated.</li>
            <li>it just feels so cheap.......</li>
            <li>If you have a hairy back this will help you out greatly.</li>
            <li>It gives close non-irritating shaves and is easy to clean and use.  </li>
            <li>Ever since I got this groomer, my back, neck and shoulders look great.  </li>
            <li>The idea is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Either way, this thing isn&#x27;t going to give you that calendar-boy smooth torso.</li>
            <li>This is built out of cheap plastic.  </li>
            <li>This thing uses two double-A batteries and is extremely light.  </li>
            <li>The unit is cheaply constructed, as others have pointed out, and for that I give it 4 out of 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t fit....    </li>
            <li>Although some reviewers find it cheaply made, for the price</li>
            <li>Some may not like the light design</li>
            <li>If you need a cheap solution this will work, but I was somewhat dissapointed.</li>
            <li>It seems cheaply made, for the price paid.  </li>
            <li>It&#x60;s light weight and folds compact to fit in a bag for travel or to keep in a drawer.</li>
            <li>I bought this 2 years ago and until recently has worked great.</li>
            <li>This device works as advertised and provides a close and comfortable trimming.</li>
            <li>My back feels great,</li>
            <li>Unlike the trimmer from the same company, this trims/shaves to the skin so in essence it does a great job at that.  </li>
            <li>If you order one and have pain, send it back and try again; when it works, it works great.</li>
            <li>Just by handling it you would notice how cheap it is.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cheap construction.</li>
            <li>This product is well made and did a great job at getting rid of my back hair.</li>
            <li>I have light colored fine/soft hair.</li>
            <li>yes it feels cheap</li>
            <li>I was prepared for the quality to feel cheap, but so is the performance.</li>
            <li>Unit feels cheap, but the bottom line is it does the job.</li>
            <li>So I was amazed at the close, smooth results.</li>
            <li>It is an awfully light trimmer</li>
            <li>This unit works, but primarily for maintenance.</li>
            <li>If you have a \\&quot;pelt\\&quot; it will not work well as the primary treatment.</li>
            <li>It is cheaply made and does not work.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The shaver head snaps off easily, and a clean paint brush can sweep away any hair that accumulates in the mechanism.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product that needs to go through a second generation refinement.   </li>
            <li>Fresh batteries make it work more efficiently.</li>
            <li>cheap construction?</li>
            <li>It is comfortable to use and well designed.</li>
            <li>you feel how cheaply made it is.</li>
            <li>Simply fabulous does everything it promises.</li>
            <li>It feels light in hand but not flimsy.</li>
            <li>Avoid at all cost and furthermore extremely cheaply made.</li>
            <li>I thought the mangroomer would be a great thing for my husband&#x27;s hairy back, however, once he tried it, I changed my mind!  </li>
            <li>But overall it works great.</li>
            <li>after it looks fantastic.</li>
            <li>Takes a while to get used to using it in a mirror or by feel but gives a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>the head replacement cost $10, thats cheap.</li>
            <li>so I contacted the manufacturer and they promised to send a replacement Mangroomer and also a ear and nose hair trimmer all free of charge.  </li>
            <li>This does a great job of scraping the barnacles off of your back and makes a great motorized back scratcher too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s make up is kinda cheap, but it does what I need it to do.</li>
            <li>Its made of cheap plastic and leaves a lot of stubble.</li>
            <li>The extender does a great job getting to the lowest part of my back</li>
            <li>/&gt;Prompt delivery, delivered in NJ 3 days after placing order via free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>More economical then going to get waxed and doesn&#x27;t leave ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>It is also supper light.</li>
            <li>Not only works for the guys but makes the ladies happy too</li>
            <li>The components used to make these seem incredibly cheap.  </li>
            <li>This thing is rather cheap and doesn&#x27;t work that well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a great deal of back hair</li>
            <li>i am still at this day amazed what made me buy this cheap piece of plastic.</li>
            <li>Overall a great idea.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s cheap)</li>
            <li>I found item to be light weight but not flimsy.</li>
            <li>It does a great job, cuts close, never jams up, and gets every spot on your back with ease!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s horribly cheap plastic, like something you&#x27;d buy at a flea market...</li>
            <li>It does not \\&quot;shave\\&quot; nor does it leave your skin smooth without trace of hair.</li>
            <li>and the foil shaver makes everything smooth.    </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m smooth.</li>
            <li>Since I was so happy with it, I didn&#x27;t hesitate to buy the same item again on June 30th, 2012.  </li>
            <li>recommend!!Cuts smooth without any problems.</li>
            <li>u do it by your self pain free.</li>
            <li>The product itself is a bit cheap feeling</li>
            <li>They also sent a free gift for my trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But for the stated purpose, this is an indispensable grooming device to get rid of unwanted body hair.</li>
            <li>This groomer is fantastic.</li>
            <li>, if you need your back scratched, you can use it without turning it on, and it works great.</li>
            <li>Great back shaver!!</li>
            <li>I will say that it does not get you perfectly smooth, and</li>
            <li>this cheap but for the money it works, just invest in some rechargeable batteries.</li>
            <li>If having no hair is important to you, I recommend getting both - you&#x27;ll need the Mangroomer to get rid of the bulk of your hair, then the Razorba to shave the rest</li>
            <li>have mentioned that the quality of build and plastic feel cheap; I disagree.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- cuts smooth</li>
            <li>The angle is GREAT for reaching your back.  </li>
            <li>Not the hairiest but more than a fair amount of animal pelt grows on my back.  </li>
            <li>I have a Norelco beard trimmer that is far superior.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much for making such a GREAT product!!</li>
            <li>basic design concept is excellent - this design concept would really work if were executed well.  </li>
            <li>Working good so far.</li>
            <li>Still learning to master it, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>I actually gave it as a &amp;#34;gag gift&amp;#34; and found out that he really thought it a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>My best personal grooming gadget so far!!!</li>
            <li>Works great to keep a clean smooth back or chest.</li>
            <li>this is perfect foe the man who wants to keep a clean back .  </li>
            <li>Great product for the guy who like to keep him self looking clean cut for the lady&#x27;s of the guys.works way better than I had expected.</li>
            <li>Holidays &amp; Thanks!!!</li>
            <li>Thanks Mangroomer!!!</li>
            <li>Very useful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for a couple of years now and find it so very useful.</li>
            <li>This works great and leaves your back clean.</li>
            <li>improve this product they need to make a more powerful trimmer preferably with removable heads so that it will be easier to clean and maintain.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are a man looking to get hair off of your body, particularly your back, this is superb product to help keep you groom.</li>
            <li>My first impression on opening up the packaging is that this thing is very cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>So easy and quick    Bravo</li>
            <li>This thing works quickly and easily and got rid of my cave-man look in about 3 minutes.  </li>
            <li>This is a quick and effortless solution that is as easy as buzzing your whiskers.  </li>
            <li>This product does a decent job and it comes in handy with the handle.  </li>
            <li>The Man Groomer is the best back shave I have tried and will order a new one if and when this one dies.</li>
            <li>The good news was about half of my hair was effectively, permanently removed</li>
            <li>I have used this product for a long time and going through a divorce it disappeared  happy to see the wife go</li>
            <li>I would purchase another one, even at a higher price if it were made better.</li>
            <li>Folds and fits perfect in a small place.</li>
            <li>Admittedly, that is what i was excited about too.</li>
            <li>and I must say - it is worth the money!  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pretty sure they are from user error and will go away.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant dulling of the blades.  </li>
            <li>Original review</li>
            <li>Within 10 minutes of my first attempt at using this my back was gorgeous!  </li>
            <li>The frustration it creates alone would make it worth paying for laser treatment!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>May even take it on a date, I love it so much!</li>
            <li>Well worth the price!  </li>
            <li>Returning the original defective one was a breeze.  </li>
            <li>Please email us your original Order # and mailing address at once.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>so far I&#x27;ve been very pleased with how well it cuts and the area it covers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty fat and this can still reach most the places.</li>
            <li>its worth it!</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll see how long it lasts, but for now, I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li>Purchased mangroomer quite a while ago&amp; it has not disappointed</li>
            <li>The battery life isn&#x27;t so great anymore, but it still lasts long enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Xmas came, my bro was so excited to use this</li>
            <li>, I worked on it, did it right before I went in the shower, it took about 15 minutes to really get it all shaven, and my back looked awesome!!</li>
            <li>The blades were sharp and di a great job very quickly</li>
            <li>I used to own the original Mangroomer from ten or more years ago.  </li>
            <li>The electric razor cuts hair cleanly at every angle I tried.</li>
            <li>But will get a clean shave .</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shave cleanly and it snags and pulls hairs.</li>
            <li>Gets a clean shave</li>
            <li>However, there is either a huge difference in quality between what they used to produce and what they are producing today, or I was just extremely lucky with the device I bought in 2007.</li>
            <li>It will not shave you as cleanly as a razor with foam</li>
            <li>Clean and close shave.</li>
            <li>course, in this case the logical thing to do is simply return it for a replacement (if you don&#x27;t object to an item whose construction materials would need a significant upgrade to approach the quality of a cheap Happy Meal toy) or a refund.</li>
            <li>Great for grooming while single, or saving someone you care about from a quite unglamorous task.</li>
            <li>mangroomer replaced my first shaver, the second one has worked good for many years</li>
            <li>As long as the batteries are new, then this thing runs perfect.</li>
            <li>Once you figure out how to hold it properly and get the right angles, it works great.</li>
            <li>Very efficient, easy to use, and most importantly: VERY AFFORDABLE!!</li>
            <li>I was able to cut down the man forest in about 10 minutes, and to be honest it worked better than I thought it would.</li>
            <li>This pain is easy to avoid, so don&#x27;t condemn the Mangroomer just because you aren&#x27;t using it the right way.    </li>
            <li>This back shaver is very unique and was designed to do a good job shaving  your own back.</li>
            <li>(ya right!).</li>
            <li>I was originally disapointed when I opened the package because of how lightweight and cheap it felt, but when I loaded the batteries and fired it up, I was amazed at how well it cut hair, how fast the blades moved, and how easy it was to use.</li>
            <li>It was Christmas morning, 2006, and I rapidly tore open a box with my name on it underneath the brightly lit tree.</li>
            <li>Works great just have to be careful about irratation from the edges of clippers, but a close cut otherwise</li>
            <li>I am very happy especially after the de-furring of my back :) Came in handy during the last 2 weeks heat wave!</li>
            <li>While it worked great the first time, I ended up getting a bunch of ingrown hairs and razor bumps on my neck, shoulders and back.</li>
            <li>the proud owner of a hairless back thanks to my mangroomer!</li>
            <li>trimmer is kind of loud too and seems to rattle the plastic parts.</li>
            <li>This tool has made grooming much easier and more convenient than trying to find someone to do it for you.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true...</li>
            <li>A good grooming tool for a mans back.</li>
            <li>But I kept using it because it scratched my back so good.  </li>
            <li>This does a good job on the back.  </li>
            <li>When the Mangroomer was working (for the 3 times that I used it), it did do a good job of shaving the hair off of my back.    </li>
            <li>It did an fair job on my back.</li>
            <li>Been looking for a good back shaver for years</li>
            <li>feel it only fair to eddit this with the following.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I expect a full refund, given that I tried the product and it does not work as Amazon advertised.    </li>
            <li>It is true,</li>
            <li>Besides the ease of getting it on the suface of my back, what also amazed me was how surprisingly close it \\&quot;shaved\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I was very impressed with its performance and did not suffer any of the nicks, scrapes, and cuts that others have complained about.  </li>
            <li>This is a good way to shave the back hair by yourself.</li>
            <li>To be perfectly frank, this product sucks.  </li>
            <li>After being self-conscious about my chia-like back for years, I&#x27;m delighted to have purchased the groomer.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I would trust it for more intimate areas of my bod.</li>
            <li>He likes that he can shave his back himself (which I appreciate as well) and it does a good job.</li>
            <li>A 3-way mirror would be a definite help, but I can get by with a good wall mirror and a handheld mirror.  </li>
            <li>Therefore it is the full 5 star rating.</li>
            <li>I really wish the design ahd been better.</li>
            <li>The design is good as it can reach any part of your back</li>
            <li>I think I love it as much as he does.</li>
            <li>Takes practice to get a technic that works, but overall good purchase.</li>
            <li>Batteries and your ready to go :)</li>
            <li>An innovative product that just does not work very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be returning it for a full refund tomorrow.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like mowing the lawn and getting a good back scratch!  </li>
            <li>It also did a good job on the shoulders, upper arms, and underarms.</li>
            <li>The only thing it&#x27;s good for is duct taping a cordless to the handle</li>
            <li>It is more like a clipper, although it does clip the hair very close to the skin.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s still full bush mode.  </li>
            <li>The good news is that the design of this product enables it to reach every inch of your back - if your a contortionist like that guy Turk on America&#x27;s Got Talent!</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t work very well and it sometimes pulls at the hair more than it trims it.</li>
            <li>I do notice that it only cuts good when pushing, or in the forward motion, not pulling backward.</li>
            <li>Gives a quick clean up once every week or two.  </li>
            <li>The trimming is much finer and better than the trimming I get from the trimmer on my Braun foil head shaver which cost over $200.  </li>
            <li>Not necessarily a bad thing.</li>
            <li>always struggled with unsightly back hair and this thing is amazing and easy to use to remove it.  </li>
            <li>I am a fairly hairy guy with a mildly hairy back.</li>
            <li>Very friendly and very apologetic.  </li>
            <li>Everyone else is right -- it feels cheap.</li>
            <li>Anyway, the Mangroomer is easy to use, even for the first time.  </li>
            <li>It takes the hair off that it makes contact with pretty easily</li>
            <li>For light hair this product is excellent, however if you&#x27;ve got the Fangorn Forest on your back, I&#x27;d get something more heavy duty.</li>
            <li>It certainly would take a man of great intelligence to design such a device --</li>
            <li>It always cuts the hair like it&#x27;s suppose to, has a nice long arm, and it easy to wipe clean.</li>
            <li>I am so happy with this and would suggest it to other guys.</li>
            <li>The first time it worked great, second time (with fresh batteries) the power mechanism started to poop out but finished the job.  </li>
            <li>Other than that it is a great product.</li>
            <li>after the first shave, you get more comfortable with using it and it is much easier.</li>
            <li>The first time it irritated the skin but has been fine every time since.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t cut as close as a razer, but it&#x27;s quick and eady.</li>
            <li>the mangroomer has a great design: it really lets you reach every part of your back.</li>
            <li>luckily he has me to help.  </li>
            <li>This does the trick and is quick.</li>
            <li>This is my third and best back shaver I have owned.</li>
            <li>It does a decent job and for the price it is G2G. Could be a wee more adjustable</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ladies, if your man is a hairy boy and you want him to have a nice, silky smooth, hairless back once again, this is what you need to get him ASAP!</li>
            <li>and I can do the job quickly.</li>
            <li>Rather cheaply made but effective enough.</li>
            <li>It works great and you can reach your whole back without being a gymnast.</li>
            <li>I had a problem with the hinge mechanism and another piece of the machinery but the customer service quickly replaced the product.  </li>
            <li>It works great for me as my back hair grows in really sporadic areas and isn&#x27;t the thickest.  </li>
            <li>It clipped my hair quickly and close to the skin.</li>
            <li>but it was not like you had to pass over the same spot numerous of times because the angle had to be perfect.</li>
            <li>Quality product, appropriately priced with decent battery life.</li>
            <li>The upgraded versions of this have a rechargeable battery that dies quickly.</li>
            <li>A couple of quick passes takes care of the problem.</li>
            <li>Just buy it and enjoy the benefits as good as a wet shave for me.</li>
            <li>The item arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>or you move it too quickly, so you&#x27;ll want to find your speed.</li>
            <li>Mangroomer really works great to get the hair off your chest, back and nether parts; a must for athletes; oesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>This is the result of trying to clip an area too quickly.</li>
            <li>The best way to use the clipper is to move it in the opposite direction of the hair growth while simultaneously moving it back and forth about an inch, if that makes sense.</li>
            <li>The shave isn&#x27;t super close, but sufficient.  </li>
            <li>ARRIVED QUICKLY</li>
            <li>The item was delivered extremely quick.</li>
            <li>Still, it&#x27;s adequate.</li>
            <li>Super tacky feel.  </li>
            <li>This little wonder works beautifully.  </li>
            <li>overall i am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;Feels pretty cheap,</li>
            <li>I waited two weeks before getting brave enough to give it a go agin with the same results, and it seemed to pull hair more.</li>
            <li>I am overall very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>My first impression was how cheap the item felt</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light when you first pick it up</li>
            <li>China\\&quot; feel to it, if you have a willing girlfriend/wife, might be easier to buy a cheap ELECTRIC hair trimmer and have her do it.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t remove hair in a very consistent manner and caused irritation.</li>
            <li>It does a good job, and doesn&#x27;t take too long to get the job done.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with this product and do recommend it since it is really the only product of its kind I have seen.</li>
            <li>This was a good idea because of the long handle</li>
            <li>Gentle &#x27;back and forth&#x27; movement seems to be most effective.</li>
            <li>Good idea, just takes a long time to get used to it.</li>
            <li>back is nice and clean now</li>
            <li>I can think of anyone who would want to be hairy if they were fortunate enough to the right kind of DNA for it.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to you and works better than I had expected.</li>
            <li>Well, the half that was completed, it was great.  </li>
            <li>It is possible to get a pretty good shave with it.  </li>
            <li>It does do the job fairly well, especially after the first use....</li>
            <li>However, even though it was time-consuming initially, I did manage to remove most of my hair and it looked noticeably smooth and clean post-shave.    </li>
            <li>Makes shaving easy, really like the design.</li>
            <li>This product actually works and does a pretty good job at getting a close shave.</li>
            <li>Close shave, easy to use and the angle of it really really works well.    </li>
            <li>I cuts really close and is easy to manuever.</li>
            <li>It shaves body parts extremely well and much better than my norelco and as good or better than regular nonelectric razor.  </li>
            <li>when I first bought this, I was excited.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the Mangroomer in november 2011, and at first I was excited about the product.</li>
            <li>You will have to go over the same areas more than once!</li>
            <li>Better than the old days of trying to get rid of unsightly hair!  </li>
            <li>Overall, I am pleased with this unit!</li>
            <li>I was really excited about this product at first.</li>
            <li>Not only was my girlfreind happy with my new look</li>
            <li>I just tried it for the first time, and it&#x27;s pretty easy.</li>
            <li>I was AMAZED how easy it was to take the hair off the top of my back</li>
            <li>If you know of a product which makes grooming one&#x27;s back easy and is better built, please advise.</li>
            <li>It tore my back up pretty good because I couldn&#x27;t get the right angles, but it got the job done.  </li>
            <li>I love the idea of the device and when it works it works great, but it just doesnt last very long.  </li>
            <li>An easy, fast and effective way to shave unwanted back hair.</li>
            <li>The design of the handle is great and makes it possible to easily reach anywhere on your back (or elsewhere for that matter).  </li>
            <li>feels and looks super smooth and sleek, and results last for more than two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>Operating it while looking in the mirror took a little getting used too, but it works great.</li>
            <li>It feels a little flimsy, but does a great job.</li>
            <li>It works great, with a little bit of handling it produced the results as advertised.</li>
            <li>This one works great, although it does hurt a little bit until you get used to it.  </li>
            <li>It is a bit tricky to get the hang of using it at first, but once you adjust to the opposite look to your movements and ensuring the blade lays flat on the skin, it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also not very loud and the battery life is pretty good.</li>
            <li>With the Mangroomer, I have very good control over my entire back.</li>
            <li>: Good design, but mostly made of hard plastic.  </li>
            <li>It trims VERY close to the skin, but is comfortable and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.  </li>
            <li>yes when you get it, it does feel really cheap plastic, very lightweight.  </li>
            <li>Regardless of the fact that it&#x27;s made of cheap plastic and feels like a toy, the thing absolutely works like it says.</li>
            <li>They go away real fast.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;Oh great, money wasted again.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>amazing, I almost can&#x27;t wait for it to grow back to use it again... almost.</li>
            <li>I have used it a few times now, and greatly appreciate it.&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li>Completely worth the price.</li>
            <li>I have to use it kind of like you would use a back scratcher.</li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>but it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the $40.</li>
            <li>It will take a bit more time and patience than you might think, but after 20 to 30 minutes, you will have a smooth back.  </li>
            <li>The longer I had it, the more frequently it consumed batteries.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Almost worth 4 stars because of the ease of use, quality of blade....</li>
            <li>Worth the 40 bucks.</li>
            <li>nothing like a nice five o&#x27;clock shadow on your back!    </li>
            <li>Even if I have to buy one a year, at the price it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is powerful.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money.</li>
            <li>Bout time a man can shave his own back!</li>
            <li>I think the key to best results is closing your eyes, placing the shaver where you want it and then drag it</li>
            <li>worth the 40.00</li>
            <li>I am thrilled I can go to the pool and not have people staring at my back.  </li>
            <li>It has been worth every penny of the 24 dollars</li>
            <li>I use this strictly for shaving my own hairy back.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Took the device out of its package, read the instructions, inserted two fresh \\&quot;AA\\&quot; batteries and...</li>
            <li>Put fresh batteries in and...</li>
            <li>I used it 3 times already without any kind of marks on my back.   </li>
            <li>The marketing on this product is far better than its effectiveness...</li>
            <li>It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Worth it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shave worth a darn.</li>
            <li>I figure that it was worth a shot</li>
            <li>All and all, it seems to be well worth the $40</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re thinking about getting this, do it, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>The problem with shavers is they are not geared for you to shave your own back.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too powerful.  </li>
            <li>I just purchased a different kind.</li>
            <li>It is the only one of its kind that I have found and I have wondered with all the guys in the world shaving there backs these days, why someone hasn&#x27;t come up with this before.</li>
            <li>It turns out that I believe it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Definatley useful if you are like myself and would like to shave the backrug before you go to the beach.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
            <li>liked it enough to buy another one.</li>
            <li>And even though I try fresh batteries after a year</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>The Mangroomer is a nice tool for those that have a lot of back hair going.</li>
            <li>This thing is the most fabulous invention, if you have back hair shame.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>scrapes and pulls far more than it cuts.</li>
            <li>Worth not having to ask my wife to help me out while in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>Worth 40 dollars.</li>
            <li>I saw there was a more expensive Mangroomer, I have no idea how good that one works, but I could ask for nothing more then this one.</li>
            <li>Did you insert fresh batteries?  </li>
            <li>worth the money.</li>
            <li>Just for fun, I tried this on part of my chest, and it worked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To be honest, if you have a standard trimmer and a girlfriend, just ask her to help you.</li>
            <li>point being, it is fun to use.  </li>
            <li>This product was definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it.</li>
            <li>The compact design is nice, but it is certainly bigger than my shaving bag.</li>
            <li>I always read reviews but rarely write them.</li>
            <li>I was nervous purchasing it but easy to use and high quality.</li>
            <li>This one is easy to use, I would highly recommend.....</li>
            <li>It shaves very close and after the first time or two getting used to working with this device it is easy.</li>
            <li>First let me say this gives a much closer shave than the Remington bht600, but its not as easy to use.</li>
            <li>assure you I do not work for the company, but find it really rare these days for a company to do customer service right, even for a $20 product.</li>
            <li>i love this product and so do other people so do yourselves a favor and buy it you&#x27;ll love it</li>
            <li>Feels like its cheap, and doesn&#x27;t even have it&#x27;s own battery like all other shavers in this category.</li>
            <li>As many other reviewers have noted, the construction of the shaver is flimsy and it&#x27;s not as sturdy as most would hope.</li>
            <li>The first unit I got didn&#x27;t work but was quickly replaced at no charge.  </li>
            <li>but it fades pretty quick.</li>
            <li>The shave was pretty good for a low priced tool and certainly a LOT easier than the Razorba that I have also used.  </li>
            <li>It works great, although the first time you do have to go over your back several times to get it smooth.</li>
            <li>I have been extremely happy with the product thus far and would highly recommend it to anyone with unwanted body hair that prefers to take care of it at home as opposed to having it professionally removed.</li>
            <li>And make sure your back is clean and sweat-free before you begin.  </li>
            <li>With the exception of the wobbly handle it is easy to maneuver around my back and seems to cut easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and gets to every place on back easily.</li>
            <li>My first use took about 10-15 minutes to completely remove the hair from my back &amp; shoulders, and it did a great job (stand in a shower stall, or you&#x27;ll get hair all over).  </li>
            <li>You probably won&#x27;t want to use this clipper where an ordinary clipper can be used more comfortably and with better results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and they were fast and friendly.  </li>
            <li>loved this product, and I highly recommend it to anyone else with back</li>
            <li>It really does allow you to reach the middle of your back easily and works great.  </li>
            <li>There is a &amp;#34;technique&amp;#34; you need to get used to to make it work right.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t go right to the skin, like a razor does...</li>
            <li>And when it does connect, it rips the hair right out.  </li>
            <li>It has almost a right angle bend to it.</li>
            <li>, right?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll get right to the point.</li>
            <li>Also, the width of the trimming surface seems just right.</li>
            <li>That means you are not holding it right if you get nicked.</li>
            <li>Thankfully, I was right.     </li>
            <li>almost like it sucked the battery juices right out.</li>
            <li>The blade seized right out of the box</li>
            <li>Do not use it in the shower, use it right when you get out.   </li>
            <li>Since the moving blade is flush with the \\&quot;guard\\&quot;, it just chews you right</li>
            <li>YOU have to take the time to find the right way to hold it</li>
            <li>I read some reviews about having to get the angle right, etc, but didn&#x27;t have any issues.  </li>
            <li>Then compared to the right side.  </li>
            <li>THAT&#x27;S RIGHT</li>
            <li>This electric razor cuts right through it, no fuss.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After useing it just 2 times the thing broke in 2 pieces right where it swivels.</li>
            <li>The shaver more or less works but is of very cheap construction.</li>
            <li>As far as performance, I was not so impressed at first because it took a very long time for me to remove most of my hair, and I don&#x27;t even have a very think layer on my back.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice having my shirt touch my back again for the first time in longer than I can remember.</li>
            <li>Since my hair tends to lay down, a back and forth motion seemed to work best for me.</li>
            <li>I actually have a much better way to get a smooth sexy back.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great idea that I&#x27;m surprised no one financed a long time ago!</li>
            <li>The new Mangroomer works very well and I am completely satisfied.  </li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t get a super close shave, but this will look much better than a hairy back.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very glad I spent the money on this.  </li>
            <li>I actually find that the cheap razors work good on back hair.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nice to have a the long handle to do it while he stands in the shower.</li>
            <li>Honestly, this is the junkiest thing I have purchased in a long time.</li>
            <li>because it would be cool if it had a full range of movement on the arm, it doesnt go to a straight 180&#x27; (which would be a straight line)</li>
            <li>Lo and behold, they shipped me a new one right away, along with a free gift.  </li>
            <li>The blades are sharp and will scratch you pretty well if you bear down, The trick is to glide it lightly over the skin and the blades will do a marvelous job.</li>
            <li>But if you want a perfectly adequate solution, then certainly invest $40 in this tool</li>
            <li>I was a bit reluctant to try this product, not completely believing it would be as efficient and easy to use as quoted by other reviewers, but this product does what it says and does it splendidly.</li>
            <li>works well, not hard to maneuver with either arm, comfort and quick, The sound is barely audible and results are easily seen close cut each time.</li>
            <li>how long this new look will last but for now, It looks great!</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair on my back, and this tackled the hair without issue.</li>
            <li>It was great also did the job and was waterproof and allowed me to trim other areas, but i had lost my charger while moving and a replacement was just as costly as a new one.</li>
            <li>The original is going strong but can&#x27;t last forever.</li>
            <li>MANGROOMER has been in contact and they are sending a new unit free of charge.  </li>
            <li>The new unit they sent - FREE OF CHARGE - works like a charm (they even sent it out to me by overnight Fedex).</li>
            <li>Therefore, we will ship you a new MANGROOMER free of all charges immediately.</li>
            <li>and well the Mangroomer certainly does!  </li>
            <li>I certainly wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to purchase this shaver again!</li>
            <li>my girlfriend presented me with a present, a mangroomer, she said a woman at her office told her how great it was that her husband had starting using the mangroomer.</li>
            <li>Makes it much easier to &#x27;tidy up&#x27; my back and is a lot cheaper than having to go to the bus stop and pay some homeless dude to do it for me</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re usually good for about a week and a half to two weeks.  </li>
            <li>Makes it much easier and faster to tidy up my back for the beach.</li>
            <li>Leaves marks on my back like happy hour at the local brothel.  </li>
            <li>Works great and has become a personal grooming essential.  </li>
            <li>I received a Mangroomer back hair trimmer as a gift and it worked great for about 16 months of occasional use and then the motor quit.  </li>
            <li>It is one of those pleasant surprises that you buy thinking you just wasted some money</li>
            <li>In the mean time I am thrilled (and better yet</li>
            <li>I have very fast growing course hair and have had no problem.</li>
            <li>, I still cannot comment on the durability of the product seeing as I&#x27;ve only had the second shaver for a few minutes but the customer service of this company is superb and that matters more to me than their products, I would not hesitate to buy from Mangroomer again.</li>
            <li>this model is a good model to use, i mainly decided with this model because i had lost my older one which was the next model up but also because this one is battery operated, i would rather deal with batteries than a battery that will eventually not charge anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It turned a 30 minute fiasco into 5 minutes of pure EASE worth every dime, penny and nickle..</li>
            <li>It worked fine at first but has since stopped working completely.</li>
            <li>Charges are quick, easy and last, too.  </li>
            <li>super easy .. battery&#x27;s last along time too.  </li>
            <li>I bought this Mangroomer after reading many reviews, most positive , but a few negative, and I have to say it was great.</li>
            <li>Great for those hard to reach areas..</li>
            <li>I wish there was a higher quality product, but I also appreciate the weight (light) since it does take a while to clean up my back.</li>
            <li>It works on hair of any length, can be used out of the shower, and allows me to shave my entire back more quickly and easily than if I were to use the Razorba.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Okay, the handle could be a little more rigid, but it was simple to use and left me almost as smooth as when my wife performed the uneviable and much dreaded task of clean shaving me so that I could go to the beach without scaring innocent children.      </li>
            <li>The shaver does &#x27;feel&#x27; cheap in that it&#x27;s very light weight, but it works very well - much better than anything I&#x27;ve tried in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak to long-term reliability as I&#x27;ve only had the shaver for a few days, but so far I&#x27;m pleased</li>
            <li>a little cheaply made, blades are good, overall- not bad..</li>
            <li>first time user:</li>
            <li>If the product manufacturer replaced the blade with a foil one such as the Philips-Norelco Bodygroomer than I feel the item would work much better.</li>
            <li>On first use I had to use duct tape to get it not to collapse upon itself.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, it seemed to actually work better on thicker hair, while having trouble with the thinner patches that are close to the skin.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;d gladly pay double for the design if they would up the quality.</li>
            <li>Fairly decent product that performs adequately to what it claims.  </li>
            <li>I have patches on my back and was able to reach them all.</li>
            <li>So when I saw this I thought it was a God send...and sure enough once I used it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d gladly pay extra for a gadget that is sturdier.   </li>
            <li>It takes a while to get used to working with it, but I got it done the first time.</li>
            <li>I am a tall gentleman of Mediterranean descent, so let&#x27;s just say a product aimed at body-hair issues was something that interested me.  </li>
            <li>and it sure beats the hell out of lashing a disposable razor to a back scratacher!</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for over a year and it still work pretty well.</li>
            <li>Picking up a buzzing bag at baggage claim earns you some funny looks.</li>
            <li>It is reasonably well made with the many different angles you can set being incredibly useful.</li>
            <li>Gr8 idea but product doesn&#x27;t have good trimming capability what it is meant for and handle in different position has very loose fit.</li>
            <li>This works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I only wish there were more alternatives.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this will improve with future uses.</li>
            <li>First I started with a metal spatula.</li>
            <li>but beats asking the wife to shave your back for sure.</li>
            <li>Feels smooth and natural.  </li>
            <li>First off, the product does work as described.</li>
            <li>Angle of the head is not optimal for getting most of my back hair.</li>
            <li>It was first time I had ever seen anything like this.  </li>
            <li>Immediately ripped out a handful of hair; upon close examination of the shave head it was clear that the cheap plastic housing had been assembled improperly.</li>
            <li>Quite inexpensive, and seems to be pretty durable.  </li>
            <li>The blade is similar to the trimmer blade on my electric shaver, but wider to cover more area.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Granted plan on spending 15 minutes shaving and make sure you make even strokes or else you&#x27;ll have a hairy spotty back.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a pretty hairy guy and this thing had no issues removing the hair.  </li>
            <li>After using the first about 5 times it stopped turning on</li>
            <li>While my face still looks like a buffalo&#x27;s arm pit, my back has a lovely stubble,</li>
            <li>[...] I laugh and imagine a very hairy Anthony Quinn playing \\&quot;Razorba</li>
            <li>The Mangroomer works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>You will feel better without the hair itching your back.</li>
            <li>I bought this for twice the price when it first came out 5 or so years ago</li>
            <li>I have tried many ways to simplify the removal of back hair, but haven&#x27;t found what I was looking for, until now.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t about to put my faith in a $22 product to get the job done at first.  </li>
            <li>It helps prevent bumps and used it after my first Mangroomer use</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had mine for several months now and am completely satisfied.  </li>
            <li>This item is tricky to use at first</li>
            <li>I wish I knew of a higher quality replacement.</li>
            <li>It actually shaves close , leaving my back nice and smooth.    </li>
            <li>My recommended alternative is Veet for Sensitive Skin if you want to go smooth, or just an adjustable-length beard or hair clipper to trim.  </li>
            <li>I rated this when I first got it</li>
            <li>The first unit I received was defective - it wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>If I have one comment for the company, it would be that they need to get their quality control in check to prevent defective units from going out in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No Scratches on my back at all, love the feeling.</li>
            <li>the hair is gone, my shirt feels better on my back</li>
            <li>This implement is useful but could be much better.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>A smaller groomer I was using before does a better job</li>
            <li>First time I used this, it worked \\&quot;ok\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it worked as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Every time it would cut on the first stroke or 2 and then just start pulling hairs.  </li>
            <li>And unfortunately I&#x27;m not exaggerating.</li>
            <li>Works very well!</li>
            <li>When I received this item I was surprised at how cheaply made it seems.</li>
            <li>The Mangroomer worked exactly as it was described.</li>
            <li>I would forget to get batteries, they would last awhile but it works better with fresher batteries.</li>
            <li>I commend the designers for their innovative idea, and only hope that they better design the clipper in the future.  </li>
            <li>Not as close as a blade, sure, but close enough.  </li>
            <li>I can use it from the side, over the top, and from the bottom of my back.</li>
            <li>The only disadvantage that this groomer has in comparison to dipilatories like nair is that it needs to be done more often.</li>
            <li>I tried it last night and it works better than I thought it would.  </li>
            <li>so an occassional shave is all that is needed after the first time.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t totally sure what to expect given that the negative reviews made this sound like it was cheap and it didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but this did exactly what i needed it to do and still works til this day</li>
            <li>This back hair shaver is simply the best I have ever used and trust me, I HAVE TRIED THEM ALL OVER THE LAST 15 YEARS!!</li>
            <li>I just got the Mangroomer and used it for the first time.  </li>
            <li>It still is the fastest thing I have ever used and got every spot with ease which might have been a first time for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can trim my back more often if needed.</li>
            <li>And if you can reach your back, it&#x27;ll do everything this&#x27;ll do and more.</li>
            <li>ok no big deal</li>
            <li>To get a close cut, and because shaver edge must move against skin while perpendicular to body, the top &amp; bottom blades are set at the same place--unlike, say, a regular barber&#x27;s electric trimmer on which the bottom blade extends a bit beyond the top blade and the shaver moves along the skin surface parallell to it.</li>
            <li>Hence, blades are more likely to nick the skin unles you hold the shaver edge evenly against the skin surface.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That&#x27;s what happened to my first Mangroomer.  </li>
            <li>I will opt for a better trimmer and a bottle of Nair next time.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical when I ordered this, but it is really awesome.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used this product, it stopped working immediately.  </li>
            <li>Works very well!  </li>
            <li>Shaves pretty close.</li>
            <li>Nice way to keep your back &amp; back side smooth .</li>
            <li>Worth the money works very well</li>
            <li>My first one I dropped after one week of use and it literally shattered into a million pieces.</li>
            <li>The first time I used the Mangroomer</li>
            <li>This trimmer does exactly what I wanted it to do and</li>
            <li>exactly what it claims to do.</li>
            <li>When you first get this shaver it seems lightweight but it has held up well for me.</li>
            <li>my fault but just be aware it takes them.</li>
            <li>but I have yet to get one to last more than a year</li>
            <li>This is the first solution.</li>
            <li>First, it works.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my first one for over 5 years</li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this thing I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair on my back</li>
            <li>..be better off without the extra handle.</li>
            <li>Versus the bend, but after use; it&#x27;s not difficult to adjust to.</li>
            <li>and it has worked exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>First, read the directions.  </li>
            <li>I bet it won&#x27;t last for more than a year...</li>
            <li>most regular shavers cost about 100. &lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks for inventing!</li>
            <li>After evaluating first hand, I&#x27;d give this gadget a 3 out of 10.</li>
            <li>Firstly, this thing is so flimsy.  </li>
            <li>After they wrote me I was able to reach them back at sales@mangroomer.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I wish the clippers were a bit more heavy duty as I have a good amount of back hair.</li>
            <li>Razor is nice and wide and works well.</li>
            <li>You are better off getting someone to cut your back hair with a trimmer.</li>
            <li>Think of a &#x27;shaved head&#x27;, the hair isn&#x27;t exactly gone, it&#x27;s just cropped.</li>
            <li>I tried it first day and worked well.  </li>
            <li>Keep the bottom blade hitting your skin first and it won&#x27;t bite you.  </li>
            <li>The shaver broke the first time I used it</li>
            <li>and my wife is much happier!</li>
            <li>me, I do my sides first, feeling the path without a mirror, in a horizontal pattern.  </li>
            <li>just finished using it for the first time.  </li>
            <li>now that&#x27;s funny.  </li>
            <li>The MANGROOMER worked exactly as it said it would.  </li>
            <li>I think they would do well to produce a more robust unit in the future, one that is metallic and AC-powered.</li>
            <li>he really likes it!</li>
            <li>First, I hesitate to call the Mangroomer a \\&quot;shaver.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>The first one I received in 2012 would cut the hair for about 1/2 an inch before snagging; the replacement immediately snagged hair.  </li>
            <li>Got the first one at Bed, Bath, and Beyond.</li>
            <li>I first saw the MANGROOMER, I thought I had found my Eden..</li>
            <li>~$100, as many of these upraised moles were removed at a later date at a cost much higher than the $20 that I paid for the MANGROOMER</li>
            <li>one cause the first died after about 4 months.</li>
            <li>I have wanted to get one of these since I first heard about it years ago.</li>
            <li>it worked pretty freaking well.</li>
            <li>but I thought it could be more solid.</li>
            <li>Spend the extra bucks and make sure you get a quality groomer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many things over the years to address my hairy back.</li>
            <li>This thing works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Been using this for several years now and women will love you for it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to shave my back with ease.  </li>
            <li>but it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed</li>
            <li>I received the first one it did not turn</li>
            <li>They were able to replace it with no issue after i sent them some pictures of the current one.</li>
            <li>The foldable handle and extension allow you to reach every area of your back - though it takes a bit of practice to figure out the best angle to approach different areas of your back from.  </li>
            <li>I just used it for the first time today.  </li>
            <li>No one wants to see that!  </li>
            <li>Really works well!</li>
            <li>Broke on first use.</li>
            <li>Tried multiple times to use it, and tested to make sure the blades were functioning...</li>
            <li>On the plus side, if you do happen to have fair skin and a mole here or there, you could save a few hundred bucks and just MANGROOM it off, instead of going to see a dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had given this to lmy son-in-law a few years ago and he loved it.  </li>
            <li>(The first few uses will provide an amazing close &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; and moves through hair quickly and efficiently).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>: Mangroomer sent me a new shaver at no extra charge and it arrived within a couple days which was nice</li>
            <li>It improves his self-esteem, it feels more comfortable under his shirts and he seems to sweat less.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and as expected :-)</li>
            <li>Gets rid of even the longest hairs on the back and is relatively easy to use right out of the box.</li>
            <li>If they were smart, they would make one that actually plugs into the wall with better construction for the clippers and power mechanism.  </li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t figure out why they didn&#x27;t work a little harder to perfect the product.  </li>
            <li>It took me a third of the time that it was taking me on my last shaver that I thought it was pretty good.</li>
            <li>which is a fairly long time I feel much better  and confident with this razor and back hair groomer.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, no major cuts or nicks, no bleeding, so it&#x27;s a relatively safe item.</li>
            <li>but when you do finally get it at the right angle it works fine on shorter hair.  </li>
            <li>It really does a good job at getting all the right spots that I can&#x27;t usually reach.</li>
            <li>This product is far from excellent - and that&#x27;s what&#x27;s frustrating about it, because it should be.  </li>
            <li>I have a good patch of hair on my entire back and</li>
            <li>good thing i only paid ten bucks for it</li>
            <li>I found the best method for me was to slowly draw the head back and forth, instead of just one direction.  </li>
            <li>Overall it provides good value of money and simplifies removing hair on the back.</li>
            <li>I am able to reach over my whole back with this.</li>
            <li>It actually feels good like a back scratcher.</li>
            <li>(my wife was probably tired of it, too, but she was too nice to say anything about it),and wanted to give the MANGROOMER a try before something more radical like waxing or laser removal.    </li>
            <li>In any case, once you get the hang of it, it does a good enough job so that you no longer need to rely on your spouse or partner--or the sadists who do back waxing.</li>
            <li>Yet if I am anything more than gentle when using it, my back gets all scratched up to the point where it looks like I was making out with a grizzly bear.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the Mangroomer would be strong enough to remove thick layers of hair, but it&#x27;s managed to rid of my hair quite easily and effectively.</li>
            <li>Ok, let&#x27;s face it, who wants to talk about back hair?  </li>
            <li>Most people do not have a 3 way mirror in their house, and I am not about to go shave my back at J.C. Penny haha. &lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used it multiple times since purchase and wish there was a better reasonably priced alternative</li>
            <li>A gentle summer breeze has more effect on my back hair than this wimpy clipper.</li>
            <li>He used the mangroomer and said it cut his time in half maybe even more!</li>
            <li>So I have nothing positive to say.</li>
            <li>Positive: 1.  </li>
            <li>- I have already returned it and will say something positive now.</li>
            <li>This shaver does an awesome job of trimming the hair down to 1/8&amp;#34; or less</li>
            <li>And since they&#x27;ve pretty much got the market cornered here, I&#x27;d still recommend the buy.</li>
            <li>My only real problem with this is the price, I don&#x27;t really understand why this costs more then $10 or $15.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have many, but each was is around 1.5 inches long.  </li>
            <li>This review is pretty straight forward just like the name of the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep looking out there for another product that may be more durable that has the long handle feature that separates this groomer from the others.</li>
            <li>It is very light-weight, which is nice, but it does not give a close shave and the other reviewers are correct in saying that you&#x27;d need a 3-way mirror to shave it correctly and thoroughly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s been over a month since I bought it and the packaging is long gone, so I&#x27;m sure I won&#x27;t be allowed to return it, but I&#x27;m going to try.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is Better to before hair gets too long</li>
            <li>Doesnt work at all pretty much.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty much just garbage</li>
            <li>But it is a good buy if you want to shave a small area.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairly flexible and have used my old trimmer a few times to do my shaving with much success.</li>
            <li>This product worked effectively twice and then started breaking down.  </li>
            <li>I had to tape down the blade head after 2 years of use after it kept popping off but still is effective.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re of European decent, the chances of this are even greater.  </li>
            <li>Like everyone, I was excited to finally have a product that was able to trim my back.  </li>
            <li>Move it back and forth and it will clean you right up.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy for me to shave his back.    </li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s easy and I don&#x27;t even think about it, I know how to move it around my back in a way that works for me, and I use it maybe once or twice a month.</li>
            <li>I am not sure it would be ideal for anyone with a \\&quot;back sweater\\&quot;</li>
            <li>You can easily reach all areas of your back.  </li>
            <li>Not as easy as they make it look, but sufficient enough.</li>
            <li>For the back it&#x27;s easy to use</li>
            <li>If you have super sensitive skin then it may hurt.</li>
            <li>It is easily reassembled by unscrewing the piece that holds the joint together, replacing the arm, and screwing it back on.</li>
            <li>It does the job pretty well the only thing keeping it from 5 stars is it feels really cheaply made.</li>
            <li>All the flexible angles one can use made it easy to reach all areas of the back.</li>
            <li>And the job the Mangroomer does on my back may not be razor and cream smooth, but it&#x27;s pretty close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got my MANGROOMER yesterday, put in 2 AA batteries, hopped into the bathtub so that hair cleanup would be easy, and proceeded to groom my back.</li>
            <li>After using it, there is visually no hair and the skin is pretty smooth.</li>
            <li>I have thought about buying this for a long time, and finally decided to because of the good price on Amazon.com</li>
            <li>Really good, Batteries last a long time.</li>
            <li>If you drop it, it will certainly break.  </li>
            <li>they are certain that i received a faulty unit and are sending me another to try out.</li>
            <li>a $5 large mirror I bought off Amazon</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unlike certain World Series of Poker players</li>
            <li>For this, I must applaud MANGROOMER, as they certainly have achieved that goal with the MANGROOMER</li>
            <li>this MANGROOMING was going to be quite an effort, for certain.  </li>
            <li>This has certainly met my expectations.</li>
            <li>Be sure to clean the blades for longer life span, Would purchase again; Be sure to watch on sensitive areas where skin is thin, it will cut you.</li>
            <li>I just received my product, and I am so impressed that I felt I needed to immediately try to add a little clarity to the mess of reviews.</li>
            <li>The item is lightweight and easy to maneuver but keep in mind if you are going to shave your back by yourself you really do need a 3 way mirror to see what you are doing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy and I had the whole back done in five minutes.    </li>
            <li>It was easy and took about 15 minutes to do my whole back.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was fast, and I would recommend this product to all that want an easy way to remove unwanted back hair!</li>
            <li>would like to add that that representative from Mangroomer who contacted me after the first unit quit working was very courteous and it appeared they want to stand behind their product.  </li>
            <li>If you have fine hair that&#x27;s not spread thoughout your back, this MIGHT work for you.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re gonna walk around the beach from a distance your back will probably look fine, but it&#x27;s not going to give results of a razor.</li>
            <li>But if you can stand having two day&#x27;s stubble on your back, this is fine.  </li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product if you&#x27;re willing to be patient in learning how to use it correctly and if you do not have a significant amount of hair.</li>
            <li>I was a bit worried that it wouldn&#x27;t get close enough, but it does just fine.</li>
            <li>but my Philips cuts jsut fine except for the short handle.  </li>
            <li>Ah, such a finely crafted instrument.</li>
            <li>This is one of the main products I use in preparation for a modelling shoot!</li>
            <li>I ordered this because I&#x27;ve been growing some fine but very noticeable hair on my back.</li>
            <li>The duct tape holds it really well but gives it a little play room that is nice.</li>
            <li>It works great and inspite of the fact it only lasted a little over 2 years,</li>
            <li>This product shaves the hair down so close and is very easy to get every angle you need.</li>
            <li>He now could groom his back on his own with the help of a large mirror and several industrial sized trash bags.</li>
            <li>Would like better if it open a little bit more.</li>
            <li>I finally can go around not sweating and feel comfortable wherever i go</li>
            <li>Like, really guys?</li>
            <li>very* close.</li>
            <li>This one really worked for me.  </li>
            <li>This thing works very well.  </li>
            <li>Depending on how much you have to remove I would suggest standing in the tub as it does tend to get messy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it works very well now that I have got the hang of it.  </li>
            <li>It pulls the hair with no cutting action despite reviews to the contrary.  </li>
            <li>I glanced at the instructions (not that there&#x27;s much to know about it), popped in a couple batteries, went into the bathroom, took off my shirt, and went to work.</li>
            <li>In about 10 minutes, my back was smooth.</li>
            <li>It was fried, so I threw the whole thing away.    </li>
            <li>Thanks for all the reviews</li>
            <li>Im thinking about attaching a real shaver to this with ductape or something.</li>
            <li>Its an electric shaver for fast close shaving        </li>
            <li>I use this Mangroomer very often.</li>
            <li>you Mangroomer so much.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t felt so comfortable shirtless since I took the third highest fee at the 9th grade poolside bachelor auction.  </li>
            <li>problem with this product is the legal ramifications.  </li>
            <li>Also, the blades cut very close to the skin</li>
            <li>Packaging was a bit much, but I guess that&#x27;s a manufacturer decision.</li>
            <li>, in comparison it&#x27;s much easier to remove and replace batteries as needed.</li>
            <li>So, for now I&#x27;m not going to worry too much about it.    </li>
            <li>This way I can do the back grooming myself which is just fantastic.</li>
            <li>very substandard finishing of product, it seems its a sample.</li>
            <li>The whole thing is made from the cheapest of plastics.</li>
            <li>SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GET YOUR HONEY TO USE A REAL CLIPPER TO REMOVE THE HAIR.</li>
            <li>What I was not expecting was the absolute slice fest that occurred.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer has about as much power as a nose trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Cuts really close, but not (nor did I expect it to) cut as close as a razor blade.  </li>
            <li>You have to gently shave teh area</li>
            <li>I am a hairy beast and it made my back smooth as silk.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend but check the item very well when it is received.    </li>
            <li>The Mangroomer works very well.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think much of this when I tried it though.</li>
            <li>Works very well...</li>
            <li>......shave won&#x27;t be totally smooth like you&#x27;d get with an electric razor on your face, but it does an outstanding job while leaving only minimal and unnoticable to the eye stubble</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t cut hair all that well, but it does leave a lot of welts.      </li>
            <li>Makes it soooo much easier making contact with the skin.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>it makes my life much simplier and keeps me groomed without needing assistance from others.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>It worked very well.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t complain too much because it did what it said it could do.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to be gentle with it.  </li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>My wife really likes when I take care of my body</li>
            <li>you really should consider getting this product.</li>
            <li>Some straight, some curly, but when I was through, there was a pile of hair on the floor to be vacuumed.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;VERY SLOWLY\\&quot; across that area.  </li>
            <li>really ?</li>
            <li>I Had this item over two years now , its very durable .&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not a very close shave, but better than nothing.</li>
            <li>It took me no time at all to figure this out, and a very short time to do my whole back without irritation of any kind.</li>
            <li>I will say this, it was shipped fast.</li>
            <li>In the time I have owned it I have replaced the batteries maybe 3 or 4 times I don&#x27;t really remember.</li>
            <li>but now that I have this it makes it so easy to have a clean back that I am definitely going to make it a part of my routine.</li>
            <li>you reach anywhere without have to go into contortions&lt;br /&gt;Shaves reasonably close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>did not work well, broke on very 1st use.</li>
            <li>I really would like this to work realiably.    </li>
            <li>Although the casing is plastic, it feels very durable and works well.</li>
            <li>takes some time and trials to get used to do it by yourself because of the at-first awkward movement involved so its best if you can have someone else do it for you.</li>
            <li>The biggest drawback was that I really needed the arm to be longer.  </li>
            <li>Your ready to kill yourself.</li>
            <li>I really tried to make this work.</li>
            <li>This really works and I&#x27;m tall (6&#x27;6)</li>
            <li>do you expect stainless steel and a lifetime of use?  </li>
            <li>it gentle on the skin</li>
            <li>I had to remove as much hair as I could with an electric trimmer, and then use the Mangroomer.</li>
            <li>works very well.  </li>
            <li>cant really complain about anything.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re ready to go.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll enjoy a hairless back.</li>
            <li>and it work very well.</li>
            <li>Basically the only way to get smooth skin would be to trim the hair and then have someone shave the area with shaving cream and a razor.</li>
            <li>I assume that, much like an electric razor, if I keep using the MANGROOMER over time the shaves will get closer as my skin adjusts.       </li>
            <li>is that while it is somewhat well-made, it WILL NOT take much abuse.  </li>
            <li>Invest in this and enjoy the glow of knowing you&#x27;ve tamed that shrubbery that grows on your back!</li>
            <li>This works really well.</li>
            <li>Really helped because I have had both shoulders operated on and range of motion limits</li>
            <li>Cleans the back smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Even if it had worked, the quality of construction is very flimsy.  </li>
            <li>It worked very well for me, no pulling or pain.</li>
            <li>I think it would work well for light to moderate hair.</li>
            <li>The on/off switch is flimsy and the overall quality reminded me of a cheap flashlight.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really quite a feat.</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>Used it so much we wore it out</li>
            <li>my back looks (and feels) smooth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;the arm doesn&#x27;t lock very well</li>
            <li>have to really press the button on the arm</li>
            <li>The hinge in my unit is flimsy and doesn&#x27;t hold the angle real well.  </li>
            <li>one thing I&#x27;ll say is that these aren&#x27;t made very well.</li>
            <li>This is a lifesaver haha.</li>
            <li>All of my  back hair is gone and my skin is even smooth.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that could have made this better was if it was more expensive and built better.</li>
            <li>Get one, for real.</li>
            <li>Maybe they&#x27;re trying to go too fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>worked better than expected.   </li>
            <li>bottom line is, for 25 dollars this thing is an absolute steal.</li>
            <li>I could focus on the cheaply made motion restricted handle or the low grade battery contacts.</li>
            <li>This thing really works.</li>
            <li>This razor works very well.</li>
            <li>But, only trimmer head available.  </li>
            <li>and I can say that the Professional model is worth the money.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rechargeable and the blade is much softer on the skin.  </li>
            <li>The nose hair trimmer works very well too.</li>
            <li>Having said that, it performs very well</li>
            <li>Highly recomend!</li>
            <li>I got the package, wasn&#x27;t really looking forward to it.  </li>
            <li>real problem is the blade.</li>
            <li>/&gt;By comparison, the much cheaper Remington BHT-2000 \\&quot;precision\\&quot; trimmer removes even the longest hairs with practically no pain at all.</li>
            <li>I almost dislocated a shoulder in trying, but it does work really well.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting miracles, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting this to really hurt either.    </li>
            <li>This makes life so much easier.</li>
            <li>Cheap and scratches the hell out of your back if you don&#x27;t have the angle correct.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>shipping was fast and thats about it</li>
            <li>This shaver allows men to shave in places, we haven&#x27;t seen (and maybe don&#x27;t really want to see) without a mirror.  </li>
            <li>In hindsight it&#x27;s obvious that a shaver with a handle isn&#x27;t going to give someone &#x27;smooth&#x27; results.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s about it really.  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic back hair removal product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned this since 2006, and while I can&#x27;t say I use it all that much, I can say that I&#x27;ve used it periodically over the years, and it still works.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>It really serves its purpose without having to ask someone for help.</li>
            <li>Works very well, saves a ton of time, and affordable.</li>
            <li>I have to say, it worked very well, did not leave me scratched or scarred.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work very well if at all.</li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>3- sometimes it gets stuck on hair if there&#x27;s too much</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>It shaved close (not quite to the skin, but so close you&#x27;d really have to look close to see any hair).  </li>
            <li>I ended up using a Norelco body groom, which gets very close without irritation.</li>
            <li>let alone to produce it in such a fashion....  sturdy, robust, yet maintaining a sleek metallic look, all despite the cheap plastic and manufacturing methods used in its design.  </li>
            <li>Do-It-Yourself Electric Back Hair Shaver is much more convenient &amp;kinder on the skin than a razor as an &#x27;inbetween&#x27; haircut tool, to trim off encroaching mullet hairs on the back of one&#x27;s neck; it also proved useful on sideburns....</li>
            <li>but it felt  very flimsy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this for about two years, and it works really well.  </li>
            <li>product feels cheap, but it works well enough for the money.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>This really does the job.</li>
            <li>This has really helped me out a ton.</li>
            <li>Really tried to like it, but didn&#x27;t work like I had hoped.</li>
            <li>is no longer very thick.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this situation, the MANGROOMER works real well.</li>
            <li>It just works, simple, a genuis invention, it took me all of five minutes to go from hairy to smooth,</li>
            <li>be careful of the blade… That is the most flimsy piece of plastic and can break</li>
            <li>Thanks MANGROOMER.</li>
            <li>Razorba, however, gives a much closer shave.</li>
            <li>At $25, I expected much more.  </li>
            <li>I really believe I will accidentally break this soon.</li>
            <li>I chose this rating because unlike what some ppl have said this really does work and does so quite well</li>
            <li>Excellent for that behind the back deforestation.  </li>
            <li>I received the M/G faster than expected then put it to the test of mowing the thicket on my back which it did a good job.</li>
            <li>anyone touching my back would feel some soft stubble.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Able to get my whole back (thanks Italian hair genes) - works great but is a bit rough on the skin and can leave some red marks for an hour or so</li>
            <li>My Remington trimmer does a far better job, I can shave my back</li>
            <li>For the shaver to work effectively you need to have the entire head level on your back.  </li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t worry, it goes away on its own after a few minutes.</li>
            <li>I tried razor blades and they effect me negatively, this is a good trimmer.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a wookie-like hairy back, just kind of patchy back hair.  </li>
            <li>For an improvement, an angled head with a soft plastic comb (with rounded teeth) on it could help reduce scratching and possibly allow for a more even cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this does a good job shaving the butt, chest (do not go too close to the nipples), upper thighs (definitely stay clear of the &amp;#34;twig &amp; berries&amp;#34;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This trimmer is very easy to use and the black handle is adjustable for longer lengths.</li>
            <li>I never had any razor burn or itching problems and luckily the hair isn&#x27;t growing back very fast</li>
            <li>I showered right after, dried off, and I was amazed at how good of a job such a cheap and simple product did.</li>
            <li>BUT, I&#x27;ve never been able to shave this easily, and it actually shaves closer than any of my other razors!    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the same probably holds true if your significant other is of the same sex ;-)</li>
            <li>It is easy to maneuver with the long handle and reached everywhere</li>
            <li>I think I was more impressed at first by the ability to actually *reach* my back hair than this thing&#x27;s cutting power.  </li>
            <li>Easily shaves the entire back rather quickly and conveniently.  </li>
            <li>What a brilliantly simple concept that frees you from having to ask your best friend or significant other to get those hard to reach places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Takes a little dexterity at first, and you need to get good at translating what you see in the mirror or mirrors to actual actions that you intended to perform.  </li>
            <li>Like everyone has said, it takes a little getting used to, but it&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
            <li>It allows to reach even the most difficult places very easily as designed.</li>
            <li>We can&#x27;t imagine that any other electric razor would do a better job.    </li>
            <li>I love this product,I would recommend it to anyone who has a major back hair issue !!</li>
            <li>I would recommend trying this electric shaver to anyone before investing more money into other options.</li>
            <li>But it was worth it as it pretty much made it through the summer with moderate growth.  </li>
            <li>There are other products out there that have passed this one by for sure.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical for a while, worried that it&#x27;d be too good to be true, but I&#x27;m very relieved that it works.</li>
            <li>If you have dry or sensitive skin it might be a good idea to use a beard trimmer or one of those smaller battery trimmers if you aren&#x27;t very hairy just in that area, then use this trimmer everywhere else.  </li>
            <li>This is great for me to use on my legs because I can&#x27;t bend down far enough to shave anymore.</li>
            <li>This is very important, as having this device at a 90 angle (for example) makes it possible to reach certain areas in your back.  </li>
            <li>I wish it had a hair catcher because I have to clean the entire bathroom after every use.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t recommend this higher, actually the fact that I felt the need to spend the effort to recommend this, should indicate that I thought that it is worth the recommendation.  </li>
            <li>I managed to get every inch of my back and sides clean shaven.</li>
            <li>I had a clean back and&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gives me a clean, itch-free back without bothering my wife.  </li>
            <li>It was becoming increasingly bothersome to keep my back clear of hair until now.  </li>
            <li>The results were a clean back.</li>
            <li>nick or scratch like trying to clean up with a regular hair trimmer.</li>
            <li>This product is a good idea for an unassisted serious need.  </li>
            <li>my clippers to long sticks and come up with all sorts of ways to shave my own back.</li>
            <li>I have used other Mens grooming shavers from the large global manufacturers who I would think would  have well funded R&amp;D departmant and could come up with the perfect back shaver, but all come up very short from my experience.</li>
            <li>and it worked like a charm taking it down close, not razor close but good enough.  </li>
            <li>(the first time you use it, you have to plug it in for 24 hours before you can use it), this latter version is apparently not sold on Amazon but is sold at all Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond stores, and I think it sells for $10 dollars more there.</li>
            <li>We both agree that $40 is much too high for this product.</li>
            <li>They sent out a new product via FedEx same day free of charge.</li>
            <li>I got scared off of ordering a replacement head because of some of the fit issues people had, but for the money, and my last one hung on for a couple of years, I just grabbed a new one.  </li>
            <li>After all, it really does work (when new) and I see the pro has some much improved features.  </li>
            <li>For the most part I&#x27;m alright with it since it makes it look like I&#x27;m trying to do something about my obscene amount of back hair, but it&#x27;s definitely not for someone who wants a completely clean shaved back.</li>
            <li>Fast and easy with not much of a learning curve.</li>
            <li>I have moderate back hair, it works good, you have to go lightly, like someone lightly scratching your back, you also have to go slow, so go slow and just repeat over the area, if you rush you will not get a good cut.  </li>
            <li>It is bare metal against bare metal, like most shavers, but there is nothing preventing it from grabbing, or rubbing your skin right off your back.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works fine and lasts a long time!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty bummed about buying this product, seeing how badly it works, and not being able to return it!!!  </li>
            <li>only used it once so far but works very well, comfortable, would recommend to others</li>
            <li>That makes it a good purchase.full telescoping handle and went from above, like in the illustration, and that took care of my upper back.</li>
            <li>I found none of the above to be true.</li>
            <li>Cool I got to review this now that I just threw away last week.</li>
            <li>not only helping you to manscape your back, but also other areas of the body: legs, neck, chest...very convenient design and an all-around great product.</li>
            <li>in box says for the first two years if you have any problems with the groomer you can call them for a replacement unit, so trying this out is nearly risk free.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do full upper body shaves every two weeks or so</li>
            <li>Just used this product for the first time and WOW what a product...</li>
            <li>But this little beauty is excellent at getting those hard to reach places.  </li>
            <li>Worked fine initially, but parts of shaving head broke after 4 months  of light use, apparently due to inferior material/construction, rendering  product unuseable.</li>
            <li>It took about 4 times to get it down without many scratches.</li>
            <li>I didnt think that an item that cost so little could possibly work as good as it does.</li>
            <li>It takes a little practice, but if used correctly, the Mangroomer does a good job on my back.  </li>
            <li>Worked just like new, but for the price, shouldn&#x27;t have to use duct tape ANYWHERE on this thing!  </li>
            <li>Tried batteries given and another new set of batteries...no power!</li>
            <li>it was time to get a new one!</li>
            <li>I have (had) a perfect bush of dark, coarse, Italian fur on my back.  </li>
            <li>I read a few reviews on this site and was kinda scared off by how hard it seemed to use but rest assured this is not a PDA it takes two AA batterie (not incuded)s NO assembly and works GREAT!!  </li>
            <li>my back was clean as a brand spanking new chromed out whistle.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased to say it works as advertised - the head is a bit wider than your typical electric trimmer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than duct taping an electric razor to a stick which I tried previously (I know, I know, but it did work, sort of...).  </li>
            <li>Probably works better if you have less hair.</li>
            <li>Even though it irritated a lot, it didn&#x27;t cut, and as I learn how to do the angles better, I will have less irritation.</li>
            <li>quick way to get the unwanted back hair off</li>
            <li>It made quick work of my back and shoulder hair.</li>
            <li>Like a mild back scratcher.</li>
            <li>Battery life was decent.  </li>
            <li>It works only OK and leaves you instead of an all over hairy back, a patchy one instead.  </li>
            <li>So, I purchased this particular mangroomer.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s helping you to be more flexible and shave you back at the same time.</li>
            <li>I should give this product four stars: it works quickly and efficiently at removing back hair.</li>
            <li>Otherwise a decent working product.</li>
            <li>Will definitely remain a loyal customer and would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>Decent product.</li>
            <li>The handle has multiple positions but they don&#x27;t &#x27;lock&#x27; adequately</li>
            <li>The main guidance provided is to shave against the way the hair is growing - the \\&quot;grain\\&quot; of the hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used similar products prior to this one, but have never had as many problems with them.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend it to anyone with mild back hair.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty decent first shot at a product, and I understand why they wouldn&#x27;t have come out with both guns blazing on the initial release with no idea</li>
            <li>After a couple passes I can assure a fairly decent cut.</li>
            <li>Pappy got hair in every imaginable place as he grew older.</li>
            <li>I would also like to see a internal battery rather than the throw aways, I wouldnt mind spending extra money for a better product.</li>
            <li>There are some good points and some weak points.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to loose its position with moderate pressure.      </li>
            <li>It is best to check out your back in the mirror every few weeks or so to keep the forest down.  </li>
            <li>It extends far down your back and it feels good to scratch an itch.</li>
            <li>Highly recommeneded.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>He highly recommends it.</li>
            <li>A high percent of the units are defective.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Still, I highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t expect a high powered tool here.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to any man suffering from \\&quot;bear back.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this item.  </li>
            <li>Greattt product!Will purchase again and highly</li>
            <li>recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wide enough to cover a good sized area at a stroke, but not so wide that it can&#x27;t be effectively negotiated in any areas where my back is not fairly flat.</li>
            <li>Compared to my older and smaller trimmer, I accomplished the task in less time (between 5 and 10 minutes on my first try) and it did a better job and</li>
            <li>If you have back hair and you want a simple, fast and easy to maintain solution that just does the job without any issue then get this sucka.</li>
            <li>It has a large head and extends so far it would probably go around two people.</li>
            <li>It would have gotten a five-star rating had it been built a little more rugged.</li>
            <li>It would have gotten a five-star rating had it been built a little more rugged.</li>
            <li>wow why are you so damm hairy!!</li>
            <li>(although, I knocked it a little bit, and they stopped working, the cover wouldn&#x27;t stay on...took more effort than it should, but</li>
            <li>So, I stood up and the little guy fell and whimpered, but he was okay.</li>
            <li>could be made a little better for the money.</li>
            <li>If you have more than a little (like me), it stunk.  </li>
            <li>I have also gotten a lot more efficient with the shaver with a little practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;18 Month update</li>
            <li>I will get better at it since I know it will take a little bit of practice.  </li>
            <li>but it they could find a way to make it a little more flexible, it would be prefect.  </li>
            <li>This is my second one because my first one was stolen!</li>
            <li>I realize writing a review for a backshaver is somewhat..  odd, but none the less this product is great.  </li>
            <li>Since there is not way to to clean the cutting mechanism, that&#x27;s all it was good for.  </li>
            <li>By all means get it right away, there is no excuse for just letting it grow.</li>
            <li>I tried it with some older batteries then found new batteries.  </li>
            <li>Really flimsy and cheap, not worth what you pay for it.</li>
            <li>First off it wasn&#x27;t clear clear anywhere that this was not rechargeable.  </li>
            <li>Not perfect, but pretty good.</li>
            <li>I tried just using a normal trimmer and razor but that did not work.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve killed many a device in my time, so I&#x27;ll update accordingly.</li>
            <li>Finally, even fresh batteries couldn&#x27;t get it going, so I took it apart to see what I could see.  </li>
            <li>First off, I have to say, there was absolutely ZERO pain involved while shaving my back</li>
            <li>The trimmer is safe to the touch; even when pressed firmly against the tender skin of my forearm did not nick or cut the skin at all.</li>
            <li>Sure there may be a few hairs here or there</li>
            <li>The Mangroomer came in one of those hard-shelled plastic containers, which are always fun to open.</li>
            <li>It reached all angles as advertised, and the clipper was powerful enough.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your time, there are better products on the market.</li>
            <li>the shaver  head is not angled like a normal shaver</li>
            <li>The MANGROOMER is well worth it if you don&#x27;t have someone to trim your back for you.</li>
            <li>I hesitated to buy it because I saw a few reviews that said it did not cut efficiently, but I gave it a shot, and I&#x27;m extremely pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>And for what it&#x27;s worth, I am no slouch when it comes to back hair.  </li>
            <li>I bought 2 and never complained until now.</li>
            <li>just a battery powered clipper with a long bending handle and just like most simple things it works.</li>
            <li>A wider head or a head that can pivot and stay on your back would be useful.</li>
            <li>If you want to get rid of back hair, this is worth EVERY PENNY.</li>
            <li>Shaving your back isn&#x27;t the most romantic thing you can ask your significant other to do.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve ever tried this with a normal clipper, you can appreciate it.  </li>
            <li>that is normal.</li>
            <li>My Mangroomer eats normal batteries from breakfast.    </li>
            <li>Finally, a trimmer that is powerful and a solution to all those hard-to-reach areas.  </li>
            <li>It took a few more passes to get it all off</li>
            <li>On a normal grooming session to get Pappy to beach his friends would need to spend hours helping him.</li>
            <li>This product is good at getting through the thick hair, but I generally have to follow up with a razor to remove stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but alas all good things come to an end.</li>
            <li>I think this is a good idea poorly executed.</li>
            <li>Device is very cheaply made - powered off a single AA battery, I was worried before I ever applied the blade to my back.</li>
            <li>The company does a good job of getting fake purchasers to spread buzz and positive reviews -- but it&#x27;s just hype and clever marketing.  </li>
            <li>However the main drawback is that it&#x27;s very very loud.  </li>
            <li>It does a better job than anything I have done previously!</li>
            <li>The trimmer cuts the hair short enough and as easy as it is to use</li>
            <li>Easy to use and the two double-A batteries required last the entire season.</li>
            <li>use update&lt;br /&gt;Still going strong after 6 uses on my back and on the same set of batteries.</li>
            <li>I liked it, was surprised it didn&#x27;t cut me, but still sharp enough to do the job.</li>
            <li>I just wouldn&#x27;t use it right before you go outside with your shirt off.</li>
            <li>Once I got the right angle on the back</li>
            <li>It does say Do-It-yourself ELECTRIC back hair shaver, right??</li>
            <li>Plus, the hair on my shoulder is becoming thinner and less noticeable since I&#x27;ve stopped shaving it with a blade.</li>
            <li>It is time consuming and does not make a clean pass so multiple passes are needed over the entire skin surface to get a reasonable result.  </li>
            <li>Had one for over 2 years and finally gave out and got a new one right away.</li>
            <li>I started on a small section with up and down strokes and looked in the mirror to see a nice clean area.</li>
            <li>however, it&#x27;s really easy once you have that part down</li>
            <li>It has long flexible extendable/retractable joints which allows you to reach various parts of your own back.</li>
            <li>I have found that with a little practice you can completely avoid this all together; however, I never had any redness that lasted more than 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>I got pretty good at it, but i was getting tired of the process of doing this for my back...</li>
            <li>but they could have spend a little more engineering to make it feel less cheaply made.     </li>
            <li>It would not turn on and yes, I put new batteries in it.  </li>
            <li>The razor still performs like new.</li>
            <li>So I decided to get the new rechargeable shaver.</li>
            <li>Inserted new batteries and it didn&#x27;t even turn on.  </li>
            <li>it becomes something you do not want to live without.</li>
            <li>and it works like new.</li>
            <li>So, I got a new one.  </li>
            <li>For the new one, I&#x27;m going to drill a hole through the handle and run a lanyard through</li>
            <li>I have now tried 3 pair of brand new batteries  and</li>
            <li>I see that there is a new version, but I don&#x27;t know what the difference is.</li>
            <li>Go get some new batteries before using this.</li>
            <li>Since I live on a tropical island i go to the beach a lot.  </li>
            <li>just used my new mangroomer.  </li>
            <li>It soon found a new home in my garbage can.  </li>
            <li>, the Bodygroom Pro does a better overall job and is useful for trimming other than just back</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of awkward trying to get the right angles the first time</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got a huge back, so it takes awhile to groom in between my lats and such, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>I noticed the arm&#x27;s two pieces came slightly apart allowing the hinge to slip out easily.  </li>
            <li>When using just be gentle when trimming your back, the blades work really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very tender skin, and course back hair, and it was absolutely painless.   </li>
            <li>Works great if you are tired of asking wife or girlfriend to groom your back</li>
            <li>It takes almost no pressure at all to &#x27;unlock&#x27; the device, so it&#x27;s really an annoyance, and makes the shaving experience much longer (to constantly re-position the shaver at the correct angle).  </li>
            <li>Cheaply made overall, and on mine the battery door wouldn&#x27;t latch back in place, once removed.    </li>
            <li>It is obviously cheap and while I&#x27;ve had my current mangroomer for a year, it is my second one.</li>
            <li>My back hair REALLY grows fast and when I began and looked in the mirror, I thought</li>
            <li>It easily reached all the spots I needed it to, the whole back, with absolutely no problem.  </li>
            <li>: while this works great on one&#x27;s back and could be used to do some manscaping for clean, sharp lines down below, I would never use this on sensitive areas with loose skin, if you get my drift.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s surprisingly easy to use and there&#x27;s no smell or burn or mess.</li>
            <li>Pretty much any other electronic shaver/body groomer on the market will either be run off AC or have a pretty beefy rechargeable battery, but of course none of those have the handle necessary.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to get the angle of the head just right, and move it slowly.  </li>
            <li>Feels a little cheap, but has not broken on me so far.  </li>
            <li>The long adjustable handle makes it easy to reach all areas of your back.</li>
            <li>I see there&#x27;s now a re-chargeable one out, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s made any better besides not requiring batteries.</li>
            <li>The actual blades and the shaving head is kind of flimsy, maybe it need to have two cutting edges instead of one to make it more robust.</li>
            <li>, the box looks exactly the same</li>
            <li>Otherwise they&#x27;re both exactly the same.</li>
            <li>Considering some of the reviews here of pulling &amp; red marks, I was a bit apprehensive at first, but took the plunge anyway.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was the angle of the shaver to my back</li>
            <li>The first couple of times it left a couple of spots tender</li>
            <li>I got it today and all I can say is WOW!  </li>
            <li>acting like a girl, for god&#x27;s sake - the product does exactly what it claims to do</li>
            <li>It feels pretty flimsy, and is nowhere near as solid as my normal clippers, but boy, it does the job.</li>
            <li>I was able to get it to work but it feels as though it will only last a short amount of time before it breaks.</li>
            <li>First time I ever thought of shaving my back.  </li>
            <li>I had managed to run this razor over my back so many times my skin was red and nearly no back hair had been cut.</li>
            <li>So get someone to help you with the first trimming, and then use this to keep the back hair in check.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>My back is pretty hairy,</li>
            <li>Used this for the first and maybe last time yesterday.  </li>
            <li>But it does a hecka better job than anything I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any pain or red marks the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I take care of my things so it is not dropped or abused and left with other items piled on top of it.</li>
            <li>That being said, it does its job well enough and was pretty inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Yes it will leave some red marks the first time you use it</li>
            <li>:  Works better than any other grooming tool designed for the back that I have tried.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used this product, I had mixed feelings.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, it is a unique and helpful tool.</li>
            <li>The first time you use this thing you&#x27;ll be in pain and it will take over 1 hour to shave that hairy back (if you&#x27;re part simian like myself).  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it cut into my skin and made me actually bleed.  </li>
            <li>It took a bit getting used to, and I have to be careful around my sides and lower back because my skin is more sensitive there.</li>
            <li>I finally had to use it this morning for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It actually worked well, for the first three or four uses, but then the blades seem to develop rounded edges.</li>
            <li>The only disadvantage I can see of this device is that he will be more likely to get skin cancer because his back hair no longer protects him.</li>
            <li>Went to use it for the first time last weekend and it won&#x27;t turn on!</li>
            <li>This is exactly what you need to buy if you want to shave your back.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty close shave and when I look at my back in the mirror afterwards, I can&#x27;t even see any noticeable stubble.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After the first use it is obvious that it doesn&#x27;t need one; blow off the blades and rock and roll.</li>
            <li>I returned my mangroomer and got a full refund from Amazon (minus shipping of course).  </li>
            <li>did* find that it was good for removing a few stray back (&amp; back of shoulder)</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how easily it worked with little effort.</li>
            <li>With a little practice it was easy to use and worked well.</li>
            <li>These most certainly involved massive cost cutting in the materials, production, and wages of the (skilled) employees, all to make it affordable to the likes of people like myself.  </li>
            <li>but with that being said, it&#x27;s the only product out there that allows me to keep my back clean.</li>
            <li>45 minutes and two sets of Energizer batteries later, my back was reasonably clean,</li>
            <li>If you go slow and steady, then the clipper will work better.</li>
            <li>Arrived with a chip in the plastic next to the power switch right out of the box which I was initially concerned about but decided it wasn&#x27;t that much of a problem.</li>
            <li>With this nifty unit I can generally keep nice and trim back there where I previously couldn&#x27;t reach.</li>
            <li>A little hard to get all the spots on my back without twisting and turning the Mangroover, but it did get everywhere, and I have a very hairy back and am a very heavy guy, but was able to do it all myself, which was wonderful.</li>
            <li>I just bought a new one to replace my old one.</li>
            <li>This invention, along with the bamboo backscratcher, completely alleviates the need for a live in girlfriend- and for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>This was also very comfortable to use, it leaves small red marks, but those go away within minutes leaving you looking like a real man instead of a hairy beast.</li>
            <li>This product changed all of that for me and allows for me to get a smooth shave in less than 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, takes a few times to get use to it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak to how well it cleans up really thick hair, or dark hair, but it works great for me.  </li>
            <li>Surprised, but it actually works pretty well.</li>
            <li>kept the receipt in case something happens, read the reviews from other people they are all right on about the quality and usage!</li>
            <li>placing the order I regretted it -- I thought it would be $40 down the drain, but I was happily wrong -- this product is EXCELLENT.</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, having back hair makes me feel positively primate-like.  </li>
            <li>when I unpacked this thing, I was disappointed, it&#x27;s very light and feels like it will break pretty easily.</li>
            <li>Tshirts now stick to my back in a very close, heat-retaining way when it gets hot outside.  </li>
            <li>I can have a silky smooth back all year long!</li>
            <li>The length of the handle is more than long enough to reach every part of my back.</li>
            <li>Not very hard to use, does the job well.</li>
            <li>task that used to take me at least 20 contortion filled minutes and a big mess, now takes me 1/2 the time, is super easy and no mess at all.&lt;br /&gt;Life</li>
            <li>The center of the back, the sides and shoulders were all easy to reach</li>
            <li>my technique is really down just takes me minutes every 2-3 weeks to touch my back up one observation I use the remington blade saver spray to disinfect and lube the blades and this seems to do a great job of preserving the sharpness and cleaning away hair and dead skin.</li>
            <li>Unless, that is, it happens to be the progeny of one of the said moles, in which case it is a striking &#x27;midnight black&#x27; color, coarse, and quite visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The upper back is quite easy to get to, and I use a regular trimmer there.  </li>
            <li>I watched the razor comb the hair on my arm back and forth and not cut a SINGLE hair and the only thing this does for sure</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t remove tiny hairs because the razor head is too large.</li>
            <li>believe I must have received a bad unit, but was pleasantly suprised by the company&#x27;s effort to make things right.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Product feels a little cheap, but the blade makes up for it.  </li>
            <li>The materials are a little cheap though.  </li>
            <li>Feels a little cheap but works well.</li>
            <li>If you are too modest to ask your significant other (or your kids - not!)</li>
            <li>Having been \\&quot;blessed\\&quot; with as much back hair as the furriest of primates, this, why-didn&#x27;t-I-think-of-this-first, device groomed me with remarkable ease and almost no discomfort beyond some general and short-lived irritation - similar to when a women&#x27;s nails would dig in and scrape across my back during my much less furry, collegiate and early marriage years.      </li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t drop it on a hard floor and you should be ok.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately it&#x27;s made super cheap for a forty dollar item; it&#x27;s lightweight and feels just plain cheap!</li>
            <li>I was surprised by how tough and effective this gadget was.</li>
            <li>Easy to reach all places but can be a bit rough at first to your skin, especially if hair is very long.</li>
            <li>This tale begins innocently enough when a young man hit puberty a time most young men receive a gift of a little bit of additional hair at this tender age, but not Pappy.</li>
            <li>I easily did my entire back from my neck down to my top crack in less then 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>The very slight skin abrasion has gone away with subsequent uses as my skin has gotten used to the shaver and it is still a very smooth shave.</li>
            <li>This is probably the most cost effective, and lest painful way to get rid of back hair.  </li>
            <li>the only tell tale sign was the huge red welts a nd slices that appeared on my back.  </li>
            <li>Not a very hairy back, but grew light patches of hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: if you&#x27;ve got a very hairy back and you just want to clear away the bulk of it, then this clipper will work for you.</li>
            <li>You will thank the makers if you have a lot of back hair, like me, cause it took a bit to do the whole thing.</li>
            <li>We were happily surprised and here&#x27;s our review...    </li>
            <li>You have to go over each area repeatedly, to remove the hair completely.  </li>
            <li>I should also say, its loud too.</li>
            <li>I am surprised Amazon is carrying the product again.</li>
            <li>about 10 min to do my whole back and shoulders.</li>
            <li>and i no longer have to wear that natural sweater.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s tricky in that you need two mirrors (a bathroom mirror and hand mirror suffice) and the motions you use don&#x27;t come naturally.</li>
            <li>Any guy who wants to get rid of his back hair needs to get this product.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s the only thing I have found that really works.  </li>
            <li>I actually cringed when I started to use it because there had been so much talk of pain associated with use.</li>
            <li>The second use was much easier..</li>
            <li>I know they make a professional model but have yet to chance and try it.</li>
            <li>What you might not know is that there&#x27;s also a professional version of this</li>
            <li>I TRIED EVERY CONCEIVABLE WAY TO MAKE IT WORK</li>
            <li>and yes... wow... hurts...</li>
            <li>As far as ingrown hairs go, I have never got one in my years of using a razor.</li>
            <li>So if you encounter a problem with your   Mangroomer, you should contact the Mangroomer folks directly [...]</li>
            <li>My only concern is that if I \\&quot;gorilla\\&quot; with too much torque, I&#x27;ll break it.</li>
            <li>It does take several attempts and a bit of getting accustomed to using it, but all-in-all it works very well.</li>
            <li>30 minutes I finally got it, and was very pleased.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This MANGROOMER was a gift; the man who received it had no trouble removing unwanted body hair.</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>The blades are just not moving fast enough.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t completely remove all hair</li>
            <li>Its painless and leaves no rash or in grown hairs.grows back fast though.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your time and money.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made gimicky waste of money.</li>
            <li>but I am surprised it is battery operated, I thought it would be chargeable</li>
            <li>I was very pleasantly surprised how well this product worked.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it about 5 times so far.</li>
            <li>I try and trim my back hair every 1-1.5 weeks, so it wasn&#x27;t too much to cut through - 10 to 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li>The man groomer makes reaching my back so much easier, with zero in grown hairs.  </li>
            <li>I have very scarce back hair, but there is some, and it has always bothered me.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone that wants to have a do-it-yourself soltution to removing back hair.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use it much because it was such a misery.</li>
            <li>, it shaves my whole back with no strain.  </li>
            <li>I shaved my whole back in 5 min.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li>It takes some practice to work out the angles to cover your whole back, but in time it&#x27;s a breeze.</li>
            <li>I took completely apart and could y find any problems.</li>
            <li>My back is very hairy, the ManGroomer took it all off.</li>
            <li>complete unability to shave hair?</li>
            <li>Shaves pretty close for basically being just long handled clippers.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They have several (more expensive) versions of this available</li>
            <li>This back shaver works very well</li>
            <li>Does pull hair if the battery gets too old.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at the ease of using this product.</li>
            <li>have this Wahl shaving kit that I was using before to remove body hair, and this thing just puts it to shame, not even mentioning the fact that it&#x27;s far easier to reach the hair, but it cuts it like it&#x27;s nothing.</li>
            <li>where you put the batteries just completely broke into pieces when i went to change the batteries</li>
            <li>The whole thing - entire length - needs to be in contact with your skin.</li>
            <li>It is made of cheap plastic and falls apart after few uses.  </li>
            <li>and they immediately mailed me a Professional model and the ear/nose hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I contacted the company directly, and they shipped me a replacement, thinking it was faulty.  </li>
            <li>the only con is that this can pull hair if you move fast.</li>
            <li>And initially the shave was very close.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>For areas where you don&#x27;t need the extra length of the fold-out handle, this makes the unit much easier to manuver.  </li>
            <li>right-handed guys will have a much easier time getting to the left side of their backs, and vice versa.  </li>
            <li>and I would recommend this to anyone who wants to get rid of hair on their back.</li>
            <li>and it really cut my back up in the process.</li>
            <li>at least their customer service is top notch</li>
            <li>The arm isn&#x27;t stable in its&#x27; extended position, and almost ends up collapsing completely while it&#x27;s in use.  </li>
            <li>I never knew how much hair I had on my back.  </li>
            <li>am surprised that this doesn&#x27;t mention shaving the neck.  </li>
            <li>I have no trouble using it on my body.  </li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>I discovered parts of back never before known to the modern world.  </li>
            <li>so far, it works.</li>
            <li>product is completely unusable.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>It takes hours, if not days, of training with this instrument in order to learn how to handle it and to become a MANGROOMING professional.  </li>
            <li>it would make life much easier when it came to maintaining my back hair.</li>
            <li>you look at the pictures, notice that the clipper head is nearly perpendicular to the shaft of the device.</li>
            <li>Anyhow on to how this product saved this young mans life.</li>
            <li>Kinda loud</li>
            <li>It also had a very flimsy feel overall.</li>
            <li>We ordered this about a month ago to replace a 4 year old identical product that worked like a charm.</li>
            <li>I also tried to return it and it is marked unreturnable.</li>
            <li>5 minutes later, the job was done very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shaving head rusted completely within about 6 months.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 6&#x27;2&amp;#34; so that&#x27;s a lot of real estate back there for hair to grow on.</li>
            <li>find this product to be far easier to use than my Razorba.</li>
            <li>I ordered it directly from man groomer and it took 10 days to get here.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical since it runs on batteries if it would be powerful enough to be effective, but</li>
            <li>The third time (with fresh batteries) it simply quit halfway through using it.  </li>
            <li>Worth the $25 bucks I spent.</li>
            <li>or even KIND OF thick and coarse.</li>
            <li>In the beginning, I got scratched up a good bit trying to use it, but that&#x27;s because it takes some getting used to the awkwardness of directing this long, telescoping machine up and down your back, especially if you&#x27;re using a mirror for guidance, which throws off your sense of forward/backward/left</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a very thick layer of hair on my back, so I thought a do-it-yourself product such as the Mangroomer might handle my unwanted hair very nicely.    </li>
            <li>It should be designed at an optimal, gentle angle, like regular hair clippers, but the head is at a right angle to my back and doesn&#x27;t shave well and scratches my back</li>
            <li>I used my regular trimmer over the same areas that I could reach and it took the hair right off.      </li>
            <li>He has always had a significant back hair problem and has tried several different trimming products that have all been unsatisfactory.  </li>
            <li>On the other hand there are only so many times you can ask people to help you shave your back, as well.     </li>
            <li>The plastic is incredibly cheap and brittle and would not likely survive a 2-3 foot drop onto anything other than padded carpet.</li>
            <li>The head is wide enough to get a significant area in one swip.  </li>
            <li>This product for me made life very easy to reach the hard areas to get on your back!</li>
            <li>It is a very modest &amp;#34;trimmer&amp;#34; that&#x27;s not super powerful.  </li>
            <li>i ignored the warnings of others and wasted $40--i have not been able to use this product beyond the first 5 minutes of wasted time.</li>
            <li>The Mangroomer is somewhat cheaply made and I did have to snap the case back to together around the blades, but its held up the several times I&#x27;ve used it, no idea of the long term durability though.</li>
            <li>I then used the full telescoping handle and went from above, like in the illustration, and that took care of my upper back.</li>
            <li>So I bought this a few days ago and when it arived I was excited to try it out.</li>
            <li>After a few months I&#x27;m still on the original set I put in which are the newest high-power ones that Duracell makes.</li>
            <li>Also, because I had to keep going over certain spots trying to make sure I got everything, by the time I finished, I had little red welts (temporary) that looked like I had spent some time in an s&amp;m club.</li>
            <li>Every man should buy one of these because seriously - where are your woman&#x27;s hands when she is touching you?</li>
            <li>Trimmer works well, won&#x27;t give you a super close shave, and be careful because it will still cut open sensitive skin areas.</li>
            <li>First you&#x27;ll wash off the cut hairs, &amp; not letting a rug develop is the key to any back shaver.</li>
            <li>You should be aware that the blade is similar to the sideburn trimmers that a hairstylist uses, only wider.  </li>
            <li>The battery life seems to be adequate as I have used it half a dozen times already with no noticeable decrease of power.</li>
            <li>I literally have red welts in the exact width of this thing&#x27;s shaving blade crisscrossing my back.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy if you are a first time back shaver or seasonal back shaver like myself.      </li>
            <li>&quot; the first time, then go back a second time and finish the job.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t use a lot of battery power and does a decent job on my back.</li>
            <li>Guys if you have back hair, do your significant other or family a favor and buy this product.  </li>
            <li>Either first or last position only</li>
            <li>However, I find its main short coming to be the end result.</li>
            <li>With several mowings behind me now, I continue to be very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>They developed a long folding handle which would probably work very well, except that it won&#x27;t hold</li>
            <li>No more back hair for me :)</li>
            <li>You will see some red marks on your back after the first couple uses, but they will vanish in 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li>2ed one ,first one lasted a few years after much use.  </li>
            <li>It will cut your back hair down to the skin to the point that it is not noticeable but you will need to shave to create an upclose smooth look.  </li>
            <li>The power is inconsistent and the razor must not be sharp right out of the packaging, b/c it just didn&#x27;t work efficiently.  </li>
            <li>I would shake it and it would go back to high speed.  </li>
            <li>If you have hair on your back and have been thinking to shave it off, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly Recomend to anyone who&#x27;s gone the NAIR route only to say never again.</li>
            <li>The blade on this starts becoming dull after appx 6 times of using it.  </li>
            <li>I tried 4 different sets of new batteries and still nothing, unit was completely inoperative.     </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these for a couple years now, bought a new one because my old one finally bit the dust.  </li>
            <li>At first the plastic design feels a little flimsy but after using, it&#x27;s pretty solid.</li>
            <li>Yes it is horribly cheap, but for about half the price of a back wax, what do you have to lose?</li>
            <li>It is not super smooth like using a blade, but for me, this is close enough!  </li>
            <li>The handle folds the unit into a shape I can easily store in the below sink cabinet and the result of the shave, though not completely smooth, is that I no longer have what amount to a mat on my back.</li>
            <li>I thought surely this razor would clean up my back pretty well, and I&#x27;m sorry to say I have been let down by this product.  </li>
            <li>If you have a little hair on your back, this is fine.  </li>
            <li>Since it was only $40 plus tax, and I saw mostly positive comments on this site, I&#x27;m asking for a replacement to see if second time is a charm...stay tuned.  </li>
            <li>The real test will be how long this thing lasts.</li>
            <li>Small and light weight.</li>
            <li>I love my husband but never loved his backhair.  </li>
            <li>They have really come a long way.  </li>
            <li>I got this as a partial sincere, partial gag-gift for my younger brother for Christmas.</li>
            <li>Really, not a big deal for me, and probably for most people (does anyone shave their back in front of other people, or while a spouse is sleeping in the same room?).</li>
            <li>The head to the shaver popped off the first time I used it and the telescoping feature is not very sturdy.</li>
            <li>I do wish it were more tighter at the hinge because especially if you are doing it yourself, then you need it to be firm when you work it at your back and not give in to the bending force.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>It was about this time that Pappy was starting to gain weight, very normal for a young man of his age, but for Pappy it was much different.</li>
            <li>This product is very cheaply made and impossible to clean, so I wouldn&#x27;t pay $9.99 if they offered.</li>
            <li>read many of the reviews before purchasing the Mangroomer and many of them mentioned that it will feel a little painful the first time you use it because you&#x27;re not used to how it makes contact with your skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this model works the same, but a part of me feels as if it doesn&#x27;t do the job on the first time like the previous model, the plastic does feel cheap but will last as long as your arent trying to break it on purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it took a couple of days for my skin to calm down. .</li>
            <li>After using this battery powered one, I will definitely make certain any future purchases come with that adapter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now the thing does not work unless you hit it a few times and hold it just the right way and even then it is very prone to starting and stopping.</li>
            <li>This groomer makes reaching the hard to reach areas easy.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer makes it easy to get to those hard to reach places.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s hard to reach quite easy.  </li>
            <li>, my hair did not get  hard as many people suspect in such products.</li>
            <li>Do not worry about sending back the defective unit, due that we do not want you to incur any further costs.&lt;br /&gt;Please feel free to contact us at anytime with anything additional.</li>
            <li>It allows men who live alone or can&#x27;t afford to have their back&#x27;s waxed an option.</li>
            <li>I may modify my rating if they actually follow through with a new one, as she promised.  </li>
            <li>reminiscent of that Don Johnson from Saturday Night Live, or Magnum PI or</li>
            <li>Finally a product for guys who live alone..</li>
            <li>I mailed the product back to the manufacturer and indicated the product was defective and I would like a new Mangroomer.  </li>
            <li>and they said they would ship new one immediately - received it two days later.  </li>
            <li>I hope the designers come out with a new design because I will definitely try it then.</li>
            <li>No, shave for several months than buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>THE KEY IS TO ALWAYS USE A NEW PAIR OF BATTERIES</li>
            <li>i emailed the customer service folks and they almost overnited me a new one with no questions asked the next day!</li>
            <li>He would have to buy a new set about once a month because the hair on his back would wear the motor out.</li>
            <li>i had huge red welts after a few seconds of using the mangroomer.</li>
            <li>It sucks batteries very quickly.</li>
            <li>It gets the job done, easy to use, it sucks that you can&#x27;t just charge it though.</li>
            <li>hair is dark and straight, not thick and curly, which some reviewers said it didnt work</li>
            <li>Overall, it actually leaves you fairly smooth, and it&#x27;s gently enough to use regularly to keep the hair short.</li>
            <li>I have used it once and did receive the nicks and cuts others have mentioned, but considering that you rarely cut your back hair that was to be expected.</li>
            <li>Based on what it does and the few options that men with back hair have available</li>
            <li>The only con is that shaving your back seems easier in the video or pics than it really is even with mirrors.</li>
            <li>It took me about 4 minutes to do my whole back, and I have a forest back there believe me, so that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t understand why some people said it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve rarely purchased an item that works for less than 5 seconds - this is one of them.  </li>
            <li>And finally, be ready for the challenge of doing the side of your back that is the same as the hand</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not fantastic, and your back won&#x27;t look like a baby&#x27;s butt after you&#x27;re done, but it does do an effective job of reducing the amount of visible hair once you learn the proper directions to pull in on various areas of your back.</li>
            <li>The actual clippers are nit fine enough to take the hair down.</li>
            <li>highly recommend the mangroomer back shaver to clear the back 40.  </li>
            <li>It took longer to drag out the vacuum and clean up the bathroom floor than it took to actually do the deed!    </li>
            <li>I was initially hesitant to buy this, fearing a cheaply made product due to the low cost, but I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised at the quality I&#x27;m actually receiving.</li>
            <li>Though I commend the innovative design, the clipper itself is too weak to cut hair.  </li>
            <li>I have one spot on my back where I got hit with a baseball when i was young that grows hair now!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Blades are sharp and cut on the first</li>
            <li>Next, don&#x27;t get hung up on the red splotches that you will see (in the mirror) on your back when you first start using this.</li>
            <li>It is not perfect, but it is lightweight, cuts well when flush against the surface of your skin and more manageable than an electric shaver (or razor - gasp!) taped to a broom handle.</li>
            <li>I read various reviews about this product from various places and that one word kept coming up all the time, \\&quot;smooth\\&quot;, and for all I had my reservations about this &#x27;shaver&#x27; in the first place, I put aside such skepticism and gave it a go</li>
            <li>Holding it as intended (or any other way you can think of) corrects this, so that the blades are exactly perpendicular to your skin.</li>
            <li>The teeth are not sharp and I have to pass it over an area a dozen times to see</li>
            <li>The blades are much too wide and after following all the instructions to a \\&quot;T\\&quot; ended up with a bloodied, nicked and very irritated back.</li>
            <li>I originally wrote a negative review for this product as it took considerable amount of effort to do the job</li>
            <li>I even tried oiling the blades before deciding on this review, thinking maybe they had dried out like many other clippers I have used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m delighted that other customers will see how poor your product and service is.</li>
            <li>His only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t come with any sort of guard in case you wanted to use it in other areas but all in all he was very pleased.</li>
            <li>Whether this is worthwhile for you depends on whether you&#x27;re moderately furry (like me) or have that serious caveman look.  </li>
            <li>Main complaints are that the clippers are really low quality and only work well with hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to get a completely smooth shave...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made of light plastic and is hard to extend fully.  </li>
            <li>It feels cheap to the touch, and there is nothing that covers the blade to keep it from getting dull and dinged between uses.  </li>
            <li>It only makes sense that I would discover this a few months before my laser treatment starts, but if you&#x27;re looking for a quick way to shave your back without asking the new girlfriend to do it for you-</li>
            <li>but patience and a little determination prevailed and my back is finally hair free.</li>
            <li>ha, seriously very little trial and error and without looking I got 60% of it, in the mirror 1/2 looking another 30% and then with detailed attention got the last 10%.  </li>
            <li>Conventional shavers just didn&#x27;t cut it as they didn&#x27;t allow full access to my entire back.</li>
            <li>I read the other reviews that were positive</li>
            <li>The construction is generally flimsy.   </li>
            <li>feels cheaply, made razor is not effective.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m puzzled by some of the negative reviews because this thing is, IMO, a fabulous product.  </li>
            <li>My advice to anyone considering purchasing the Mangroomer is to have your back waxed by a professional.</li>
            <li>If you are self conscious about your back hair, order this now.</li>
            <li>This thing makes you have a complete hairless back.</li>
            <li>Apparently some of these trimmers are defective -   </li>
            <li>I called Mangroomer and apparently got their after hour answer service.  </li>
            <li>Returned immediately; will look for something well-made or will just go back to my au natural state.</li>
            <li>I still believe that a professional waxing is the way to go for those who have never done a thing back there.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the easiest trimmer I have ever used on my back.</li>
            <li>It does reach spots, but it barely trims hair at all and severely scratches skin.  </li>
            <li>I barely even used this item.  </li>
            <li>Was also surprised to find that this item operates on AA batteries instead of a chargable internal battery.</li>
            <li>After having tried darn near everything to shave my back, the Mangroomer has got it!</li>
            <li>Yes it scratched and left marks, but I&#x27;m not too surprised that it did.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s completely  aggravating running it over the same spot over and over and over.</li>
            <li>Only used it once so far</li>
            <li>Not only is my back very hairy, but the hair rubbing against my shirt makes it itch constantly throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>This is a solid investment for anyone who needs to reach areas that have so far been inaccessible.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Batteries last so far about 8 weeks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t remove your hair entirely (like shaving with a razor would), but it does remove nearly all of the hair.</li>
            <li>no regrets.</li>
            <li>and still it barely did anything.</li>
            <li>my only gripe would be that it doesn&#x27;t flex all the way straight to 180 degrees, this is a pretty small</li>
            <li>There is only one drawback, this thing is loud as hell.</li>
            <li>Does not really perform very well.</li>
            <li>handle let you reach nearly everywhere to trim your back.  </li>
            <li>and it barely works - it didn&#x27;t evenly or fully remove the hair.    </li>
            <li>It takes me a couple goes at my back to get it complete void of hair.</li>
            <li>Regardless of my potential scientific or freak-show value, the \\&quot;ManGroomer\\&quot; has thus far proven to be the device I&#x27;ve been seeking.      </li>
            <li>I purchased this one and it has picked up where the old on left off.</li>
            <li>The window to return or replace it has apparently passed.</li>
            <li>Tried to return but apparently, this product has a no return policy...</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re planning on shaving your back for the beach, just make sure you shave at least the day before because your back will have scratch marks from the razor.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t get all the hair on the first pass, but subsequent tries finished the job.</li>
            <li>But as many people say on here, it is poorly constructed.  </li>
            <li>I have a pretty good tolerance for pain and not particularly sensitive skin, but this thing is too painful to try to use.    </li>
            <li>allow me to admit that I had missed this fatal flaw before buying the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reviewers who reported the ManGroomer effective either failed to mention they had help, or were lying about using it alone.</li>
            <li>This does trim it down to the skin, so there is a smooth feeling, how long that last depends on who you are.</li>
            <li>and WOW it trimmed the hedges down to the skin much like</li>
            <li>The hair on my back is very fine, thin, and sparse.  </li>
            <li>Now Pappy was familiar with commercial versions used in barber shops and they could do little to the forest of back hair he had.</li>
            <li>* OK, So, after submitting this review Mangroomer has sent me a message (that&#x27;s different from the reply here where all can see) where they accuse me of \\&quot;making fake positive reviews\\&quot; for a different item on Amazon</li>
            <li>I posted a one star review here noting the short life of the unit and shortly after the Mangroomer company contacted me with an offer to send a new unit in exchange for revising my one star review (they sent, I edited).  </li>
            <li>The only downside (other than the higher price) of the professional version is that when the recharger part of it finally wears out, the instructions tell you don&#x27;t just throw it out, there&#x27;s a circuit board inside that needs to be removed and recycled, but the instructions don&#x27;t say how or even where to go to recycle this part.</li>
            <li>Not too bad but batteries drain quickly and isnt the easiest thing to use&lt;br /&gt;Could be configured to be more sturdy.</li>
            <li>I wish that it cost less, but not having to ask my wife to shave my back before I go swimming is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>For what it&#x27;s worth, I am not super hairy, I would say you would need an initial cut with a beefier trimmer before using this for maintenance.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d urge someone to think long and hard before you purchase this item yourself, you likely won&#x27;t get smooth results if you&#x27;re anything up to average on the hairy scale, but you will get convenience and from a distance it does give my back that smooth appearance, it&#x27;s just a shame that close up</li>
            <li>I guess others have better success, but i&#x27;m not supporting this lame product again.  </li>
            <li>right now wasted money and unusable.</li>
            <li>And i&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just the one i got, the shaver is very cheaply made, it&#x27;s very loose and does not hold it&#x27;s different angles.  </li>
            <li>A little on the light side and there is no way to lock the handle at the middle and that causes&lt;br /&gt;it to open up when you are trying to mow back there.</li>
            <li>You will need to remove the hair some other way first, and then, perhaps, use this as a way to KEEP the hair short.</li>
            <li>Takes some time to get everything if you don&#x27;t have someone to help you, but the good news is, you CAN shave your whole back if you are patient enough, which was impossible prior to this razor!</li>
            <li>In addition, the blade itself is not very wide, so it takes longer to shave than seems practical.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried 2 other shavers to much frustration and 30-45 minute sessions of trying to trim down.&lt;br /&gt;Got</li>
            <li>The shave is comfortable and close, but the blades aren&#x27;t sharp enough to disturb warts or other skin imperfections.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to keep it clean.</li>
            <li>I can finally walk around outside with my shirt off and look like a normal human being.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s hard to overestimate the satisfaction of having a smooth, hairless back.  </li>
            <li>if it breaks, I&#x27;ll definitely be buying a new one same day, might go for the pro model next time</li>
            <li>Only negative is it is so lightweight it feels cheap</li>
            <li>ONLY NEGATIVE IS THAT IT WASN&#x27;T AVAILABLE</li>
            <li>but it was fairly easy to use (not perfect) but worked very well on my back.  </li>
            <li>I was self conscious of the amount of back hair I had and did not want to ask a friend to help shave my back.</li>
            <li>I would definitely suggest this product to anyone who is in the slightest self conscious about their back hair.</li>
            <li>I had no trouble reaching every part of my back and could trim my entire body if I wished.</li>
            <li>I also have virtually no redness/irritation, and I find that I only need to shave once a month to keep my back nearly hairless.</li>
            <li>I would definitely suggest this product to anyone who is in the slightest self conscious about their back hair.  </li>
            <li>I can only use the Mangroomer by holding it with the upper end of the handle, the part near the razor head.</li>
            <li>Tired of having more hair on your back than on your head??</li>
            <li>I am tired of those smelly liquides that just burn you&#x27;re skin... plus how do you get your hands on most of your back...  </li>
            <li>It is good at cutting short hair but longer hair takes a couple of passes.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews, one person took the time to describe the challenge and how to use a fair technique on cutting back hair.  </li>
            <li>Excellent, have always hated back hair, now can get it gone by myself</li>
            <li>I felt like I had been dragged down the road on my back afetr the first use.  </li>
            <li>For the first time, I can do it all myself with little effort.</li>
            <li>For the first time, I can do it all myself with little effort.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little tricky to get used to at first</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve never had anything I&#x27;ve ever bought that you needed to plug in to recharge it to ever give out on me, or at least I have absolutely no memory of that ever happening to me, so I&#x27;m confident I&#x27;ll have the professional version around for quite a long time before that ever happens, if it ever does.</li>
            <li>, it was an odd feeling having my shirt touch my back for the first time in longer than I can remember.  </li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t extend quite as far as I had expected, so reaching some of the most difficult areas of the back (particularly the lower-middle area) can be quite a nuisance.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this product since it is hard to get people to shave your back.</li>
            <li>, I found that the blades cut pretty close and as long as you don&#x27;t press too hard won&#x27;t cause much irritation.</li>
            <li>But, unlike other back shavers, this one really does not lock.  </li>
            <li>: Use sewing machine oil to lubrucate the blade (not any other type of oil), it will then last much longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hears to bare back!</li>
            <li>Basically it barely worked, and it will be going back to Amazon.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does exactly what is announced and on my opinion just a trimming level control is missing.</li>
            <li>My first time the device lasted a few months and then it just died.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I did produce a few scratches but they cleared up in a day.</li>
            <li>It takes a little getting used to the manuevering in a mirror to get the angles right to cover your entire back</li>
            <li>It did leave my back a little scratched up at first</li>
            <li>It is not sharp enough to actually shave anything.  </li>
            <li>Finish was very smooth, I immediately had my wife apply Jojoba Oil to deal with the slight skin abrasion from the groomer, I think I was pushing too hard in the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;Card</li>
            <li>The packaging sucks, and it seems to be made with standard poor production Chinese methods, but the thing works great.</li>
            <li>I could feel my life slipping away after 30 minutes,I then broke the MANGROOMER into pieces just to fit it in the small trash can in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>, basically keeps the grass mowed to a reasonable, much less visible height.</li>
            <li>much confidence shown by the manufacturer in their product.&lt;br /&gt;Just received it and in less than 10 minutes</li>
            <li>I got it around six months ago and it does shave your back, but I generally still walk away with a noticeable amount of back hair.</li>
            <li>He gets wild long hairs on his back and likes to keep them shaved.  </li>
            <li>It left razor burn all over my back because the blade guard is apparently non-existent.  </li>
            <li>Second one I&#x27;ve owned -- misplaced first one in a move.  </li>
            <li>, however, the first few times I used it I ended up with scratches all over my back.</li>
            <li>However, after the failure of two consecutive units in such a relatively short period of time, I think it&#x27;s important to provide this feedback for potential Mangroomer buyers.</li>
            <li>might* work for a few people with a very certain hair type, very flat backs, or something...</li>
            <li>If you hate looking in the mirror in the morning because you feel like Sasquatch is looking back at you, and you have more hair on your back than on your head, this is the device you need; especially if you are in-between &amp;#34;significant others&amp;#34; and there is no one available to use a razor on your back.  </li>
            <li>Works well - makes it easier to reach the hard to reach areas but would be better if there were a slight curve to the handle to make using it even easier</li>
            <li>Previously I strapped my Norelco Bodygroom to a back scratcher with numerous rubber bands, and achieved limited success.</li>
            <li>Out of the box I installed new batteries, after 25 minutes of a complete struggle with this waste of money.</li>
            <li>What is really remarkable about this product is that while it&#x27;s fully capable of shredding your flesh, it has a hard time cutting human hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not super hairy, but I had to do my whole back.</li>
            <li>Just like one previous reviewer said they last for just about a year so whether you buy the rechargeable or this cheaper version don&#x27;t expect there to be much of a difference in the life expectancy.</li>
            <li>Most of your back hair grows down, so that means shaving \\&quot;up\\&quot; by extending the arm on the product and pulling it slowly up your back.  </li>
            <li>i didnt want to deal with the mess of trying to shave my back with a razor and shaving cream, so i felt the mangroomer would be much easier.</li>
            <li>The product performs its function ok (adequate, not great), just did not like the poor quality.  </li>
            <li>and it was too small to hold anything other than cheap razor, so i cut up my back, yuck...</li>
            <li>A little flimsy, but it shaves very close.</li>
            <li>The plastic housing is a bit cheap and I seriously wonder how long it will last.      </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work properly, i was very dissapointed at the product, hair gets stuck between the blades and just cuts a little amount of hair.</li>
            <li>I have medium density back hair and really wanted to do something about it and this little groomer was the solution.</li>
            <li>My back was a little red after I was done, but it went away fast and</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The product works excellent</li>
            <li> I would note that it shaves the best when you use a pushing away from you motion instead of pulling it toward you.  </li>

            <li> This thing is the best!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m seriously so happy I could vomit.  </li>
            <li> Well designed, well constructed, and works great.</li>
            <li> So after reading all of these GREAT reviews I figured I would buy another one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great idea</li>
            <li> It really is great once you master it.</li>

            <li> Great manscaper.</li>
            <li> I used it from neck-to-toe with great ease.  </li>
            <li> this thing literally cuts as close and a razor...keep it oiled and use good batteries and should be good to go!</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> Still, it&#x27;s very very effective</li>
            <li> Still, it&#x27;s very very effective</li>
            <li> This is a very effective product.  </li>
            <li> Doesnt telescope very nicely at all.</li>
            <li> Great, practical, and it is so nice to be groomed!  </li>
            <li> Until something better comes along, this looks like the best thing out there if you want to shave solo.    </li>
            <li> In fairness, I have to start off by saying that I had this product for over a year and used it successfully 15-20 times.  </li>
            <li> Great product, good idea, and design.  </li>
            <li> :) Best of luck to all my hairy-backed friends!</li>
            <li> great product, good deal.</li>
            <li> I was a skeptic, to be sure, but I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I am a hairy guy and the the product is a very welcome tool to make myself more presentable.</li>
            <li> Good luck and happy grooming, my testosterone-rich and folically-blessed brethren.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more than impressed with this razor.</li>
            <li> Nice!</li>
            <li> AND IN PERFECT CONDITION  My son says that it works great and is easily used</li>
            <li> The blade is awesome and I even used it to shave my chest (also very hairy) and it did a great job!  </li>
            <li> To my pleasant surprise it arrived 3 days after I ordered it.  </li>
            <li> It was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this item it does a great job</li>
            <li> but it works perfectly and the hair falls away easily.</li>
            <li> THE GOOD NEWS:  </li>
            <li> The product cleans up the body perfectly and you will find yourself as smooth as a peach.</li>
            <li> That makes it a good purchase.</li>
            <li> The good reviews are correct.  </li>
            <li> But after using it twice, the lightweight helps reduce arm strain, and it didn&#x27;t feel cheap at all, and I&#x27;m impressed with the design.  </li>
            <li> This is a good item</li>
            <li> but it does not cut hair as good as I thought.  </li>
            <li> Once the judge ruled in my favor, the blades did a good job of shredding the nests, but the minced feathers can make you sneeze, so you may want to wear a face</li>
            <li> Good grip/durable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
            <li> It does a good job.</li>
            <li> The shave you get is surprisingly close.  </li>
            <li> it is a good value.  </li>
            <li> Price is good</li>
            <li> It shaved it fairly close.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> I loved</li>
            <li> hey..it has a good reach..</li>
            <li> Good price too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joe Schmoe</li>
            <li> A fair value</li>
            <li> But this thing is so good</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s as good as it got.  </li>
            <li> this product is all about appearance and feeling good about the way</li>
            <li> but it works and has good length to get to all areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All the good reviews here must be made by the Mangroomer folks themselves...</li>
            <li> the Mangroomer does a good job of reaching all those hard-to-reach areas, but once it gets there, WATCH OUT.  </li>
            <li> Good product.  </li>
            <li> Take good care of it</li>
            <li> and you would basically have to be a contortionist to get a good trim</li>
            <li> did&#x27;nt do a good job.</li>
            <li> - as I say, design concept is good.  </li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve got a good start, though, I might give it a try.</li>
            <li> Good product for one year.</li>
            <li> The Groomer gets surprisingly close.</li>
            <li> I initially loved the man groomer.</li>
            <li> loved the man groomer</li>
            <li> Good for reaching spots but doesn&#x27;t give as close of a shave as I would like.</li>
            <li> Good buy for the price.</li>
            <li> Works surprisingly well.  </li>
            <li> It folds away neatly which is good for storage, discretion and traveling.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does a good job, although it does irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li> I used it on my neck and it did a good job.  </li>
            <li> As in, none of them are any good.</li>
            <li> Good lord, what is with these people entering reviews that the MANGROOMER</li>
            <li> Good idea...</li>
            <li> It does good.</li>
            <li> He loved it so he asked me to order one for his buddy.</li>
            <li> We have asked the company to make Pappy one of their sponsored athletes, because the product is that good.</li>
            <li> The product is a good idea, just needs to be improved.</li>
            <li> It does a good job.</li>
            <li> This product works very much good .</li>

            <li> Excellent, Useful and good power for shaving close.  </li>
            <li> The handle designn is indeed a great accomplishment, even though it is made of very cheap plastic and it feels as if it could break at any moment.</li>
            <li> anyway this thing works real good and real fast shipping</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very glad that I bought this item.</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with the close shave it gave me.</li>

            <li> It does it&#x27;s job and makes it easier for my husband to look as great as he does :)</li>
            <li> but it will do a very respectable job.  </li>
            <li> Very cheaply made piece of plastic!</li>
            <li> But for right now very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Amazon sells this at a very reasonable price, and delivery was flawless.  </li>

            <li> You&#x27;ll be amazed at how much better you look!</li>
            <li> And the ladies love it!</li>
            <li> What I do now is attach my cheap Remington foil shaver (about $30 on Amazon and works beautifully.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Reaches most places with ease because of the extending handle and it also cuts well!</li>

            <li> This thing is amazing...</li>
            <li> This product is a great idea, but cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> It did however cut kind of close.</li>
            <li> Note that I said kind of.</li>
            <li> You kind of have to feel where you&#x27;re moving it.</li>
            <li> It kind of feels nice.</li>
            <li> had it for two years till i broke it, it didnt break on its own.</li>
            <li> You can remove the hair in the privacy of your own home, without the need to ask someone to do it for you.</li>
            <li> From design stand point, it is a nice concept</li>
            <li> Battery operated is sufficient, nice design.  </li>
            <li> However, the product support is great and the folks at Manpower will bend over backwards to make sure you are satisfied.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s sooo pleased, so I&#x27;m happy, :), and he&#x27;ll probably be writing his own review too, hehe.&lt;br /&gt;Happy</li>
            <li> Nice to purchase a product that works like it</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that I wish I bought this product sooner.</li>
            <li> Dudes, its just straight up perfect yo.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the way to go to keep yourself trimmed up nicely with minimum fuss and inconvenience.</li>
            <li> best of all it cut very close and cause no irritation at all.  </li>
            <li> Product works good, however the top keeps poping off.</li>
            <li> Good product, I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that it dosen&#x27;t cut into you like a blade</li>
            <li> It does not work, the idea is great and if it had a real razor attached it would be great.</li>
            <li> Requires some care &amp; practice to use effectively without scratching or nicking yourself.</li>
            <li> Make sure you have a couple of good mirrors, though.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled at the result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is nicely balanced, cuts hair without pulling, gives a close shave, and is lightweight.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product.</li>
            <li> He was able to groom without having to ask me to help and that is a good thing.</li>
            <li> I got many many great shaved from it for the price</li>
            <li> Nice handle</li>
            <li> It costs more but has a rubber-like coating that improves your grip, if getting a good grip is a problem.</li>
            <li> This is a handy gadget that will, over time, become part of your routine.  </li>
            <li> Nice and close shave lasts like 2-3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> so it works effectively and efficiently.  </li>
            <li> Suprisingly effective</li>
            <li> And it requires some good hand eye coordination. :)</li>
            <li> It works fairly well and there has been no issues yet but could be constructed better in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> It cuts nice and close, runs on batteries (2 AA)</li>
            <li> what kind of response they might see.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;You&#x27;ve ruined your own lands, you&#x27;ll not ruin mine!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being</li>
            <li> Fully functional and effective.</li>
            <li> It does trim nicely.</li>
            <li> you can the best clean back and best part</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t remove hair completely smooth like you just waxed or use a hair removal cream, but it still does a very very nice job.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the product and the easy ordering process and impressed by the quick delivery time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this purchase worth every penny!</li>

            <li> ( Note to my fair haired counterparts, you guys have it easy.  </li>
            <li> I like that now its more maintained and being able to keep it looking good</li>
            <li> Love love loved it.</li>
            <li> the top part of my arm and his product is absolutely the best product.</li>
            <li> I wanted a product that was easy to use and that would keep my hair trimmed and this one did the job as promised at a good price.</li>
            <li> It has a good design, and was easy to use.</li>
            <li> Lightweight and easy to use, not a shaver but a good trimmer.</li>
            <li> This is a good, easy, painless way to get rid of that hair.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> The plastic used to make it isn&#x27;t very strong.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use</li>
            <li> Very easy to use on the areas needed.</li>
            <li> I find the product very easy to use.</li>
            <li> No feeling self-conscious in a tank top this summer! :)</li>
            <li> Bought our first one about 5 years ago and LOVED it!  </li>
            <li> This is the best option I have seen thus far!</li>
            <li> Perfect grooming tool for an old silverback gorilla like me.</li>
            <li> the mangroomer and have to say it is by far the best on the market.  </li>
            <li> This thing is great, worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Requires batteries, so make sure you have 2 AAs sitting around, otherwise I believe the pro version has a rechargeable battery which is a nice feature.</li>
            <li> I have purchased a number of items for hair removal, this is the best I have used so far when it comes to&lt;br /&gt;reaching</li>
            <li> Okay, guys -- let&#x27;s be honest.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been impressed by how good it looks, and I&#x27;ve been really happy that I&#x27;ve had such good results at a fraction of the cost of a professional treatment.    </li>
            <li> I think you will find this a great tool to have around and worth the price.</li>
            <li> me this is by far the best solution I have seen...</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve now moved on to a Phillips Bodygroom Pro and am very happy with it so far.  </li>
            <li> The shaver is amazing to help get rid of some of that unwanted hair in places where you might not be able to reach.</li>
            <li> It does a good job and the handle extension is very useful.  </li>
            <li> It is a great value and does the job right.</li>
            <li> Works great for one month, then quits working right after the Amazon return policy expires.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this thing unless you have very fine, unnoticeable hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using this thing is so easy!</li>
            <li> Very handy and useful</li>
            <li> Happy to report that after reading some mixed reviews -- this is a great gadget.</li>
            <li> this product helps a lot especially when you are in a hurry and don&#x27;t have the patients  the best of its kind</li>
            <li> The first time I used this, I knew this was a great product.</li>
            <li> This product was great for the first six months.  </li>
            <li> I just used this for the first time though, and it works great.</li>
            <li> Product feels very cheap and flimsy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> but the product is made VERY Cheap...</li>
            <li> Did what it should but was very cheap.</li>
            <li> The item is very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very light in color.</li>
            <li> This thing is VERY cheaply made.</li>
            <li> The product didnt even work and it was very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> It uses 2 AA batteries and is very light weight.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very smooth.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- very cheaply made, feels like it will break any day</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product and it got mostly all of the hair, it&#x27;s just if I wanted a smooth clean feeling I would need to use a razor after I was done with the mangroomer.</li>
            <li> Good power and does what its supposed to quick.</li>
            <li> But over all it is easy to use and the adjustable length handle is handy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy and effective.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and effective.  </li>
            <li> All the positive reviews affirm  that this is a great product.</li>
            <li> The cutter is nice and wide,and it shaves surprisingly close and gets most hair on the first pass.  </li>
            <li> Holy cow, this thing is awesome, shaves pretty much everywhere, doesn&#x27;t get a perfect cut, but it does the bulk of the work amazingly!</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re better off or get your wife to do it</li>
            <li> It really does a great job.</li>
            <li> I have used this 4 times and the more I use it the better and faster</li>
            <li> am really pleased with this product and thank everyone here for helping me make my decision.</li>
            <li> and I used it more than three weeks ago.</li>
            <li> With more practice it will probably go faster and more smoother.     </li>
            <li> so I got it thinking anything would be better than what its been.</li>
            <li> Works ok.</li>
            <li> enjoy!</li>
            <li> The hair you shave off seems attracted to the plastic like static.</li>
            <li> and they seldom lasted more than a year.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for better.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I can quit spending</li>
            <li> While I did run into problems with product, I was able to get a replacement from their customer service department.</li>
            <li> I just love it.</li>
            <li> So until I find a better made alternative I will use this product.</li>
            <li> Using a mirror can be tricky, so for the most part I do it by feel, and check my results periodically.</li>
            <li> Okay, I&#x27;m really pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping and Great delivery.</li>
            <li> and i love the rubber grip.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s it, now you have a razor with an extended handle at the perfect angle for shaving your back.</li>
            <li> It works 10 times better than this product in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve finally tried it out and it seems to work perfectly, with none of the problems I was experiencing before.</li>
            <li> Halfway through, the top part with the razor fell off.  </li>
            <li> It appears the motion of the blades broke off both bottom front anchors that help to hold the top surface on.  </li>
            <li> I taped the top portion on, and was able to finish.  </li>
            <li> If this were a plug-in appliance, it would be much better.</li>
            <li> It has cut me many, many times.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;Another improvement would be to place the head at a better angle</li>
            <li> The quality of this item could be much better.  </li>
            <li> Go to Bed, Bath and Beyond and use their $10 off coupon on purchases of $30 or more.</li>
            <li> OK just used this item, tried the hair remover cream, tried the razor stapped to hanger (myself)</li>
            <li> I think the shaver should have better blades for thicker hair.</li>
            <li> Defective junk, isn&#x27;t much better than a $4.99 microtouch on a stick.</li>
            <li> The best part is the handle obviously</li>
            <li> Love this product ...</li>
            <li> This is your best option for personal</li>
            <li> I am so glad i don&#x60;t have to do that anymore..</li>
            <li> I did get some irritation but most went away after showering.</li>
            <li> This is the reason many (including myself) are complaigning about irritation and the feel of pulled hairs.  </li>
            <li> The profit they must be making off of each one of these must be outstanding, because the money is not going to materials.</li>
            <li> This product CLEARLY is remarkable and does EXACTLY what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> Sincerely,                                                      Jim</li>
            <li> But I was not about to spend $80 or more every three months and decided to give the Mangroomer a shot.  </li>
            <li> I love this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Just ordered another one until I find something better.</li>
            <li> The size of the head trimmer is appropriate for the task and two AA batteries (not included)</li>
            <li> Way better than any alternatives I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> And to top it off, the gave me a free t-shirt!</li>
            <li> I am glad to have the product on the market-</li>
            <li> I just hope they make it better.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, I CAN DO IT MYSELF!</li>
            <li> Ive love it.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Mangroomer\\&quot; allows me to do it myself with the use of mirrors to make sure I did not miss any spots.</li>
            <li> and I was pleased</li>
            <li> I like many others wasn&#x27;t sure about buying this and spending 40 bucks for it.  </li>
            <li> and I feel better.  </li>
            <li> , I wish it were made of a more durable material.  </li>
            <li> So until someone comes up with a better made groomer this might be it.</li>
            <li> but it could be a better product</li>
            <li> If anyone of you have back hair and want it removed by shaving it this is the best product.</li>
            <li> I am able to do it myself about once a month even with 2 torn rotator cuffs in my shoulders.</li>
            <li> This shaver bends around perfectly to get every part of my back.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it, and the fact that I can do my back myslef, is just awesome.  </li>
            <li> My friend Dana, is also extrememly grateful, as it used to be her job to do this...&#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Both Mangroomer and Amazon were very helpful and provided great customer service.      </li>
            <li> Found it works better to go by feel than look in the mirror.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li> but he says he satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> and it would be more durable.</li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why they couldn&#x27;t have used a more sophisticated and better-designed razor, the one that&#x27;s</li>
            <li> sincerely apologize for the problems you are having with your shaver.</li>
            <li> We would like to provide you with a replacement at once as you should never have had any problems with your shaver and it is our responsibility to be sure you are always 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li> Your satisfaction with our product is our top priority.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you and kindest regards,&lt;br /&gt;The MANGROOMER Team&lt;</li>
            <li> I would recommend you try the product even if it didn&#x27;t work for me, given that the most you will lose is shipping.  </li>
            <li> It worked even better than I had anticipated.</li>
            <li> (One wax treatment I had done before cost me more).</li>
            <li> I was most worried about (the somewhat flimsy feeling plastic shell).</li>
            <li> Wish I could have gotten more for what I paid for.</li>
            <li> and i realize there is a better version out now</li>
            <li> I wold like to tell you this works great,but I can&#x27;t My first Mangroomer worked ok at best at first.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way better than the 15 plus years of frustration leading up to when I found the mangroomer...</li>
            <li> Most people you would ask to do this job will not volunteer to do it so this device provides an alternative.</li>
            <li> All in all this is an innovative device.  </li>
            <li> For this money, they should be able to deliver a top notch</li>
            <li> TOP POINTS for that</li>
            <li> Norelco is much, much better product.  </li>
            <li> Worked ok for about 10 seconds</li>
            <li> OK,</li>
            <li> (note to MANGROOMER - higher quality blades would be nice!).  </li>
            <li> The handle is ingenious.  </li>
            <li> There was a bit of stubble, but nothing you could see from more than 3 feet away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m somewhere between a 6-7 on a scale of 1-10, I&#x27;ve seen guys more hairy than me.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m thinking ok this has got some power</li>
            <li> I would spend your money on a better trimmer.</li>
            <li> If they would make one with a stronger motor and it plugged into the wall it would be a better product</li>
            <li> He handles it himself, and now it is smooth sailing!  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> This product is an excellent solution to an embarrassing problem, back hair!</li>
            <li> The telescoping plastic arm rattles around more, the more you extend it.   </li>
            <li> Glad I got it</li>
            <li> Im sure if you drop it... it will break...</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li> I have gotten much better values from Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> innovative design?</li>
            <li> I wanted to give the Mangroomer 1 more chance</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like $10 more</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than hacking up furballs.</li>
            <li> and if this one continues to work, I might invest in a better version.  </li>
            <li> i walked away with more than one scratch marks on my shoulders</li>
            <li> have used it for about 8 weeks now without issue, I am glad i went with this one and not the rechargeable version.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t come with any assorted guards and the blades don&#x27;t adjust but for getting rid of back hair, the setup it perfect as is.</li>
            <li> Buy at own risk but if you want to be perfectly smooth in terms of body hair, you should probably go with a wax.</li>
            <li> While it folds up nicely into a compact size, it does look fairly cheap.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Then I gave it a try and thought a disposable razor would be much more efficient.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> The design is better than anything I&#x27;ve used and my wife doesn&#x27;t have to help anymore.</li>
            <li> in all - it could not be better.</li>
            <li> I have been able to get this to stay with an epoxy treatment.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> but you will need to shave more often because it is not a close shave.</li>
            <li> A genius created a gadget that solves SO many manly problems.  </li>
            <li> Anyone thinking about purchasing this as a gift or for themselves don&#x27;t think twice, you&#x27;ll be glad you bought it.</li>
            <li> Husband is pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> Worked ok (the product itself does have the \\&quot;Made in</li>
            <li> so you will have to shave slightly more often.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been generally satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> Best product I&#x27;ve found for do-it-yourself back hair removal.  </li>
            <li> Ok, so it pulls some hair.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve got more hair than just fuzz.</li>
            <li> I use my webcam and laptop to see how I&#x27;m doing or have done with this product :)</li>
            <li> But for the price that&#x27;s okay, I suppose.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Putting some clippers on a stick is not what I&#x27;d call an engineering feat and in fact, I but you could make a better one with a stick and some duct tape...</li>
            <li> Battery use makes it more portable and easier to manuver.</li>
            <li> or I&#x27;m sure it will crack.  </li>
            <li> Joint in handle could have a greater range of motion, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> and I love still love it.</li>
            <li> but if you have to this looks and feels cheap as well and now that i warned you, you are on your own.</li>
            <li> I will gladly recommend this product to any man with hair on their backs.</li>
            <li> The word &#x27;smooth&#x27; isn&#x27;t the word I&#x27;d use to describe it, the shaver itself also does feel kind of flimsy from a build quality</li>
            <li> Static on the plastic handle collects clipped hair.  </li>
            <li> I used it on my arms, legs, feet, back, stomach, chest, its great for everywhere and doesn&#x27;t hurt one bit!</li>
            <li> have purchased the pro version of this item to see if it&#x27;s any better.  </li>
            <li> I have never had problems with Amazon before, but will make sure I check the return policy before buying something like this again.</li>
            <li> IM SO SEXY</li>
            <li> Be sure to pick up 2 AA batteries.</li>
            <li> Definitely glad I purchased this,</li>
            <li> As I get better at it I think it would not take longer than 6 or 7 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I am better off with a razor.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great design.</li>
            <li> It does help to be in front of a mirror to be able to see what you are doing.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> So the angle works wonderfully for my mans back.</li>
            <li> He uses it and is satisfied with the quality of shave</li>
            <li> Ive found the holy grail, this is the next best invention after fire.  </li>
            <li> the blade is way too close to the skin and makes it look like you made love with a wolverine when you&#x27;re done, then you go to take a shower</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s the most excruciating shower you&#x27;ll probably ever have.    </li>
            <li> (sure I have some, but I&#x27;m not sasquatch) seemed to also take a layer of skin with it...</li>
            <li> but that was not my intention, nor do i feel it will be the intention of most of you.</li>
            <li> There seemed to be more pulling then clipping</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> but I am hairier then most men.</li>
            <li> Mangroomer, understandably, wanted to make sure I wasn&#x27;t using the device improperly.  </li>
            <li> Thank goodness.:)</li>
            <li> Update: Keeping the hair shorter lets the unit work much better.  </li>
            <li> and I was able to dispose of the unwanted hair on my back.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> If that is not a horrible disease I do not know what is.</li>
            <li> But since getting the knack of using it, the results have been more than satisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the cheaper FYI shaver had a better blade, but they don&#x27;t make them anymore.  </li>
            <li> it would be even better if the blades would trim easier.</li>
            <li> overall a good product, the trimmers work great for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m totally satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t get more than a year.</li>
            <li> So glad I came across it online.</li>
            <li> A well groomed body is just more appealing.  </li>
            <li> The blades are set up in a way that will not harm you, unlike many trimmers not specifically designed for this purpose.</li>
            <li> Not as close as I would like, but better than others.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s better to buy it here online.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ll go away in a day and best of all your back will have no hair anyway.</li>
            <li> I got it, used it and love it.  </li>
            <li> Makes him feel more confident without his shirt.  </li>
            <li> It seems like a good product, but it doesn&#x27;t work right.  </li>
            <li> I really needed this!!!!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to put it to use when it was delivered.</li>
            <li> I was given this as a gift, and was very excited...</li>
            <li> Over 6 years - I&#x27;ve used this shaver every 6 - 8 weeks (more often in summer - shirtless weather) for over 6 years, and I thought I should update my original review: NO problems!  </li>
            <li> (I made sure good batteries were in it first).</li>
            <li> This is the most impressive product design I have seen in a long time.  </li>
            <li> He was becoming more and more withdrawn, until one his friends recommended this product.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to order the mangroomer, it seemed like the perfect solution to a long time problem.  </li>
            <li> Very clean and smoothing.  </li>
            <li> I took a chance on this, and have to say it worked pretty good.</li>
            <li> For all others it&#x27;s a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li> $5 a session compared to what waxing costs is still a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li> Pretty good considering design/ergonomic difficulties with product like this.</li>
            <li> Worked pretty good but stopped shaving?</li>
            <li> Does a pretty good job.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s pretty good</li>
            <li> but you can do a pretty good job without even looking in a mirrior.</li>
            <li> Some attention should also be given to protecting skin from carving, but as for closeness it&#x27;s a pretty darned good shave.</li>
            <li> good news is that Mangroomer appears to really want to make sure their customers are satisfied.  </li>
            <li> Works pretty good.</li>
            <li> Correspondence with the company was quick, courteous, and generous.</li>
            <li> Love it ...very easy to use and keeps me well groomed....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did, it&#x27;s easy to operate and works well.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he was happy he could take care of his back on his own.</li>
            <li> It worked PERFECTLY well and much better than expected.</li>
            <li> It would be more user friendly if it had more than one head, a trimmer head and a shaver head.  </li>
            <li> Batteries last very good.</li>
            <li> but, my unit works fine and cuts good- actually too good..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not going to give you 100% smooth results but does a pretty good job once you get used to it.</li>
            <li> : It feels cheap as it is made of mostly plastic.</li>
            <li> They were more noticeable in a nice hot shower.  </li>
            <li> However, this thing is one of the most cheaply constructed, flimsy products I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Nice design that would be better with higher quality materials</li>
            <li> So far this is the one, Great improvements, check it out even if you don&#x27;t think you would use it that often I would recommend[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to say that I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> The BG2020 is more comfortable and the razor probably shaves a bit closer.  </li>
            <li> My husband is 6&#x27;2\\&quot; and also not very flexible, so this groomer has a perfect reach for him.  </li>
            <li> My first Mangroomer seemed to have been effective over 2 years, or more.</li>
            <li> So simple, yet so brilliant.  </li>
            <li> Great reaching capability, feels soft on the skin.</li>
            <li> These newer models are significantly better in terms of their capability to cut smoothly and without nicking or grabing you skin.  </li>
            <li> so i may review in better light after i try the replacement.</li>
            <li> It takes AA batteries, so if for some bizarre reason you wanted one, this would be the better buy over the costlier rechargeable version.</li>
            <li> The handle works great to reach areas, the shaver itself is complete garbage.</li>
            <li> I really could not belive how good a job that this product delivered.</li>
            <li> For all the adjustable handle is good and it folds away neatly for your convenience, the end result is really what I was looking for when I bought this item, and it just didn&#x27;t deliver what I was lead to hope it</li>
            <li> This product sort of threw me for a loop because of all the good reviews it got.&lt;br /&gt;Right out of the box it felt very flimsy.</li>
            <li> it fired right up!!  </li>
            <li> I originally had an issue with this product, however when I talked to the customer service about it they were more than helpful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not interested in paying for waxing, or the bumps that show up afterward, so this product is perfect.</li>
            <li> I love this little awesome shaver.</li>
            <li> Other than that, really great product!</li>
            <li> works great, easy to use and does a great job reaching those hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> It easily takes off hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> me just say this thing is a great product, I was able to easily reach all my back hair.</li>
            <li> I was releived that it was so easy to make this change.</li>
            <li> it should be easy to groom yourself.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another last warning; if you fly with your mangroomer, make sure you take the batteries out before you check your bag.  </li>
            <li> its really easy to use</li>
            <li> The battery cover falls off easily and when it doesn&#x27;t, hair trimmings enter the battery compartment.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the most effective whole body shaver I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It is just that easy.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be pleased at how great your back feels.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and saves you a lot of money and pain.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Did the job easily.</li>
            <li> This shaver is easy and painless.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, just takes a time or two to get the feel.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It works and it&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The Mangrommer worked flawlessy and easily reach any area...  </li>
            <li> (On a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the hairiest, I&#x27;m easily a 7).</li>
            <li> It is constructed out of flimsy plastic and it looks and feels like it could break quite easily.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to use and got the job done.  </li>
            <li> Not as clean of a job as waxing but substantially easier and more convenient.</li>
            <li> It is easy to get to the &amp;#34;hard to get [laces&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Because I also have the rechargeable model, I have removed the folding part of the handle, (an easy job).</li>
            <li> yes, the mangroomer is not a sturdy product, and if you drop it, it probably will break easily.</li>
            <li> When I got the Mangroomer, it was easy to put the batteries in and easy to figure out how to use it.</li>
            <li> Another plus is that it reaches all areas fairly easily.  </li>
            <li> Easy do it yourself item.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t fold easy.  </li>
            <li> The handle enables easy reach to all locations.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was as easy as one, two and three.</li>
            <li> The product itself is easy to use and</li>
            <li> Does the job, easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Reaching every spot was easy and I gathered the shaved hair from the bottom of the tub so the drain won&#x27;t clog.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is easily the poorest quality item I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> and they are still going strong.</li>
            <li> strongly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> but it is handy and the adjustability of the handle is good though it feels fragile.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> of fair skin, I have a rather decent amount of moles.  </li>
            <li> Its compact, very easy to use and is quite powerful.  </li>
            <li> Nothing really special about it, but I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> and I must say Im suprised it cleans it up pretty nicely.</li>
            <li> but I gets easy quick!</li>
            <li> Handy and efficient, does exactly what it describes.</li>
            <li> These last for years, give a nice close shave, and are by far the best option I have found.</li>
            <li> Save the $40 for something more exciting and useful like a waxing!!</li>
            <li> Hands down the best thing I&#x27;ve EVER purchased.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so quick and easy to use compared to anything else I&#x27;ve been able to think of or that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Not that impressed with product at first... but fired it up, easily trimmed my back............</li>
            <li> You need good, new batteries</li>
            <li> The handle piece works fine, although it seems a tad flimsy.  </li>
            <li> Mine works fine.  </li>
            <li> But this is fine for maitenance.</li>
            <li> and it is light weight for easy handling.</li>
            <li> For me, about once per month works fine.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll do fine.</li>
            <li> and it worked perfectly fine out of the box.</li>
            <li> Maybe I should have read the fine print on that one, so it&#x27;s on me.</li>
            <li> you will be fine.  </li>
            <li> Light and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> Once I got sort of the hang of it, it was fine.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re fine.  </li>
            <li> Fine....</li>
            <li> Its light and easy to use...</li>
            <li> if i had some peach fuzz on my arms, this would probably be fine, but i&#x27;m a man.</li>
            <li> It cuts great pretty much every</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an easy 5 minute task once a week to keep smooth.</li>
            <li> I just tried it out, and it works fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also light and easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li> It started to work just fine</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this trimmer and it worked wonderfully the first time I tried.  </li>
            <li> Works great, AND you kind of get your own back scratching that is better than those bamboo back scratching sticks ...</li>
            <li> I use it bi-weekly and it&#x27;s holding up fine.</li>
            <li> I found this product more than adequate.</li>
            <li> It did not give a close shave and it clogged up quickly!  </li>
            <li> Cricks the neck a little, but that&#x27;s what a nice hot shower afterwards is for :D</li>
            <li> I found that slow and easy, and with a very light pressure works best.  </li>
            <li> Very useful, easy to use once you get the hang of looking in the mirror.</li>
            <li> This shaver is great for removing back hair easily.</li>
            <li> Also worth note, is the weight of the product - very light, and the reach and flexibility it gives you with one hand.</li>
            <li> It is battery operated and cheap plastic, but it works fine.</li>
            <li> I just used this unique back shaver for the first time and I am impressed.</li>
            <li> I was a little dubious about this product but it did the job perfectly.</li>
            <li> Battery life is great, very very safe and efficient, blades needed no maintenance, only cleaning after use, very ergonomic (being an Industrial Engineer, I have some idea of Ergonomics), user friendly and prefectly priced as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does take a little while to get use to tilting the head correctly to shave the hair effectively, but once you get the hang of it, it works great.     </li>
            <li> is very cheaply built,the handle cracked the first time I used it so it is now taped.is fairly easy to use but for the money I think it was over priced.....</li>
            <li> It felt great to be back hair free with just a 5 min shave.</li>
            <li> It seems people are only happy with it for light touch ups.  </li>
            <li> The mangroomer looks like a great idea, and it is contructed well enough, though it seems a bit light, however, I found it to be well made.  </li>
            <li> This is a great way to get a smooth feel to the area you want to rid hair from if using an actual razor blade won&#x27;t work for you.</li>
            <li> cheap product casing.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that should be in the hygine aisle of every big box store.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for the man with an overly hairy back.  </li>
            <li> The quality does seem a bit cheap, so I&#x27;ll see how well it holds up after time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product is light and made out of plastic but don&#x27;t let that fool you.</li>
            <li> The Mangroomer do it yourself electric back hair shaver is truly a great invention.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t put in words how happy I am to remove my back hair!!!!</li>
            <li> He has a light growth all over those areas</li>
            <li> If you have light hair...</li>
            <li> Finally...some reviews indicate that this item is lightweight and cheap...</li>
            <li> which is important...</li>
            <li> The important thing to do is to relax and take your time.</li>
            <li> The important thing to do is to relax and take your time.</li>
            <li> Sometimes, I could get it going by push-starting the blade with a pencil or something, but mostly it wanted fresh batteries to get going.      </li>
            <li> They also provide a free ear and nose trimmer.</li>
            <li> It is cheaply constructed, which is concerning.</li>
            <li> Although for the money it is cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> Since ive been using the mangroomer I can walk into the gym proud with no guilt and embarrassment of no longer having a hairy back.</li>
            <li> This version that&#x27;s available on Amazon is battery-operated.</li>
            <li> it just feels so cheap.......</li>
            <li> If you have a hairy back this will help you out greatly.</li>
            <li> It gives close non-irritating shaves and is easy to clean and use.  </li>
            <li> Ever since I got this groomer, my back, neck and shoulders look great.  </li>
            <li> The idea is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Either way, this thing isn&#x27;t going to give you that calendar-boy smooth torso.</li>
            <li> This is built out of cheap plastic.  </li>
            <li> This thing uses two double-A batteries and is extremely light.  </li>
            <li> The unit is cheaply constructed, as others have pointed out, and for that I give it 4 out of 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t fit....    </li>
            <li> Although some reviewers find it cheaply made, for the price</li>
            <li> Some may not like the light design</li>
            <li> If you need a cheap solution this will work, but I was somewhat dissapointed.</li>
            <li> It seems cheaply made, for the price paid.  </li>
            <li> It&#x60;s light weight and folds compact to fit in a bag for travel or to keep in a drawer.</li>
            <li> I bought this 2 years ago and until recently has worked great.</li>
            <li> This device works as advertised and provides a close and comfortable trimming.</li>
            <li> My back feels great,</li>
            <li> Unlike the trimmer from the same company, this trims/shaves to the skin so in essence it does a great job at that.  </li>
            <li> If you order one and have pain, send it back and try again; when it works, it works great.</li>
            <li> Just by handling it you would notice how cheap it is.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cheap construction.</li>
            <li> This product is well made and did a great job at getting rid of my back hair.</li>
            <li> I have light colored fine/soft hair.</li>
            <li> yes it feels cheap</li>
            <li> I was prepared for the quality to feel cheap, but so is the performance.</li>
            <li> Unit feels cheap, but the bottom line is it does the job.</li>
            <li> So I was amazed at the close, smooth results.</li>
            <li> It is an awfully light trimmer</li>
            <li> This unit works, but primarily for maintenance.</li>
            <li> If you have a \\&quot;pelt\\&quot; it will not work well as the primary treatment.</li>
            <li> It is cheaply made and does not work.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The shaver head snaps off easily, and a clean paint brush can sweep away any hair that accumulates in the mechanism.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product that needs to go through a second generation refinement.   </li>
            <li> Fresh batteries make it work more efficiently.</li>
            <li> cheap construction?</li>
            <li> It is comfortable to use and well designed.</li>
            <li> you feel how cheaply made it is.</li>
            <li> Simply fabulous does everything it promises.</li>
            <li> It feels light in hand but not flimsy.</li>
            <li> Avoid at all cost and furthermore extremely cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I thought the mangroomer would be a great thing for my husband&#x27;s hairy back, however, once he tried it, I changed my mind!  </li>
            <li> But overall it works great.</li>
            <li> after it looks fantastic.</li>
            <li> Takes a while to get used to using it in a mirror or by feel but gives a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> the head replacement cost $10, thats cheap.</li>
            <li> so I contacted the manufacturer and they promised to send a replacement Mangroomer and also a ear and nose hair trimmer all free of charge.  </li>
            <li> This does a great job of scraping the barnacles off of your back and makes a great motorized back scratcher too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s make up is kinda cheap, but it does what I need it to do.</li>
            <li> Its made of cheap plastic and leaves a lot of stubble.</li>
            <li> The extender does a great job getting to the lowest part of my back</li>
            <li> /&gt;Prompt delivery, delivered in NJ 3 days after placing order via free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> More economical then going to get waxed and doesn&#x27;t leave ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> It is also supper light.</li>
            <li> Not only works for the guys but makes the ladies happy too</li>
            <li> The components used to make these seem incredibly cheap.  </li>
            <li> This thing is rather cheap and doesn&#x27;t work that well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a great deal of back hair</li>
            <li> i am still at this day amazed what made me buy this cheap piece of plastic.</li>
            <li> Overall a great idea.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s cheap)</li>
            <li> I found item to be light weight but not flimsy.</li>
            <li> It does a great job, cuts close, never jams up, and gets every spot on your back with ease!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s horribly cheap plastic, like something you&#x27;d buy at a flea market...</li>
            <li> It does not \\&quot;shave\\&quot; nor does it leave your skin smooth without trace of hair.</li>
            <li> and the foil shaver makes everything smooth.    </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m smooth.</li>
            <li> Since I was so happy with it, I didn&#x27;t hesitate to buy the same item again on June 30th, 2012.  </li>
            <li> recommend!!Cuts smooth without any problems.</li>
            <li> u do it by your self pain free.</li>
            <li> The product itself is a bit cheap feeling</li>
            <li> They also sent a free gift for my trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But for the stated purpose, this is an indispensable grooming device to get rid of unwanted body hair.</li>
            <li> This groomer is fantastic.</li>
            <li> , if you need your back scratched, you can use it without turning it on, and it works great.</li>
            <li> Great back shaver!!</li>
            <li> I will say that it does not get you perfectly smooth, and</li>
            <li> this cheap but for the money it works, just invest in some rechargeable batteries.</li>
            <li> If having no hair is important to you, I recommend getting both - you&#x27;ll need the Mangroomer to get rid of the bulk of your hair, then the Razorba to shave the rest</li>
            <li> have mentioned that the quality of build and plastic feel cheap; I disagree.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- cuts smooth</li>
            <li> The angle is GREAT for reaching your back.  </li>
            <li> Not the hairiest but more than a fair amount of animal pelt grows on my back.  </li>
            <li> I have a Norelco beard trimmer that is far superior.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much for making such a GREAT product!!</li>
            <li> basic design concept is excellent - this design concept would really work if were executed well.  </li>
            <li> Working good so far.</li>
            <li> Still learning to master it, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> I actually gave it as a &amp;#34;gag gift&amp;#34; and found out that he really thought it a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> My best personal grooming gadget so far!!!</li>
            <li> Works great to keep a clean smooth back or chest.</li>
            <li> this is perfect foe the man who wants to keep a clean back .  </li>
            <li> Great product for the guy who like to keep him self looking clean cut for the lady&#x27;s of the guys.works way better than I had expected.</li>
            <li> Holidays &amp; Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> Thanks Mangroomer!!!</li>
            <li> Very useful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a couple of years now and find it so very useful.</li>
            <li> This works great and leaves your back clean.</li>
            <li> improve this product they need to make a more powerful trimmer preferably with removable heads so that it will be easier to clean and maintain.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are a man looking to get hair off of your body, particularly your back, this is superb product to help keep you groom.</li>
            <li> My first impression on opening up the packaging is that this thing is very cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> So easy and quick    Bravo</li>
            <li> This thing works quickly and easily and got rid of my cave-man look in about 3 minutes.  </li>
            <li> This is a quick and effortless solution that is as easy as buzzing your whiskers.  </li>
            <li> This product does a decent job and it comes in handy with the handle.  </li>
            <li> The Man Groomer is the best back shave I have tried and will order a new one if and when this one dies.</li>
            <li> The good news was about half of my hair was effectively, permanently removed</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time and going through a divorce it disappeared  happy to see the wife go</li>
            <li> I would purchase another one, even at a higher price if it were made better.</li>
            <li> Folds and fits perfect in a small place.</li>
            <li> Admittedly, that is what i was excited about too.</li>
            <li> and I must say - it is worth the money!  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m pretty sure they are from user error and will go away.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant dulling of the blades.  </li>
            <li> Original review</li>
            <li> Within 10 minutes of my first attempt at using this my back was gorgeous!  </li>
            <li> The frustration it creates alone would make it worth paying for laser treatment!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> May even take it on a date, I love it so much!</li>
            <li> Well worth the price!  </li>
            <li> Returning the original defective one was a breeze.  </li>
            <li> Please email us your original Order # and mailing address at once.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> so far I&#x27;ve been very pleased with how well it cuts and the area it covers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty fat and this can still reach most the places.</li>
            <li> its worth it!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how long it lasts, but for now, I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Purchased mangroomer quite a while ago&amp; it has not disappointed</li>
            <li> The battery life isn&#x27;t so great anymore, but it still lasts long enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Xmas came, my bro was so excited to use this</li>
            <li> , I worked on it, did it right before I went in the shower, it took about 15 minutes to really get it all shaven, and my back looked awesome!!</li>
            <li> The blades were sharp and di a great job very quickly</li>
            <li> I used to own the original Mangroomer from ten or more years ago.  </li>
            <li> The electric razor cuts hair cleanly at every angle I tried.</li>
            <li> But will get a clean shave .</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave cleanly and it snags and pulls hairs.</li>
            <li> Gets a clean shave</li>
            <li> However, there is either a huge difference in quality between what they used to produce and what they are producing today, or I was just extremely lucky with the device I bought in 2007.</li>
            <li> It will not shave you as cleanly as a razor with foam</li>
            <li> Clean and close shave.</li>
            <li> course, in this case the logical thing to do is simply return it for a replacement (if you don&#x27;t object to an item whose construction materials would need a significant upgrade to approach the quality of a cheap Happy Meal toy) or a refund.</li>
            <li> Great for grooming while single, or saving someone you care about from a quite unglamorous task.</li>
            <li> mangroomer replaced my first shaver, the second one has worked good for many years</li>
            <li> As long as the batteries are new, then this thing runs perfect.</li>
            <li> Once you figure out how to hold it properly and get the right angles, it works great.</li>
            <li> Very efficient, easy to use, and most importantly: VERY AFFORDABLE!!</li>
            <li> I was able to cut down the man forest in about 10 minutes, and to be honest it worked better than I thought it would.</li>
            <li> This pain is easy to avoid, so don&#x27;t condemn the Mangroomer just because you aren&#x27;t using it the right way.    </li>
            <li> This back shaver is very unique and was designed to do a good job shaving  your own back.</li>
            <li> (ya right!).</li>
            <li> I was originally disapointed when I opened the package because of how lightweight and cheap it felt, but when I loaded the batteries and fired it up, I was amazed at how well it cut hair, how fast the blades moved, and how easy it was to use.</li>
            <li> It was Christmas morning, 2006, and I rapidly tore open a box with my name on it underneath the brightly lit tree.</li>
            <li> Works great just have to be careful about irratation from the edges of clippers, but a close cut otherwise</li>
            <li> I am very happy especially after the de-furring of my back :) Came in handy during the last 2 weeks heat wave!</li>
            <li> While it worked great the first time, I ended up getting a bunch of ingrown hairs and razor bumps on my neck, shoulders and back.</li>
            <li> the proud owner of a hairless back thanks to my mangroomer!</li>
            <li> trimmer is kind of loud too and seems to rattle the plastic parts.</li>
            <li> This tool has made grooming much easier and more convenient than trying to find someone to do it for you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true...</li>
            <li> A good grooming tool for a mans back.</li>
            <li> But I kept using it because it scratched my back so good.  </li>
            <li> This does a good job on the back.  </li>
            <li> When the Mangroomer was working (for the 3 times that I used it), it did do a good job of shaving the hair off of my back.    </li>
            <li> It did an fair job on my back.</li>
            <li> Been looking for a good back shaver for years</li>
            <li> feel it only fair to eddit this with the following.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I expect a full refund, given that I tried the product and it does not work as Amazon advertised.    </li>
            <li> It is true,</li>
            <li> Besides the ease of getting it on the suface of my back, what also amazed me was how surprisingly close it \\&quot;shaved\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with its performance and did not suffer any of the nicks, scrapes, and cuts that others have complained about.  </li>
            <li> This is a good way to shave the back hair by yourself.</li>
            <li> To be perfectly frank, this product sucks.  </li>
            <li> After being self-conscious about my chia-like back for years, I&#x27;m delighted to have purchased the groomer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I would trust it for more intimate areas of my bod.</li>
            <li> He likes that he can shave his back himself (which I appreciate as well) and it does a good job.</li>
            <li> A 3-way mirror would be a definite help, but I can get by with a good wall mirror and a handheld mirror.  </li>
            <li> Therefore it is the full 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> I really wish the design ahd been better.</li>
            <li> The design is good as it can reach any part of your back</li>
            <li> I think I love it as much as he does.</li>
            <li> Takes practice to get a technic that works, but overall good purchase.</li>
            <li> Batteries and your ready to go :)</li>
            <li> An innovative product that just does not work very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be returning it for a full refund tomorrow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like mowing the lawn and getting a good back scratch!  </li>
            <li> It also did a good job on the shoulders, upper arms, and underarms.</li>
            <li> The only thing it&#x27;s good for is duct taping a cordless to the handle</li>
            <li> It is more like a clipper, although it does clip the hair very close to the skin.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s still full bush mode.  </li>
            <li> The good news is that the design of this product enables it to reach every inch of your back - if your a contortionist like that guy Turk on America&#x27;s Got Talent!</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work very well and it sometimes pulls at the hair more than it trims it.</li>
            <li> I do notice that it only cuts good when pushing, or in the forward motion, not pulling backward.</li>
            <li> Gives a quick clean up once every week or two.  </li>
            <li> The trimming is much finer and better than the trimming I get from the trimmer on my Braun foil head shaver which cost over $200.  </li>
            <li> Not necessarily a bad thing.</li>
            <li> always struggled with unsightly back hair and this thing is amazing and easy to use to remove it.  </li>
            <li> I am a fairly hairy guy with a mildly hairy back.</li>
            <li> Very friendly and very apologetic.  </li>
            <li> Everyone else is right -- it feels cheap.</li>
            <li> Anyway, the Mangroomer is easy to use, even for the first time.  </li>
            <li> It takes the hair off that it makes contact with pretty easily</li>
            <li> For light hair this product is excellent, however if you&#x27;ve got the Fangorn Forest on your back, I&#x27;d get something more heavy duty.</li>
            <li> It certainly would take a man of great intelligence to design such a device --</li>
            <li> It always cuts the hair like it&#x27;s suppose to, has a nice long arm, and it easy to wipe clean.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this and would suggest it to other guys.</li>
            <li> The first time it worked great, second time (with fresh batteries) the power mechanism started to poop out but finished the job.  </li>
            <li> Other than that it is a great product.</li>
            <li> after the first shave, you get more comfortable with using it and it is much easier.</li>
            <li> The first time it irritated the skin but has been fine every time since.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t cut as close as a razer, but it&#x27;s quick and eady.</li>
            <li> the mangroomer has a great design: it really lets you reach every part of your back.</li>
            <li> luckily he has me to help.  </li>
            <li> This does the trick and is quick.</li>
            <li> This is my third and best back shaver I have owned.</li>
            <li> It does a decent job and for the price it is G2G. Could be a wee more adjustable</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ladies, if your man is a hairy boy and you want him to have a nice, silky smooth, hairless back once again, this is what you need to get him ASAP!</li>
            <li> and I can do the job quickly.</li>
            <li> Rather cheaply made but effective enough.</li>
            <li> It works great and you can reach your whole back without being a gymnast.</li>
            <li> I had a problem with the hinge mechanism and another piece of the machinery but the customer service quickly replaced the product.  </li>
            <li> It works great for me as my back hair grows in really sporadic areas and isn&#x27;t the thickest.  </li>
            <li> It clipped my hair quickly and close to the skin.</li>
            <li> but it was not like you had to pass over the same spot numerous of times because the angle had to be perfect.</li>
            <li> Quality product, appropriately priced with decent battery life.</li>
            <li> The upgraded versions of this have a rechargeable battery that dies quickly.</li>
            <li> A couple of quick passes takes care of the problem.</li>
            <li> Just buy it and enjoy the benefits as good as a wet shave for me.</li>
            <li> The item arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> or you move it too quickly, so you&#x27;ll want to find your speed.</li>
            <li> Mangroomer really works great to get the hair off your chest, back and nether parts; a must for athletes; oesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> This is the result of trying to clip an area too quickly.</li>
            <li> The best way to use the clipper is to move it in the opposite direction of the hair growth while simultaneously moving it back and forth about an inch, if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> The shave isn&#x27;t super close, but sufficient.  </li>
            <li> ARRIVED QUICKLY</li>
            <li> The item was delivered extremely quick.</li>
            <li> Still, it&#x27;s adequate.</li>
            <li> Super tacky feel.  </li>
            <li> This little wonder works beautifully.  </li>
            <li> overall i am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;Feels pretty cheap,</li>
            <li> I waited two weeks before getting brave enough to give it a go agin with the same results, and it seemed to pull hair more.</li>
            <li> I am overall very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> My first impression was how cheap the item felt</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so light when you first pick it up</li>
            <li> China\\&quot; feel to it, if you have a willing girlfriend/wife, might be easier to buy a cheap ELECTRIC hair trimmer and have her do it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t remove hair in a very consistent manner and caused irritation.</li>
            <li> It does a good job, and doesn&#x27;t take too long to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with this product and do recommend it since it is really the only product of its kind I have seen.</li>
            <li> This was a good idea because of the long handle</li>
            <li> Gentle &#x27;back and forth&#x27; movement seems to be most effective.</li>
            <li> Good idea, just takes a long time to get used to it.</li>
            <li> back is nice and clean now</li>
            <li> I can think of anyone who would want to be hairy if they were fortunate enough to the right kind of DNA for it.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to you and works better than I had expected.</li>
            <li> Well, the half that was completed, it was great.  </li>
            <li> It is possible to get a pretty good shave with it.  </li>
            <li> It does do the job fairly well, especially after the first use....</li>
            <li> However, even though it was time-consuming initially, I did manage to remove most of my hair and it looked noticeably smooth and clean post-shave.    </li>
            <li> Makes shaving easy, really like the design.</li>
            <li> This product actually works and does a pretty good job at getting a close shave.</li>
            <li> Close shave, easy to use and the angle of it really really works well.    </li>
            <li> I cuts really close and is easy to manuever.</li>
            <li> It shaves body parts extremely well and much better than my norelco and as good or better than regular nonelectric razor.  </li>
            <li> when I first bought this, I was excited.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the Mangroomer in november 2011, and at first I was excited about the product.</li>
            <li> You will have to go over the same areas more than once!</li>
            <li> Better than the old days of trying to get rid of unsightly hair!  </li>
            <li> Overall, I am pleased with this unit!</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this product at first.</li>
            <li> Not only was my girlfreind happy with my new look</li>
            <li> I just tried it for the first time, and it&#x27;s pretty easy.</li>
            <li> I was AMAZED how easy it was to take the hair off the top of my back</li>
            <li> If you know of a product which makes grooming one&#x27;s back easy and is better built, please advise.</li>
            <li> It tore my back up pretty good because I couldn&#x27;t get the right angles, but it got the job done.  </li>
            <li> I love the idea of the device and when it works it works great, but it just doesnt last very long.  </li>
            <li> An easy, fast and effective way to shave unwanted back hair.</li>
            <li> The design of the handle is great and makes it possible to easily reach anywhere on your back (or elsewhere for that matter).  </li>
            <li> feels and looks super smooth and sleek, and results last for more than two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> Operating it while looking in the mirror took a little getting used too, but it works great.</li>
            <li> It feels a little flimsy, but does a great job.</li>
            <li> It works great, with a little bit of handling it produced the results as advertised.</li>
            <li> This one works great, although it does hurt a little bit until you get used to it.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit tricky to get the hang of using it at first, but once you adjust to the opposite look to your movements and ensuring the blade lays flat on the skin, it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also not very loud and the battery life is pretty good.</li>
            <li> With the Mangroomer, I have very good control over my entire back.</li>
            <li> : Good design, but mostly made of hard plastic.  </li>
            <li> It trims VERY close to the skin, but is comfortable and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.  </li>
            <li> yes when you get it, it does feel really cheap plastic, very lightweight.  </li>
            <li> Regardless of the fact that it&#x27;s made of cheap plastic and feels like a toy, the thing absolutely works like it says.</li>
            <li> They go away real fast.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;Oh great, money wasted again.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> amazing, I almost can&#x27;t wait for it to grow back to use it again... almost.</li>
            <li> I have used it a few times now, and greatly appreciate it.&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li> Completely worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have to use it kind of like you would use a back scratcher.</li>
            <li> Well worth it.</li>
            <li> but it is worth it.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the $40.</li>
            <li> It will take a bit more time and patience than you might think, but after 20 to 30 minutes, you will have a smooth back.  </li>
            <li> The longer I had it, the more frequently it consumed batteries.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Almost worth 4 stars because of the ease of use, quality of blade....</li>
            <li> Worth the 40 bucks.</li>
            <li> nothing like a nice five o&#x27;clock shadow on your back!    </li>
            <li> Even if I have to buy one a year, at the price it is worth it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is powerful.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> Bout time a man can shave his own back!</li>
            <li> I think the key to best results is closing your eyes, placing the shaver where you want it and then drag it</li>
            <li> worth the 40.00</li>
            <li> I am thrilled I can go to the pool and not have people staring at my back.  </li>
            <li> It has been worth every penny of the 24 dollars</li>
            <li> I use this strictly for shaving my own hairy back.</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Took the device out of its package, read the instructions, inserted two fresh \\&quot;AA\\&quot; batteries and...</li>
            <li> Put fresh batteries in and...</li>
            <li> I used it 3 times already without any kind of marks on my back.   </li>
            <li> The marketing on this product is far better than its effectiveness...</li>
            <li> It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Worth it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave worth a darn.</li>
            <li> I figure that it was worth a shot</li>
            <li> All and all, it seems to be well worth the $40</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re thinking about getting this, do it, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> The problem with shavers is they are not geared for you to shave your own back.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too powerful.  </li>
            <li> I just purchased a different kind.</li>
            <li> It is the only one of its kind that I have found and I have wondered with all the guys in the world shaving there backs these days, why someone hasn&#x27;t come up with this before.</li>
            <li> It turns out that I believe it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Definatley useful if you are like myself and would like to shave the backrug before you go to the beach.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
            <li> liked it enough to buy another one.</li>
            <li> And even though I try fresh batteries after a year</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> The Mangroomer is a nice tool for those that have a lot of back hair going.</li>
            <li> This thing is the most fabulous invention, if you have back hair shame.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> scrapes and pulls far more than it cuts.</li>
            <li> Worth not having to ask my wife to help me out while in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> Worth 40 dollars.</li>
            <li> I saw there was a more expensive Mangroomer, I have no idea how good that one works, but I could ask for nothing more then this one.</li>
            <li> Did you insert fresh batteries?  </li>
            <li> worth the money.</li>
            <li> Just for fun, I tried this on part of my chest, and it worked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To be honest, if you have a standard trimmer and a girlfriend, just ask her to help you.</li>
            <li> point being, it is fun to use.  </li>
            <li> This product was definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Totally worth it.</li>
            <li> The compact design is nice, but it is certainly bigger than my shaving bag.</li>
            <li> I always read reviews but rarely write them.</li>
            <li> I was nervous purchasing it but easy to use and high quality.</li>
            <li> This one is easy to use, I would highly recommend.....</li>
            <li> It shaves very close and after the first time or two getting used to working with this device it is easy.</li>
            <li> First let me say this gives a much closer shave than the Remington bht600, but its not as easy to use.</li>
            <li> assure you I do not work for the company, but find it really rare these days for a company to do customer service right, even for a $20 product.</li>
            <li> i love this product and so do other people so do yourselves a favor and buy it you&#x27;ll love it</li>
            <li> Feels like its cheap, and doesn&#x27;t even have it&#x27;s own battery like all other shavers in this category.</li>
            <li> As many other reviewers have noted, the construction of the shaver is flimsy and it&#x27;s not as sturdy as most would hope.</li>
            <li> The first unit I got didn&#x27;t work but was quickly replaced at no charge.  </li>
            <li> but it fades pretty quick.</li>
            <li> The shave was pretty good for a low priced tool and certainly a LOT easier than the Razorba that I have also used.  </li>
            <li> It works great, although the first time you do have to go over your back several times to get it smooth.</li>
            <li> I have been extremely happy with the product thus far and would highly recommend it to anyone with unwanted body hair that prefers to take care of it at home as opposed to having it professionally removed.</li>
            <li> And make sure your back is clean and sweat-free before you begin.  </li>
            <li> With the exception of the wobbly handle it is easy to maneuver around my back and seems to cut easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and gets to every place on back easily.</li>
            <li> My first use took about 10-15 minutes to completely remove the hair from my back &amp; shoulders, and it did a great job (stand in a shower stall, or you&#x27;ll get hair all over).  </li>
            <li> You probably won&#x27;t want to use this clipper where an ordinary clipper can be used more comfortably and with better results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they were fast and friendly.  </li>
            <li> loved this product, and I highly recommend it to anyone else with back</li>
            <li> It really does allow you to reach the middle of your back easily and works great.  </li>
            <li> There is a &amp;#34;technique&amp;#34; you need to get used to to make it work right.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t go right to the skin, like a razor does...</li>
            <li> And when it does connect, it rips the hair right out.  </li>
            <li> It has almost a right angle bend to it.</li>
            <li> , right?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll get right to the point.</li>
            <li> Also, the width of the trimming surface seems just right.</li>
            <li> That means you are not holding it right if you get nicked.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, I was right.     </li>
            <li> almost like it sucked the battery juices right out.</li>
            <li> The blade seized right out of the box</li>
            <li> Do not use it in the shower, use it right when you get out.   </li>
            <li> Since the moving blade is flush with the \\&quot;guard\\&quot;, it just chews you right</li>
            <li> YOU have to take the time to find the right way to hold it</li>
            <li> I read some reviews about having to get the angle right, etc, but didn&#x27;t have any issues.  </li>
            <li> Then compared to the right side.  </li>
            <li> THAT&#x27;S RIGHT</li>
            <li> This electric razor cuts right through it, no fuss.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After useing it just 2 times the thing broke in 2 pieces right where it swivels.</li>
            <li> The shaver more or less works but is of very cheap construction.</li>
            <li> As far as performance, I was not so impressed at first because it took a very long time for me to remove most of my hair, and I don&#x27;t even have a very think layer on my back.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice having my shirt touch my back again for the first time in longer than I can remember.</li>
            <li> Since my hair tends to lay down, a back and forth motion seemed to work best for me.</li>
            <li> I actually have a much better way to get a smooth sexy back.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great idea that I&#x27;m surprised no one financed a long time ago!</li>
            <li> The new Mangroomer works very well and I am completely satisfied.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t get a super close shave, but this will look much better than a hairy back.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very glad I spent the money on this.  </li>
            <li> I actually find that the cheap razors work good on back hair.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nice to have a the long handle to do it while he stands in the shower.</li>
            <li> Honestly, this is the junkiest thing I have purchased in a long time.</li>
            <li> because it would be cool if it had a full range of movement on the arm, it doesnt go to a straight 180&#x27; (which would be a straight line)</li>
            <li> Lo and behold, they shipped me a new one right away, along with a free gift.  </li>
            <li> The blades are sharp and will scratch you pretty well if you bear down, The trick is to glide it lightly over the skin and the blades will do a marvelous job.</li>
            <li> But if you want a perfectly adequate solution, then certainly invest $40 in this tool</li>
            <li> I was a bit reluctant to try this product, not completely believing it would be as efficient and easy to use as quoted by other reviewers, but this product does what it says and does it splendidly.</li>
            <li> works well, not hard to maneuver with either arm, comfort and quick, The sound is barely audible and results are easily seen close cut each time.</li>
            <li> how long this new look will last but for now, It looks great!</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair on my back, and this tackled the hair without issue.</li>
            <li> It was great also did the job and was waterproof and allowed me to trim other areas, but i had lost my charger while moving and a replacement was just as costly as a new one.</li>
            <li> The original is going strong but can&#x27;t last forever.</li>
            <li> MANGROOMER has been in contact and they are sending a new unit free of charge.  </li>
            <li> The new unit they sent - FREE OF CHARGE - works like a charm (they even sent it out to me by overnight Fedex).</li>
            <li> Therefore, we will ship you a new MANGROOMER free of all charges immediately.</li>
            <li> and well the Mangroomer certainly does!  </li>
            <li> I certainly wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to purchase this shaver again!</li>
            <li> my girlfriend presented me with a present, a mangroomer, she said a woman at her office told her how great it was that her husband had starting using the mangroomer.</li>
            <li> Makes it much easier to &#x27;tidy up&#x27; my back and is a lot cheaper than having to go to the bus stop and pay some homeless dude to do it for me</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re usually good for about a week and a half to two weeks.  </li>
            <li> Makes it much easier and faster to tidy up my back for the beach.</li>
            <li> Leaves marks on my back like happy hour at the local brothel.  </li>
            <li> Works great and has become a personal grooming essential.  </li>
            <li> I received a Mangroomer back hair trimmer as a gift and it worked great for about 16 months of occasional use and then the motor quit.  </li>
            <li> It is one of those pleasant surprises that you buy thinking you just wasted some money</li>
            <li> In the mean time I am thrilled (and better yet</li>
            <li> I have very fast growing course hair and have had no problem.</li>
            <li> , I still cannot comment on the durability of the product seeing as I&#x27;ve only had the second shaver for a few minutes but the customer service of this company is superb and that matters more to me than their products, I would not hesitate to buy from Mangroomer again.</li>
            <li> this model is a good model to use, i mainly decided with this model because i had lost my older one which was the next model up but also because this one is battery operated, i would rather deal with batteries than a battery that will eventually not charge anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It turned a 30 minute fiasco into 5 minutes of pure EASE worth every dime, penny and nickle..</li>
            <li> It worked fine at first but has since stopped working completely.</li>
            <li> Charges are quick, easy and last, too.  </li>
            <li> super easy .. battery&#x27;s last along time too.  </li>
            <li> I bought this Mangroomer after reading many reviews, most positive , but a few negative, and I have to say it was great.</li>
            <li> Great for those hard to reach areas..</li>
            <li> I wish there was a higher quality product, but I also appreciate the weight (light) since it does take a while to clean up my back.</li>
            <li> It works on hair of any length, can be used out of the shower, and allows me to shave my entire back more quickly and easily than if I were to use the Razorba.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Okay, the handle could be a little more rigid, but it was simple to use and left me almost as smooth as when my wife performed the uneviable and much dreaded task of clean shaving me so that I could go to the beach without scaring innocent children.      </li>
            <li> The shaver does &#x27;feel&#x27; cheap in that it&#x27;s very light weight, but it works very well - much better than anything I&#x27;ve tried in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak to long-term reliability as I&#x27;ve only had the shaver for a few days, but so far I&#x27;m pleased</li>
            <li> a little cheaply made, blades are good, overall- not bad..</li>
            <li> first time user:</li>
            <li> If the product manufacturer replaced the blade with a foil one such as the Philips-Norelco Bodygroomer than I feel the item would work much better.</li>
            <li> On first use I had to use duct tape to get it not to collapse upon itself.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, it seemed to actually work better on thicker hair, while having trouble with the thinner patches that are close to the skin.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;d gladly pay double for the design if they would up the quality.</li>
            <li> Fairly decent product that performs adequately to what it claims.  </li>
            <li> I have patches on my back and was able to reach them all.</li>
            <li> So when I saw this I thought it was a God send...and sure enough once I used it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d gladly pay extra for a gadget that is sturdier.   </li>
            <li> It takes a while to get used to working with it, but I got it done the first time.</li>
            <li> I am a tall gentleman of Mediterranean descent, so let&#x27;s just say a product aimed at body-hair issues was something that interested me.  </li>
            <li> and it sure beats the hell out of lashing a disposable razor to a back scratacher!</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for over a year and it still work pretty well.</li>
            <li> Picking up a buzzing bag at baggage claim earns you some funny looks.</li>
            <li> It is reasonably well made with the many different angles you can set being incredibly useful.</li>
            <li> Gr8 idea but product doesn&#x27;t have good trimming capability what it is meant for and handle in different position has very loose fit.</li>
            <li> This works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I only wish there were more alternatives.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this will improve with future uses.</li>
            <li> First I started with a metal spatula.</li>
            <li> but beats asking the wife to shave your back for sure.</li>
            <li> Feels smooth and natural.  </li>
            <li> First off, the product does work as described.</li>
            <li> Angle of the head is not optimal for getting most of my back hair.</li>
            <li> It was first time I had ever seen anything like this.  </li>
            <li> Immediately ripped out a handful of hair; upon close examination of the shave head it was clear that the cheap plastic housing had been assembled improperly.</li>
            <li> Quite inexpensive, and seems to be pretty durable.  </li>
            <li> The blade is similar to the trimmer blade on my electric shaver, but wider to cover more area.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Granted plan on spending 15 minutes shaving and make sure you make even strokes or else you&#x27;ll have a hairy spotty back.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pretty hairy guy and this thing had no issues removing the hair.  </li>
            <li> After using the first about 5 times it stopped turning on</li>
            <li> While my face still looks like a buffalo&#x27;s arm pit, my back has a lovely stubble,</li>
            <li> [...] I laugh and imagine a very hairy Anthony Quinn playing \\&quot;Razorba</li>
            <li> The Mangroomer works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> You will feel better without the hair itching your back.</li>
            <li> I bought this for twice the price when it first came out 5 or so years ago</li>
            <li> I have tried many ways to simplify the removal of back hair, but haven&#x27;t found what I was looking for, until now.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t about to put my faith in a $22 product to get the job done at first.  </li>
            <li> It helps prevent bumps and used it after my first Mangroomer use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for several months now and am completely satisfied.  </li>
            <li> This item is tricky to use at first</li>
            <li> I wish I knew of a higher quality replacement.</li>
            <li> It actually shaves close , leaving my back nice and smooth.    </li>
            <li> My recommended alternative is Veet for Sensitive Skin if you want to go smooth, or just an adjustable-length beard or hair clipper to trim.  </li>
            <li> I rated this when I first got it</li>
            <li> The first unit I received was defective - it wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> If I have one comment for the company, it would be that they need to get their quality control in check to prevent defective units from going out in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No Scratches on my back at all, love the feeling.</li>
            <li> the hair is gone, my shirt feels better on my back</li>
            <li> This implement is useful but could be much better.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A smaller groomer I was using before does a better job</li>
            <li> First time I used this, it worked \\&quot;ok\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it worked as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Every time it would cut on the first stroke or 2 and then just start pulling hairs.  </li>
            <li> And unfortunately I&#x27;m not exaggerating.</li>
            <li> Works very well!</li>
            <li> When I received this item I was surprised at how cheaply made it seems.</li>
            <li> The Mangroomer worked exactly as it was described.</li>
            <li> I would forget to get batteries, they would last awhile but it works better with fresher batteries.</li>
            <li> I commend the designers for their innovative idea, and only hope that they better design the clipper in the future.  </li>
            <li> Not as close as a blade, sure, but close enough.  </li>
            <li> I can use it from the side, over the top, and from the bottom of my back.</li>
            <li> The only disadvantage that this groomer has in comparison to dipilatories like nair is that it needs to be done more often.</li>
            <li> I tried it last night and it works better than I thought it would.  </li>
            <li> so an occassional shave is all that is needed after the first time.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t totally sure what to expect given that the negative reviews made this sound like it was cheap and it didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but this did exactly what i needed it to do and still works til this day</li>
            <li> This back hair shaver is simply the best I have ever used and trust me, I HAVE TRIED THEM ALL OVER THE LAST 15 YEARS!!</li>
            <li> I just got the Mangroomer and used it for the first time.  </li>
            <li> It still is the fastest thing I have ever used and got every spot with ease which might have been a first time for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can trim my back more often if needed.</li>
            <li> And if you can reach your back, it&#x27;ll do everything this&#x27;ll do and more.</li>
            <li> ok no big deal</li>
            <li> To get a close cut, and because shaver edge must move against skin while perpendicular to body, the top &amp; bottom blades are set at the same place--unlike, say, a regular barber&#x27;s electric trimmer on which the bottom blade extends a bit beyond the top blade and the shaver moves along the skin surface parallell to it.</li>
            <li> Hence, blades are more likely to nick the skin unles you hold the shaver edge evenly against the skin surface.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That&#x27;s what happened to my first Mangroomer.  </li>
            <li> I will opt for a better trimmer and a bottle of Nair next time.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I ordered this, but it is really awesome.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used this product, it stopped working immediately.  </li>
            <li> Works very well!  </li>
            <li> Shaves pretty close.</li>
            <li> Nice way to keep your back &amp; back side smooth .</li>
            <li> Worth the money works very well</li>
            <li> My first one I dropped after one week of use and it literally shattered into a million pieces.</li>
            <li> The first time I used the Mangroomer</li>
            <li> This trimmer does exactly what I wanted it to do and</li>
            <li> exactly what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> When you first get this shaver it seems lightweight but it has held up well for me.</li>
            <li> my fault but just be aware it takes them.</li>
            <li> but I have yet to get one to last more than a year</li>
            <li> This is the first solution.</li>
            <li> First, it works.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my first one for over 5 years</li>
            <li> Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this thing I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair on my back</li>
            <li> ..be better off without the extra handle.</li>
            <li> Versus the bend, but after use; it&#x27;s not difficult to adjust to.</li>
            <li> and it has worked exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> First, read the directions.  </li>
            <li> I bet it won&#x27;t last for more than a year...</li>
            <li> most regular shavers cost about 100. &lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks for inventing!</li>
            <li> After evaluating first hand, I&#x27;d give this gadget a 3 out of 10.</li>
            <li> Firstly, this thing is so flimsy.  </li>
            <li> After they wrote me I was able to reach them back at sales@mangroomer.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I wish the clippers were a bit more heavy duty as I have a good amount of back hair.</li>
            <li> Razor is nice and wide and works well.</li>
            <li> You are better off getting someone to cut your back hair with a trimmer.</li>
            <li> Think of a &#x27;shaved head&#x27;, the hair isn&#x27;t exactly gone, it&#x27;s just cropped.</li>
            <li> I tried it first day and worked well.  </li>
            <li> Keep the bottom blade hitting your skin first and it won&#x27;t bite you.  </li>
            <li> The shaver broke the first time I used it</li>
            <li> and my wife is much happier!</li>
            <li> me, I do my sides first, feeling the path without a mirror, in a horizontal pattern.  </li>
            <li> just finished using it for the first time.  </li>
            <li> now that&#x27;s funny.  </li>
            <li> The MANGROOMER worked exactly as it said it would.  </li>
            <li> I think they would do well to produce a more robust unit in the future, one that is metallic and AC-powered.</li>
            <li> he really likes it!</li>
            <li> First, I hesitate to call the Mangroomer a \\&quot;shaver.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The first one I received in 2012 would cut the hair for about 1/2 an inch before snagging; the replacement immediately snagged hair.  </li>
            <li> Got the first one at Bed, Bath, and Beyond.</li>
            <li> I first saw the MANGROOMER, I thought I had found my Eden..</li>
            <li> ~$100, as many of these upraised moles were removed at a later date at a cost much higher than the $20 that I paid for the MANGROOMER</li>
            <li> one cause the first died after about 4 months.</li>
            <li> I have wanted to get one of these since I first heard about it years ago.</li>
            <li> it worked pretty freaking well.</li>
            <li> but I thought it could be more solid.</li>
            <li> Spend the extra bucks and make sure you get a quality groomer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many things over the years to address my hairy back.</li>
            <li> This thing works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Been using this for several years now and women will love you for it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to shave my back with ease.  </li>
            <li> but it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed</li>
            <li> I received the first one it did not turn</li>
            <li> They were able to replace it with no issue after i sent them some pictures of the current one.</li>
            <li> The foldable handle and extension allow you to reach every area of your back - though it takes a bit of practice to figure out the best angle to approach different areas of your back from.  </li>
            <li> I just used it for the first time today.  </li>
            <li> No one wants to see that!  </li>
            <li> Really works well!</li>
            <li> Broke on first use.</li>
            <li> Tried multiple times to use it, and tested to make sure the blades were functioning...</li>
            <li> On the plus side, if you do happen to have fair skin and a mole here or there, you could save a few hundred bucks and just MANGROOM it off, instead of going to see a dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had given this to lmy son-in-law a few years ago and he loved it.  </li>
            <li> (The first few uses will provide an amazing close &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; and moves through hair quickly and efficiently).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> : Mangroomer sent me a new shaver at no extra charge and it arrived within a couple days which was nice</li>
            <li> It improves his self-esteem, it feels more comfortable under his shirts and he seems to sweat less.  </li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and as expected :-)</li>
            <li> Gets rid of even the longest hairs on the back and is relatively easy to use right out of the box.</li>
            <li> If they were smart, they would make one that actually plugs into the wall with better construction for the clippers and power mechanism.  </li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t figure out why they didn&#x27;t work a little harder to perfect the product.  </li>
            <li> It took me a third of the time that it was taking me on my last shaver that I thought it was pretty good.</li>
            <li> which is a fairly long time I feel much better  and confident with this razor and back hair groomer.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, no major cuts or nicks, no bleeding, so it&#x27;s a relatively safe item.</li>
            <li> but when you do finally get it at the right angle it works fine on shorter hair.  </li>
            <li> It really does a good job at getting all the right spots that I can&#x27;t usually reach.</li>
            <li> This product is far from excellent - and that&#x27;s what&#x27;s frustrating about it, because it should be.  </li>
            <li> I have a good patch of hair on my entire back and</li>
            <li> good thing i only paid ten bucks for it</li>
            <li> I found the best method for me was to slowly draw the head back and forth, instead of just one direction.  </li>
            <li> Overall it provides good value of money and simplifies removing hair on the back.</li>
            <li> I am able to reach over my whole back with this.</li>
            <li> It actually feels good like a back scratcher.</li>
            <li> (my wife was probably tired of it, too, but she was too nice to say anything about it),and wanted to give the MANGROOMER a try before something more radical like waxing or laser removal.    </li>
            <li> In any case, once you get the hang of it, it does a good enough job so that you no longer need to rely on your spouse or partner--or the sadists who do back waxing.</li>
            <li> Yet if I am anything more than gentle when using it, my back gets all scratched up to the point where it looks like I was making out with a grizzly bear.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the Mangroomer would be strong enough to remove thick layers of hair, but it&#x27;s managed to rid of my hair quite easily and effectively.</li>
            <li> Ok, let&#x27;s face it, who wants to talk about back hair?  </li>
            <li> Most people do not have a 3 way mirror in their house, and I am not about to go shave my back at J.C. Penny haha. &lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used it multiple times since purchase and wish there was a better reasonably priced alternative</li>
            <li> A gentle summer breeze has more effect on my back hair than this wimpy clipper.</li>
            <li> He used the mangroomer and said it cut his time in half maybe even more!</li>
            <li> So I have nothing positive to say.</li>
            <li> Positive: 1.  </li>
            <li> - I have already returned it and will say something positive now.</li>
            <li> This shaver does an awesome job of trimming the hair down to 1/8&amp;#34; or less</li>
            <li> And since they&#x27;ve pretty much got the market cornered here, I&#x27;d still recommend the buy.</li>
            <li> My only real problem with this is the price, I don&#x27;t really understand why this costs more then $10 or $15.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have many, but each was is around 1.5 inches long.  </li>
            <li> This review is pretty straight forward just like the name of the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep looking out there for another product that may be more durable that has the long handle feature that separates this groomer from the others.</li>
            <li> It is very light-weight, which is nice, but it does not give a close shave and the other reviewers are correct in saying that you&#x27;d need a 3-way mirror to shave it correctly and thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s been over a month since I bought it and the packaging is long gone, so I&#x27;m sure I won&#x27;t be allowed to return it, but I&#x27;m going to try.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is Better to before hair gets too long</li>
            <li> Doesnt work at all pretty much.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty much just garbage</li>
            <li> But it is a good buy if you want to shave a small area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly flexible and have used my old trimmer a few times to do my shaving with much success.</li>
            <li> This product worked effectively twice and then started breaking down.  </li>
            <li> I had to tape down the blade head after 2 years of use after it kept popping off but still is effective.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re of European decent, the chances of this are even greater.  </li>
            <li> Like everyone, I was excited to finally have a product that was able to trim my back.  </li>
            <li> Move it back and forth and it will clean you right up.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy for me to shave his back.    </li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s easy and I don&#x27;t even think about it, I know how to move it around my back in a way that works for me, and I use it maybe once or twice a month.</li>
            <li> I am not sure it would be ideal for anyone with a \\&quot;back sweater\\&quot;</li>
            <li> You can easily reach all areas of your back.  </li>
            <li> Not as easy as they make it look, but sufficient enough.</li>
            <li> For the back it&#x27;s easy to use</li>
            <li> If you have super sensitive skin then it may hurt.</li>
            <li> It is easily reassembled by unscrewing the piece that holds the joint together, replacing the arm, and screwing it back on.</li>
            <li> It does the job pretty well the only thing keeping it from 5 stars is it feels really cheaply made.</li>
            <li> All the flexible angles one can use made it easy to reach all areas of the back.</li>
            <li> And the job the Mangroomer does on my back may not be razor and cream smooth, but it&#x27;s pretty close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got my MANGROOMER yesterday, put in 2 AA batteries, hopped into the bathtub so that hair cleanup would be easy, and proceeded to groom my back.</li>
            <li> After using it, there is visually no hair and the skin is pretty smooth.</li>
            <li> I have thought about buying this for a long time, and finally decided to because of the good price on Amazon.com</li>
            <li> Really good, Batteries last a long time.</li>
            <li> If you drop it, it will certainly break.  </li>
            <li> they are certain that i received a faulty unit and are sending me another to try out.</li>
            <li> a $5 large mirror I bought off Amazon</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unlike certain World Series of Poker players</li>
            <li> For this, I must applaud MANGROOMER, as they certainly have achieved that goal with the MANGROOMER</li>
            <li> this MANGROOMING was going to be quite an effort, for certain.  </li>
            <li> This has certainly met my expectations.</li>
            <li> Be sure to clean the blades for longer life span, Would purchase again; Be sure to watch on sensitive areas where skin is thin, it will cut you.</li>
            <li> I just received my product, and I am so impressed that I felt I needed to immediately try to add a little clarity to the mess of reviews.</li>
            <li> The item is lightweight and easy to maneuver but keep in mind if you are going to shave your back by yourself you really do need a 3 way mirror to see what you are doing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy and I had the whole back done in five minutes.    </li>
            <li> It was easy and took about 15 minutes to do my whole back.  </li>
            <li> The shipping was fast, and I would recommend this product to all that want an easy way to remove unwanted back hair!</li>
            <li> would like to add that that representative from Mangroomer who contacted me after the first unit quit working was very courteous and it appeared they want to stand behind their product.  </li>
            <li> If you have fine hair that&#x27;s not spread thoughout your back, this MIGHT work for you.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re gonna walk around the beach from a distance your back will probably look fine, but it&#x27;s not going to give results of a razor.</li>
            <li> But if you can stand having two day&#x27;s stubble on your back, this is fine.  </li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product if you&#x27;re willing to be patient in learning how to use it correctly and if you do not have a significant amount of hair.</li>
            <li> I was a bit worried that it wouldn&#x27;t get close enough, but it does just fine.</li>
            <li> but my Philips cuts jsut fine except for the short handle.  </li>
            <li> Ah, such a finely crafted instrument.</li>
            <li> This is one of the main products I use in preparation for a modelling shoot!</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I&#x27;ve been growing some fine but very noticeable hair on my back.</li>
            <li> The duct tape holds it really well but gives it a little play room that is nice.</li>
            <li> It works great and inspite of the fact it only lasted a little over 2 years,</li>
            <li> This product shaves the hair down so close and is very easy to get every angle you need.</li>
            <li> He now could groom his back on his own with the help of a large mirror and several industrial sized trash bags.</li>
            <li> Would like better if it open a little bit more.</li>
            <li> I finally can go around not sweating and feel comfortable wherever i go</li>
            <li> Like, really guys?</li>
            <li> very* close.</li>
            <li> This one really worked for me.  </li>
            <li> This thing works very well.  </li>
            <li> Depending on how much you have to remove I would suggest standing in the tub as it does tend to get messy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it works very well now that I have got the hang of it.  </li>
            <li> It pulls the hair with no cutting action despite reviews to the contrary.  </li>
            <li> I glanced at the instructions (not that there&#x27;s much to know about it), popped in a couple batteries, went into the bathroom, took off my shirt, and went to work.</li>
            <li> In about 10 minutes, my back was smooth.</li>
            <li> It was fried, so I threw the whole thing away.    </li>
            <li> Thanks for all the reviews</li>
            <li> Im thinking about attaching a real shaver to this with ductape or something.</li>
            <li> Its an electric shaver for fast close shaving        </li>
            <li> I use this Mangroomer very often.</li>
            <li> you Mangroomer so much.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t felt so comfortable shirtless since I took the third highest fee at the 9th grade poolside bachelor auction.  </li>
            <li> problem with this product is the legal ramifications.  </li>
            <li> Also, the blades cut very close to the skin</li>
            <li> Packaging was a bit much, but I guess that&#x27;s a manufacturer decision.</li>
            <li> , in comparison it&#x27;s much easier to remove and replace batteries as needed.</li>
            <li> So, for now I&#x27;m not going to worry too much about it.    </li>
            <li> This way I can do the back grooming myself which is just fantastic.</li>
            <li> very substandard finishing of product, it seems its a sample.</li>
            <li> The whole thing is made from the cheapest of plastics.</li>
            <li> SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GET YOUR HONEY TO USE A REAL CLIPPER TO REMOVE THE HAIR.</li>
            <li> What I was not expecting was the absolute slice fest that occurred.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer has about as much power as a nose trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Cuts really close, but not (nor did I expect it to) cut as close as a razor blade.  </li>
            <li> You have to gently shave teh area</li>
            <li> I am a hairy beast and it made my back smooth as silk.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend but check the item very well when it is received.    </li>
            <li> The Mangroomer works very well.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think much of this when I tried it though.</li>
            <li> Works very well...</li>
            <li> ......shave won&#x27;t be totally smooth like you&#x27;d get with an electric razor on your face, but it does an outstanding job while leaving only minimal and unnoticable to the eye stubble</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t cut hair all that well, but it does leave a lot of welts.      </li>
            <li> Makes it soooo much easier making contact with the skin.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> it makes my life much simplier and keeps me groomed without needing assistance from others.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> It worked very well.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t complain too much because it did what it said it could do.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to be gentle with it.  </li>
            <li> This product really works.</li>
            <li> My wife really likes when I take care of my body</li>
            <li> you really should consider getting this product.</li>
            <li> Some straight, some curly, but when I was through, there was a pile of hair on the floor to be vacuumed.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;VERY SLOWLY\\&quot; across that area.  </li>
            <li> really ?</li>
            <li> I Had this item over two years now , its very durable .&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not a very close shave, but better than nothing.</li>
            <li> It took me no time at all to figure this out, and a very short time to do my whole back without irritation of any kind.</li>
            <li> I will say this, it was shipped fast.</li>
            <li> In the time I have owned it I have replaced the batteries maybe 3 or 4 times I don&#x27;t really remember.</li>
            <li> but now that I have this it makes it so easy to have a clean back that I am definitely going to make it a part of my routine.</li>
            <li> you reach anywhere without have to go into contortions&lt;br /&gt;Shaves reasonably close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> did not work well, broke on very 1st use.</li>
            <li> I really would like this to work realiably.    </li>
            <li> Although the casing is plastic, it feels very durable and works well.</li>
            <li> takes some time and trials to get used to do it by yourself because of the at-first awkward movement involved so its best if you can have someone else do it for you.</li>
            <li> The biggest drawback was that I really needed the arm to be longer.  </li>
            <li> Your ready to kill yourself.</li>
            <li> I really tried to make this work.</li>
            <li> This really works and I&#x27;m tall (6&#x27;6)</li>
            <li> do you expect stainless steel and a lifetime of use?  </li>
            <li> it gentle on the skin</li>
            <li> I had to remove as much hair as I could with an electric trimmer, and then use the Mangroomer.</li>
            <li> works very well.  </li>
            <li> cant really complain about anything.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re ready to go.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll enjoy a hairless back.</li>
            <li> and it work very well.</li>
            <li> Basically the only way to get smooth skin would be to trim the hair and then have someone shave the area with shaving cream and a razor.</li>
            <li> I assume that, much like an electric razor, if I keep using the MANGROOMER over time the shaves will get closer as my skin adjusts.       </li>
            <li> is that while it is somewhat well-made, it WILL NOT take much abuse.  </li>
            <li> Invest in this and enjoy the glow of knowing you&#x27;ve tamed that shrubbery that grows on your back!</li>
            <li> This works really well.</li>
            <li> Really helped because I have had both shoulders operated on and range of motion limits</li>
            <li> Cleans the back smoothly.  </li>
            <li> Even if it had worked, the quality of construction is very flimsy.  </li>
            <li> It worked very well for me, no pulling or pain.</li>
            <li> I think it would work well for light to moderate hair.</li>
            <li> The on/off switch is flimsy and the overall quality reminded me of a cheap flashlight.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really quite a feat.</li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> Used it so much we wore it out</li>
            <li> my back looks (and feels) smooth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;the arm doesn&#x27;t lock very well</li>
            <li> have to really press the button on the arm</li>
            <li> The hinge in my unit is flimsy and doesn&#x27;t hold the angle real well.  </li>
            <li> one thing I&#x27;ll say is that these aren&#x27;t made very well.</li>
            <li> This is a lifesaver haha.</li>
            <li> All of my  back hair is gone and my skin is even smooth.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that could have made this better was if it was more expensive and built better.</li>
            <li> Get one, for real.</li>
            <li> Maybe they&#x27;re trying to go too fast.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> worked better than expected.   </li>
            <li> bottom line is, for 25 dollars this thing is an absolute steal.</li>
            <li> I could focus on the cheaply made motion restricted handle or the low grade battery contacts.</li>
            <li> This thing really works.</li>
            <li> This razor works very well.</li>
            <li> But, only trimmer head available.  </li>
            <li> and I can say that the Professional model is worth the money.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rechargeable and the blade is much softer on the skin.  </li>
            <li> The nose hair trimmer works very well too.</li>
            <li> Having said that, it performs very well</li>
            <li> Highly recomend!</li>
            <li> I got the package, wasn&#x27;t really looking forward to it.  </li>
            <li> real problem is the blade.</li>
            <li> /&gt;By comparison, the much cheaper Remington BHT-2000 \\&quot;precision\\&quot; trimmer removes even the longest hairs with practically no pain at all.</li>
            <li> I almost dislocated a shoulder in trying, but it does work really well.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting miracles, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting this to really hurt either.    </li>
            <li> This makes life so much easier.</li>
            <li> Cheap and scratches the hell out of your back if you don&#x27;t have the angle correct.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> shipping was fast and thats about it</li>
            <li> This shaver allows men to shave in places, we haven&#x27;t seen (and maybe don&#x27;t really want to see) without a mirror.  </li>
            <li> In hindsight it&#x27;s obvious that a shaver with a handle isn&#x27;t going to give someone &#x27;smooth&#x27; results.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s about it really.  </li>
            <li> This is a fantastic back hair removal product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this since 2006, and while I can&#x27;t say I use it all that much, I can say that I&#x27;ve used it periodically over the years, and it still works.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> It really serves its purpose without having to ask someone for help.</li>
            <li> Works very well, saves a ton of time, and affordable.</li>
            <li> I have to say, it worked very well, did not leave me scratched or scarred.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work very well if at all.</li>
            <li> Haha.</li>
            <li> 3- sometimes it gets stuck on hair if there&#x27;s too much</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> It shaved close (not quite to the skin, but so close you&#x27;d really have to look close to see any hair).  </li>
            <li> I ended up using a Norelco body groom, which gets very close without irritation.</li>
            <li> let alone to produce it in such a fashion....  sturdy, robust, yet maintaining a sleek metallic look, all despite the cheap plastic and manufacturing methods used in its design.  </li>
            <li> Do-It-Yourself Electric Back Hair Shaver is much more convenient &amp;kinder on the skin than a razor as an &#x27;inbetween&#x27; haircut tool, to trim off encroaching mullet hairs on the back of one&#x27;s neck; it also proved useful on sideburns....</li>
            <li> but it felt  very flimsy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about two years, and it works really well.  </li>
            <li> product feels cheap, but it works well enough for the money.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> This really does the job.</li>
            <li> This has really helped me out a ton.</li>
            <li> Really tried to like it, but didn&#x27;t work like I had hoped.</li>
            <li> is no longer very thick.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this situation, the MANGROOMER works real well.</li>
            <li> It just works, simple, a genuis invention, it took me all of five minutes to go from hairy to smooth,</li>
            <li> be careful of the blade… That is the most flimsy piece of plastic and can break</li>
            <li> Thanks MANGROOMER.</li>
            <li> Razorba, however, gives a much closer shave.</li>
            <li> At $25, I expected much more.  </li>
            <li> I really believe I will accidentally break this soon.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because unlike what some ppl have said this really does work and does so quite well</li>
            <li> Excellent for that behind the back deforestation.  </li>
            <li> I received the M/G faster than expected then put it to the test of mowing the thicket on my back which it did a good job.</li>
            <li> anyone touching my back would feel some soft stubble.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Able to get my whole back (thanks Italian hair genes) - works great but is a bit rough on the skin and can leave some red marks for an hour or so</li>
            <li> My Remington trimmer does a far better job, I can shave my back</li>
            <li> For the shaver to work effectively you need to have the entire head level on your back.  </li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t worry, it goes away on its own after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I tried razor blades and they effect me negatively, this is a good trimmer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a wookie-like hairy back, just kind of patchy back hair.  </li>
            <li> For an improvement, an angled head with a soft plastic comb (with rounded teeth) on it could help reduce scratching and possibly allow for a more even cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this does a good job shaving the butt, chest (do not go too close to the nipples), upper thighs (definitely stay clear of the &amp;#34;twig &amp; berries&amp;#34;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This trimmer is very easy to use and the black handle is adjustable for longer lengths.</li>
            <li> I never had any razor burn or itching problems and luckily the hair isn&#x27;t growing back very fast</li>
            <li> I showered right after, dried off, and I was amazed at how good of a job such a cheap and simple product did.</li>
            <li> BUT, I&#x27;ve never been able to shave this easily, and it actually shaves closer than any of my other razors!    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the same probably holds true if your significant other is of the same sex ;-)</li>
            <li> It is easy to maneuver with the long handle and reached everywhere</li>
            <li> I think I was more impressed at first by the ability to actually *reach* my back hair than this thing&#x27;s cutting power.  </li>
            <li> Easily shaves the entire back rather quickly and conveniently.  </li>
            <li> What a brilliantly simple concept that frees you from having to ask your best friend or significant other to get those hard to reach places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Takes a little dexterity at first, and you need to get good at translating what you see in the mirror or mirrors to actual actions that you intended to perform.  </li>
            <li> Like everyone has said, it takes a little getting used to, but it&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It allows to reach even the most difficult places very easily as designed.</li>
            <li> We can&#x27;t imagine that any other electric razor would do a better job.    </li>
            <li> I love this product,I would recommend it to anyone who has a major back hair issue !!</li>
            <li> I would recommend trying this electric shaver to anyone before investing more money into other options.</li>
            <li> But it was worth it as it pretty much made it through the summer with moderate growth.  </li>
            <li> There are other products out there that have passed this one by for sure.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical for a while, worried that it&#x27;d be too good to be true, but I&#x27;m very relieved that it works.</li>
            <li> If you have dry or sensitive skin it might be a good idea to use a beard trimmer or one of those smaller battery trimmers if you aren&#x27;t very hairy just in that area, then use this trimmer everywhere else.  </li>
            <li> This is great for me to use on my legs because I can&#x27;t bend down far enough to shave anymore.</li>
            <li> This is very important, as having this device at a 90 angle (for example) makes it possible to reach certain areas in your back.  </li>
            <li> I wish it had a hair catcher because I have to clean the entire bathroom after every use.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t recommend this higher, actually the fact that I felt the need to spend the effort to recommend this, should indicate that I thought that it is worth the recommendation.  </li>
            <li> I managed to get every inch of my back and sides clean shaven.</li>
            <li> I had a clean back and&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gives me a clean, itch-free back without bothering my wife.  </li>
            <li> It was becoming increasingly bothersome to keep my back clear of hair until now.  </li>
            <li> The results were a clean back.</li>
            <li> nick or scratch like trying to clean up with a regular hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> This product is a good idea for an unassisted serious need.  </li>
            <li> my clippers to long sticks and come up with all sorts of ways to shave my own back.</li>
            <li> I have used other Mens grooming shavers from the large global manufacturers who I would think would  have well funded R&amp;D departmant and could come up with the perfect back shaver, but all come up very short from my experience.</li>
            <li> and it worked like a charm taking it down close, not razor close but good enough.  </li>
            <li> (the first time you use it, you have to plug it in for 24 hours before you can use it), this latter version is apparently not sold on Amazon but is sold at all Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond stores, and I think it sells for $10 dollars more there.</li>
            <li> We both agree that $40 is much too high for this product.</li>
            <li> They sent out a new product via FedEx same day free of charge.</li>
            <li> I got scared off of ordering a replacement head because of some of the fit issues people had, but for the money, and my last one hung on for a couple of years, I just grabbed a new one.  </li>
            <li> After all, it really does work (when new) and I see the pro has some much improved features.  </li>
            <li> For the most part I&#x27;m alright with it since it makes it look like I&#x27;m trying to do something about my obscene amount of back hair, but it&#x27;s definitely not for someone who wants a completely clean shaved back.</li>
            <li> Fast and easy with not much of a learning curve.</li>
            <li> I have moderate back hair, it works good, you have to go lightly, like someone lightly scratching your back, you also have to go slow, so go slow and just repeat over the area, if you rush you will not get a good cut.  </li>
            <li> It is bare metal against bare metal, like most shavers, but there is nothing preventing it from grabbing, or rubbing your skin right off your back.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works fine and lasts a long time!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty bummed about buying this product, seeing how badly it works, and not being able to return it!!!  </li>
            <li> only used it once so far but works very well, comfortable, would recommend to others</li>
            <li> That makes it a good purchase.full telescoping handle and went from above, like in the illustration, and that took care of my upper back.</li>
            <li> I found none of the above to be true.</li>
            <li> Cool I got to review this now that I just threw away last week.</li>
            <li> not only helping you to manscape your back, but also other areas of the body: legs, neck, chest...very convenient design and an all-around great product.</li>
            <li> in box says for the first two years if you have any problems with the groomer you can call them for a replacement unit, so trying this out is nearly risk free.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do full upper body shaves every two weeks or so</li>
            <li> Just used this product for the first time and WOW what a product...</li>
            <li> But this little beauty is excellent at getting those hard to reach places.  </li>
            <li> Worked fine initially, but parts of shaving head broke after 4 months  of light use, apparently due to inferior material/construction, rendering  product unuseable.</li>
            <li> It took about 4 times to get it down without many scratches.</li>
            <li> I didnt think that an item that cost so little could possibly work as good as it does.</li>
            <li> It takes a little practice, but if used correctly, the Mangroomer does a good job on my back.  </li>
            <li> Worked just like new, but for the price, shouldn&#x27;t have to use duct tape ANYWHERE on this thing!  </li>
            <li> Tried batteries given and another new set of batteries...no power!</li>
            <li> it was time to get a new one!</li>
            <li> I have (had) a perfect bush of dark, coarse, Italian fur on my back.  </li>
            <li> I read a few reviews on this site and was kinda scared off by how hard it seemed to use but rest assured this is not a PDA it takes two AA batterie (not incuded)s NO assembly and works GREAT!!  </li>
            <li> my back was clean as a brand spanking new chromed out whistle.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased to say it works as advertised - the head is a bit wider than your typical electric trimmer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than duct taping an electric razor to a stick which I tried previously (I know, I know, but it did work, sort of...).  </li>
            <li> Probably works better if you have less hair.</li>
            <li> Even though it irritated a lot, it didn&#x27;t cut, and as I learn how to do the angles better, I will have less irritation.</li>
            <li> quick way to get the unwanted back hair off</li>
            <li> It made quick work of my back and shoulder hair.</li>
            <li> Like a mild back scratcher.</li>
            <li> Battery life was decent.  </li>
            <li> It works only OK and leaves you instead of an all over hairy back, a patchy one instead.  </li>
            <li> So, I purchased this particular mangroomer.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s helping you to be more flexible and shave you back at the same time.</li>
            <li> I should give this product four stars: it works quickly and efficiently at removing back hair.</li>
            <li> Otherwise a decent working product.</li>
            <li> Will definitely remain a loyal customer and would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Decent product.</li>
            <li> The handle has multiple positions but they don&#x27;t &#x27;lock&#x27; adequately</li>
            <li> The main guidance provided is to shave against the way the hair is growing - the \\&quot;grain\\&quot; of the hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used similar products prior to this one, but have never had as many problems with them.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend it to anyone with mild back hair.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty decent first shot at a product, and I understand why they wouldn&#x27;t have come out with both guns blazing on the initial release with no idea</li>
            <li> After a couple passes I can assure a fairly decent cut.</li>
            <li> Pappy got hair in every imaginable place as he grew older.</li>
            <li> I would also like to see a internal battery rather than the throw aways, I wouldnt mind spending extra money for a better product.</li>
            <li> There are some good points and some weak points.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to loose its position with moderate pressure.      </li>
            <li> It is best to check out your back in the mirror every few weeks or so to keep the forest down.  </li>
            <li> It extends far down your back and it feels good to scratch an itch.</li>
            <li> Highly recommeneded.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> He highly recommends it.</li>
            <li> A high percent of the units are defective.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Still, I highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t expect a high powered tool here.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to any man suffering from \\&quot;bear back.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this item.  </li>
            <li> Greattt product!Will purchase again and highly</li>
            <li> recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wide enough to cover a good sized area at a stroke, but not so wide that it can&#x27;t be effectively negotiated in any areas where my back is not fairly flat.</li>
            <li> Compared to my older and smaller trimmer, I accomplished the task in less time (between 5 and 10 minutes on my first try) and it did a better job and</li>
            <li> If you have back hair and you want a simple, fast and easy to maintain solution that just does the job without any issue then get this sucka.</li>
            <li> It has a large head and extends so far it would probably go around two people.</li>
            <li> It would have gotten a five-star rating had it been built a little more rugged.</li>
            <li> It would have gotten a five-star rating had it been built a little more rugged.</li>
            <li> wow why are you so damm hairy!!</li>
            <li> (although, I knocked it a little bit, and they stopped working, the cover wouldn&#x27;t stay on...took more effort than it should, but</li>
            <li> So, I stood up and the little guy fell and whimpered, but he was okay.</li>
            <li> could be made a little better for the money.</li>
            <li> If you have more than a little (like me), it stunk.  </li>
            <li> I have also gotten a lot more efficient with the shaver with a little practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;18 Month update</li>
            <li> I will get better at it since I know it will take a little bit of practice.  </li>
            <li> but it they could find a way to make it a little more flexible, it would be prefect.  </li>
            <li> This is my second one because my first one was stolen!</li>
            <li> I realize writing a review for a backshaver is somewhat..  odd, but none the less this product is great.  </li>
            <li> Since there is not way to to clean the cutting mechanism, that&#x27;s all it was good for.  </li>
            <li> By all means get it right away, there is no excuse for just letting it grow.</li>
            <li> I tried it with some older batteries then found new batteries.  </li>
            <li> Really flimsy and cheap, not worth what you pay for it.</li>
            <li> First off it wasn&#x27;t clear clear anywhere that this was not rechargeable.  </li>
            <li> Not perfect, but pretty good.</li>
            <li> I tried just using a normal trimmer and razor but that did not work.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve killed many a device in my time, so I&#x27;ll update accordingly.</li>
            <li> Finally, even fresh batteries couldn&#x27;t get it going, so I took it apart to see what I could see.  </li>
            <li> First off, I have to say, there was absolutely ZERO pain involved while shaving my back</li>
            <li> The trimmer is safe to the touch; even when pressed firmly against the tender skin of my forearm did not nick or cut the skin at all.</li>
            <li> Sure there may be a few hairs here or there</li>
            <li> The Mangroomer came in one of those hard-shelled plastic containers, which are always fun to open.</li>
            <li> It reached all angles as advertised, and the clipper was powerful enough.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time, there are better products on the market.</li>
            <li> the shaver  head is not angled like a normal shaver</li>
            <li> The MANGROOMER is well worth it if you don&#x27;t have someone to trim your back for you.</li>
            <li> I hesitated to buy it because I saw a few reviews that said it did not cut efficiently, but I gave it a shot, and I&#x27;m extremely pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> And for what it&#x27;s worth, I am no slouch when it comes to back hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought 2 and never complained until now.</li>
            <li> just a battery powered clipper with a long bending handle and just like most simple things it works.</li>
            <li> A wider head or a head that can pivot and stay on your back would be useful.</li>
            <li> If you want to get rid of back hair, this is worth EVERY PENNY.</li>
            <li> Shaving your back isn&#x27;t the most romantic thing you can ask your significant other to do.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever tried this with a normal clipper, you can appreciate it.  </li>
            <li> that is normal.</li>
            <li> My Mangroomer eats normal batteries from breakfast.    </li>
            <li> Finally, a trimmer that is powerful and a solution to all those hard-to-reach areas.  </li>
            <li> It took a few more passes to get it all off</li>
            <li> On a normal grooming session to get Pappy to beach his friends would need to spend hours helping him.</li>
            <li> This product is good at getting through the thick hair, but I generally have to follow up with a razor to remove stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but alas all good things come to an end.</li>
            <li> I think this is a good idea poorly executed.</li>
            <li> Device is very cheaply made - powered off a single AA battery, I was worried before I ever applied the blade to my back.</li>
            <li> The company does a good job of getting fake purchasers to spread buzz and positive reviews -- but it&#x27;s just hype and clever marketing.  </li>
            <li> However the main drawback is that it&#x27;s very very loud.  </li>
            <li> It does a better job than anything I have done previously!</li>
            <li> The trimmer cuts the hair short enough and as easy as it is to use</li>
            <li> Easy to use and the two double-A batteries required last the entire season.</li>
            <li> use update&lt;br /&gt;Still going strong after 6 uses on my back and on the same set of batteries.</li>
            <li> I liked it, was surprised it didn&#x27;t cut me, but still sharp enough to do the job.</li>
            <li> I just wouldn&#x27;t use it right before you go outside with your shirt off.</li>
            <li> Once I got the right angle on the back</li>
            <li> It does say Do-It-yourself ELECTRIC back hair shaver, right??</li>
            <li> Plus, the hair on my shoulder is becoming thinner and less noticeable since I&#x27;ve stopped shaving it with a blade.</li>
            <li> It is time consuming and does not make a clean pass so multiple passes are needed over the entire skin surface to get a reasonable result.  </li>
            <li> Had one for over 2 years and finally gave out and got a new one right away.</li>
            <li> I started on a small section with up and down strokes and looked in the mirror to see a nice clean area.</li>
            <li> however, it&#x27;s really easy once you have that part down</li>
            <li> It has long flexible extendable/retractable joints which allows you to reach various parts of your own back.</li>
            <li> I have found that with a little practice you can completely avoid this all together; however, I never had any redness that lasted more than 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> I got pretty good at it, but i was getting tired of the process of doing this for my back...</li>
            <li> but they could have spend a little more engineering to make it feel less cheaply made.     </li>
            <li> It would not turn on and yes, I put new batteries in it.  </li>
            <li> The razor still performs like new.</li>
            <li> So I decided to get the new rechargeable shaver.</li>
            <li> Inserted new batteries and it didn&#x27;t even turn on.  </li>
            <li> it becomes something you do not want to live without.</li>
            <li> and it works like new.</li>
            <li> So, I got a new one.  </li>
            <li> For the new one, I&#x27;m going to drill a hole through the handle and run a lanyard through</li>
            <li> I have now tried 3 pair of brand new batteries  and</li>
            <li> I see that there is a new version, but I don&#x27;t know what the difference is.</li>
            <li> Go get some new batteries before using this.</li>
            <li> Since I live on a tropical island i go to the beach a lot.  </li>
            <li> just used my new mangroomer.  </li>
            <li> It soon found a new home in my garbage can.  </li>
            <li> , the Bodygroom Pro does a better overall job and is useful for trimming other than just back</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of awkward trying to get the right angles the first time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a huge back, so it takes awhile to groom in between my lats and such, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I noticed the arm&#x27;s two pieces came slightly apart allowing the hinge to slip out easily.  </li>
            <li> When using just be gentle when trimming your back, the blades work really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very tender skin, and course back hair, and it was absolutely painless.   </li>
            <li> Works great if you are tired of asking wife or girlfriend to groom your back</li>
            <li> It takes almost no pressure at all to &#x27;unlock&#x27; the device, so it&#x27;s really an annoyance, and makes the shaving experience much longer (to constantly re-position the shaver at the correct angle).  </li>
            <li> Cheaply made overall, and on mine the battery door wouldn&#x27;t latch back in place, once removed.    </li>
            <li> It is obviously cheap and while I&#x27;ve had my current mangroomer for a year, it is my second one.</li>
            <li> My back hair REALLY grows fast and when I began and looked in the mirror, I thought</li>
            <li> It easily reached all the spots I needed it to, the whole back, with absolutely no problem.  </li>
            <li> : while this works great on one&#x27;s back and could be used to do some manscaping for clean, sharp lines down below, I would never use this on sensitive areas with loose skin, if you get my drift.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s surprisingly easy to use and there&#x27;s no smell or burn or mess.</li>
            <li> Pretty much any other electronic shaver/body groomer on the market will either be run off AC or have a pretty beefy rechargeable battery, but of course none of those have the handle necessary.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to get the angle of the head just right, and move it slowly.  </li>
            <li> Feels a little cheap, but has not broken on me so far.  </li>
            <li> The long adjustable handle makes it easy to reach all areas of your back.</li>
            <li> I see there&#x27;s now a re-chargeable one out, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s made any better besides not requiring batteries.</li>
            <li> The actual blades and the shaving head is kind of flimsy, maybe it need to have two cutting edges instead of one to make it more robust.</li>
            <li> , the box looks exactly the same</li>
            <li> Otherwise they&#x27;re both exactly the same.</li>
            <li> Considering some of the reviews here of pulling &amp; red marks, I was a bit apprehensive at first, but took the plunge anyway.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was the angle of the shaver to my back</li>
            <li> The first couple of times it left a couple of spots tender</li>
            <li> I got it today and all I can say is WOW!  </li>
            <li> acting like a girl, for god&#x27;s sake - the product does exactly what it claims to do</li>
            <li> It feels pretty flimsy, and is nowhere near as solid as my normal clippers, but boy, it does the job.</li>
            <li> I was able to get it to work but it feels as though it will only last a short amount of time before it breaks.</li>
            <li> First time I ever thought of shaving my back.  </li>
            <li> I had managed to run this razor over my back so many times my skin was red and nearly no back hair had been cut.</li>
            <li> So get someone to help you with the first trimming, and then use this to keep the back hair in check.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> My back is pretty hairy,</li>
            <li> Used this for the first and maybe last time yesterday.  </li>
            <li> But it does a hecka better job than anything I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any pain or red marks the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I take care of my things so it is not dropped or abused and left with other items piled on top of it.</li>
            <li> That being said, it does its job well enough and was pretty inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Yes it will leave some red marks the first time you use it</li>
            <li> :  Works better than any other grooming tool designed for the back that I have tried.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used this product, I had mixed feelings.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, it is a unique and helpful tool.</li>
            <li> The first time you use this thing you&#x27;ll be in pain and it will take over 1 hour to shave that hairy back (if you&#x27;re part simian like myself).  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it cut into my skin and made me actually bleed.  </li>
            <li> It took a bit getting used to, and I have to be careful around my sides and lower back because my skin is more sensitive there.</li>
            <li> I finally had to use it this morning for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It actually worked well, for the first three or four uses, but then the blades seem to develop rounded edges.</li>
            <li> The only disadvantage I can see of this device is that he will be more likely to get skin cancer because his back hair no longer protects him.</li>
            <li> Went to use it for the first time last weekend and it won&#x27;t turn on!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what you need to buy if you want to shave your back.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty close shave and when I look at my back in the mirror afterwards, I can&#x27;t even see any noticeable stubble.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After the first use it is obvious that it doesn&#x27;t need one; blow off the blades and rock and roll.</li>
            <li> I returned my mangroomer and got a full refund from Amazon (minus shipping of course).  </li>
            <li> did* find that it was good for removing a few stray back (&amp; back of shoulder)</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how easily it worked with little effort.</li>
            <li> With a little practice it was easy to use and worked well.</li>
            <li> These most certainly involved massive cost cutting in the materials, production, and wages of the (skilled) employees, all to make it affordable to the likes of people like myself.  </li>
            <li> but with that being said, it&#x27;s the only product out there that allows me to keep my back clean.</li>
            <li> 45 minutes and two sets of Energizer batteries later, my back was reasonably clean,</li>
            <li> If you go slow and steady, then the clipper will work better.</li>
            <li> Arrived with a chip in the plastic next to the power switch right out of the box which I was initially concerned about but decided it wasn&#x27;t that much of a problem.</li>
            <li> With this nifty unit I can generally keep nice and trim back there where I previously couldn&#x27;t reach.</li>
            <li> A little hard to get all the spots on my back without twisting and turning the Mangroover, but it did get everywhere, and I have a very hairy back and am a very heavy guy, but was able to do it all myself, which was wonderful.</li>
            <li> I just bought a new one to replace my old one.</li>
            <li> This invention, along with the bamboo backscratcher, completely alleviates the need for a live in girlfriend- and for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> This was also very comfortable to use, it leaves small red marks, but those go away within minutes leaving you looking like a real man instead of a hairy beast.</li>
            <li> This product changed all of that for me and allows for me to get a smooth shave in less than 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, takes a few times to get use to it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to how well it cleans up really thick hair, or dark hair, but it works great for me.  </li>
            <li> Surprised, but it actually works pretty well.</li>
            <li> kept the receipt in case something happens, read the reviews from other people they are all right on about the quality and usage!</li>
            <li> placing the order I regretted it -- I thought it would be $40 down the drain, but I was happily wrong -- this product is EXCELLENT.</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, having back hair makes me feel positively primate-like.  </li>
            <li> when I unpacked this thing, I was disappointed, it&#x27;s very light and feels like it will break pretty easily.</li>
            <li> Tshirts now stick to my back in a very close, heat-retaining way when it gets hot outside.  </li>
            <li> I can have a silky smooth back all year long!</li>
            <li> The length of the handle is more than long enough to reach every part of my back.</li>
            <li> Not very hard to use, does the job well.</li>
            <li> task that used to take me at least 20 contortion filled minutes and a big mess, now takes me 1/2 the time, is super easy and no mess at all.&lt;br /&gt;Life</li>
            <li> The center of the back, the sides and shoulders were all easy to reach</li>
            <li> my technique is really down just takes me minutes every 2-3 weeks to touch my back up one observation I use the remington blade saver spray to disinfect and lube the blades and this seems to do a great job of preserving the sharpness and cleaning away hair and dead skin.</li>
            <li> Unless, that is, it happens to be the progeny of one of the said moles, in which case it is a striking &#x27;midnight black&#x27; color, coarse, and quite visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The upper back is quite easy to get to, and I use a regular trimmer there.  </li>
            <li> I watched the razor comb the hair on my arm back and forth and not cut a SINGLE hair and the only thing this does for sure</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t remove tiny hairs because the razor head is too large.</li>
            <li> believe I must have received a bad unit, but was pleasantly suprised by the company&#x27;s effort to make things right.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Product feels a little cheap, but the blade makes up for it.  </li>
            <li> The materials are a little cheap though.  </li>
            <li> Feels a little cheap but works well.</li>
            <li> If you are too modest to ask your significant other (or your kids - not!)</li>
            <li> Having been \\&quot;blessed\\&quot; with as much back hair as the furriest of primates, this, why-didn&#x27;t-I-think-of-this-first, device groomed me with remarkable ease and almost no discomfort beyond some general and short-lived irritation - similar to when a women&#x27;s nails would dig in and scrape across my back during my much less furry, collegiate and early marriage years.      </li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t drop it on a hard floor and you should be ok.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it&#x27;s made super cheap for a forty dollar item; it&#x27;s lightweight and feels just plain cheap!</li>
            <li> I was surprised by how tough and effective this gadget was.</li>
            <li> Easy to reach all places but can be a bit rough at first to your skin, especially if hair is very long.</li>
            <li> This tale begins innocently enough when a young man hit puberty a time most young men receive a gift of a little bit of additional hair at this tender age, but not Pappy.</li>
            <li> I easily did my entire back from my neck down to my top crack in less then 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> The very slight skin abrasion has gone away with subsequent uses as my skin has gotten used to the shaver and it is still a very smooth shave.</li>
            <li> This is probably the most cost effective, and lest painful way to get rid of back hair.  </li>
            <li> the only tell tale sign was the huge red welts a nd slices that appeared on my back.  </li>
            <li> Not a very hairy back, but grew light patches of hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: if you&#x27;ve got a very hairy back and you just want to clear away the bulk of it, then this clipper will work for you.</li>
            <li> You will thank the makers if you have a lot of back hair, like me, cause it took a bit to do the whole thing.</li>
            <li> We were happily surprised and here&#x27;s our review...    </li>
            <li> You have to go over each area repeatedly, to remove the hair completely.  </li>
            <li> I should also say, its loud too.</li>
            <li> I am surprised Amazon is carrying the product again.</li>
            <li> about 10 min to do my whole back and shoulders.</li>
            <li> and i no longer have to wear that natural sweater.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tricky in that you need two mirrors (a bathroom mirror and hand mirror suffice) and the motions you use don&#x27;t come naturally.</li>
            <li> Any guy who wants to get rid of his back hair needs to get this product.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s the only thing I have found that really works.  </li>
            <li> I actually cringed when I started to use it because there had been so much talk of pain associated with use.</li>
            <li> The second use was much easier..</li>
            <li> I know they make a professional model but have yet to chance and try it.</li>
            <li> What you might not know is that there&#x27;s also a professional version of this</li>
            <li> I TRIED EVERY CONCEIVABLE WAY TO MAKE IT WORK</li>
            <li> and yes... wow... hurts...</li>
            <li> As far as ingrown hairs go, I have never got one in my years of using a razor.</li>
            <li> So if you encounter a problem with your   Mangroomer, you should contact the Mangroomer folks directly [...]</li>
            <li> My only concern is that if I \\&quot;gorilla\\&quot; with too much torque, I&#x27;ll break it.</li>
            <li> It does take several attempts and a bit of getting accustomed to using it, but all-in-all it works very well.</li>
            <li> 30 minutes I finally got it, and was very pleased.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This MANGROOMER was a gift; the man who received it had no trouble removing unwanted body hair.</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> The blades are just not moving fast enough.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t completely remove all hair</li>
            <li> Its painless and leaves no rash or in grown hairs.grows back fast though.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your time and money.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made gimicky waste of money.</li>
            <li> but I am surprised it is battery operated, I thought it would be chargeable</li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised how well this product worked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it about 5 times so far.</li>
            <li> I try and trim my back hair every 1-1.5 weeks, so it wasn&#x27;t too much to cut through - 10 to 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li> The man groomer makes reaching my back so much easier, with zero in grown hairs.  </li>
            <li> I have very scarce back hair, but there is some, and it has always bothered me.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone that wants to have a do-it-yourself soltution to removing back hair.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it much because it was such a misery.</li>
            <li> , it shaves my whole back with no strain.  </li>
            <li> I shaved my whole back in 5 min.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> It takes some practice to work out the angles to cover your whole back, but in time it&#x27;s a breeze.</li>
            <li> I took completely apart and could y find any problems.</li>
            <li> My back is very hairy, the ManGroomer took it all off.</li>
            <li> complete unability to shave hair?</li>
            <li> Shaves pretty close for basically being just long handled clippers.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They have several (more expensive) versions of this available</li>
            <li> This back shaver works very well</li>
            <li> Does pull hair if the battery gets too old.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at the ease of using this product.</li>
            <li> have this Wahl shaving kit that I was using before to remove body hair, and this thing just puts it to shame, not even mentioning the fact that it&#x27;s far easier to reach the hair, but it cuts it like it&#x27;s nothing.</li>
            <li> where you put the batteries just completely broke into pieces when i went to change the batteries</li>
            <li> The whole thing - entire length - needs to be in contact with your skin.</li>
            <li> It is made of cheap plastic and falls apart after few uses.  </li>
            <li> and they immediately mailed me a Professional model and the ear/nose hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I contacted the company directly, and they shipped me a replacement, thinking it was faulty.  </li>
            <li> the only con is that this can pull hair if you move fast.</li>
            <li> And initially the shave was very close.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> For areas where you don&#x27;t need the extra length of the fold-out handle, this makes the unit much easier to manuver.  </li>
            <li> right-handed guys will have a much easier time getting to the left side of their backs, and vice versa.  </li>
            <li> and I would recommend this to anyone who wants to get rid of hair on their back.</li>
            <li> and it really cut my back up in the process.</li>
            <li> at least their customer service is top notch</li>
            <li> The arm isn&#x27;t stable in its&#x27; extended position, and almost ends up collapsing completely while it&#x27;s in use.  </li>
            <li> I never knew how much hair I had on my back.  </li>
            <li> am surprised that this doesn&#x27;t mention shaving the neck.  </li>
            <li> I have no trouble using it on my body.  </li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> I discovered parts of back never before known to the modern world.  </li>
            <li> so far, it works.</li>
            <li> product is completely unusable.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> It takes hours, if not days, of training with this instrument in order to learn how to handle it and to become a MANGROOMING professional.  </li>
            <li> it would make life much easier when it came to maintaining my back hair.</li>
            <li> you look at the pictures, notice that the clipper head is nearly perpendicular to the shaft of the device.</li>
            <li> Anyhow on to how this product saved this young mans life.</li>
            <li> Kinda loud</li>
            <li> It also had a very flimsy feel overall.</li>
            <li> We ordered this about a month ago to replace a 4 year old identical product that worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> I also tried to return it and it is marked unreturnable.</li>
            <li> 5 minutes later, the job was done very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shaving head rusted completely within about 6 months.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 6&#x27;2&amp;#34; so that&#x27;s a lot of real estate back there for hair to grow on.</li>
            <li> find this product to be far easier to use than my Razorba.</li>
            <li> I ordered it directly from man groomer and it took 10 days to get here.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical since it runs on batteries if it would be powerful enough to be effective, but</li>
            <li> The third time (with fresh batteries) it simply quit halfway through using it.  </li>
            <li> Worth the $25 bucks I spent.</li>
            <li> or even KIND OF thick and coarse.</li>
            <li> In the beginning, I got scratched up a good bit trying to use it, but that&#x27;s because it takes some getting used to the awkwardness of directing this long, telescoping machine up and down your back, especially if you&#x27;re using a mirror for guidance, which throws off your sense of forward/backward/left</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a very thick layer of hair on my back, so I thought a do-it-yourself product such as the Mangroomer might handle my unwanted hair very nicely.    </li>
            <li> It should be designed at an optimal, gentle angle, like regular hair clippers, but the head is at a right angle to my back and doesn&#x27;t shave well and scratches my back</li>
            <li> I used my regular trimmer over the same areas that I could reach and it took the hair right off.      </li>
            <li> He has always had a significant back hair problem and has tried several different trimming products that have all been unsatisfactory.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand there are only so many times you can ask people to help you shave your back, as well.     </li>
            <li> The plastic is incredibly cheap and brittle and would not likely survive a 2-3 foot drop onto anything other than padded carpet.</li>
            <li> The head is wide enough to get a significant area in one swip.  </li>
            <li> This product for me made life very easy to reach the hard areas to get on your back!</li>
            <li> It is a very modest &amp;#34;trimmer&amp;#34; that&#x27;s not super powerful.  </li>
            <li> i ignored the warnings of others and wasted $40--i have not been able to use this product beyond the first 5 minutes of wasted time.</li>
            <li> The Mangroomer is somewhat cheaply made and I did have to snap the case back to together around the blades, but its held up the several times I&#x27;ve used it, no idea of the long term durability though.</li>
            <li> I then used the full telescoping handle and went from above, like in the illustration, and that took care of my upper back.</li>
            <li> So I bought this a few days ago and when it arived I was excited to try it out.</li>
            <li> After a few months I&#x27;m still on the original set I put in which are the newest high-power ones that Duracell makes.</li>
            <li> Also, because I had to keep going over certain spots trying to make sure I got everything, by the time I finished, I had little red welts (temporary) that looked like I had spent some time in an s&amp;m club.</li>
            <li> Every man should buy one of these because seriously - where are your woman&#x27;s hands when she is touching you?</li>
            <li> Trimmer works well, won&#x27;t give you a super close shave, and be careful because it will still cut open sensitive skin areas.</li>
            <li> First you&#x27;ll wash off the cut hairs, &amp; not letting a rug develop is the key to any back shaver.</li>
            <li> You should be aware that the blade is similar to the sideburn trimmers that a hairstylist uses, only wider.  </li>
            <li> The battery life seems to be adequate as I have used it half a dozen times already with no noticeable decrease of power.</li>
            <li> I literally have red welts in the exact width of this thing&#x27;s shaving blade crisscrossing my back.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy if you are a first time back shaver or seasonal back shaver like myself.      </li>
            <li> &quot; the first time, then go back a second time and finish the job.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t use a lot of battery power and does a decent job on my back.</li>
            <li> Guys if you have back hair, do your significant other or family a favor and buy this product.  </li>
            <li> Either first or last position only</li>
            <li> However, I find its main short coming to be the end result.</li>
            <li> With several mowings behind me now, I continue to be very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> They developed a long folding handle which would probably work very well, except that it won&#x27;t hold</li>
            <li> No more back hair for me :)</li>
            <li> You will see some red marks on your back after the first couple uses, but they will vanish in 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li> 2ed one ,first one lasted a few years after much use.  </li>
            <li> It will cut your back hair down to the skin to the point that it is not noticeable but you will need to shave to create an upclose smooth look.  </li>
            <li> The power is inconsistent and the razor must not be sharp right out of the packaging, b/c it just didn&#x27;t work efficiently.  </li>
            <li> I would shake it and it would go back to high speed.  </li>
            <li> If you have hair on your back and have been thinking to shave it off, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly Recomend to anyone who&#x27;s gone the NAIR route only to say never again.</li>
            <li> The blade on this starts becoming dull after appx 6 times of using it.  </li>
            <li> I tried 4 different sets of new batteries and still nothing, unit was completely inoperative.     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a couple years now, bought a new one because my old one finally bit the dust.  </li>
            <li> At first the plastic design feels a little flimsy but after using, it&#x27;s pretty solid.</li>
            <li> Yes it is horribly cheap, but for about half the price of a back wax, what do you have to lose?</li>
            <li> It is not super smooth like using a blade, but for me, this is close enough!  </li>
            <li> The handle folds the unit into a shape I can easily store in the below sink cabinet and the result of the shave, though not completely smooth, is that I no longer have what amount to a mat on my back.</li>
            <li> I thought surely this razor would clean up my back pretty well, and I&#x27;m sorry to say I have been let down by this product.  </li>
            <li> If you have a little hair on your back, this is fine.  </li>
            <li> Since it was only $40 plus tax, and I saw mostly positive comments on this site, I&#x27;m asking for a replacement to see if second time is a charm...stay tuned.  </li>
            <li> The real test will be how long this thing lasts.</li>
            <li> Small and light weight.</li>
            <li> I love my husband but never loved his backhair.  </li>
            <li> They have really come a long way.  </li>
            <li> I got this as a partial sincere, partial gag-gift for my younger brother for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Really, not a big deal for me, and probably for most people (does anyone shave their back in front of other people, or while a spouse is sleeping in the same room?).</li>
            <li> The head to the shaver popped off the first time I used it and the telescoping feature is not very sturdy.</li>
            <li> I do wish it were more tighter at the hinge because especially if you are doing it yourself, then you need it to be firm when you work it at your back and not give in to the bending force.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> It was about this time that Pappy was starting to gain weight, very normal for a young man of his age, but for Pappy it was much different.</li>
            <li> This product is very cheaply made and impossible to clean, so I wouldn&#x27;t pay $9.99 if they offered.</li>
            <li> read many of the reviews before purchasing the Mangroomer and many of them mentioned that it will feel a little painful the first time you use it because you&#x27;re not used to how it makes contact with your skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this model works the same, but a part of me feels as if it doesn&#x27;t do the job on the first time like the previous model, the plastic does feel cheap but will last as long as your arent trying to break it on purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it took a couple of days for my skin to calm down. .</li>
            <li> After using this battery powered one, I will definitely make certain any future purchases come with that adapter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now the thing does not work unless you hit it a few times and hold it just the right way and even then it is very prone to starting and stopping.</li>
            <li> This groomer makes reaching the hard to reach areas easy.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer makes it easy to get to those hard to reach places.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s hard to reach quite easy.  </li>
            <li> , my hair did not get  hard as many people suspect in such products.</li>
            <li> Do not worry about sending back the defective unit, due that we do not want you to incur any further costs.&lt;br /&gt;Please feel free to contact us at anytime with anything additional.</li>
            <li> It allows men who live alone or can&#x27;t afford to have their back&#x27;s waxed an option.</li>
            <li> I may modify my rating if they actually follow through with a new one, as she promised.  </li>
            <li> reminiscent of that Don Johnson from Saturday Night Live, or Magnum PI or</li>
            <li> Finally a product for guys who live alone..</li>
            <li> I mailed the product back to the manufacturer and indicated the product was defective and I would like a new Mangroomer.  </li>
            <li> and they said they would ship new one immediately - received it two days later.  </li>
            <li> I hope the designers come out with a new design because I will definitely try it then.</li>
            <li> No, shave for several months than buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> THE KEY IS TO ALWAYS USE A NEW PAIR OF BATTERIES</li>
            <li> i emailed the customer service folks and they almost overnited me a new one with no questions asked the next day!</li>
            <li> He would have to buy a new set about once a month because the hair on his back would wear the motor out.</li>
            <li> i had huge red welts after a few seconds of using the mangroomer.</li>
            <li> It sucks batteries very quickly.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done, easy to use, it sucks that you can&#x27;t just charge it though.</li>
            <li> hair is dark and straight, not thick and curly, which some reviewers said it didnt work</li>
            <li> Overall, it actually leaves you fairly smooth, and it&#x27;s gently enough to use regularly to keep the hair short.</li>
            <li> I have used it once and did receive the nicks and cuts others have mentioned, but considering that you rarely cut your back hair that was to be expected.</li>
            <li> Based on what it does and the few options that men with back hair have available</li>
            <li> The only con is that shaving your back seems easier in the video or pics than it really is even with mirrors.</li>
            <li> It took me about 4 minutes to do my whole back, and I have a forest back there believe me, so that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t understand why some people said it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve rarely purchased an item that works for less than 5 seconds - this is one of them.  </li>
            <li> And finally, be ready for the challenge of doing the side of your back that is the same as the hand</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not fantastic, and your back won&#x27;t look like a baby&#x27;s butt after you&#x27;re done, but it does do an effective job of reducing the amount of visible hair once you learn the proper directions to pull in on various areas of your back.</li>
            <li> The actual clippers are nit fine enough to take the hair down.</li>
            <li> highly recommend the mangroomer back shaver to clear the back 40.  </li>
            <li> It took longer to drag out the vacuum and clean up the bathroom floor than it took to actually do the deed!    </li>
            <li> I was initially hesitant to buy this, fearing a cheaply made product due to the low cost, but I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised at the quality I&#x27;m actually receiving.</li>
            <li> Though I commend the innovative design, the clipper itself is too weak to cut hair.  </li>
            <li> I have one spot on my back where I got hit with a baseball when i was young that grows hair now!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Blades are sharp and cut on the first</li>
            <li> Next, don&#x27;t get hung up on the red splotches that you will see (in the mirror) on your back when you first start using this.</li>
            <li> It is not perfect, but it is lightweight, cuts well when flush against the surface of your skin and more manageable than an electric shaver (or razor - gasp!) taped to a broom handle.</li>
            <li> I read various reviews about this product from various places and that one word kept coming up all the time, \\&quot;smooth\\&quot;, and for all I had my reservations about this &#x27;shaver&#x27; in the first place, I put aside such skepticism and gave it a go</li>
            <li> Holding it as intended (or any other way you can think of) corrects this, so that the blades are exactly perpendicular to your skin.</li>
            <li> The teeth are not sharp and I have to pass it over an area a dozen times to see</li>
            <li> The blades are much too wide and after following all the instructions to a \\&quot;T\\&quot; ended up with a bloodied, nicked and very irritated back.</li>
            <li> I originally wrote a negative review for this product as it took considerable amount of effort to do the job</li>
            <li> I even tried oiling the blades before deciding on this review, thinking maybe they had dried out like many other clippers I have used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m delighted that other customers will see how poor your product and service is.</li>
            <li> His only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t come with any sort of guard in case you wanted to use it in other areas but all in all he was very pleased.</li>
            <li> Whether this is worthwhile for you depends on whether you&#x27;re moderately furry (like me) or have that serious caveman look.  </li>
            <li> Main complaints are that the clippers are really low quality and only work well with hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get a completely smooth shave...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made of light plastic and is hard to extend fully.  </li>
            <li> It feels cheap to the touch, and there is nothing that covers the blade to keep it from getting dull and dinged between uses.  </li>
            <li> It only makes sense that I would discover this a few months before my laser treatment starts, but if you&#x27;re looking for a quick way to shave your back without asking the new girlfriend to do it for you-</li>
            <li> but patience and a little determination prevailed and my back is finally hair free.</li>
            <li> ha, seriously very little trial and error and without looking I got 60% of it, in the mirror 1/2 looking another 30% and then with detailed attention got the last 10%.  </li>
            <li> Conventional shavers just didn&#x27;t cut it as they didn&#x27;t allow full access to my entire back.</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews that were positive</li>
            <li> The construction is generally flimsy.   </li>
            <li> feels cheaply, made razor is not effective.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m puzzled by some of the negative reviews because this thing is, IMO, a fabulous product.  </li>
            <li> My advice to anyone considering purchasing the Mangroomer is to have your back waxed by a professional.</li>
            <li> If you are self conscious about your back hair, order this now.</li>
            <li> This thing makes you have a complete hairless back.</li>
            <li> Apparently some of these trimmers are defective -   </li>
            <li> I called Mangroomer and apparently got their after hour answer service.  </li>
            <li> Returned immediately; will look for something well-made or will just go back to my au natural state.</li>
            <li> I still believe that a professional waxing is the way to go for those who have never done a thing back there.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the easiest trimmer I have ever used on my back.</li>
            <li> It does reach spots, but it barely trims hair at all and severely scratches skin.  </li>
            <li> I barely even used this item.  </li>
            <li> Was also surprised to find that this item operates on AA batteries instead of a chargable internal battery.</li>
            <li> After having tried darn near everything to shave my back, the Mangroomer has got it!</li>
            <li> Yes it scratched and left marks, but I&#x27;m not too surprised that it did.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s completely  aggravating running it over the same spot over and over and over.</li>
            <li> Only used it once so far</li>
            <li> Not only is my back very hairy, but the hair rubbing against my shirt makes it itch constantly throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> This is a solid investment for anyone who needs to reach areas that have so far been inaccessible.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Batteries last so far about 8 weeks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t remove your hair entirely (like shaving with a razor would), but it does remove nearly all of the hair.</li>
            <li> no regrets.</li>
            <li> and still it barely did anything.</li>
            <li> my only gripe would be that it doesn&#x27;t flex all the way straight to 180 degrees, this is a pretty small</li>
            <li> There is only one drawback, this thing is loud as hell.</li>
            <li> Does not really perform very well.</li>
            <li> handle let you reach nearly everywhere to trim your back.  </li>
            <li> and it barely works - it didn&#x27;t evenly or fully remove the hair.    </li>
            <li> It takes me a couple goes at my back to get it complete void of hair.</li>
            <li> Regardless of my potential scientific or freak-show value, the \\&quot;ManGroomer\\&quot; has thus far proven to be the device I&#x27;ve been seeking.      </li>
            <li> I purchased this one and it has picked up where the old on left off.</li>
            <li> The window to return or replace it has apparently passed.</li>
            <li> Tried to return but apparently, this product has a no return policy...</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re planning on shaving your back for the beach, just make sure you shave at least the day before because your back will have scratch marks from the razor.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t get all the hair on the first pass, but subsequent tries finished the job.</li>
            <li> But as many people say on here, it is poorly constructed.  </li>
            <li> I have a pretty good tolerance for pain and not particularly sensitive skin, but this thing is too painful to try to use.    </li>
            <li> allow me to admit that I had missed this fatal flaw before buying the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reviewers who reported the ManGroomer effective either failed to mention they had help, or were lying about using it alone.</li>
            <li> This does trim it down to the skin, so there is a smooth feeling, how long that last depends on who you are.</li>
            <li> and WOW it trimmed the hedges down to the skin much like</li>
            <li> The hair on my back is very fine, thin, and sparse.  </li>
            <li> Now Pappy was familiar with commercial versions used in barber shops and they could do little to the forest of back hair he had.</li>
            <li> * OK, So, after submitting this review Mangroomer has sent me a message (that&#x27;s different from the reply here where all can see) where they accuse me of \\&quot;making fake positive reviews\\&quot; for a different item on Amazon</li>
            <li> I posted a one star review here noting the short life of the unit and shortly after the Mangroomer company contacted me with an offer to send a new unit in exchange for revising my one star review (they sent, I edited).  </li>
            <li> The only downside (other than the higher price) of the professional version is that when the recharger part of it finally wears out, the instructions tell you don&#x27;t just throw it out, there&#x27;s a circuit board inside that needs to be removed and recycled, but the instructions don&#x27;t say how or even where to go to recycle this part.</li>
            <li> Not too bad but batteries drain quickly and isnt the easiest thing to use&lt;br /&gt;Could be configured to be more sturdy.</li>
            <li> I wish that it cost less, but not having to ask my wife to shave my back before I go swimming is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> For what it&#x27;s worth, I am not super hairy, I would say you would need an initial cut with a beefier trimmer before using this for maintenance.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d urge someone to think long and hard before you purchase this item yourself, you likely won&#x27;t get smooth results if you&#x27;re anything up to average on the hairy scale, but you will get convenience and from a distance it does give my back that smooth appearance, it&#x27;s just a shame that close up</li>
            <li> I guess others have better success, but i&#x27;m not supporting this lame product again.  </li>
            <li> right now wasted money and unusable.</li>
            <li> And i&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just the one i got, the shaver is very cheaply made, it&#x27;s very loose and does not hold it&#x27;s different angles.  </li>
            <li> A little on the light side and there is no way to lock the handle at the middle and that causes&lt;br /&gt;it to open up when you are trying to mow back there.</li>
            <li> You will need to remove the hair some other way first, and then, perhaps, use this as a way to KEEP the hair short.</li>
            <li> Takes some time to get everything if you don&#x27;t have someone to help you, but the good news is, you CAN shave your whole back if you are patient enough, which was impossible prior to this razor!</li>
            <li> In addition, the blade itself is not very wide, so it takes longer to shave than seems practical.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried 2 other shavers to much frustration and 30-45 minute sessions of trying to trim down.&lt;br /&gt;Got</li>
            <li> The shave is comfortable and close, but the blades aren&#x27;t sharp enough to disturb warts or other skin imperfections.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to keep it clean.</li>
            <li> I can finally walk around outside with my shirt off and look like a normal human being.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to overestimate the satisfaction of having a smooth, hairless back.  </li>
            <li> if it breaks, I&#x27;ll definitely be buying a new one same day, might go for the pro model next time</li>
            <li> Only negative is it is so lightweight it feels cheap</li>
            <li> ONLY NEGATIVE IS THAT IT WASN&#x27;T AVAILABLE</li>
            <li> but it was fairly easy to use (not perfect) but worked very well on my back.  </li>
            <li> I was self conscious of the amount of back hair I had and did not want to ask a friend to help shave my back.</li>
            <li> I would definitely suggest this product to anyone who is in the slightest self conscious about their back hair.</li>
            <li> I had no trouble reaching every part of my back and could trim my entire body if I wished.</li>
            <li> I also have virtually no redness/irritation, and I find that I only need to shave once a month to keep my back nearly hairless.</li>
            <li> I would definitely suggest this product to anyone who is in the slightest self conscious about their back hair.  </li>
            <li> I can only use the Mangroomer by holding it with the upper end of the handle, the part near the razor head.</li>
            <li> Tired of having more hair on your back than on your head??</li>
            <li> I am tired of those smelly liquides that just burn you&#x27;re skin... plus how do you get your hands on most of your back...  </li>
            <li> It is good at cutting short hair but longer hair takes a couple of passes.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews, one person took the time to describe the challenge and how to use a fair technique on cutting back hair.  </li>
            <li> Excellent, have always hated back hair, now can get it gone by myself</li>
            <li> I felt like I had been dragged down the road on my back afetr the first use.  </li>
            <li> For the first time, I can do it all myself with little effort.</li>
            <li> For the first time, I can do it all myself with little effort.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little tricky to get used to at first</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve never had anything I&#x27;ve ever bought that you needed to plug in to recharge it to ever give out on me, or at least I have absolutely no memory of that ever happening to me, so I&#x27;m confident I&#x27;ll have the professional version around for quite a long time before that ever happens, if it ever does.</li>
            <li> , it was an odd feeling having my shirt touch my back for the first time in longer than I can remember.  </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t extend quite as far as I had expected, so reaching some of the most difficult areas of the back (particularly the lower-middle area) can be quite a nuisance.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this product since it is hard to get people to shave your back.</li>
            <li> , I found that the blades cut pretty close and as long as you don&#x27;t press too hard won&#x27;t cause much irritation.</li>
            <li> But, unlike other back shavers, this one really does not lock.  </li>
            <li> : Use sewing machine oil to lubrucate the blade (not any other type of oil), it will then last much longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hears to bare back!</li>
            <li> Basically it barely worked, and it will be going back to Amazon.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does exactly what is announced and on my opinion just a trimming level control is missing.</li>
            <li> My first time the device lasted a few months and then it just died.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I did produce a few scratches but they cleared up in a day.</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to the manuevering in a mirror to get the angles right to cover your entire back</li>
            <li> It did leave my back a little scratched up at first</li>
            <li> It is not sharp enough to actually shave anything.  </li>
            <li> Finish was very smooth, I immediately had my wife apply Jojoba Oil to deal with the slight skin abrasion from the groomer, I think I was pushing too hard in the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;Card</li>
            <li> The packaging sucks, and it seems to be made with standard poor production Chinese methods, but the thing works great.</li>
            <li> I could feel my life slipping away after 30 minutes,I then broke the MANGROOMER into pieces just to fit it in the small trash can in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> , basically keeps the grass mowed to a reasonable, much less visible height.</li>
            <li> much confidence shown by the manufacturer in their product.&lt;br /&gt;Just received it and in less than 10 minutes</li>
            <li> I got it around six months ago and it does shave your back, but I generally still walk away with a noticeable amount of back hair.</li>
            <li> He gets wild long hairs on his back and likes to keep them shaved.  </li>
            <li> It left razor burn all over my back because the blade guard is apparently non-existent.  </li>
            <li> Second one I&#x27;ve owned -- misplaced first one in a move.  </li>
            <li> , however, the first few times I used it I ended up with scratches all over my back.</li>
            <li> However, after the failure of two consecutive units in such a relatively short period of time, I think it&#x27;s important to provide this feedback for potential Mangroomer buyers.</li>
            <li> might* work for a few people with a very certain hair type, very flat backs, or something...</li>
            <li> If you hate looking in the mirror in the morning because you feel like Sasquatch is looking back at you, and you have more hair on your back than on your head, this is the device you need; especially if you are in-between &amp;#34;significant others&amp;#34; and there is no one available to use a razor on your back.  </li>
            <li> Works well - makes it easier to reach the hard to reach areas but would be better if there were a slight curve to the handle to make using it even easier</li>
            <li> Previously I strapped my Norelco Bodygroom to a back scratcher with numerous rubber bands, and achieved limited success.</li>
            <li> Out of the box I installed new batteries, after 25 minutes of a complete struggle with this waste of money.</li>
            <li> What is really remarkable about this product is that while it&#x27;s fully capable of shredding your flesh, it has a hard time cutting human hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not super hairy, but I had to do my whole back.</li>
            <li> Just like one previous reviewer said they last for just about a year so whether you buy the rechargeable or this cheaper version don&#x27;t expect there to be much of a difference in the life expectancy.</li>
            <li> Most of your back hair grows down, so that means shaving \\&quot;up\\&quot; by extending the arm on the product and pulling it slowly up your back.  </li>
            <li> i didnt want to deal with the mess of trying to shave my back with a razor and shaving cream, so i felt the mangroomer would be much easier.</li>
            <li> The product performs its function ok (adequate, not great), just did not like the poor quality.  </li>
            <li> and it was too small to hold anything other than cheap razor, so i cut up my back, yuck...</li>
            <li> A little flimsy, but it shaves very close.</li>
            <li> The plastic housing is a bit cheap and I seriously wonder how long it will last.      </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work properly, i was very dissapointed at the product, hair gets stuck between the blades and just cuts a little amount of hair.</li>
            <li> I have medium density back hair and really wanted to do something about it and this little groomer was the solution.</li>
            <li> My back was a little red after I was done, but it went away fast and</li>
            <li> The particular ways I must move the mangroomer around on my back have become familiar patterns of movement, they only feel awkward the first few times until you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time getting the right angle.  </li>
            <li> Mangroomer is powerful enough to cut right through without snagging, pulling, or cutting.</li>
            <li> With its long arm I can get my whole back by my self in less then 10 min.</li>
            <li> Simply put, it works, which is amazing, as I thought there weren&#x27;t any options here other than waxing, which gave me acne, and expensive laser hair removal.      </li>
            <li> This is a unique product that helps get the tough spots.  </li>
            <li> This tool really makes trimming the hair from areas not easily reached.  </li>
            <li> Using a hand mirror and the bathroom (or other fixed) mirror is the only way to get started.  </li>
            <li> (i.e. Kinda like a vacuum) &lt;br</li>
            <li> I mentioned earlier, I also have a decent amount of \\&quot;flat\\&quot; moles (a few freckles here and there as well) on my back &amp; shoulders.  </li>
            <li> After using this, I had a certain swagger usually reversed for only athletes, movie stars, and political figures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The battery cap started to fall off and the shaver would shut down every 30 seconds or so, even with new batteries.  </li>
            <li> Its long enough for           me to reach the most difficult back spots.   </li>
            <li> Other than that, do not waste your money or time</li>
            <li> Wow, was not expecting the cutters to be so sharp.</li>
            <li> Further, once you get a feel for this, I recommend NOT looking into the mirror but use this like you would use a back-scrubber or loofah for washing your back -- visualize it on your back and use long \\&quot;up\\&quot; strokes.  </li>
            <li> If one has a rug on the back, go slow until it&#x27;s thinned out or try to cut off with scissors as much as possible first.  </li>
            <li> Apparently a wire or something electronic in the Mangroomer unit had become loose or burned out.    </li>
            <li> I think the price a little high for the plastic construction of it.</li>
            <li> The mangroomer works pretty well to get those hard to reach areas on your back</li>
            <li> Sometimes it comes down at weird angles and kind of scratches up my back.</li>
            <li> The handle is covered in fake rubber that smells like paint thinner, the plastic is incredibly cheap, and when you extend it it barely keeps from falling apart.</li>
            <li> Have not tried the Razorba product, but I did not think it would work for me, at least at first, given the length and amount of hair on my back.  </li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this product after coming to the conclusion that having my back hair professionally removed (i.e., by electrolysis or laser treatment) would simply not be worth the cost.</li>
            <li> So I go with it and the whole shave takes a small fraction of what it used to take with a standard clipper.</li>
            <li> The long handle makes it possible to reach every area of my back.  </li>
            <li> My only concern is how long it could last since it didn&#x27;t feel like it was assembled too well</li>
            <li> It is also long enough to reach all spots of your back.  </li>
            <li> Then I was surprised that it ran on two AA batteries which will not stay in place unless you put the battery cap on, and even the battery cap had to be pushed into place a few times before it barely clicked shut.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it would work on really thick hair, but I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> The motor is ample to get the job done even with thick patches in various spots and even with the first cut, it didn&#x27;t cause any skin irritation.</li>
            <li> The only problem I find is the whole thing is really out of balance and difficult to compensate when looking in the mirror and keeping the cutter square on the back.</li>
            <li> and, dare I say, when my batteries were near dead and the MANGROOMER Do-It-Yourself Electric Back Hair Shaver was struggling to draw enough power to continue to MANGROOM, I actually *</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give it five stars because of the construction as it is made mostly of plastic and feels a little weak.</li>
            <li> It worked pretty well and wasn&#x27;t too hard to use.  </li>
            <li> I bought this as a less expensive alternative to a popular brand after reading the reviews and I have the Cat Marks to show for it.  </li>
            <li> a few users mentioned it scratching up your back, I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The cutting head is cheap and will leave tracks on your back, and I do not have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> There is no more twisting and pulling muscles to reach around and try to shave, this is so much easier to do.</li>
            <li> I guess it got the job done, but I am not sure how much longer it will continue to work.    </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t expect the unit to last long.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel like it will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> Well, this he-Mangroomer does the job of letting you get that monkey off your back (so to speak).</li>
            <li> Some minor irritation, but after the shower that went away completely, my back just needed to get used to being shaven</li>
            <li> It works, but I don&#x27;t know how long it will last.  </li>
            <li> I take care of it and don&#x27;t abuse it, however, it will eventually die for no apparent reason.</li>
            <li> Cant believe that I have been trying to bend my arms all the way around using regular hand held clippers for so long.  </li>
            <li> The batteries last a long time though.  </li>
            <li> Keep the trimming blade flat against the skin at all times, not at an angle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long enough and angles</li>
            <li> I recommend this product...as long as you know it only runs on batteries.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how long the blade and batteries last.</li>
            <li> Third, the trimmer head lasts a long time, and can be replaced.  </li>
            <li> I wish that I had gotten this baby a long time ago for my back.  </li>
            <li> Wouldnt mind if it extended out totally flat.</li>
            <li> But you shouldn&#x27;t have long hair once you start clipping it regularly!    </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve amended the review to add an additional star for the efforts put forward by Mangroomer to try to provide a fully working device.&lt;br /&gt;Mangroomer stood by their offer in the reply to my initial review and sent out a replacement, though not without additional minor inconveniences (see reply string for details).  </li>
            <li> , the only thing is that my hair is thick and when I used this product it left my hair prickly and if I really wanted the hair all the way gone</li>
            <li> I have disgustingly thick back, shoulder, and upper arm hair (everywhere really).</li>
            <li> It worked well for one year, and then it broke down completely.  </li>
            <li> The first time I tried the Mangroomer, it had been a while since I been clipped and the hair was a little long, but not exactly bushy.  </li>
            <li> This product does scratch skin a little and does hurt just a little...but it does cut VERY close, so that is really expected.</li>
            <li> This is my second experience with the Mangroomer;     After ordering one a few years ago when they first came out, i tried and tried to get it to work - it was literally among the most painful experiences of my life.</li>
            <li> It works really well, little tough to get used to at first.</li>
            <li> I remember that it felt a bit awkward to use this product in general when I first bought it, but that was only when it was new to me.</li>
            <li> I previously posted the review below, and contacted Mangroomer directly for a refund.</li>
            <li> The adjustment can reach most of your back but the cutting instrument hurts and cuts into your skin.</li>
            <li> The blade does a better job cutting my back than shaving.</li>
            <li> It allows access to difficult to reach back areas and provides a smooth finish.  </li>
            <li> What it will do is trim the hair to a barely noticeable soft stubble, and no more.</li>
            <li> The problem is it seems very cheep in the way it&#x27;s made, and after a few tries this thing is broke and no longer works at all.</li>
            <li> It has a wide blade and does work if your patient enough to go over the same spot a couple of times</li>
            <li> Also, as its not a straight edge, I get zero in-grown hairs which is key to me because you always see those guys with razor marks and in-grown hairs on their back.  </li>
            <li> Luckily the broken piece did not effect the performance of the unit.</li>
            <li> This thing could not cut one single hair from my back no matter</li>
            <li> I could not cut a single square inch on my back.</li>
            <li> There is such limited options out there for manscaping that I give this 5 stars when it should be 4 stars.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought the one from here first, then a year or so later (when I thought I had left it behind in another state)</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t affect the performance as the pressure you apply keeps it rigid, but it still has that initial loose feel to</li>
            <li> Worked fine for about 6 months, then the coil spring holding the battery broke, rendering it useless.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver and did not expect too much due to the low price and the difficulty of shaving your back.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, if you aren&#x27;t currently shaving your back hair and think this would help.</li>
            <li> You have to attack the hair from different angles and positions, but you can shave an entire back in less than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> MANGROOMER Ultimate Pro Back Shaver with 2 Shock Absorber Flex Heads, Power Hinge, Extreme Reach Handle and Power Burst]]</li>
            <li> The only differences I could see were that this model is battery operated whereas the other is rechargeable and has a cord, and I think something about the handle is different.  </li>
            <li> The motor finally died this week and we are replacing with same product without even checking other options.</li>
            <li> I had heard the Mangroomer ads on Sirius XM, but $40 always seemed excessive, particularly as I&#x27;ve purchased a number of beard and (head)</li>
            <li> You simply open the Mangroomer up and bring the shaving head up and down slowly, but not too slowly, for most your back.</li>
            <li> It does scratch your skin when shaving, and it will hurt a little if you have sensitive skin like I do.  </li>
            <li> Hope it doesn&#x27;t dull fast.</li>
            <li> I tried it from all angles, slowly, flat and alligned to my back, against the grain, with the grain, sideways, but the trimmer was not very powerful.  </li>
            <li> It didnt come with any oil for the cutting blade and it takes AA batteries it would have been alot better if it had a built in batterie.</li>
            <li> My 10 dollar shaver does a better job at cutting my hair.     </li>
            <li> My back is so smooth and completely free of those UGLY hairs!!</li>
            <li> It felt more like it was scraping against skin and trying to pull the hairs from their roots rather than cutting them.</li>
            <li> It feels like it is ripping hair out by the roots, more than cutting them with blades...</li>
            <li> A complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Noisy and not near as close as a razor, but accomplishes the task.</li>
            <li> This conversation got her thinking how our vacation weekend would be with just the two of us minus my back hair.</li>
            <li> There way to long in my opinion.</li>
            <li> A minor annoyance, but it&#x27;s something that will have you wiping it off with a rag to get rid of all that hair clinging to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> diameter and 1-1/4\\&quot; long.  </li>
            <li> Come on, it is a light-duty, battery powered trimmer on a long plastic handle.</li>
            <li> , we&#x27;ll see how long it lasts.  </li>
            <li> and it takes a long time to get there.</li>
            <li> would recommend that like shaving anywhere, do it on a normal schedule, b/c shaving small hairs is easier, so</li>
            <li> This product is something I wish I had discovered a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> I hope it surprises me and lasts a long time, but I&#x27;m not holding my breath.</li>
            <li> I should of looked for a product like this a long time ago.</li>
            <li> its a minor design issue, so no problems there.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s long term durability.  </li>
            <li> I guess I had it that long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairy guy, but not so hairy that a razor made for trimming back hair would have a rough time.  </li>
            <li> I wish I would have bought this a long time ago...</li>
            <li> but the shave is not nearly as close as initially.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Long handle&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> That aside, it scratched up my skin leaving big, pink sore patches.  </li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t wait too long between uses.it</li>
            <li> My only suggestion is if when fully closed you could extend the head of the shaver out.</li>
            <li> Needs a remote camera device on it so you can see you got all the back hair off.</li>
            <li> The directions suggest it may take time for skin to adjust/experience minor irritation ---- to clip the hair</li>
            <li> Doing the job will take a LONG time, and it&#x27;s gonna hurt.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I am curious to see how long it will last given</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get very close, and can&#x27;t handle thick hair.</li>
            <li> A little awkward to use at first,but you get the hang of it pretty quickly..</li>
            <li> The only way I can results with this is to use an up and down or back and forth type motion.</li>
            <li> Since then, I&#x27;ve experimented with my shaving technique and I&#x27;ve cut down the overall time it takes to shave by a third, from about 30 minutes to 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> Then I do the upper and middle from the over the shoulder method, pulling up instead of trying to push it down.  </li>
            <li> THE BLADES DULL QUICKLY AND THE UNIT WAS PROBABLY MADE FOR UNDER A FEW DOLLARS.  </li>
            <li> And it is not dangerously sharp, just irritating sharp at first.     </li>
            <li> Somewhat expensive, but very useful.</li>
            <li> The size of the shaver head will def surprise, it shaved entire back in less than 3 minutes.  </li>
            <li> After a half of year or so, the head would not stay attached, so i rubber banded it, eventually threw it out, and got a razor shaver, but now i am back to using this.</li>
            <li> I shaved half (left side) of my back with it.  </li>
            <li> So you get a less hairy back, but it&#x27;s still a hairy back!!</li>
            <li> mean you can&#x27;t expect much for something</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little hard at first to master the coordination looking in a mirror, and one of those double mirrors like in a dressing room would help, but it got the job done.  </li>
            <li> I do have some shoulder issues so it can be tough reaching certain areas at times around mid-upper back.</li>
            <li> Well it does make a big difference on my back and other areas that I was unhappy with all these years!!!&lt;br /&gt;very easy to use too, no cuts or bruises.</li>
            <li> Removes hair easily and quickly, as long as cutting edge is flat against skin.  </li>
            <li> The device also works well for other body parts, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be trying to trim anything too personal.</li>
            <li> But anyway, I started to use this tool on my back, legs, calves, thighs and all sorts of other places.</li>
            <li> You can lock the handle at various angles and the blades don&#x27;t pinch or hurt like some other trimmers.</li>
            <li> but maybe the blade is not sharp enough, not really sure</li>
            <li> The blades on my second trimmer are, dare I say, TOO sharp.   </li>
            <li> but it lasted a long time!  </li>
            <li> My routine is to use it before getting in the shower so all the little hairs wash off and my skin tone evens out, because after use you will definitely notice red irritation marks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would go with this type of oroduct but try a different brand due to the quality.  </li>
            <li> Your back is just not used to coming in contact with something this sharp.  </li>
            <li> Overall I recommend this product since other than waxing or laser</li>
            <li> I do find the angle to feel a little flimsy, when you snap it into the specific angle you want, it wiggles, a benefit of this, is it allows the mangroomer to move and adjust easier to your back.</li>
            <li> I tried the other side and it just stopped working, I would go over the same spot 3 or 4 times and no hair would be cut.</li>
            <li> You see, I don&#x27;t have any hair on my back, except, err, the little downy white hairs.  </li>
            <li> Changed and tried multiple sets of other batteries...</li>
            <li> Due to not needing it often, I expect my 2 AAs to last for quite a while.</li>
            <li> A little digging reveals that if the item is damaged you can refer to the refunds policy - which simply refers you back to the returns page, which informs you to look at the refunds policy, which refers you to the returns page...</li>
            <li> Very loud so don&#x27;t use this during the night and don&#x27;t use it if you&#x27;re in a rush to a pull because it leaves little marks or trail on your back but goes away in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> but it won&#x27;t be doing it for very long.</li>
            <li> No scratching or other red marks (only initial &amp;#34;inflamation&amp;#34; after use, but goes away after a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> The surprise came when I found that the 2 batteries have a very long life.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It also runs a very long time on a set of alkaline batteries.  </li>
            <li> There were many reviews of this product that talked about a lack of power, and the inability to trim hairs as well as being painful to use and red splotches and bumps associated with using this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten serious skin infections after using the Mangroomer because it cuts the skin so readily.    </li>
            <li> It seems there is too much of a gap between the cutting blades to do much.</li>
            <li> This thing has a great design approach hampered by an extremely poor cutting device.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different devices in the attempt to manage back hair.  </li>
            <li> My back was red in spots, but that cleared up in a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> Since this is the first time I&#x27;ve trimmed my back, I have no ideal</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few similar products, and this is the only one that gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I owned a regular Mangroomer a few years ago and used it extensively</li>
            <li> Does not work - get clogged with hair and all it&#x27;s useful for is an expensive back scratcher.  </li>
            <li> Having to put in batteries was a pain but the more expensive one has the built battery, not a huge deal.</li>
            <li> I found it a little awkward for the first 20 seconds or so, but when I got the hand of it it was just bloody awesome.  </li>
            <li> if there&#x27;s hair on our backs, it&#x27;s probably not little girly hair--it might be thick and coarse.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m single, I needed to find a way to do it myself.</li>
            <li> But on about my 4th time using it (after a long time just sitting there) it powered on for half a second and then died.  </li>
            <li> Some other reviewers have mentioned that your back can turn red and seem slightly irritated after shaving.</li>
            <li> there is extremely cheap and does a better job cutting skin than it does cutting hair.    </li>
            <li> I have an average amount of hair on my back</li>
            <li> They used to last about one year on average.  </li>
            <li> I was long curious about this product and wanted to share my experiences.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given it a few tries now and each time it leaves red marks all over my back and burns for days.  </li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s not a great product and it hurts at first</li>
            <li> the plus side, it does reach down your back or</li>
            <li> , it was just a copious amount of blood flowing down my ravaged back, presumably from the mole I had forgotten about and had, well, MANGROOMED, I suppose you could say.  </li>
            <li> your goal is only to cut down on the number of sasquatch sightings when you go to the beach, this is all you&#x27;ll need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the hair on my back grows fast and fairly thick and this works really well using a pushing type motion.  </li>
            <li> normally  not the hairiest at the beach or the gym, but usually a close second or third.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that if you don&#x27;t keep the blade flat against your back, the plastic and metal edges will scratch the daylights out of you.</li>
            <li> Obviously these things are produced for about a buck and a half each.    </li>
            <li> It took less then 10 min to fully shave my back with the Mangroomer.</li>
            <li> Once you get the hang of behind-the-back manipulation (and anyone who has been attempting to groom their back previously will already be somewhat facile at this task)the device is a breeze.</li>
            <li> As far as cutting it is like a hot knife thru butter.</li>
            <li> Took less than 5 minutes to groom my back.</li>
            <li> When I got it I was thinking I was going to be getting the same results I usually get when I try to remove my back hair.</li>
            <li> However, when you figure you spend $15 on a bottle of Nair you can use twice, you only need to use this thing a half dozen times to come out ahead.  </li>
            <li> I had a slight issue with a product and their customer support team went above in beyond to fix the issue.</li>
            <li> It is like if you took a thin pencil (or similar flat long object) and it only cut when it was totally flat against the desired area.</li>
            <li> This is my second mangroomer, my first one was dropped by careless roommate.</li>
            <li> My last one was rechargeable and the batteries were the first to fail.</li>
            <li> Being your typical big, macho, hairy guy, I&#x27;ve got hair growing everywhere.</li>
            <li> After that first grueling session, if you keep a regular grooming regimen it will be much easier, faster, and way less painful.    </li>
            <li> If you drop it once it&#x27;ll likely break in half.  </li>
            <li> My only wonder, is what the benefit is to the higher end (read: expensive) model...</li>
            <li> Furthermore, after receiving the second unit, I took the first one apart in a failed attempt to repair it.  </li>
            <li> It does leave a slight red mark here</li>
            <li> Not only was it causing me way more pain than before, it wasn&#x27;t even cutting any of the hair!</li>
            <li> Relatively simple piece of technology, doesn&#x27;t cut you and makes life a lot less acrobatic</li>
            <li> At first I thought I just had the angel wrong, but I tried to cut the hair on my arm for a test, and same thing</li>
            <li> My wife asked me what I wanted for Father&#x27;s Day, I half jokingly said a back groomer with an extendable handle.</li>
            <li> For the packaging and all I would have expected a cleaning brush or something, and was kind of disappointed to see that it didn&#x27;t come with one.</li>
            <li> My hair is not very coarse or thick but this just barely does the trick.</li>
            <li> Did not have much trouble with it not wanting to cut my hair, but I had previously trimmed it down and used this while my hair was already really short so not much trouble for it.</li>
            <li> I just wonder how long it will stay as sharp as it is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a teen, and I&#x27;ve not loved my back hair for the last two years to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The only problem I had was trying not to make a mess all over the bathroom while looking in the mirror while shaving.</li>
            <li> Some people worry about little scratches if the clipper is not completely flat........</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long the batteries last since I haven&#x27;t had it that long.</li>
            <li> It folds open but feels a little loose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m over 6 feet tall and had trouble reaching down on the middle of my back.  </li>
            <li> You will want to set it down carefully and hold it with a gentle grip, lest you inadvertently crack it open by squeezing a little too hard.  </li>
            <li> The only feature I would change is the ability to extend the handle completely straight instead of slightly curved which makes it a little hard to handle.  </li>
            <li> Now wrap the ends of the duct tape around the back of the spatula really tightly.</li>
            <li> I had only a few small areas where I could feel stuble, so next time I will just take an extra minute to do those better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sometimes it causes some red marks on my back that look like scratches (not even 1/4 as bad as razors), but they will go away quickly after you use it for a while.</li>
            <li> It is not a clean shave, though, so while it improves back hair problems, it does not eliminate them.</li>
            <li> The disgust I have for back hair outweighs a little temporary suffering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Perhaps future models will have materials that are a little stronger.</li>
            <li> No irritation or problems and you get a little bit of a back scratch in the process.</li>
            <li> To give you a little background, the one trait that I inherited from the Italian side of my family is the body hair.</li>
            <li> My husband went into the bathroom with this little beauty and came out smiling about 1/2 hour later.</li>
            <li> Leaving a little stubble may be preferable to a close shave: some men develop ingrown hairs when close shaving their backs.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re buying this for the handle, which allows you to reach all points of your back.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s going to take a little time to get it figured out, but basically it&#x27;s simple to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now that I do, I&#x27;m very insecure about it, and would have my girlfriend use a beard trimmer to clean up my back before a day at the pool or beach.</li>
            <li> I know how difficult it can be to reach certain places on your back if you&#x27;ve got hair that you like to keep well groomed.</li>
            <li> Found out the hard way, that this works with Batteries, my old one worked/came with ac adapter..was rechargeable.</li>
            <li> bought this, having a hard time deciding between the pro and the basic one, but anyways I purchased the basic one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Finally, a tool that reach all the spots on your back that were so hard to shave.</li>
            <li> The joint will twist backwards now making it much more difficult to get the hard areas.  </li>
            <li> Dull blades from Day 1 will tug and snag every last hair from your back.</li>
            <li> Move the shaver back and forth very slowly over the same area and virtually all the unsightly hair is caught in only two passes.  </li>
            <li> This is a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> Blade to cheap, stopped cutting even after cleaning.    </li>
            <li> This is one of the most painful products that I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> The unit is definitely cheaply constructed, which is fairly disappointing considering the price.</li>
            <li> This product is cheaply made, including the razor which felt like it was cutting the skin.</li>
            <li> I felt kind of stupid for not buying one sooner.</li>
            <li> I noticed that my hair grew back just the same time frame as a razor, yet I didn&#x27;t have the negative effects with this as I did with a razor blade.</li>
            <li> This mole... removed... just for the cost of the MANGROOMER Do-It-Yourself Electric Back Hair Shaver which happens to be much cheaper than a dermatologist if one&#x27;s insurance fails to cover said removal.  </li>
            <li> It seemed like the cutting edge couldn&#x27;t vibrate fast enough to actually cut the hair and was pulling it instead.</li>
            <li> It really was poorly constructed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a rough week.  </li>
            <li> But there&#x27;s nothing especially flexible about it, it just makes the trimmer longer, and maybe helps at a few angles.   </li>
            <li> There are absolutely no negatives.</li>
            <li> AS EXPECTED .WACKS</li>
            <li> Not really necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blade</li>
            <li> and so is $39.99 I spent on it after one year.    </li>
            <li> \\&quot;A BIG waste of MONEY\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Also the thing would not power on after only a few uses unless I banged on it repeatedly</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re careful, then should be no problem.  </li>
            <li> The second unit&#x27;s blades were not precise and literally tore the hair off my body.  </li>
            <li> With a spouse that doesn&#x27;t want to deal with a patchy carpet on my back, there have been few solutions until today.</li>
            <li> I have owned two of these over the last few years.</li>
            <li> It leaves stubble, not a smooth back.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re on the fence - order it the money is well spent</li>
            <li> leaves a rough stubble.</li>
            <li> A total waste of money.</li>
            <li> The hinge in the center does not lock so the end of the groomer wobbles when you hold it by the handle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Mangroomer a few times and am relatively staisfied with it.</li>
            <li> My back was not completely smooth.  </li>
            <li> Big waste of money.  </li>
            <li> but mine only lasted a few months</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting my back waxed for a few years and the cost is $40 (includes tip) for each visit.</li>
            <li> Had another one for a few years but the motor finally quit.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Also I have only had this a few months</li>
            <li> But the heads are poorly built, abd wear out fast.</li>
            <li> I only had to make a few passes to do</li>
            <li> I do not think you could get closer even with a wet blade shave.</li>
            <li> I would really not recommend buying it.</li>
            <li> after roughly 15 minutes of tricky mirror angling i was finished.</li>
            <li> It lasted only a few time after so</li>
            <li> what I expected out of it.</li>
            <li> the only problem with this product is that the motor stops working for no reason after a few uses.</li>
            <li> All that said, I consider this thing to be money well spent.      </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it does not work nearly as well as the one that I bought back in 2007, but if I go over an area several times, it will eventually cut the hair</li>
            <li> Not much else to say.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s understandable considering that it&#x27;s not a straight razor.</li>
            <li> But this execution is near fatally flawed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem is lack of power and poor materials - totally out of whack with the cost of the thing.  </li>
            <li> I have other grooming products, but was unable to reach certain areas of my back.</li>
            <li> However, these moles on my back do sprout such hairs and while my back is otherwise hairless, these clusters of black hairs become a subject of amusement which, sadly, lends fuel to my anxiety whilst cavorting amongst my colleagues, relaxing in a sauna, streaking naked across various sporting events, or what have you.&lt;br</li>
            <li> On the occasions my wife has actually shaved the hair down to the skin, I&#x27;ve been pretty uncomfortable with the resulting sharp hairs that surface a few days later.</li>
            <li> I do mean loud, so don&#x27;t try this at night while others are sleeping.</li>
            <li> You certainly wouldn&#x27;t see my faintly tanned, extremely white self on national TV with a 3 inch black hair growing out of a rather unfortunately located facial mole (as was the case with the aforementioned professional gambler -- perhaps a means to distract his opponents?).  </li>
            <li> After trying a few other back shaving products I found this product.</li>
            <li> I will admit that if you are clipping long hair, the trimmer may pull slightly.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to pull your back hair out at the roots - especially in those tender, hard to reach areas at the small of your back - then this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> He is now less hairy and slightly less gross</li>
            <li> Waxing is pricey and painful and asking someone else to help shave your back is embarrassing so a product such as this one seems logical.  </li>
            <li> wow,no more painful back waxing,i been working out for the past 5 years</li>
            <li> may be a little irritating at first but a man gotta do what a man gotta do.</li>
            <li> The number of angles is limited, the one you need is not one of the possibilities, and the arms don&#x27;t lock in place anyway, so even if you come close, it just falls down.</li>
            <li> You still might need someone else to help get to those hard to reach places since the handle is not quite long enough for that.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it takes regular batteries because when built in rechargeables die then its garbage, also seen some posts that said it pulls their hair out, not sure why unless your batteries are weak, I have a older &amp;#34;chic&amp;#34; model, now that yanks the hairs out</li>
            <li> At first try you feel like its cutting your back, you will get used to it.</li>
            <li> This is the less expensive model, but works very well, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> you have to use it regularly before the hair gets to long and thick.</li>
            <li> Some people also complained about how difficult it was to get the hang of shaving backwards in a mirror, which I also found to be quite easy.    </li>
            <li> On the one hand, it is not easy to master and the first time out can be frustrating.</li>
            <li> Although lightweight, the ManGroomer is made of VERY cheap plastic: if you drop this thing on a hard surface I&#x27;m afraid it would crack or break.</li>
            <li> We wondered if it would hold up as soon as we opened the package due to the flimsy feel of the handle.</li>
            <li> It works extremely well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The blade itself isn&#x27;t overly sharp or pointy, so unless you gouge yourself, you shouldn&#x27;t have any scratches.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone that has unwanted back hair and has always had to get someone else to help them shave, no more, you can do it yourself.</li>
            <li> That other hair removal product..</li>
            <li> The blade is kinda sharp but noisy,</li>
            <li> /&gt;Yes, contrary to other reviews, rechargeable batters do work.  </li>
            <li> No replacement, refund or other help from Amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot noisier than other shavers.  </li>
            <li> whatever he was on with that other guy who is in the Bacardi and Cola commercials with him.</li>
            <li> I will be anxious to see if it will perform over time in the same manner.</li>
            <li> However, just like other reviews have commented, it did irritate and redden my skin.</li>
            <li> I cannot recommend this product for $40 though I am at a loss as to what other product to recommend.  </li>
            <li> Either one side or the other digs into the skin.  </li>
            <li> (the philips device looks small) to get to the areas of your back.  </li>
            <li> Using this will be easier than other methods including asking my wife to help out.</li>
            <li> It cuts pretty close for an electric trimmer, though it can rub your skin a bit if you trim at the wrong angle.  </li>
            <li> I dont think there is any other product like it out there.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Money well spent!</li>
            <li> anywhere else you&#x27;d ever want extremely well.  </li>
            <li> You may have even taped a razor on a stick or experimented with some other contraption like that.  </li>
            <li> I assumed that this thing would be like my small personal groomer, just on an extended handle.</li>
            <li> so, I Ordered the other Mangroomer</li>
            <li> Can also use on other parts of the body as closing the shaver does not null the blades (they&#x27;re still functional).&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more having to shave my back</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about battery life at this point because I&#x27;m still using the ones I initially put</li>
            <li> and honestly it&#x27;s a not issue, it makes your back red for a few minutes but</li>
            <li> and has never been as well as other horrors.</li>
            <li> This item does not trim, barely cuts anything and quickly loses sharpness (1 usage).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find something that would do this job (other than my wife) for years.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I was a bit concerned that this product might not hold up, as it seems a bit \\&quot;fragile\\&quot; in its construction.  </li>
            <li> The company immediately sent me a replacement along with some additional mangroomer wipes, one of their other products, and I received the replacement within 2 business days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t run through batteries as some other products of the like.  </li>
            <li> I have, in the past, been waxed, had someone shave my back, tried an epilator _ouch!!,  and sugaring all of which are embarrassing and, except for the shave method, get pricey.  </li>
            <li> The Mangroomer is simply too weak to shred through my \\&quot;back forest,\\&quot;</li>
            <li> No more depending on asking someone else to shave your back.  </li>
            <li> the first time you use the mangroomer, it is difficult and hurts a bit and will take 20-30 minutes.</li>
            <li> I use it about every other week.  </li>
            <li> It stayed sharp.  </li>
            <li> (Mine actually came shipped with a small crack, do to this</li>
            <li> I had to open it up and fasten the small motor</li>
            <li> It is extremely lightweight to the point of fragility, and feels like it will fall apart in your hand when you take it out of the box.</li>
            <li> I expect that if I take care of it (and don&#x27;t drop it on the tile floor), it will last at least a few years, which is enough value for what I paid.</li>
            <li> Product does what it says it would do albeit awkward to use but would be fine after using it a few times.  </li>
            <li> I ordered a replacement head for an outdated model and they shipped me a brand new shaver at no cost.  </li>
            <li> I fully expect to have to replace it someday, but as far as I can tell, if you want a do-it-yourself solution, this is the only game in town!</li>
            <li> I went for the expensive professional waxing at an upper end spa.  </li>
            <li> I have been getting my back waxed for a few years (at $40 a whack) and found the Mangroomer on Amazon a few months ago.</li>
            <li> Instead of just getting an area in one wide sweep, go slow and move the clipper back and forth in an effort to get all the hair.</li>
            <li> Perhaps, the only thing that really disappoints me is that Mike Rowe and the rest of the strong-stomached crew of Dirty Jobs probably won&#x27;t be filming a deforestation episode here after all.  </li>
            <li> although a little awkward reaching around yourself at first, but no big deal.</li>
            <li> It is very useful if you are not a contortionist and have an annoying patch of hair on your back.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too terribly ruggedly built, but it&#x27;s not expensive enough that I really mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, as I stood up, our pet chihuaha had been chewing on the long luxurious hair on my back (it pokes up above the neck on my PJs),</li>
            <li> I know that some people will complain about it irritating or hurting, but I think that&#x27;s just because the thicker the back hair the worse it is the first time.  </li>
            <li> Because of this, for the past several years I tried to do this task myself, often ending with less than desirable results.</li>
            <li> but annoy it is to stand two feet behind yourself, ignore the extensible handle, and hold the main body at a shallow angle to the skin so that the head is almost parallel to the surface, as you would a clipper used on a beard, sideburns, or a dog.</li>
            <li> I wondered if since this model is half the price of the other model, that maybe it did not work as well.  </li>
            <li> At first it&#x27;s a little weird to get used to..</li>
            <li> The silver button makes the arm longer....if you push hard enough.  </li>
            <li> If you have back hair in hard to reach places this product is for you.</li>
            <li> I felt compelled to write a review for those considering purchasing since it was so hard for me to find something that actually worked.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Arm bends in such a way that i can get to those hard to reach spots&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gets all the hard to reach areas of the back.</li>
            <li> Every dude should be sporting this for back of the neck (with self haircuts) or any hard to reach unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> even with the extra handle makes it hard to use//bulky</li>
            <li> For hair areas lower and areas that grow in a different direction and are hard to shave, you just come in from your sides.</li>
            <li> My only little complaint would be that it&#x27;s louder than I expected, but that doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> Not only that, but for thirty something bucks if I had to buy a new one every time I needed my back done, it would still be faster, cheaper, less humiliating, and certainly less painful than getting some stranger torture me with wax.</li>
            <li> just feels cheap and badly</li>
            <li> not worth it</li>
            <li> Maybe louder than your average hair clippers at your barber/beauty shop.</li>
            <li> Not useful for my oppinion.</li>
            <li> My big complaint is the construction and durability....</li>
            <li> not worth the money</li>
            <li> Not Worth the price.</li>
            <li> (Or at least the last dozen years or so.)</li>
            <li> I read about having to have the proper angle as a complaint</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth even $1.</li>
            <li> but the discomfort is not worth it.  </li>
            <li> only negative</li>
            <li> I always felt guilty because whenever we were intimate, I was always distracted by &#x27;the hair&#x27;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basically an ordinary battery-operated clipper on a long handle.  </li>
            <li> He went over the same place at least 10 times and it did not remove any hair.  </li>
            <li> Just buy a small hand mirror from the dollar store, and use a bigger mirror, and you can have the hair off in a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that when you put it in a 90 degree bend it doesn&#x27;t stay locked in place</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Second, the batteries are entirely replaceable, so you&#x27;re not left with a useless shell when the usual ni-cad batteries die.  </li>
            <li> I read all the negative reviews on this and still went to buy it hoping they were just being overly critical.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sad really....</li>
            <li> If you are thick in the waist and/or back and shoulders, this product works.</li>
            <li> This is just a physiological result, and is far from irritating or permanent.   </li>
            <li> That said the item I received had a broken part inside the handle which rattled loudly.</li>
            <li> After a few tries I gave up and realized it wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> I have scratched myself and cut myself a few times in harder to reach areas.</li>
            <li> mangroomer will take some getting used to, if you go slow and develop strategy to  get to all the places on your back</li>
            <li> My body hair is thick and coarse, and the Mangroomer doesn&#x27;t remove it at all; it feels like</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair on my back but the hair itself is not that thick.</li>
            <li> My back tends to have patches of thick, dark hair.</li>
            <li> It is extremely rough on the skin and it will not, repeat, WILL NOT cut hairs longer than a few millimeters.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s NOT the thick, coarse hair some guys have on their backs.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this because of the thick hairy jungle that is my back.  </li>
            <li> I had expected it to be a waste of money, but it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> My back hair was not as thick as some</li>
            <li> It also bogs down worse than the internet of a 14 year old kid who just discovered online porn.  </li>
            <li> Dulls quickly and painfully rips hair out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately the Mangroomer broke down this morning.</li>
            <li> I been using hydrocortisone cream 1% and that seems to be taking some of the burn and redness down.</li>
            <li> Just trims it down still need to shave or wax.  </li>
            <li> that means DON&#x27;T PRESS DOWN    </li>
            <li> and it does get it down close to the skin.</li>
            <li> Then it functions to keep the hair down.</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, I continued to plug away - up, down, sideways, diagonally, and</li>
            <li> Just run the head up and down, side to side</li>
            <li> and it has never let me down.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve thrown a pair of AA lithiums into this battery-operated plastic contraption, but even they are insufficient to chop down the \\&quot;trees\\&quot; in my forest.</li>
            <li> Buying another as the price has come down and after six years</li>
            <li> When I opened the box I felt let down, I was expecting something well put together</li>
            <li> : Like some other reviewers I thought it felt a little lightweight, flimsy out of the box.  </li>
            <li> I mean alot of shaving to get the job done, and I was red and sore for days.</li>
            <li> I tried for 15 minutes to align the cutting edge with my skin just right so that it would do its job to no avail.</li>
            <li> Seriously, its clear the manufacturers behind this make the Mangroomer as cheaply as possible.</li>
            <li> Nair is such a bad smelling, messy  hassle to use and apply to my back that I usually just keep my shirt on when I wish I didn&#x27;t have to for much of the summer.</li>
            <li> This unit works as it should but it is not easy to use and you must be careful of the angle of the trimmer head.  </li>
            <li> Felt very cheap/constructed very poorly.</li>
            <li> Well, it only made it through 3/4 of my first use before the shaver became dull and began pulling my hair out instead of cutting it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Blade is very sharp</li>
            <li> I had it about a year and the motor started to slow down making it a bit more painful to shave.  </li>
            <li> I typically do it for him</li>
            <li> : Shipping took less than two weeks.</li>
            <li> Also, when using it extended and with the sharper angle, it tends to pop out of the the angle into the less angled position.</li>
            <li> It is still difficult for me to maneuver and the batteries only last about 2 shaves before needing to be replaced.  </li>
            <li> I had to fend off several lawsuits from environmentalists claiming that the bird nesting in my back hair were an endangered species, and I was disturbing their habitat.  </li>
            <li> I did not have to return either of the previous ones.  </li>
            <li> Lasted less than 6 months after the plastic in the battery compartment broke.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve used mine about half a dozen times</li>
            <li> I am not super hairy</li>
            <li> I never had the guts or the extra money to go do a laser surgery and would always feel uncomfortable in public on beaches, swimming pools etc.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> ( it&#x27;s all black one)</li>
            <li> and I think it holds a nicer charge than my previous one.</li>
            <li> Not sure how anyone could possibly have gotten any use of this thing unless I have alien hair.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s not a super close shave.  </li>
            <li> The product died after a year and half.  </li>
            <li> Bought Mangroomer for nephew 2 and a half years ago.</li>
            <li> This is one of those products you are hesitant to say you bought much less do a review on.</li>
            <li> not super hairy</li>
            <li> One of the reasons people get frustrated with this product is that the first time they use it is with long-ignored hair that is, well, long.  </li>
            <li> I previously used a Remington BHT600.</li>
            <li> His previous one had a charger; I didn&#x27;t realize this one runs on AA batteries.</li>
            <li> When I finaly went to use it, It lasted  less then 30 seconds and the blades locked onto eachother</li>
            <li> /&gt;Miserable experience, not worthy of the quality of product nor of service I expect from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This particular product is useless.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even fathom putting it in our garage sale and letting some other poor sap go through the same as me.</li>
            <li> Also, this particular unit was very poor quality.</li>
            <li> , it still only trims, so you do have stubble on your back, and it&#x27;s a little prickly for a few days, plus wearing shirts will feel weird.</li>
            <li> the product itself is a ripp off and not worth it at half the price!</li>
            <li> Is a little awkward to use at first just take&#x27;s practice.</li>
            <li> unless you&#x27;ve done these other ways before getting a hang of working it will take a little getting used to!</li>
            <li> This 2nd try device has left me with no pain whatsoever, and closely and completely shaves off all that nasty back and shoulder hair</li>
            <li> Very sharp and does leave marks on your body/back that take a few days to go away.  </li>
            <li> I was wary of this product because electric trimmers normally leave heavy stubble.</li>
            <li> I did however find it a little too rigid.</li>
            <li> It took a little getting used to</li>
            <li> and it is a shot in the dark with some products!</li>
            <li> I just wish it was a little but wider for faster cleanups.</li>
            <li> I see there is a rugged model, but for the pricing, I think this one should have been made a little tougher.</li>
            <li> I see there is a rugged model, but for the pricing, I think this one should have been made a little tougher.</li>
            <li> I emailed them a month ago and then again a little over two weeks ago.</li>
            <li> The battery door is a little flimsy.</li>
            <li> It belongs in a dollar store and is certainly not worth the $40!</li>
            <li> I was pretty mad since I had just got it.</li>
            <li> So maybe I&#x27;m babying it a little</li>
            <li> Takes a little getting use to</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> It works quite well, almost as well as if it was a razor blade but misses by just a little.</li>
            <li> , it takes a little getting used to.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the cash!</li>
            <li> Not much more to say other</li>
            <li> I was a little unclear for a while as to the difference between this model and the \\&quot;pro\\&quot; model.  </li>
            <li> What little hair that did come off of me with this thing was just pulled out.</li>
            <li> With a little practice, I found that I could aim it just about anywhere</li>
            <li> , I guess it grabs your hairs and skin a little.    </li>
            <li> now all this thing has to do is work a LITTLE BIT</li>
            <li> Takes a little practice to get used to .</li>
            <li> It did scratch me a little</li>
            <li> The head could also be a little wider.  </li>
            <li> There was a little reddening, but it disappeared within an hour.</li>
            <li> As I reviewed in the &amp;#34;Mangroomer,&amp;#34; the thirties are not friendly to men.</li>
            <li> Takes a little getting used to.  </li>
            <li> Wish it was make a little sturdier.  </li>
            <li> The construction is a little janky, but it works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the other brands have to offer, but I felt it did well for the price and</li>
            <li> The blade did not scratch, it did cause a little redness but</li>
            <li> /right a little.</li>
            <li> When I tried to shave my back again a few days later, the razor cut into all the bumps caused by the first session and it was a horrible experience.</li>
            <li> I used only one mirror and had a tough time getting at all of the spots, but eventually did.  </li>
            <li> -- it&#x27;s tough to see back there!  </li>
            <li> could foresee that maybe it wouldn&#x27;t cut so well through very thick back hair and might even leave the appearance and feel of stubble/shadow.</li>
            <li> If you drop this on a hard floor it will probably break so be careful.</li>
            <li> You have to be careful not to press too hard</li>
            <li> You see, my family suffers from a genetic disorder that makes us all very hairy, all over.</li>
            <li> and it really does irritate the skin like crazy.</li>
            <li> The teeth seem too tall as well, which is why it can grab so much skin, without cutting any hair.</li>
            <li> Once every three shaves it requires fresh batteries or it painfully pulls my hair</li>
            <li> A waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the mangroomer about 3 months ago and have used it every few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Its not entirely smooth its just a close buzz...</li>
            <li> Hold it with a firm grip since I don&#x27;t recommend dropping it, and soon you&#x27;ll get the hang of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hold it with a firm grip since I don&#x27;t recommend dropping it, and soon you&#x27;ll get the hang of it.    </li>
            <li> After sitting in the drawer for a few weeks, it wouldn&#x27;t start when I&#x27;d turn it on.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair, and thought it would take a few times to remove it all.</li>
            <li> The problem with this is it is not a smooth shave</li>
            <li> Secret is keeping the blade flush against your back.</li>
            <li> The device &amp;#34;locks&amp;#34; into place at a few angles.  </li>
            <li> but it does not click firmly into position.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this a few times and it does work.  </li>
            <li> but once I used it a few times my skin adapted and I have had no problems since.  </li>
            <li> I have used it a few times with no problems at all.</li>
            <li> but i think i&#x27;ll get a few uses out of it before then.</li>
            <li> I hope this will survive a few years.</li>
            <li> Ive been wearing strapless tops and dresses almost everyday this spring.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> Please do not waste your time and money buying this useless product.</li>
            <li> Removed batteries, reinserted a few times...same thing.  </li>
            <li> The operation of the button and slider mechanism that extends the handle is not smooth at all.</li>
            <li> My skin was also quite tender for a few hours afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I gave up after a few seconds of pain</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why you have to practice a bit, perhaps making a few runs with the shaver off.</li>
            <li> Does the job in a few minutes in the comfort of your home.  </li>
            <li> I changed batteries nothing just dead.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t look like I have a carpet on my back, maybe a 4 on a scale of 1 to 10(10 being confused for a bear)and</li>
            <li> My husband gave it a try and had trouble with it staying on,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waxing at $45 a pop every few months for a couple of years</li>
            <li> Within a few minutes I was done.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why others have trouble with it grabbing their hair.</li>
            <li> If not, run the batteries until dead.</li>
            <li> Depending on your genes you might have to use the product twice a week but few minutes</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t trim hair well and cut me a few times in the process...</li>
            <li> I when I reached for it the batteries were dead.</li>
            <li> It leaves hair all over and what it does cut is not smooth.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste you time or cash on this.</li>
            <li> With this clipper, you can expect a stubble to be left behind.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend if you happen to receive a unit like mine that wasn&#x27;t trimming efficiently or is cutting up your back to give the company a chance as they really stand behind their product.</li>
            <li> Not smooth on the skin...</li>
            <li> I am not happy with this product I would like to have my money back</li>
            <li> I look like a dalmatian with the stubble it&#x27;s left behind.</li>
            <li> really a waste of time and plastic.</li>
            <li> I guess if your body hair is like the hair on your head or face, this would have some trouble.  </li>
            <li> dropped the unit one time and the on/off switch came flying out and could not be re-inserted because the unit is &amp;#34;sealed&amp;#34; and cannot be opened without destroying it.  </li>
            <li> Gave a try a few times</li>
            <li> Perhaps, I&#x27;m the missing link that anthropologists have been seeking.  </li>
            <li> so well I didn&#x27;t get any breakout or skin trouble after using it.</li>
            <li> ladies tired of shaving your man&#x27;s back then get him this for Christmas or get it for him now!</li>
            <li> rings\\&quot; there could be only one brow for Pappy, but alas that was just the beginning.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> dead.  </li>
            <li> I took the blades apart, freed them up a few times , samething</li>
            <li> I have a very hairy back and hate using depilatories and waxes.  </li>
            <li> As other people have mentioned, it does feel a little uncomfortable on your skin as you use it, almost like someone is scratching your back with the ridged side of a butter knife.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mean that it didn&#x27;t work as well as I expected.  </li>
            <li> After reading some of the other reviews, I was skeptical about how much hair it would leave behind.</li>
            <li> Odd, I know!</li>
            <li> The durability is somewhat questionable, however only due to perception, not to a problem.</li>
            <li> The other thing to keep in mind is NOT to press too hard when using this as doing so is akin to the carving people used to do to their scalps.    </li>
            <li> It absolutely removes the hair and in places that are impossible to reach without someone else to help, so it&#x27;s less embarassing.</li>
            <li> Some other people complained that the blade scratched them.</li>
            <li> It just plain doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> This product is very difficult to use and can only be used for weekly or daily maintenance.  </li>
            <li> However, the middle back is very difficult to reach.  </li>
            <li> It is a little difficult to keep it flat on the skin, but that is just part of reaching behind your back with an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> You have to hold the edge flat to the surface which is almost impossible when talking about your back.</li>
            <li> Additionally, the angle is actually awkward because you can&#x27;t keep it in position, so when you hold it up and over your shoulder the latter half (with the blade) swings down against your skin.  </li>
            <li> This product does do the job but not very effectively.</li>
            <li> It really works, allowing a person to reach the areas that are almost impossible to reach.</li>
            <li> the man-groomer will be much less expensive in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed that this product was so poorly made because it has the potential to be a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> my only beef is that the razor head is very weak.</li>
            <li> Self shaving was impossible, waxing was very painful and lasted less than a month, and laser removal was even more painful with limited success.</li>
            <li> well it all started when i was in high school and hated playing shirts and skins in fear i would get skins and everyone would look at my back and say...</li>
            <li> Looking in a double mirror, I found it awkward, so to avoid becoming frustrated, I turned away from the mirror, envisioned in my mind where the shaver should begin cutting, placed the shaver on the area I wanted shaved and slowly pulled the shaver across my back.  </li>
            <li> No more trips to get waxed and its already paid for itself.</li>
            <li> No more grizzly Bear.</li>
            <li> This does a unbelievable job.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t leave any marks on me and doesn&#x27;t feel excessively</li>
            <li> Those of us with thick, curly hair destroy all gizmos aimed at reducing hair volume.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually don&#x27;t post reviews, I think some are bogus.</li>
            <li> Once it worked the shave was not close by any means leaving stubble that caught my clothing and more importantly disgusted my girl...</li>
            <li> No more asking friends to shave you or paying money for waxing, you can accomplish your shaving in a matter of minutes.</li>
            <li> I was quite skeptical about paying $40 dollars for a razor that uses batteries and one of the reviews I read prior to buying said it was \\&quot;a toy.\\</li>
            <li> The reason it is expensive is because it is the only one like it on the market.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I received a defective product...    </li>
            <li> Congratulations to the guy that ran with it and will make a small fortune off of it.</li>
            <li> I just received this product not more than 15 minutes ago and have immediately put it to use.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and was satisfied...kind of.  </li>
            <li> have been using this for past 2 years now and</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, you just can&#x27;t reach all areas of your back with either of them.  </li>
            <li> so you can get to those spots that you can&#x27;t ordinarily.  </li>
            <li> No more arm-breaking manuevers or using a clipper taped to a wire hanger.</li>
            <li> Based on some of the reviews, I was not sure whether this product would work.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time people with hairy bodies!  </li>
            <li> but I have a couple of small patches on each side</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used others in the past that did not work as well.</li>
            <li> Weird since it&#x27;s only been used 12 times.</li>
            <li> so it makes them pointless.  </li>
            <li> No more cuts and this time</li>
            <li> (no more cries of &amp;#34;help&amp;#34; from the shower).</li>
            <li> After using the replacement Mangroomer unit no more than 5 - 6 times, the motor on it quit working as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It takes no more than 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li> No more struggling trying to reach.</li>
            <li> This device is the worst clipper I&#x27;ve ever had...would have been better to attach a stick to my beard trimmer.    </li>
            <li> No more, or you may end up as disgruntled as some reviewers here seem to be.</li>
            <li> No more having someone do it for you (embarrassing).  </li>
            <li> If I try to use the lower handle past the point where the folding joint is located, the razor flops around and is uncontrollable.</li>
            <li> If you have upraised moles on your back, don&#x27;t place blind faith in your ability to maneuver the MANGROOMER</li>
            <li> Any set of clippers I&#x27;ve used in the past has had an AC adapter with it.</li>
            <li> and it works as advertised if not better.....</li>
            <li> The quality is no better than you&#x27;d find at a $5 shaver at a flea market.  </li>
            <li> even on my very thin back hair which I feared.</li>
            <li> I gave it three stars instead of 2 because it WILL accomplish the goal, and there are very few products that I know of that fill this niche.  </li>
            <li> It is a little awkward when you are trying to get hairs around your lower back.  </li>
            <li> This \\&quot;disease\\&quot; caused Pappy to become withdrawn and it caused him some long term damage that years of therapy have still not fixed, you ask how bad could this damage be?</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t built to be expensive or durable, but mine doesn&#x27;t feel shoddy or fragile.</li>
            <li> The on/off button is not very good.</li>
            <li> Not sure I understand any of the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> , sorry I waited so long to buy.</li>
            <li> Using any rechargeable device with a built in battery sucks because all batteries have a shorter life then usually the product.</li>
            <li> this device was pretty much worthless</li>
            <li> It was a little awkward at first and it wasn&#x27;t cutting well.</li>
            <li> because a heavyweight item would be hard to shave yourself with.  </li>
            <li> Helps you get to those hard to reach places.  </li>
            <li> but it helps reach those hard to reach places and works just fine...great gift.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking at this product, it&#x27;s because you are looking to get rid of hard to reach hair, and if this is so, this product is a must buy.</li>
            <li> Get those hard to reach spots.</li>
            <li> Well, that might be as I&#x27;ve had a hard time extending the handle.</li>
            <li> so it isnt so hard to maneuver.</li>
            <li> This unexpansive electrical tool helped me to solve one of my biggest problems in life (life is hard, you know).</li>
            <li> then the handle was lose so its hard to control( and its nonreturnable  </li>
            <li> but this is easier to reach those hard to get areas.</li>
            <li> And no, I didn&#x27;t press too hard</li>
            <li> Yes it can &#x27;scrape&#x27; like sandpaper if you go too hard.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t go rapping it on hard objects or drop it on a hard floor.  </li>
            <li> The arm gets longer if you need so there is nothing stopping you from those hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> Hard to use.</li>
            <li> For any dude with hair in hard to reach places this is a must have.</li>
            <li> This device helps to remove unwanted hair from hard to reach places by yourself.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews here.  </li>
            <li> DO NOT believe the negative reviews on this product.</li>
            <li> One negative:  </li>
            <li> Negative:  </li>
            <li> This trimmer is PAINFUL and completely ineffective.</li>
            <li> sucks to be hairy</li>
            <li> It was a very big disappointment.    </li>
            <li> it feels like its ripping hair and cutting you at the same time!</li>
            <li> I read all the negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> and it does at least fold up for travel and stores well.</li>
            <li> This product sucks.</li>
            <li> but then again they are an awkward shape for your back</li>
            <li> However, I never liked having the hair.</li>
            <li> I eventually had it fail and had to use a soldering iron to reattach a broken wire, but even then it was quirky in its operation.  </li>
            <li> The only drawback is just the awkward angles involved, but that&#x27;s no fault of the product.</li>
            <li> But if you have any common sense you shouldn&#x27;t have any problem.</li>
            <li> The key is that the cutting unit is a &#x27;line&#x27; cutter.</li>
            <li> The razor is not effective.  </li>
            <li> I wrote the negative review and almost immediately was contacted by the company offering their appoligies and a prompt replacement.&lt;br</li>
            <li> At least for me.  </li>
            <li> common sense.  </li>
            <li> Luckily, shortly thereafter I noticed that this wasn&#x27;t a cold sweat at all</li>
            <li> It unfortunately seems like its not really made too well, but what do you expect for $25?</li>
            <li> I think the  chances of pulls or nips from the cutting head are just too likely.  </li>
            <li> i can not express my disappointment enough.</li>
            <li> I would give it zero or negative stars if I could.  </li>
            <li> What a total disappointment this product is.</li>
            <li> If the hair is thick in some areas you might have to use it twice but it will take it off.  </li>
            <li> This will not work if you have thick hair.  </li>
            <li> Typically I hate writing reviews unless the product really WOWS me</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t trip and parted the thick mat of hair on my wife&#x27;s face to kiss her on the cheek.</li>
            <li> If this thing cut through my thick tweed, it will work on yours.  </li>
            <li> Just like shaving your face with a razor if you have a thick beard sometimes you have to shave against the grain or it will not come off.</li>
            <li> Result:  lots of pulled hairs and slow, slow trimming.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not covered in thick hair, bit I have some patches of medium growth.</li>
            <li> my hair isn&#x27;t thick either.</li>
            <li> Being so narrow and trying to shave with your arm behind</li>
            <li> Just go slow and follow the directions</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this farce of a clipper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still a bit awkward with keeping the cutting blades flat against my back, but that&#x27;s just a matter of practice.</li>
            <li> All-in all, like I said the shaver does a decent job without biting the skin but the price is outrageous for the poor quality of materials, construction and sheer lack of engineering.</li>
            <li> Every time afterwards it had less and less cutting power.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the other guys are doing wrong</li>
            <li> I mean that it did not work period.  </li>
            <li> Like some of the other guys, I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> I usually have to ask someone to trim it off!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit uncomfortable and it&#x27;s difficult to closely follow all of the small contours of the back.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the first replacement I received was actually worse at cutting hair than the one it was replacing.  </li>
            <li> Ouch, not really that bad but not worth it to me.  </li>
            <li> No more painful waxing or having to cover up your back with a t shirt.</li>
            <li> You have to do long slow strides over the area and can be tricky to maneuver at times and feels awkward in the hands.</li>
            <li> Hate... HATE this kind of packaging where the only options are ruining a pair of scissors and slicing your hand on the cut plastic, or stabbing your hand, leg, arm while using a pocket knife and slicing your hand on the cut plastic.  </li>
            <li> The Mangroomer is a waste of money, and I am highly disappointed that Amazon would sell such a shoddy item!</li>
            <li> While it does trim the hair quite well it obviously does leave stubble that still needs shaving; but, at least the ugly hair is gone.  </li>
            <li> Seriously.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I have serious doubt on Amazon&#x27;s review system</li>
            <li> the next week I used it and the performance was even worst, then the fourth time it broke and dosent work anymore.</li>
            <li> SERIOUSLY.</li>
            <li> even on my sparsest and thinnest body hair, this thing is INCREDIIBLY painful to use and totally unable to cut even a reasonable amount of hair.    </li>
            <li> It does what the ad says, but seriously, it&#x27;s $40 and disposable battery powered?  </li>
            <li> If you are serious about grooming, you might as well use garden snips.</li>
            <li> I was expecting pain, and while it was a little uncomfortable, it wasn&#x27;t anything too ridiculous</li>
            <li> Just positioning the machine was a little uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> and i was a little skeptical to try it.</li>
            <li> the design isnt bad but the substandard materials used to make this fall way short, it does not work well at all.</li>
            <li> but it was bad enough that I did not want to take my shirt off at the beach.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the only bad part of my purchase was that my mangroomer stopped working after about three uses.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, your back will resemble that of someone that just had a rly, rly bad nightmare about Freddy Krueger.</li>
            <li> NOt only did it hurt during the process, it was just as painful afterward during my shower.  </li>
            <li> the same painful result everytime do not buy this</li>
            <li> I had expected this from the reviews I read here, but it was still a disappointment given the price.    </li>
            <li> Totally not fair to my guy.  </li>
            <li> Not a good design.</li>
            <li> Not good.  </li>
            <li> I tried this for a painful half-hour or so before my man pride would finally (and every bit as hairy</li>
            <li> That can be painful and that&#x27;s when it actually works.</li>
            <li> I have always hated my back hair and never wanted to wax because i thought it would be too painfull and not worth it.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time but expensive and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I was going to return this item the day it arrived, as it used false advertising to sell the product, but I thought I&#x27;d at least try it out once.</li>
            <li> Getting it on was a tough job, messy and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> The blades are uncomfortable and not very effective.</li>
            <li> If you have similar issues you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> i got frustrated and was unsure if i was doing it correctly because it was taking so long.</li>
            <li> The head is weak now it won&#x27;t stay together</li>
            <li> The cutting heads are identical, (and interchangeable), except for the black coating.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not very impressive and there is a lot of afterwork to do.</li>
            <li> very bad product, so I&#x27;m looking for a new one.</li>
            <li> YOU WILL EVER BUY - NO NEED FOR HELP REACHING THOSE TOUGH SPOTS.</li>
            <li> You can reach all those tough to get spots.</li>
            <li> It will still cut, but not without moving very slowly across the area you are removing hair from.  </li>
            <li> It is made of thin, brittle plastic and is very delicate.    </li>
            <li> Doing it by \\&quot;feel\\&quot; will help keep the cutting edge flush against your skin to get a cleaner cut and avoid the red marks that you make when the cutting edge is slanted against your skin.    </li>
            <li> and there that must look unappealing when others see me in Yoga.</li>
            <li> The plastic and construction quality of Mangroomer is poor.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how close it got and the ease in which it removed my annoying back hair.</li>
            <li> This is beyond frustrating.</li>
            <li> but there are worse things.  </li>
            <li> I was getting a massage (no Happy Ending) and</li>
            <li> I had to take the thing apart to see what piece had broken off inside.</li>
            <li> News flash guys: Women HATE back hair; shave it off!   </li>
            <li> Trying to look in the mirror and placing the shaver will be frustrating.  </li>
            <li> There is nothing deficient or lacking with this one.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, I was tired of looking myself with all that hair in the bathroom mirror</li>
            <li> If you have a hairy back and hate it like I do.</li>
            <li> and I grew tired of the pain and hair bumps that followed days</li>
            <li> Whether your preferred method us \\&quot;over-the-shoulder\\&quot;, or from behind, this will get the job done.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t especially heavy duty, but does the job.  </li>
            <li> I recieved this product broken and tried to get someone to help me with no satisfaction.</li>
            <li> I took pictures of the broken product and sent them to the specified party with no satisfaction.</li>
            <li> i dont have any use for it and really not happy with the purchase</li>
            <li> Just keep in mind a short base of hair is required.</li>
            <li> poor execution</li>
            <li> : Flimsy, and seems poorly made.</li>
            <li> Worked poorly for the 45 seconds it did work.</li>
            <li> Now, the upraised moles and the flat moles, some of them have this annoying tendency to sprout hairs.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the way the hinge feels sloppy...</li>
            <li> Not sure why the negative reviews about it being painful to use.</li>
            <li> Main problem - the blade design is horrible.</li>
            <li> So for a product to die after so little use is very sad.  </li>
            <li> With it, there is no more worrying about taking your shirt off and no embarrassment about having anyone else do the dirty job for you.</li>
            <li> With it, there is no more worrying about taking your shirt off and no embarrassment about having anyone else do the dirty job for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used four of these over the past six years, replacing them as they wear out (they start pulling hair rather than cutting).  </li>
            <li> It was a little irritating, but not that bad.</li>
            <li> Some bleeding but nothing too dramatic that a shower can&#x27;t handle.</li>
            <li> So I was skeptical, but went for it, because I hate my back hair.  </li>
            <li> I will say though is that this device is quite flimsy, is VERY hard to use, and does a VERY poor job.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried waxing before, but it was expensive, painful, and for the amount and thinness of hair that I have, probably not worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read on here that it&#x27;s poorly designed, plastic and failed after a year...</li>
            <li> By far the worst thing ever.  </li>
            <li> He tried to shave in the opposite direction and it just pulled his hairs out, which was very painful.  </li>
            <li> But the horrible performance is nothing short of frustrating.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t bother with waxing as it is expensive and rather painful.   </li>
            <li> Waste of money !!!!</li>
            <li> Even the 1st unit was uncomfortable and seemed dull making it painful to use.  </li>
            <li> now dont get me wrong</li>
            <li> Unfortunately we were correct and since we couldn&#x27;t return our expensive purchase, we improvised with electrical tape to hold it together.</li>
            <li> This would probably be difficult for my husband to do alone...</li>
            <li> and it might be difficult to do alone.    </li>
            <li> sorry.  </li>
            <li> Was I ever wrong.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCR FOR YOUR DIFFICULT</li>
            <li> (it is difficult to \\&quot;push\\&quot; clipper, rather than \\&quot;pull\\&quot;)        </li>
            <li> It is also difficult to use this at the correct angle</li>
            <li> Unfortunately there&#x27;s nothing else out there</li>
            <li> so you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately they don&#x27;t sell those on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Even if they worked they were always difficult to use in reaching all areas.  </li>
            <li> (ie to get rid of the unwanted hair in the wrong places)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see anything wrong with the connections the batteries are making.    </li>
            <li> I heard the ad on the radio and immediately went to the site thinking it was some lame gimmick.</li>
            <li> However that can be difficult.</li>
            <li> Uses 2 AA batteries which can become expensive if you trim alot.</li>
            <li> But unfortunately that doesn&#x27;t outweigh the negatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> difficult spot to get to.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I needed this</li>
            <li> Not too expensive.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m probably doing something wrong</li>
            <li> It unfortunately doesn&#x27;t remove any hair.</li>
            <li> Additionally, Mangroomer, if you email them, will replace any units that are not perfect!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m no sasquach</li>
            <li> It feels horrible and the injuries are still visible over a week later.  </li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s not like the motors in these two failed units were being strained to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY!!!!!This was a horrible product it only worked for literally about 10 seconds</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I knocked it off the counter about 2 months ago, breaking it beyond repair.  </li>
            <li> extremely disappointed by how awful this product has become since I bought the first one over five years</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried waxing and shaving my back and both resulted in terrible skin for weeks.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, using this product did not go as well as I&#x27;d hoped....</li>
            <li> wary of purchasing this item.</li>
            <li> Worst part is that I&#x27;m Asian...100% Asian.  </li>
            <li> Completely useless, I would like a refund.</li>
            <li> sorry</li>
            <li> Which I am so beyond thankful for cause EW, hairy back man is NASTY...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this is when you find it that Amazon will not accept this item as a return.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very poorly made.</li>
            <li> This is very frustrating being</li>
            <li> but it went away after a day, and was still much less painful than using a depilatory cream (which burned really bad).  </li>
            <li> Laser treatment is too expensive, and I&#x27;m too afraid to try waxing (which I heard is like</li>
            <li> It bites you and leaves nasty scratches from the rough blade edges.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve tried it a few times and am very disappointed with this shaver.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid it would be a lot easier to cut yourself.    </li>
            <li> I was desperate and embaressed to ask anyone to trim/shave my backhair</li>
            <li> But what I like this over the Philips unit is: the cutting head doesn&#x27;t pop off the minute any resistance is felt, the use of AA batteries, the extending handle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Product packaging: dangerous, withstanding an atomic blast fortress shield of plastic.  </li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s flimsy so it doesn&#x27;t stay in position, and is awkwardly designed.  </li>
            <li> This drives me crazy.  </li>
            <li> Shaving using this device is awkward to start</li>
            <li> it is a rather awkward tool to use.  </li>
            <li> After perhaps 30 seconds of debilitating pain, I broke into a cold sweat....</li>
            <li> I would like to see this company improve the shaver part by upgrading its cutting ability.</li>
            <li> Its replacement has stopped cutting and started pulling hair after three weeks.  </li>
            <li> but the shaving head pulls at my hair rather than cutting.  </li>
            <li> and it stopped cutting.</li>
            <li> This thing snapped at my skin like it was mad at me.</li>
            <li> ....you want to look like you were attacked by an angry feral cat!  i found this extremely awkward to use and very uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> Hard to use, and terrible job shaving.</li>
            <li> Painful and awkward to use.  </li>
            <li> It does leave a very faint stubble though where the hair is thickest.  </li>
            <li> Oh, and waxing hurts like hell, and is very expensive.</li>
            <li> The angle and telescoping handle helps control and move the shaver where you need it to get the spots that use to be impossible to get.</li>
            <li> Poor product, very disappointing!</li>
            <li> THE BAD NEWS:  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not to bad.</li>
            <li> I encountered a bit of irritation, but nothing too bad.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that bad.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t belive some of the bad reviews on here.</li>
            <li> It is a bad product because it doesn&#x27;t cut hair.</li>
            <li> The shaving head is at a bad angle.</li>
            <li> The bad news is that it has the clipping power of an amoeba on valium.</li>
            <li> Thank gawd for this product cause that would end up SO bad...</li>
            <li> DIVORCE bad...</li>
            <li> I was actually shocked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 6&#x27;5\\&quot; and having the ugly hair gene has always been a problem until I got my hands on this device.</li>
            <li> its rips the hair out , painful</li>
            <li> Utterly worthless and a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Also, it was a bit painful to my skin, perhaps that is because it was just grabbing at the hairs and not clipping them.    </li>
            <li> to painful.</li>
            <li> Did I mention it was Painful.  </li>
            <li> a painful experiment.</li>
            <li> Painful, uses a lot of batteries, but gets the job done eventually.</li>
            <li> Painful at times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit frustrated with the mangroomer, but I just started using it</li>
            <li> What makes me sick is that I&#x27;ve been using a hand held trimmer for years that I attached to a handle with tape.</li>
            <li> However, upon using it I was completely disappointed.</li>
            <li> THIS IS YOUR TRIMMER, OTHERWISE YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PIECE OF JUNK.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;/</li>
            <li> and I was really disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I was somewhat disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m disappointed with both the product and myself for buying it.</li>
            <li> It is very painful to use on thicker hair because instead of cutting it will pull the hair out.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very unhappy with this purchase</li>
            <li> It turned out to be a worthless piece of plastic that was not eligible for return.  </li>
            <li> HATE</li>
            <li> But for the ret of us who Absolutely Hate Being Hairy...</li>
            <li> Then it&#x27;s worthless.</li>
            <li> but those annoying strays might as well be shag rugs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crap...</li>
            <li> it was deff a bad buy!</li>
            <li> Brutal.</li>
            <li> The sessions were brutal: I can still remember the smell of burning flesh.</li>
            <li> It is very painful.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with the product.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very handy and useful</li>
            <li> quick way to get the unwanted back hair off</li>
            <li> now dont get me wrong this model is a good model to use, i mainly decided with this model because i had lost my older one which was the next model up but also because this one is battery operated, i would rather deal with batteries than a battery that will eventually not charge anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this model works the same, but a part of me feels as if it doesn&#x27;t do the job on the first time like the previous model, the plastic does feel cheap but will last as long as your arent trying to break it on purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for first time user:: be patient and take your time, it takes some time getting used to on shaving your back because of the hand motions you have to do and the angles and what not.</li>
            <li> Takes some time to get used to but it definitely works.</li>
            <li> Does not work.  A complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Hair hits the floor without the need for a helping hand. Great for grooming while single, or saving someone you care about from a quite unglamorous task.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t cut as close as a razer, but it&#x27;s quick and eady. can trim chest and legs too. But don&#x27;t use it on your balls, ouch.</li>
            <li> Perfect grooming tool for an old silverback gorilla like me. I have always been somewhat embarrassed by my hairy back and was even too embarrassed to ask my wife to help. (Different problem I know) Especially when heading out to the beach. With this nifty unit I can generally keep nice and trim back there where I previously couldn&#x27;t reach. If you have similar issues you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> not worth it&lt;br /&gt;too weak&lt;br /&gt;tape your electric to a 3 foot pole and you&#x27;re better off or get your wife to do it</li>
            <li> I guess you pay for what you get ..... cheap product casing. Batteries won&#x27;r stay in place - as soon as you place them correctly - any movement of the product displaces them and the product stops working. I&#x27;ll have to just chuck it away. Waste of money !!!!</li>
            <li> I used to have a hairy back before I bought this product now its off I finally can go around not sweating and feel comfortable wherever i go</li>
            <li> Even tho it&#x27;s suppose to be a do it yourselfer...I typically do it for him but it&#x27;s nice to have a the long handle to do it while he stands in the shower.</li>
            <li> If you have fine hair that&#x27;s not spread thoughout your back, this MIGHT work for you.  Other than that, do not waste your money or time you will need to return it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time and going through a divorce it disappeared  happy to see the wife go but I had to replace the man groomer  ..  great product..</li>
            <li> I liked it, was surprised it didn&#x27;t cut me, but still sharp enough to do the job. Just positioning the machine was a little uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Theoritically the idea for this product is great. It allows men who live alone or can&#x27;t afford to have their back&#x27;s waxed an option. I am one of these men. I ordered the item and awaited it&#x27;s arrival in anticipation. I was very excited to put it to use when it was delivered. However, upon using it I was completely disappointed. The blades are much too wide and after following all the instructions to a \\&quot;T\\&quot; ended up with a bloodied, nicked and very irritated back. My advice to anyone considering purchasing the Mangroomer is to have your back waxed by a professional. If the product manufacturer replaced the blade with a foil one such as the Philips-Norelco Bodygroomer than I feel the item would work much better.</li>
            <li> Seriously, its clear the manufacturers behind this make the Mangroomer as cheaply as possible. It feels like a made-in-china plastic toy you&#x27;d get at the dollar store. The handle is covered in fake rubber that smells like paint thinner, the plastic is incredibly cheap, and when you extend it it barely keeps from falling apart. On first use I had to use duct tape to get it not to collapse upon itself. Oh, and its powered with double-A batteries, no nicads, no charger. Like, really guys? Obviously these things are produced for about a buck and a half each.    But, on the plus side, it does work. I was able to cut down the man forest in about 10 minutes, and to be honest it worked better than I thought it would. Not perfect, but pretty good. Surprisingly, it seemed to actually work better on thicker hair, while having trouble with the thinner patches that are close to the skin. It does scratch a bit, but I&#x27;m guessing with experience that will subside. And since they&#x27;ve pretty much got the market cornered here, I&#x27;d still recommend the buy. Yes it is horribly cheap, but for about half the price of a back wax, what do you have to lose? Until something better comes along, this looks like the best thing out there if you want to shave solo.    No joke though, I&#x27;d gladly pay double for the design if they would up the quality.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that should be in the hygine aisle of every big box store. Its essential to those who have \\&quot;carpets\\&quot; on their back, but dont have a sensible way of grooming. Completely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Fairly decent product that performs adequately to what it claims.  Noisy and not near as close as a razor, but accomplishes the task.</li>
            <li> I thought this was another thing to get my money, and it was only $20 so i checked out the reviews and almost didn&#x27;t buy it. I don&#x27;t know what the other guys are doing wrong i love this product and so do other people so do yourselves a favor and buy it you&#x27;ll love it</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver and did not expect too much due to the low price and the difficulty of shaving your back. It really does a great job. It shaves very close and after the first time or two getting used to working with this device it is easy. My wife is happy as I will not need her to assist me doing this job anymore. I actually look forward to my next time using it.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t get a super close shave, but this will look much better than a hairy back. I don&#x27;t have any issues getting all of my back with this. Would recommend to anyone else who doesn&#x27;t like their hairy backs :D</li>
            <li> I took a chance on this, and have to say it worked pretty good. It&#x27;s not going to give you 100% smooth results but does a pretty good job once you get used to it. If you&#x27;re gonna walk around the beach from a distance your back will probably look fine, but it&#x27;s not going to give results of a razor. The problem is it seems very cheep in the way it&#x27;s made, and after a few tries this thing is broke and no longer works at all. I see there&#x27;s now a re-chargeable one out, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s made any better besides not requiring batteries. I would purchase another one, even at a higher price if it were made better.</li>
            <li> Overall this groomer does what it says it does. It takes a couple AA batteries and takes the hair off.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Shipping took less than two weeks. If you are thick in the waist and/or back and shoulders, this product works. I have patches on my back and was able to reach them all. The handle extends with ease. It easily takes off hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It feels cheap as it is made of mostly plastic. Also, when using it extended and with the sharper angle, it tends to pop out of the the angle into the less angled position. When using just be gentle when trimming your back, the blades work really well.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is kind of loud too and seems to rattle the plastic parts.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. An easy, fast and effective way to shave unwanted back hair. I have used this 4 times and the more I use it the better and faster I get. The first time it irritated the skin but has been fine every time since. Would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great product. Something I&#x27;ve needed for a while. Folds and fits perfect in a small place. Good power and does what its supposed to quick.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he was happy he could take care of his back on his own. Admittedly, that is what i was excited about too. Anyway, he followed directions and the head broke off of the handle the second time he used it. It really was poorly constructed. We wondered if it would hold up as soon as we opened the package due to the flimsy feel of the handle. Unfortunately we were correct and since we couldn&#x27;t return our expensive purchase, we improvised with electrical tape to hold it together. I know, it sounds ghetto rigged, but it worked for a couple of times until it finally met its death. I am very disappointed that this product was so poorly made because it has the potential to be a fantastic product. For now, we have gone back to using Nair.</li>
            <li> I found this product more than adequate. It made quick work of my back and shoulder hair. I did however find it a little too rigid. The product could benefit from a pivoting head.</li>
            <li> It has always been embarrasing to ask for help with this job, and I haven&#x27;t been flexible enough to do it solo since I was in college. I was wary of this product because electric trimmers normally leave heavy stubble. Do not let any of this concern you. This works great and leaves your back clean. There is a &amp;#34;technique&amp;#34; you need to get used to to make it work right. I have to use it kind of like you would use a back scratcher. There is stubble, but it cuts *very* close. Also doesn&#x27;t leave the irritation or ingrown hairs I get when shave. Overall, it actually leaves you fairly smooth, and it&#x27;s gently enough to use regularly to keep the hair short.</li>
            <li> Got this a couple weeks ago and finally tried it out. Operating it while looking in the mirror took a little getting used too, but it works great.</li>
            <li> Product feels very cheap and flimsy. Didn&#x27;t last a month and had to return to seller. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this at all to anyone looking to groom their back hair.</li>
            <li> This one really worked for me.  I was skeptical since it runs on batteries if it would be powerful enough to be effective, but yes. The flip handle makes it possible to reach all areas of the back.  I regret that at this stage of my life I need this product, but I am glad it exists to help me!</li>
            <li> Well designed and constructed, does what it is supposed to do.  Excellent for that behind the back deforestation.  Would buy again</li>
            <li> This is a great product for the man with an overly hairy back.  You can \\&quot;shave\\&quot; it yourself without asking the aid of someone else in your household.</li>
            <li> Ordered this as an alternative to asking my wife to help me out with hair on my back.  This thing works very well.  It is easy to maneuver with the long handle and reached everywhere I needed it to.  It did leave my back a little scratched up at first but that did go away in an hour or so.  Depending on how much you have to remove I would suggest standing in the tub as it does tend to get messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very glad I spent the money on this.  Well worth it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product last week.  It was delivered on Wednesday, I opened it on Friday and it did not work.  I don&#x27;t mean that it didn&#x27;t work as well as I expected.  I mean that it did not work period.  It would not turn on and yes, I put new batteries in it.  It turned out to be a worthless piece of plastic that was not eligible for return.  I would give it zero starts, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be an option.</li>
            <li> This is indeed a great product.&lt;br /&gt;It does exactly what is announced and on my opinion just a trimming level control is missing.</li>
            <li> I just got the mangroomer yesterday.  It seems to work well.  Easy to use.  The quality does seem a bit cheap, so I&#x27;ll see how well it holds up after time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think if you have a ton of back hair, this product might not work well.  I guess i have a \\&quot;medium\\&quot; amount of back hair--and it seemed to work well.</li>
            <li> This thing works well but it is fragile.</li>
            <li> This tool really makes trimming the hair from areas not easily reached.  While it does trim the hair quite well it obviously does leave stubble that still needs shaving; but, at least the ugly hair is gone.  This tool has made grooming much easier and more convenient than trying to find someone to do it for you.</li>
            <li> On our Labor Day vacaton to Cape Cod my girlfriend presented me with a present, a mangroomer, she said a woman at her office told her how great it was that her husband had starting using the mangroomer. This conversation got her thinking how our vacation weekend would be with just the two of us minus my back hair. &lt;br /&gt;Let me just say this thing is a great product, I was able to easily reach all my back hair. It felt great to be back hair free with just a 5 min shave. Not only was my girlfreind happy with my new look I was releived that it was so easy to make this change.</li>
            <li> Worked fine for about 6 months, then the coil spring holding the battery broke, rendering it useless. Similar problem with the Norelco Bodygroomer where the pushbutton on/off button ceased to work after about a year.</li>
            <li> I have used this device twice and am very impressed.  It took a little getting used to but it works very well now that I have got the hang of it.  Expect to spend about 15 minutes per shave.  I recommend using a bathroom with a mirrored medicine cabinet door.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product, very happy with the performance of this unit.  All the positive reviews affirm  that this is a great product. There is no more twisting and pulling muscles to reach around and try to shave, this is so much easier to do. It is a great value and does the job right.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product yesterday after reading everyone&#x27;s reviews here. In my last relationship my girlfriend use to nair my back for me...but alas all good things come to an end. So when I saw this I thought it was a God send...and sure enough once I used it it was. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The product is light and made out of plastic but don&#x27;t let that fool you. You will thank the makers if you have a lot of back hair, like me, cause it took a bit to do the whole thing. The blade is awesome and I even used it to shave my chest (also very hairy) and it did a great job!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A tip, try going back and forth with the blade instead of in just one direction (i.e. Kinda like a vacuum) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am really pleased with this product and thank everyone here for helping me make my decision. Sometimes you order something and don&#x27;t have any user opinions and it is a shot in the dark with some products!</li>
            <li> I picked one up on the Mangroomer site over the Summer and have loved it! No more trips to get waxed and its already paid for itself.</li>
            <li> This item is terrible.  A waste of money.  I would not recommend it at all.  It just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Trimmer works well, won&#x27;t give you a super close shave, and be careful because it will still cut open sensitive skin areas.</li>
            <li> The Mangroomer do it yourself electric back hair shaver is truly a great invention.While it is battery operated which is great, the ease that a person can use this shaver is utmost in the great review of this product. Don&#x27;t pass this up if you have hair to remove on your back.</li>
            <li> Very impressed and happy with this product.  I&#x27;ve used it three times and can tell you it works well and gets easier to use each time.  I can&#x27;t put in words how happy I am to remove my back hair!!!!</li>
            <li> the mangroomer has a great design: it really lets you reach every part of your back. the problem is that it eats your skin! i had huge red welts after a few seconds of using the mangroomer. it took a couple of days for my skin to calm down. .</li>
            <li> We purchased the Mangroomer, to shave the hair off my husband&#x27;s back and shoulders.  He has a light growth all over those areas and he&#x27;s always felt self-conscious about it...so we were eager to try the Mangroomer.  However...we were worried that shaving would make the hair grow back heavier or that it would cause in-grown hairs (yuck!).  We were happily surprised and here&#x27;s our review...    THE GOOD NEWS:  Mangroomer works as described.  We have to shave his back about once a week and it doesn&#x27;t seem to cause in-grown hairs or heavier hair growth.  My husband enjoys having a hairless back.  It improves his self-esteem, it feels more comfortable under his shirts and he seems to sweat less.  The Mangroomer is light-weight...but it feels sturdy and it&#x27;s easy for me to shave his back.    THE BAD NEWS:  You have to go over each area repeatedly, to remove the hair completely.  This would probably be difficult for my husband to do alone...luckily he has me to help.  It&#x27;s hard to get a completely smooth shave...it doesn&#x27;t go right to the skin, like a razor does...but maybe that&#x27;s how you avoid the in-grown hair?  There&#x27;s stubble on his back in about 4-5 days...so we could probably shave twice a week, instead of once...but we&#x27;re not that picky.  For someone else...this might be a high-maintenance way to remove hair...and it might be difficult to do alone.    OUR SUMMARY:  This is a quality item that does what it promises.  If you have light hair...it should be easy to groom yourself.  For heavier hair...you may need someone else to do the shaving once or twice a week.  Finally...some reviews indicate that this item is lightweight and cheap...but we feel that it&#x27;s lightweight and sturdy...which is important...because a heavyweight item would be hard to shave yourself with.  This item needs to be lightweight, for those who have to shave themselves.  We can&#x27;t imagine that any other electric razor would do a better job.    If you have back hair...give Mangroomer a try!</li>
            <li> Finally - an alternative to waxing.  I bought this product after hearing about it on the radio and I must say - it is worth the money!  I have a good patch of hair on my entire back and this thing sliced through it like nothing. It takes a little getting used to the manuevering in a mirror to get the angles right to cover your entire back but it is worth it.  By the second or third time using it, I had it mastered.  If the hair is thick in some areas you might have to use it twice but it will take it off.  Highly recommeneded.</li>
            <li> I purchased the mangroomer about 3 months ago and have used it every few weeks.  It is still difficult for me to maneuver and the batteries only last about 2 shaves before needing to be replaced.  It has a wide blade and does work if your patient enough to go over the same spot a couple of times but I&#x27;m left wishing I had purchased the Philips Norelco Bodygroom Shaver instead.</li>
            <li> Happy to report that after reading some mixed reviews -- this is a great gadget. I think whoever wrote the reviews that claim it does not work well must be decendents of the Woolly Mammoth or a cousin of Chewbacca (Star Wars). I have a bunch of stray hairs here and there that must look unappealing when others see me in Yoga. This does the trick and is quick. For those of you with a shag carpet growing on your back.. of course this is not going to work. Dude.... get a wax job or keep your shirt on at the beach. For all others it&#x27;s a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li> I heard the adds and finally tried it. It works well and I am very impressed! I hope this product holds up for many years!</li>
            <li> This is my third and best back shaver I have owned. With its long arm I can get my whole back by my self in less then 10 min. No more grizzly Bear.</li>
            <li> If you have any back hair at all get this product. This product shaves the hair down so close and is very easy to get every angle you need. I was actually shocked. I would say you have to use it once a month. The hair is comming back a bit now and I used it more than three weeks ago. Well worth the $40.</li>
            <li> Just received this product yesterday (03/19/08) and tried it today. Wow, was not expecting the cutters to be so sharp. There way to long in my opinion. Needs to be shorter. But as I was using it, it left red scratch marks all over my back. Seemed to be temporary though. I just wouldn&#x27;t use it right before you go outside with your shirt off. It did however cut kind of close. Note that I said kind of. You can still see and feel the cut hair. But it&#x27;s not to bad. Still might have to use a razor if you want that extra closeness.    Everyone seems to be complaining  about the cheapness of the product. It&#x27;s true... I&#x27;m having problems keeping the battery lid staying shut. Likes to pop open for some reason. Nothing tape can&#x27;t fix. I just hope the product lasts.    I should also say, its loud too. Maybe louder than your average hair clippers at your barber/beauty shop.</li>
            <li> I just used this unique back shaver for the first time and I am impressed. I was self conscious of the amount of back hair I had and did not want to ask a friend to help shave my back. I tried just using a normal trimmer and razor but that did not work.    It took less then 10 min to fully shave my back with the Mangroomer. I only had to use the one mirror in my bathroom. It left a couple red marks but I&#x27;m pretty sure they are from user error and will go away. With more practice it will probably go faster and more smoother.     After reading some of the other reviews, I was skeptical about how much hair it would leave behind. After using it, I could not physically see any hair stubble on my back but I could feel it. If it shaved any closer I&#x27;m afraid it would be a lot easier to cut yourself.    There is nothing else on the market like this product. If you are self conscious about your back hair, order this now. You will be amazed how different shirts feel on your back without that layer of hair.</li>
            <li> Dear Gorilla Bros,  The Mangroomer works effectively without cutting your back or neck. It feels cheap, but works great. I&#x27;d gladly pay extra for a gadget that is sturdier.   It takes a while to get used to working with it, but I got it done the first time. No shredded skin like my hair clippers used to inflict on me. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Gets to the places you cant reach with a regular razor and dont want to ask someone else to do.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product if you have body hair anywhere that is causing you to avoid swimming, exercise without a shirt etc.  The product cleans up the body perfectly and you will find yourself as smooth as a peach.</li>
            <li> The unit stopped working after 45 days.  The company would not respond or back their product.  Only a 30 day warranty.  I tried to repair it myself - I disassembled it and moved the wires on the motor and it has worked ever since.  The product performs its function ok (adequate, not great), just did not like the poor quality.  I am surprised Amazon is carrying the product again.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done, cuts relatively low but it does take some getting use to.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try it out... I was desperate and embaressed to ask anyone to trim/shave my backhair so I got it thinking anything would be better than what its been. I got it and I must say Im suprised it cleans it up pretty nicely. Its not entirely smooth its just a close buzz...but it does the job. It took couple min to get the hang of it in the mirror and about 10 min to do my whole back and shoulders. Im impressed I like it. I just wish it was a little but wider for faster cleanups.</li>
            <li> Works ok. The actual clippers are nit fine enough to take the hair down. Needs the head from the Bodygroomer.</li>
            <li> did you know your back grows hair?  oh your back doesnt grow hair?  well screw you! JERK!    sorry.  that was uncalled for.  I apologize.  I&#x27;ve had a rough week.  Anyway this thing is great.  Makes it much easier to &#x27;tidy up&#x27; my back and is a lot cheaper than having to go to the bus stop and pay some homeless dude to do it for me - i&#x27;m not that flexible you see.  But this little beauty is excellent at getting those hard to reach places.  back is nice and clean now and i no longer have to wear that natural sweater.    enjoy!</li>
            <li> Cut my back all up...good thing i only paid ten bucks for it bc it was deff a bad buy!</li>
            <li> I didnt think that an item that cost so little could possibly work as good as it does. Was I ever wrong. This does a unbelievable job. I just wonder how long it will stay as sharp as it is. Even if it only last 5 or 6 times you will still save a ton of money vs waxing. I&#x27;m sold !!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This thing makes you have a complete hairless back. Freaking awesome! only con is that it requires two double A batteries. otherwise perfect! i am still giving it 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I almost never do reviews like this, but was motivated to write up a review of this item.  Simply put, it works, which is amazing, as I thought there weren&#x27;t any options here other than waxing, which gave me acne, and expensive laser hair removal.      It will take a bit more time and patience than you might think, but after 20 to 30 minutes, you will have a smooth back.  I encountered a bit of irritation, but nothing too bad.  Buy this item.</li>
            <li> Out of the box, my unit didn&#x27;t work. So I have nothing positive to say.</li>
            <li> Great idea but the cutters don&#x27;t work.  It pulls the hair with no cutting action despite reviews to the contrary.  Spend your money on something else.</li>
            <li> My Mangroomer got delivered today from Amazon. I glanced at the instructions (not that there&#x27;s much to know about it), popped in a couple batteries, went into the bathroom, took off my shirt, and went to work. In about 10 minutes, my back was smooth. It was definitely the easiest solution I ever used for removing back hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;1) It works extremely well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) It&#x27;s tricky in that you need two mirrors (a bathroom mirror and hand mirror suffice) and the motions you use don&#x27;t come naturally. You kind of have to feel where you&#x27;re moving it. But you get used to it and it&#x27;s actually very easy, which is nice. Just relax and take your time and soon you&#x27;ll have all the excess hair off your back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) It kind of feels nice. Like a mild back scratcher. It didn&#x27;t leave any marks on me and doesn&#x27;t feel excessively sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;1) It&#x27;s not the sturdiest appliance. The plastic is lightweight and if you drop it, I can see it breaking. It folds open but feels a little loose. This doesn&#x27;t affect the performance as the pressure you apply keeps it rigid, but it still has that initial loose feel to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The hair you shave off seems attracted to the plastic like static. A minor annoyance, but it&#x27;s something that will have you wiping it off with a rag to get rid of all that hair clinging to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things to Note&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;I see they sell extra heads. The fact that they do suggests that the heads have a lifespan. Also, there is no cap or cover for the blade. The blade itself isn&#x27;t overly sharp or pointy, so unless you gouge yourself, you shouldn&#x27;t have any scratches. It doesn&#x27;t remove hair completely smooth like you just waxed or use a hair removal cream, but it still does a very very nice job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advice for How to Use&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;I held it by the blade part of the shaft near the joint, reached back, and then brought it from the center of my back outwards. Switching arms, that took care of my lower back. I then used the full telescoping handle and went from above, like in the illustration, and that took care of my upper back. I recommend using the mirror to see where there&#x27;s hair, and then just going by the feel of it. You can hear when the blade comes in contact with hair and can feel the parts of your back that you&#x27;ve done (like getting your back scratched). Then use the mirrors again to see where you missed. The important thing to do is to relax and take your time. Hold it with a firm grip since I don&#x27;t recommend dropping it, and soon you&#x27;ll get the hang of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gone through a lot to remove my back hair over the years. For the first time, I can do it all myself with little effort. I&#x27;m definitely happy I got this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rate it four stars. It would have gotten a five-star rating had it been built a little more rugged. I see there is a rugged model, but for the pricing, I think this one should have been made a little tougher. Still, it&#x27;s very very effective and it&#x27;s easy. That makes it a good purchase.full telescoping handle and went from above, like in the illustration, and that took care of my upper back.

            <li> I was long curious about this product and wanted to share my experiences. I am a tall gentleman of Mediterranean descent, so let&#x27;s just say a product aimed at body-hair issues was something that interested me.  I had heard the Mangroomer ads on Sirius XM, but $40 always seemed excessive, particularly as I&#x27;ve purchased a number of beard and (head) hair trimmers over the years and they seldom lasted more than a year. ( Note to my fair haired counterparts, you guys have it easy.  Those of us with thick, curly hair destroy all gizmos aimed at reducing hair volume.  Electric razors for the face are totally out of the question.)    Anyway, I took the plunge and purchased during a sale for $18.93.  I am pleased to say it works as advertised - the head is a bit wider than your typical electric trimmer.  The handle piece works fine, although it seems a tad flimsy.  I appreciate that it&#x27;s battery operated so there&#x27;s no cumbersome cord.  But there&#x27;s nothing especially flexible about it, it just makes the trimmer longer, and maybe helps at a few angles.   The real test will be how long this thing lasts. I&#x27;ve killed many a device in my time, so I&#x27;ll update accordingly.</li>
            <li> If I were a praying man, I would say my prayers had been answered.  This little wonder works beautifully.  It trims VERY close to the skin, but is comfortable and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.  I don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews here.  Maybe they got a defective unit?  Dunno.  Mine works fine.  Couldn&#x27;t ask for better.</li>
            <li> The good reviews are correct.  Yes it is lightweight, but the blade is very good.  Give it some practice and it will do what it says it will do.  To avoid bumps use a back brush to exfoliate when the hair starts to come back in.  I am so glad I can quit spending $[..] every two months for waxing (and avoiding the pain).</li>
            <li> In fairness, I have to start off by saying that I had this product for over a year and used it successfully 15-20 times.  The longer I had it, the more frequently it consumed batteries.  After sitting in the drawer for a few weeks, it wouldn&#x27;t start when I&#x27;d turn it on.  I regularly cleaned the cutters with a brush and lubed them with Tri-flow, but that didn&#x27;t seem to help.  Sometimes, I could get it going by push-starting the blade with a pencil or something, but mostly it wanted fresh batteries to get going.      Finally, even fresh batteries couldn&#x27;t get it going, so I took it apart to see what I could see.  The drive motor has a plastic cam that connects to a plastic arm that moves the blade back and forth.  The motor is *tiny*.  I&#x27;m thinking 3/4\\&quot; diameter and 1-1/4\\&quot; long.  It was fried, so I threw the whole thing away.    Would I buy it again?  Yes if it was $20.  Not at $40!  Come on, it is a light-duty, battery powered trimmer on a long plastic handle.</li>
            <li> I came back to update this review. While I did run into problems with product, I was able to get a replacement from their customer service department. They also provide a free ear and nose trimmer. My point is that if you have run into quality issues with your product, you should call or write to them, and see what they can do for you.</li>
            <li> This is the best product i have ever bought on Amazon.com. Its simple, rugged, and abosultely usefull and it delivers what it promises. I just love it. had it for two years till i broke it, it didnt break on its own. If you have one, try not to drop it on the ground. Thats what happened to me.....</li>
            <li> This product works amazing.It feels a little flimsy, but does a great job. Any guy who wants to get rid of his back hair needs to get this product. You can remove the hair in the privacy of your own home, without the need to ask someone to do it for you. I have a lot of hair, and thought it would take a few times to remove it all. It got rid of it all in one try. Like everyone has said, it takes a little getting used to, but it&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
            <li> perfect, does what it says it will do.  Takes some time to get everything if you don&#x27;t have someone to help you, but the good news is, you CAN shave your whole back if you are patient enough, which was impossible prior to this razor!</li>
            <li> I just bought the Mangroomer yesterday after reading some of these reviews. First off, I have to say, there was absolutely ZERO pain involved while shaving my back and I don&#x27;t know how there even could be. Some people also complained about how difficult it was to get the hang of shaving backwards in a mirror, which I also found to be quite easy.    All in all, it only took about 15 minutes from the time I opened the package, to the time I was done man-scaping my back.    Great product and it sure beats the hell out of lashing a disposable razor to a back scratacher!</li>
            <li> It absolutely removes the hair and in places that are impossible to reach without someone else to help, so it&#x27;s less embarassing. It is not a clean shave, though, so while it improves back hair problems, it does not eliminate them. It is cheaply constructed, which is concerning. It sucks batteries very quickly.</li>
            <li> The plastic and construction quality of Mangroomer is poor. The packaging gives the feeling there should be an adapter for recharging the unit under the left side pocket but the system works on two AA batteries (not included).    From design stand point, it is a nice concept but if you don&#x27;t want to use this for shaving back there is no way to detach the extended handle or to open it all the way to be aligned with the body of the groomer.    I won&#x27;t expect the unit to last long. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought this Mangroomer after reading many reviews, most positive , but a few negative, and I have to say it was great. A little hard to get all the spots on my back without twisting and turning the Mangroover, but it did get everywhere, and I have a very hairy back and am a very heavy guy, but was able to do it all myself, which was wonderful. My back was a little red after I was done, but it went away fast and no cuts. I would recommend this product to anyone that has unwanted back hair and has always had to get someone else to help them shave, no more, you can do it yourself. Thanks for all the reviews and I hope this review will help you decide too.</li>
            <li> Mangroomer gets the job done.  Helps you get to those hard to reach places.  Although for the money it is cheaply made.  Doesn&#x27;t feel like it will last a long time.  I feel like I will have to replace it in the not too distance future.  But it&#x27;s the only thing I have found that really works.  So until I find a better made alternative I will use this product.</li>
            <li> Works well - makes it easier to reach the hard to reach areas but would be better if there were a slight curve to the handle to make using it even easier</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I use it on my back and shoulders. I used to shave my shoulders and practically disjoint my shoulders to trim the rest with a regular clipper. This tool eliminates the need for all of that. Plus, the hair on my shoulder is becoming thinner and less noticeable since I&#x27;ve stopped shaving it with a blade. Get it. No one likes back hair.</li>
            <li> It gets 1 star for the \\&quot;idea\\&quot;. Im thinking about attaching a real shaver to this with ductape or something. The blades and teeth got caught in my hair and sort of tore it out. Do not buy this thing unless you have very fine, unnoticeable hair. In which case you probably don&#x27;t need it. Really flimsy and cheap, not worth what you pay for it.</li>
            <li> I was a bit reluctant to try this product, not completely believing it would be as efficient and easy to use as quoted by other reviewers, but this product does what it says and does it splendidly.</li>
            <li> Bought this on a whim...Product works great.  Never thought I&#x27;d like it but it helps reach those hard to reach places and works just fine...great gift.</li>
            <li> I just received my product, and I am so impressed that I felt I needed to immediately try to add a little clarity to the mess of reviews. There were many reviews of this product that talked about a lack of power, and the inability to trim hairs as well as being painful to use and red splotches and bumps associated with using this product. I found none of the above to be true. The electric razor cuts hair cleanly at every angle I tried. I actually cringed when I started to use it because there had been so much talk of pain associated with use. I have very tender skin, and course back hair, and it was absolutely painless.   The red splotches last all of about 2 minutes and are just from the metal rubbing against your skin. The trimmer is safe to the touch; even when pressed firmly against the tender skin of my forearm did not nick or cut the skin at all. In fact I didn&#x27;t even feel it. I assure you that when you go to the barber and he/she uses clippers to trim your hair, the skin turns red for a couple of minutes. This is just a physiological result, and is far from irritating or permanent.   Also worth note, is the weight of the product - very light, and the reach and flexibility it gives you with one hand. I am 6&#x27;, and could almost reach over my shoulder and get to the lowest part of my back. There are absolutely no negatives. If you&#x27;re looking at this product, it&#x27;s because you are looking to get rid of hard to reach hair, and if this is so, this product is a must buy. Look no further.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually don&#x27;t post reviews, I think some are bogus. I purchased the Mangroomer over a year ago and I have the highest compliment I can give to a product. DO NOT... I REPEAT, DO NOT believe the negative reviews on this product. Its the second product I purchased for back hair removal and im very proud to say it works. That other hair removal product..rayzoba just didn&#x27;t quite do the job to my satisfaction.   PROS: Its an electric shaver for fast close shaving        It has an adjustable handle that telescopes!.. Its long enough for           me to reach the most difficult back spots.   CONS: The blade is kinda sharp but noisy, At first try you feel like its cutting your back, you will get used to it. Take a shower AFTER you have shaved. A 3-way mirror in your bed or bath would help, but thats not a fault of the product.   I use this Mangroomer very often. Since ive been using the mangroomer I can walk into the gym proud with no guilt and embarrassment of no longer having a hairy back. OMG...what a relieve that is! I still will do a laser treatment if money is no object but for now the mangroomer definately does the job.  Give it a try!</li>
            <li> This item worked incredibly well. I can&#x27;t believe how close it got and the ease in which it removed my annoying back hair. It&#x27;s nice having my shirt touch my back again for the first time in longer than I can remember. I would definitely suggest this product to anyone who is in the slightest self conscious about their back hair. With it, there is no more worrying about taking your shirt off and no embarrassment about having anyone else do the dirty job for you.</li>
            <li> At first it&#x27;s a little weird to get used to..The second use was much easier..What a great product..I would recommend this to anyone with a hairy back</li>
            <li> Over 6 years - I&#x27;ve used this shaver every 6 - 8 weeks (more often in summer - shirtless weather) for over 6 years, and I thought I should update my original review: NO problems!  The razor still performs like new. I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant dulling of the blades.  Great product!  Original review: Like some other reviewers I thought it felt a little lightweight, flimsy out of the box.  But after using it twice, the lightweight helps reduce arm strain, and it didn&#x27;t feel cheap at all, and I&#x27;m impressed with the design.  I found the best method for me was to slowly draw the head back and forth, instead of just one direction.  My first use took about 10-15 minutes to completely remove the hair from my back &amp; shoulders, and it did a great job (stand in a shower stall, or you&#x27;ll get hair all over).  Good product!</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!! Would recommend it to any of my friends that needs to do some MANSCAPING. Hands down the best thing I&#x27;ve EVER purchased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for over a year and it still work pretty well. If you can oil the blades it&#x27;ll last longer. A very good buy.</li>
            <li> PRODUCT WORKS AS EXPECTED .WACKS THROUGH THE THICKEST JUNGLES WITH EEZZE!!! I RECOMEND THIS PRODUCR FOR YOUR DIFFICULT TO REACH MANSCAPPING NEEDS</li>
            <li> This is a good item but it does not cut hair as good as I thought.  But it is a good buy if you want to shave a small area.</li>
            <li> Bought one of these before and I broke it. So I bought another one and I&#x27;m now relieved of itchy back hair problems. I know they make a professional model but have yet to chance and try it. It&#x27;s more expensive but have yet to see that model up close. They both look the same from the pictures.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mangroomer Back Shaver 9 months ago. It worked fine at first but has since stopped working completely. I tried contacting the manufacture: Mangroomer, several times, but have not received a reply. I emailed them a month ago and then again a little over two weeks ago. No reply. This is beyond frustrating. I will never purchase another Mangroomer made product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update* OK, So, after submitting this review Mangroomer has sent me a message (that&#x27;s different from the reply here where all can see) where they accuse me of \\&quot;making fake positive reviews\\&quot; for a different item on Amazon and that they are going to report me. Hahaha&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Mangroomer so much. Now I know that I made the correct decision with this review. I&#x27;m delighted that other customers will see how poor your product and service is.</li>
            <li> So I am a hairy beast.  Not the hairiest but more than a fair amount of animal pelt grows on my back.  Wish it didn&#x27;t as it is gross and my wife does not like it. I&#x27;ve tried 2 other shavers to much frustration and 30-45 minute sessions of trying to trim down.&lt;br /&gt;Got the mangroomer and have to say it is by far the best on the market.  I put in the batteries, tried a sample spot and WOW it trimmed the hedges down to the skin much like a hair clipper would shave a head.  Within 10 minutes of my first attempt at using this my back was gorgeous!  ha, seriously very little trial and error and without looking I got 60% of it, in the mirror 1/2 looking another 30% and then with detailed attention got the last 10%.  Sure there may be a few hairs here or there but I can&#x27;t see them in the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the mangroomer back shaver to clear the back 40.  Only negative is it is so lightweight it feels cheap, we&#x27;ll see how long it lasts.  In the mean time I am thrilled (and better yet so is the wife!)</li>
            <li> The first time I used this, I knew this was a great product. Previously I strapped my Norelco Bodygroom to a back scratcher with numerous rubber bands, and achieved limited success. With the Mangroomer, I have very good control over my entire back. The shave is comfortable and close, but the blades aren&#x27;t sharp enough to disturb warts or other skin imperfections. Using a mirror can be tricky, so for the most part I do it by feel, and check my results periodically. I was initially hesitant to buy this, fearing a cheaply made product due to the low cost, but I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised at the quality I&#x27;m actually receiving.</li>
            <li> Okay, I&#x27;m really pleased with this product.  I haven&#x27;t felt so comfortable shirtless since I took the third highest fee at the 9th grade poolside bachelor auction.  What, they didn&#x27;t do that at your school?  Hmph.  Anyway, the Mangroomer is easy to use, even for the first time.  It does a good job, and doesn&#x27;t take too long to get the job done.  Takes a little dexterity at first, and you need to get good at translating what you see in the mirror or mirrors to actual actions that you intended to perform.  It&#x27;s not too terribly ruggedly built, but it&#x27;s not expensive enough that I really mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My problem with this product is the legal ramifications.  I had to fend off several lawsuits from environmentalists claiming that the bird nesting in my back hair were an endangered species, and I was disturbing their habitat.  Once the judge ruled in my favor, the blades did a good job of shredding the nests, but the minced feathers can make you sneeze, so you may want to wear a face mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to overestimate the satisfaction of having a smooth, hairless back.  I can now fall asleep at parties without waking to find amusing/obscene/anti-Huguenot slogans shaved into my back.  Tshirts now stick to my back in a very close, heat-retaining way when it gets hot outside.  And the clippings make a wonderful upholstery stuffing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last warning.  If you lose your balance while twisting to reach that last spot, subsequent groomer flailing may have you shaving your arms and/or legs rather than walk around with a stripe.  Allow 45 to 78 minutes for this procedure, depending on follicle density.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another last warning; if you fly with your mangroomer, make sure you take the batteries out before you check your bag.  Picking up a buzzing bag at baggage claim earns you some funny looks.</li>
            <li> I received this product yesterday and tried it out. It works great, with a little bit of handling it produced the results as advertised. The actual blades and the shaving head is kind of flimsy, maybe it need to have two cutting edges instead of one to make it more robust. Overall it provides good value of money and simplifies removing hair on the back.</li>
            <li> The Mangroomer came in one of those hard-shelled plastic containers, which are always fun to open. The battery door is a little flimsy. I have used it once and did receive the nicks and cuts others have mentioned, but considering that you rarely cut your back hair that was to be expected. It is reasonably well made with the many different angles you can set being incredibly useful. The bottom line is that my back is hairless which is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HQ0L2E/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_prod_title</li>
            <li> Excellent, Useful and good power for shaving close.  Good grip/durable. Great angles. Very useful. Recommended for everybody hair grooming.!! Fast shipping and Great delivery.</li>
            <li> A good grooming tool for a mans back. Easy to reach all places but can be a bit rough at first to your skin, especially if hair is very long.</li>
            <li> I have a very hairy back and hate using depilatories and waxes.  This groomer makes reaching the hard to reach areas easy.  Also, the blades cut very close to the skin and I have never been cut.  It&#x27;s very comfortable to use.  It will cut your back hair down to the skin to the point that it is not noticeable but you will need to shave to create an upclose smooth look.  One word of cause:  Don&#x27;t use this groomer and then use a depilatory like Nair.  The groom works like a back scratcher against your skin.  If you put Nair on your skin immediately after using the groomer then you will get red scratches from the chemicals.  I absolutely love this groomer!</li>
            <li> I received the item, and it works well.  Battery operated is sufficient, nice design.  Packaging was a bit much, but I guess that&#x27;s a manufacturer decision.</li>
            <li> This version that&#x27;s available on Amazon is battery-operated. What you might not know is that there&#x27;s also a professional version of this, the box looks exactly the same but it also says \\&quot;Professional\\&quot; on it, there are no batteries at all and you recharge it by plugging it in (the first time you use it, you have to plug it in for 24 hours before you can use it), this latter version is apparently not sold on Amazon but is sold at all Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond stores, and I think it sells for $10 dollars more there. I bought the one from here first, then a year or so later (when I thought I had left it behind in another state) I bought the one from Bed Bath &amp; Beyond. Otherwise they&#x27;re both exactly the same. I&#x27;ve decided to go with the rechargeable version so that I will no longer have to bother with batteries.     The only downside (other than the higher price) of the professional version is that when the recharger part of it finally wears out, the instructions tell you don&#x27;t just throw it out, there&#x27;s a circuit board inside that needs to be removed and recycled, but the instructions don&#x27;t say how or even where to go to recycle this part. The instructions that explain how to remove it make the process look like it&#x27;ll be a hassle to get the circuit board out, in comparison it&#x27;s much easier to remove and replace batteries as needed. But I&#x27;ve never had anything I&#x27;ve ever bought that you needed to plug in to recharge it to ever give out on me, or at least I have absolutely no memory of that ever happening to me, so I&#x27;m confident I&#x27;ll have the professional version around for quite a long time before that ever happens, if it ever does. So, for now I&#x27;m not going to worry too much about it.    I remember that it felt a bit awkward to use this product in general when I first bought it, but that was only when it was new to me. Now it&#x27;s easy and I don&#x27;t even think about it, I know how to move it around my back in a way that works for me, and I use it maybe once or twice a month. The particular ways I must move the mangroomer around on my back have become familiar patterns of movement, they only feel awkward the first few times until you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> well it all started when i was in high school and hated playing shirts and skins in fear i would get skins and everyone would look at my back and say... wow why are you so damm hairy!! I have always hated my back hair and never wanted to wax because i thought it would be too painfull and not worth it. my wife bought me the man groomer for valentines day and i was a little skeptical to try it. well after a couple of times of using the man groomer i must say it is awesome! its really easy to use and i love the rubber grip. the man groomer has plenty of power to cut through my back hair hair like a highway sickle bar. overall i am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Bought this item with some skepticism. But worked great, very happy with it. This way I can do the back grooming myself which is just fantastic.</li>
            <li> very substandard finishing of product, it seems its a sample. Gr8 idea but product doesn&#x27;t have good trimming capability what it is meant for and handle in different position has very loose fit.</li>
            <li> This works pretty well. It&#x27;s still awkward to cut the hair on your own back but there&#x27;s not way around that. This thing works. It always cuts the hair like it&#x27;s suppose to, has a nice long arm, and it easy to wipe clean. It&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
            <li> I love this product,I would recommend it to anyone who has a major back hair issue !!</li>
            <li> This product was great for the first six months.  It reached all angles as advertised, and the clipper was powerful enough.  Battery life was decent.  However, after 6 months, the clipper started getting weaker and weaker, until it died.  I tried changing the batteries, nothing.  I thought the problem was the head, so I snapped that off to see if the underlying mechanism was still working.  Nope.  So, I contacted Mangroomer by email to see what they could do for me.  Lo and behold, they shipped me a new one right away, along with a free gift.  Amazing customer service, and I&#x27;d deal with this company again any day of the week.</li>
            <li> This thing is a trimmer, NOT a shaver. It leaves stubble, so don&#x27;t expect great results. It&#x27;s also very poorly made. The battery cover falls off easily and when it doesn&#x27;t, hair trimmings enter the battery compartment. The handle is wobbly. The whole thing is made from the cheapest of plastics. Honestly, this is the junkiest thing I have purchased in a long time. It belongs in a dollar store and is certainly not worth the $40! I only wish there were more alternatives.</li>
            <li> I considered submitting a video review and then I imagined hundreds of people collectively \\&quot;eeewwwwwwww-ing\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I won&#x27;t be doing that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I will say though is that this device is quite flimsy, is VERY hard to use, and does a VERY poor job.  The frustration it creates alone would make it worth paying for laser treatment!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the Philips Norelco Body Groomer for several years, &amp; the rechargeable battery finally died. I must have mentioned that, because I received the Mangroomer for Christmas. Considering some of the reviews here of pulling &amp; red marks, I was a bit apprehensive at first, but took the plunge anyway. To cut to the bottom line- read the directions. If one has a rug on the back, go slow until it&#x27;s thinned out or try to cut off with scissors as much as possible first.  Let the electric razor do the work- don&#x27;t scrub, as this eliminates the red pressure marks. Make it part of your morning routine before getting in the shower. First you&#x27;ll wash off the cut hairs, &amp; not letting a rug develop is the key to any back shaver. But what I like this over the Philips unit is: the cutting head doesn&#x27;t pop off the minute any resistance is felt, the use of AA batteries, the extending handle. It&#x27;s not as close as a razor, but the Razorba handles that if that&#x27;s what you want.</li>
            <li> IF YOU HAVE PEACH FUZZ FOR BACK HAIR, THAN THIS IS YOUR TRIMMER, OTHERWISE YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PIECE OF JUNK.  IT PULLS BUT DOES NOT CUT HAIR.  THE BLADES DULL QUICKLY AND THE UNIT WAS PROBABLY MADE FOR UNDER A FEW DOLLARS.  JUNK IS AN OVERESTIMATION OF ITS QUALITY.  I TRIED EVERY CONCEIVABLE WAY TO MAKE IT WORK LIKE IT SHOULD, BUT ALL TO NO AVAIL. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GET YOUR HONEY TO USE A REAL CLIPPER TO REMOVE THE HAIR.</li>
            <li> Works great if you are tired of asking wife or girlfriend to groom your back this is perfect</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a patchy coat, so this worked great.  Not sure if it would work on really thick hair, but I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> only used it once so far but works very well, comfortable, would recommend to others</li>
            <li> Get those hard to reach spots.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome. I&#x27;ve always had to get a family member or a gf to do this. I got it and trimmed my hair on my back in 5 min. Easy to use. I do recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Like everyone, I was excited to finally have a product that was able to trim my back.  What I was not expecting was the absolute slice fest that occurred.  This trimmer has about as much power as a nose trimmer.  And when it does connect, it rips the hair right out.  I took literally ten pressured swipes and it was like my back never even saw a trimmer.  the only tell tale sign was the huge red welts a nd slices that appeared on my back.  They were more noticeable in a nice hot shower.  You know, a shower that felt like it was alcohol on open wounds.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hair.  All hair needs to be cut/trimmed.  Do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon packaging fine.&lt;br /&gt;Product packaging: dangerous, withstanding an atomic blast fortress shield of plastic.  Hate... HATE this kind of packaging where the only options are ruining a pair of scissors and slicing your hand on the cut plastic, or stabbing your hand, leg, arm while using a pocket knife and slicing your hand on the cut plastic.  HATE IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product.  Lightweight.  The arm on mine is a lose...wobbly lose.  The silver button makes the arm longer....if you push hard enough.  Not really necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blade:  Awwwwwesommmme!  Seriously.  Not that impressed with product at first... but fired it up, easily trimmed my back............then my butt (why not?).......and chest.  Recklessly went over my nipples, didn&#x27;t even hurt or cut.  The blade does an amazing trim.  It&#x27;s like a back scratcher.  Dig it.  Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, contrary to other reviews, rechargeable batters do work.  (although, I knocked it a little bit, and they stopped working, the cover wouldn&#x27;t stay on...took more effort than it should, but yes, rechargeable batters and once cover is on, works fine)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product feels a little cheap, but the blade makes up for it.  Cuts really close, but not (nor did I expect it to) cut as close as a razor blade.  I&#x27;m now prepped for waxing.  Yes, Man UP.  It&#x27;s not that bad.  I&#x27;ve been when they just went for it... without trimming... and yes... wow... hurts...but there are worse things.  The disgust I have for back hair outweighs a little temporary suffering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost worth 4 stars because of the ease of use, quality of blade....it just feels so cheap.......so glad it works!</li>
            <li> The concept is Great but the product is made VERY Cheap... I had it about a year and the motor started to slow down making it a bit more painful to shave.  I would shake it and it would go back to high speed.  The batteries were changed with the results being the same until the motor went out.  It is now in the garbage and so is $39.99 I spent on it after one year.    \\&quot;A BIG waste of MONEY\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I just tried it for the first time, and it&#x27;s pretty easy. You won&#x27;t get all the hair on the first pass, but subsequent tries finished the job. I&#x27;m sure this will improve with future uses.</li>
            <li> I am 35 and have been shaving my back for years. I thought I would give this a try to see if it made my life easier. It does not. I actually have a much better way to get a smooth sexy back. I will explain it in case it helps anybody. First I started with a metal spatula. It has almost a right angle bend to it. I got it at the dollar store. Then you need a razor that has a square handle. I use the cheapest ones at walmart. I actually find that the cheap razors work good on back hair. Now take about 10\\&quot; of duct tape and put the put the middle on the front of the razor. Put the back of the razor on the front of the spatula. Now wrap the ends of the duct tape around the back of the spatula really tightly. That&#x27;s it, now you have a razor with an extended handle at the perfect angle for shaving your back. The duct tape holds it really well but gives it a little play room that is nice. It works 10 times better than this product in my opinion. The problem with this is it is not a smooth shave just a close trim and it takes a long time to get there. As far as ingrown hairs go, I have never got one in my years of using a razor. On the other hand, if you aren&#x27;t currently shaving your back hair and think this would help. By all means get it right away, there is no excuse for just letting it grow.</li>
            <li> Works well, takes some getting used to but beats asking the wife to shave your back for sure.</li>
            <li> It does a decent job and for the price it is G2G. Could be a wee more adjustable</li>
            <li> It gets the job done, easy to use, it sucks that you can&#x27;t just charge it though. Very loud so don&#x27;t use this during the night and don&#x27;t use it if you&#x27;re in a rush to a pull because it leaves little marks or trail on your back but goes away in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Manscaping could not be easier.  Do yourself and your wife, girlfriend, or boyfriend a favor and get this.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I just purchased Mangroomer for my boyfriend and what a difference!  He has always had a significant back hair problem and has tried several different trimming products that have all been unsatisfactory.  He has been using the Mangroomer for a month now and is ecstatic with the results (so am I!).   &lt;br /&gt;Ladies, if your man is a hairy boy and you want him to have a nice, silky smooth, hairless back once again, this is what you need to get him ASAP!</li>
            <li> I previously posted the review below, and contacted Mangroomer directly for a refund. I received a same-day reply from the company.   Mangroomer support apologized for the product they claimed was defective.   They sent out a new product via FedEx same day free of charge. I&#x27;ve finally tried it out and it seems to work perfectly, with none of the problems I was experiencing before. Apparently some of these trimmers are defective -   I&#x27;m not the only reviewer who posted similar complaints. However, the product support is great and the folks at Manpower will bend over backwards to make sure you are satisfied. So if you encounter a problem with your   Mangroomer, you should contact the Mangroomer folks directly [...]</li>
            <li> Once I got the right angle on the back the shaver worked great. No problems at all. I defintely recommend it.</li>
            <li> UPDATE:  MANGROOMER has been in contact and they are sending a new unit free of charge.  Very friendly and very apologetic.  They are not even making send the defective one back.  Very Impressed with the customer service!    Well, the half that was completed, it was great.  But as many people say on here, it is poorly constructed.  Halfway through, the top part with the razor fell off.  It appears the motion of the blades broke off both bottom front anchors that help to hold the top surface on.  For a second I tried to recall if I dropped it...which I didn&#x27;t.  I called Mangroomer and apparently got their after hour answer service.  They took my name, number and email, and said someone will get back to me tomorrow.  I may modify my rating if they actually follow through with a new one, as she promised.  Until then, I had to find the 1002nd use for duct tape.  I taped the top portion on, and was able to finish.  Worked just like new, but for the price, shouldn&#x27;t have to use duct tape ANYWHERE on this thing!  I&#x27;ll update after tomorrow.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor and once I figured out how to use it properly it worked great. Second time I used it, it slipped out of my hand and broke. I was pretty mad since I had just got it. I wrote to the company and they replacesd if for me. If you have a hairy back this will help you out greatly. It does a good job.</li>
            <li> The product is the best Ive come accross. It worked PERFECTLY well and much better than expected. Great Buy!</li>
            <li> This is the most effective whole body shaver I&#x27;ve tried. I purchased one last November, but dropped it, and it broke.  The second one I bought stopped working, but the company replaced it without any question. I did not have to return either of the previous ones.  I&#x27;ve had the current one for four months, and I use it once a week.  It gives close non-irritating shaves and is easy to clean and use.  One negative:  the batteries are not rechargeable.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt; Only used the groomer once but it did a great job. Worth the 40 bucks.</li>
            <li> you got a choice be a person who shaves their back or be someone with a hairy back.    shave your back    anyway this thing works real good and real fast shipping</li>
            <li> Great product. Works well. I wish it had a hair catcher because I have to clean the entire bathroom after every use. I would still reccomend.</li>
            <li> I have several \\&quot;man grooming\\&quot; products as hair is not as in as it used to be.  This one works great, although it does hurt a little bit until you get used to it.  You have to gently shave teh area and then it works great.  No stubs on regrowth.  Feels smooth and natural.  I was getting a massage (no Happy Ending) and the massuese said, \\&quot;You hairy, you Italian\\&quot;.  She, being Asian, had never seen such growth.  Ever since I got this groomer, my back, neck and shoulders look great.  Guys that say it doesn&#x27;t work must have that wolf-like, matted, sweater backs that we see once in a while on the beach.  They might need a Briggs and Straton whacker for those \\&quot;difficult\\&quot; backs.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Threw it in the trash today - the same day I got it. I doesn&#x27;t cut the hair. What is the point?</li>
            <li> Works like a charm. I&#x27;ve got a huge back, so it takes awhile to groom in between my lats and such, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> First off, the product does work as described. However, this thing is one of the most cheaply constructed, flimsy products I have ever used. The plastic is incredibly cheap and brittle and would not likely survive a 2-3 foot drop onto anything other than padded carpet. After about the 3rd or 4th time using mine, the adjuster button for the extension arm snapped off inside from simply pressing it in, so now it will no longer lock in position at the various extension intervals. Also the thing would not power on after only a few uses unless I banged on it repeatedly (I made sure good batteries were in it first). All-in all, like I said the shaver does a decent job without biting the skin but the price is outrageous for the poor quality of materials, construction and sheer lack of engineering. If I had to guess, one of these probably costs around $1.50 to make. I am currently looking for a better-made alternative to this product and I suggest others do the same.</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  I am a hairy beast and it made my back smooth as silk.  Use it once and it pays for itself.  Waxing is expensive!!!  Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought this product with some skepticism based on the reviews that it was poorly and cheaply manufactured. Well, that might be as I&#x27;ve had a hard time extending the handle. My only concern is that if I \\&quot;gorilla\\&quot; with too much torque, I&#x27;ll break it. So maybe I&#x27;m babying it a little but with that being said, it&#x27;s the only product out there that allows me to keep my back clean. It does the job as advertised without the need to be a contortionist. Takes a little getting use to but I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> this is perfect foe the man who wants to keep a clean back .  GREAT</li>
            <li> If this were a plug-in appliance, it would be much better. (it is battery operated)    It has cut me many, many times.    Angle of the head is not optimal for getting most of my back hair. (it is difficult to \\&quot;push\\&quot; clipper, rather than \\&quot;pull\\&quot;)        bottom line:  when I first bought this, I was excited.  It was first time I had ever seen anything like this.  The are others out there now.  Try those ones instead of the mangroomer.</li>
            <li> This product is very difficult to use and can only be used for weekly or daily maintenance.  This will not work if you have thick hair.  It is very painful to use on thicker hair because instead of cutting it will pull the hair out.  It is also difficult to use this at the correct angle but when you do finally get it at the right angle it works fine on shorter hair.  I would not recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To improve this product they need to make a more powerful trimmer preferably with removable heads so that it will be easier to clean and maintain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another improvement would be to place the head at a better angle so it isnt so hard to maneuver.</li>
            <li> The idea is fantastic.  Currently there is nothing else on the market that does the same job.  The quality of this item could be much better.  The first unit I got didn&#x27;t work but was quickly replaced at no charge.  I would recommend but check the item very well when it is received.    Nick</li>
            <li> The Mangroomer works very well.  It can reach all areas of a back.  It does take several attempts and a bit of getting accustomed to using it, but all-in-all it works very well.</li>
            <li> This product for me works great.  Now I don&#x27;t have to rely upon a female to get rid of back hair!</li>
            <li> Dudes! Go for it. Once you get the hang of it, it does a great job, even close to the skin. Secret is keeping the blade flush against your back. Once yoou do the big job, weekly maintenance is a breeze. Go to Bed, Bath and Beyond and use their $10 off coupon on purchases of $30 or more. I got it out the door for $32! I&#x27;ll never leave home without. May even take it on a date, I love it so much! Hears to bare back!</li>
            <li> Device is very cheaply made - powered off a single AA battery, I was worried before I ever applied the blade to my back. Immediately ripped out a handful of hair; upon close examination of the shave head it was clear that the cheap plastic housing had been assembled improperly. Returned immediately; will look for something well-made or will just go back to my au natural state.</li>
            <li> My back hair was shaved off in 5 minutes. So easy and quick    Bravo</li>
            <li> Just buy it.  This thing works quickly and easily and got rid of my cave-man look in about 3 minutes.  It took longer to drag out the vacuum and clean up the bathroom floor than it took to actually do the deed!    UPDATE 6/27/09    After being in use for a while, it&#x27;s not all that.  I think I was more impressed at first by the ability to actually *reach* my back hair than this thing&#x27;s cutting power.  It will power through obscenely bushy back hair and leave you looking like a semi-gorilla, but you will still look like a relatively well groomed gorilla.  Whether this is worthwhile for you depends on whether you&#x27;re moderately furry (like me) or have that serious caveman look.  Either way, this thing isn&#x27;t going to give you that calendar-boy smooth torso.</li>
            <li> Worked fine initially, but parts of shaving head broke after 4 months  of light use, apparently due to inferior material/construction, rendering  product unuseable. No replacement, refund or other help from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this product since it is hard to get people to shave your back. I didn&#x27;t think much of this when I tried it though. It works only OK and leaves you instead of an all over hairy back, a patchy one instead.  Save your money and just find someone else to do it.</li>
            <li> The shaver won&#x27;t will not cut my arm or back hair. At first I thought it was the angle of the shaver to my back but it doesn&#x27;t matter how I tilt the shaver it will not cut the hair on my body. I threw away the packaging or I would have sent it back for a refund. It hasn&#x27;t worked for me at all and I&#x27;m very unhappy with this purchase</li>
            <li> I ordered the Mangroomer in november 2011, and at first I was excited about the product. It worked well, but it was always a struggle to clip the hair.&lt;br /&gt;After 30 minutes I finally got it, and was very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the Mangroomer broke down this morning. I would not go back on! So after 6 months, and I dont use it every day, the groomer broke down.&lt;br /&gt;So very bad product, so I&#x27;m looking for a new one.</li>
            <li> There are some good points and some weak points. Positive: 1.  Quite inexpensive, and seems to be pretty durable.  (BUT, see below).  2.  Removes hair easily and quickly, as long as cutting edge is flat against skin.  Negative:  1.  This is built out of cheap plastic.  If you drop it, it will certainly break.  But if you&#x27;re careful, then should be no problem.  2.  The device &amp;#34;locks&amp;#34; into place at a few angles.  This is very important, as having this device at a 90 angle (for example) makes it possible to reach certain areas in your back.  But, unlike other back shavers, this one really does not lock.  It takes almost no pressure at all to &#x27;unlock&#x27; the device, so it&#x27;s really an annoyance, and makes the shaving experience much longer (to constantly re-position the shaver at the correct angle).  3.  It&#x27;s a lot noisier than other shavers.  Really, not a big deal for me, and probably for most people (does anyone shave their back in front of other people, or while a spouse is sleeping in the same room?).</li>
            <li> Tired of having more hair on your back than on your head?? Well, this he-Mangroomer does the job of letting you get that monkey off your back (so to speak). Works very well...may be a little irritating at first but a man gotta do what a man gotta do. Buy it!!</li>
            <li> OK just used this item, tried the hair remover cream, tried the razor stapped to hanger (myself) tried to ask the girlfriend (ya right!). I read a few reviews on this site and was kinda scared off by how hard it seemed to use but rest assured this is not a PDA it takes two AA batterie (not incuded)s NO assembly and works GREAT!!  I will never be without this again.. It turned a 30 minute fiasco into 5 minutes of pure EASE worth every dime, penny and nickle..</li>
            <li> This MANGROOMER was a gift; the man who received it had no trouble removing unwanted body hair. He highly recommends it.</li>
            <li> I think the shaver should have better blades for thicker hair. I am able to reach over my whole back with this.</li>
            <li> This product is a good idea for an unassisted serious need.  The exception is the battery operation.  Use drains the batteries within 2-3 uses.  It should have an AC option.  The razor isn&#x27;t the sharpest knife in the drawer, either.  Several passes are required to eliminate back hair.</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to. Once you figure out how to hold it properly and get the right angles, it works great. I also use it for my shoulders.</li>
            <li> works well......shave won&#x27;t be totally smooth like you&#x27;d get with an electric razor on your face, but it does an outstanding job while leaving only minimal and unnoticable to the eye stubble</li>
            <li> This thing uses two double-A batteries and is extremely light.  The blade is similar to the trimmer blade on my electric shaver, but wider to cover more area.  The handle folds the unit into a shape I can easily store in the below sink cabinet and the result of the shave, though not completely smooth, is that I no longer have what amount to a mat on my back. And frankly, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d want it to be any closer.  On the occasions my wife has actually shaved the hair down to the skin, I&#x27;ve been pretty uncomfortable with the resulting sharp hairs that surface a few days later. The device also works well for other body parts, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be trying to trim anything too personal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a teen, and I&#x27;ve not loved my back hair for the last two years to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this, having a hard time deciding between the pro and the basic one, but anyways I purchased the basic one.&lt;br /&gt;I had a lot of hair when I got it, I worked on it, did it right before I went in the shower, it took about 15 minutes to really get it all shaven, and my back looked awesome!!! Some minor irritation, but after the shower that went away completely, my back just needed to get used to being shaven I guess.&lt;br /&gt;I loved this product, and I highly recommend it to anyone else with back hair.&lt;br /&gt;I am finally not embarrassed to wear my track uniform.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend that like shaving anywhere, do it on a normal schedule, b/c shaving small hairs is easier, so just keep it in check, and just buy the product!!! You won&#x27;t regret it!! :D</li>
            <li> They used a crappy clipper.  It really doesn&#x27;t cut hair all that well, but it does leave a lot of welts.      I have a Norelco beard trimmer that is far superior.  If only I could somehow put those blades on this handle.</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend as part of his Christmas gift(along with two of their replacement shaver heads for it). He is Italian and does his \\&quot;mangrooming\\&quot; a couple times a week...He used the mangroomer and said it cut his time in half maybe even more! He&#x27;s sooo pleased, so I&#x27;m happy, :), and he&#x27;ll probably be writing his own review too, hehe.&lt;br /&gt;Happy Holidays &amp; Thanks!!! ;)</li>
            <li> Typically I hate writing reviews unless the product really WOWS me and well the Mangroomer certainly does!  I realize writing a review for a backshaver is somewhat..  odd, but none the less this product is great.  I&#x27;m 6&#x27;5\\&quot; and having the ugly hair gene has always been a problem until I got my hands on this device. Makes it soooo much easier making contact with the skin.  Granted plan on spending 15 minutes shaving and make sure you make even strokes or else you&#x27;ll have a hairy spotty back.  I&#x27;ll save so much money by not having to use harsh chemicals like Nair or waxing.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> After reading reviews I went and bought this. Great idea and definitely  makes it easier getting to the back. Did not have much trouble with it not wanting to cut my hair, but I had previously trimmed it down and used this while my hair was already really short so not much trouble for it. My only real problem with this is the price, I don&#x27;t really understand why this costs more then $10 or $15. Feels like its cheap, and doesn&#x27;t even have it&#x27;s own battery like all other shavers in this category. Unfortunately there&#x27;s nothing else out there I know of that&#x27;s as convenient as this so your stuck with this if you don&#x27;t have anyone to help you.</li>
            <li> I like it.  What a brilliant idea!  Now I don&#x27;t have to bug my wife to shave my back!  You should be aware that the blade is similar to the sideburn trimmers that a hairstylist uses, only wider.  Meaning, it will leave some stubble. If you need perfectly hairless skin, like for a photo shoot, or bodybuilding contest, then this is not for you.  But if you can stand having two day&#x27;s stubble on your back, this is fine.  The long handle makes it possible to reach every area of my back.  15 minutes a week and I&#x27;m done.  Some reviewers report that it irritates their skin.  You can&#x27;t scrape your skin with this, but you don&#x27;t need to.  Just go back and forth in different directions.  And make sure your back is clean and sweat-free before you begin.  Drawbacks:  The unit is cheaply constructed, as others have pointed out, and for that I give it 4 out of 5 stars.  I fully expect to have to replace it someday, but as far as I can tell, if you want a do-it-yourself solution, this is the only game in town!</li>
            <li> Richard Keith&#x27;s review under this product is spot on, and I mirror his views.  This product is something I wish I had discovered a long time ago.  It really does allow you to reach the middle of your back easily and works great.  I&#x27;m a pretty hairy guy and this thing had no issues removing the hair.  It only makes sense that I would discover this a few months before my laser treatment starts, but if you&#x27;re looking for a quick way to shave your back without asking the new girlfriend to do it for you- this is the product for you!!</li>
            <li> Defective junk, isn&#x27;t much better than a $4.99 microtouch on a stick. Don&#x27;t waste your time, there are better products on the market. A high percent of the units are defective. If you get a working one just call and complain, now you just got 2! Hard to use, and terrible job shaving.</li>
            <li> I have owned two of these now.  After using the first about 5 times it stopped turning on so I returned to Amazon and it was replaced.  The second unit&#x27;s blades were not precise and literally tore the hair off my body.  Even the 1st unit was uncomfortable and seemed dull making it painful to use.  The best part is the handle obviously but it does not click firmly into position.  It is very easy to loose its position with moderate pressure.      Once it worked the shave was not close by any means leaving stubble that caught my clothing and more importantly disgusted my girl...nothing like a nice five o&#x27;clock shadow on your back!    Still tons of room for improvement in this market.  Com&#x27;on inventors what are you all waiting for. This is probably a 100 million dollar industry waiting to be tapped!</li>
            <li> Blade to cheap, stopped cutting even after cleaning.    Purchased spare blade at same time(different vendor)...doesn&#x27;t fit....    right now wasted money and unusable.</li>
            <li> Wow.  I&#x27;ve always wanted to get rid of the hairs on my back.  I don&#x27;t have many, but each was is around 1.5 inches long.  This got rid of all of them in about 30 seconds.  But I kept using it because it scratched my back so good.  This thing is great, worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Love this product ... it makes my life much simplier and keeps me groomed without needing assistance from others.&lt;br /&gt;It does take a couple of trys to get used to it ... however, it&#x27;s really easy once you have that part down</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe my luck! It was Christmas morning, 2006, and I rapidly tore open a box with my name on it underneath the brightly lit tree. As I opened the package, what did I see but a MANGROOMER! I was instantly overjoyed and got up from the floor to hug and thank my wife. Unfortunately, as I stood up, our pet chihuaha had been chewing on the long luxurious hair on my back (it pokes up above the neck on my PJs), unbeknownst to me. So, I stood up and the little guy fell and whimpered, but he was okay. So, I bundled up the hair on my feet so I wouldn&#x27;t trip and parted the thick mat of hair on my wife&#x27;s face to kiss her on the cheek. You see, my family suffers from a genetic disorder that makes us all very hairy, all over. Even when people marry into the family, they develop the disorder! Odd, I know! Its the same disorder that those South American Wolf-man kids have, what ever its called. But anyway, I started to use this tool on my back, legs, calves, thighs and all sorts of other places. It worked great! While my face still looks like a buffalo&#x27;s arm pit, my back has a lovely stubble, reminiscent of that Don Johnson from Saturday Night Live, or Magnum PI or whatever he was on with that other guy who is in the Bacardi and Cola commercials with him. So anyway, great product!  [...] I laugh and imagine a very hairy Anthony Quinn playing \\&quot;Razorba the Greek!.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I have only used it once since receiving it but it was fairly easy to use (not perfect) but worked very well on my back.  It does feel a bit \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; with the light-weight plastic, however, despite some mixed reviews, I would have to recommend it, especially to any guy who has only \\&quot;problem\\&quot; areas on his back.  I am not sure it would be ideal for anyone with a \\&quot;back sweater\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This review is pretty straight forward just like the name of the product. It works quite well, almost as well as if it was a razor blade but misses by just a little. It gets quite close though and the handle allows you to reach everywhere on your back. No more asking friends to shave you or paying money for waxing, you can accomplish your shaving in a matter of minutes. This is your best option for personal do it yourself grooming.</li>
            <li> The product works as promised.  It does a good job and the handle extension is very useful.  You can easily reach all areas of your back.  The shave you get is surprisingly close.  Although some reviewers find it cheaply made, for the price it is a good value.  Based on what it does and the few options that men with back hair have available, I think it is great.  Even if I have to buy one a year, at the price it is worth it.  Just keep making them!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this a few times and it does work.  The last time I used it I broke out in red splotch marks between my neck and shoulders.  I could feel the scratchiness in that area when I was using it.  If you have dry or sensitive skin it might be a good idea to use a beard trimmer or one of those smaller battery trimmers if you aren&#x27;t very hairy just in that area, then use this trimmer everywhere else.  I been using hydrocortisone cream 1% and that seems to be taking some of the burn and redness down.</li>
            <li> Lasted less than 6 months after the plastic in the battery compartment broke. Nice design that would be better with higher quality materials</li>
            <li> i have been waiting to purchase the product and this is a godsend for men who need to get that chewbacca look out from your back. I like that now its more maintained and being able to keep it looking good</li>
            <li> Damn! I had an idea for this product several years ago but I was beaten to the punch. The Mangroomer works exactly as advertised. Imagine that! Once you get the hang of behind-the-back manipulation (and anyone who has been attempting to groom their back previously will already be somewhat facile at this task)the device is a breeze. The battery life seems to be adequate as I have used it half a dozen times already with no noticeable decrease of power.</li>
            <li> I received the M/G faster than expected then put it to the test of mowing the thicket on my back which it did a good job. Some may not like the light design but that makes it easier to use when extended. Is a little awkward to use at first just take&#x27;s practice. Price is good so you can&#x27;t go wrong. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> The shaver more or less works but is of very cheap construction. The head to the shaver popped off the first time I used it and the telescoping feature is not very sturdy. Overall it does the job but it won&#x27;t be doing it for very long. If you need a cheap solution this will work, but I was somewhat dissapointed.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a less expensive alternative to a popular brand after reading the reviews and I have the Cat Marks to show for it.  The cutting head is cheap and will leave tracks on your back, and I do not have sensitive skin.  I pitched it and will buy another brand.  Sometimes I have serious doubt on Amazon&#x27;s review system cause this item is garbage.</li>
            <li> This is a really great product.  It works great, it takes a little getting used to.  The first couple of times it left a couple of spots tender but once I used it a few times my skin adapted and I have had no problems since.  After I use it the hair comes back slower and slower each time and its a lot easier to manage.</li>
            <li> I was quite skeptical about paying $40 dollars for a razor that uses batteries and one of the reviews I read prior to buying said it was \\&quot;a toy.\\&quot;  I don&#x27;t know if this guy has hair like a bear but the man groomer works great for me.  You need good, new batteries and then it gets hair   everywhere with ease.  It shaves body parts extremely well and much better than my norelco and as good or better than regular nonelectric razor.  It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> I used to have a Mangroomer purchased from Bed Bath/Beyond that I bought over a year ago. Love love loved it. After been dropped a million times, finally stopped working. So, I purchased this particular mangroomer. Found out the hard way, that this works with Batteries, my old one worked/came with ac adapter..was rechargeable. Also, this particular unit was very poor quality. Felt very cheap/constructed very poorly. Also, brand new/after taking out of package..didn&#x27;t work!. Tried batteries given and another new set of batteries...no power! Won&#x27;t even turn on!. Piece of junk. Then, come to find out from &#x27;trend marketing&#x27; ..that there was no returns!. Stay away from this junk...</li>
            <li> For years, my ex-Freundin had to shave my back. Now I have to do it myself and the MANGROOMER came to my rescue. This unexpansive electrical tool helped me to solve one of my biggest problems in life (life is hard, you know). It&#x27;s very simple to use, only need two AA batteries and it&#x27;s helping you to be more flexible and shave you back at the same time. It worked very well.</li>
            <li> I got it around six months ago and it does shave your back, but I generally still walk away with a noticeable amount of back hair. I find myself going over spots three or four times before it finally starts shaving them and it really does irritate the skin like crazy. I walk away with a back looking like a striped lobster and about a centimeter of back hair. For the most part I&#x27;m alright with it since it makes it look like I&#x27;m trying to do something about my obscene amount of back hair, but it&#x27;s definitely not for someone who wants a completely clean shaved back.</li>
            <li> It works, but I don&#x27;t know how long it will last.  It seems cheaply made, for the price paid.  The reason it is expensive is because it is the only one like it on the market.  I can&#x27;t complain too much because it did what it said it could do.  I&#x27;m just worried it will break sooner than later.</li>
            <li> This is one of the most painful products that I have ever used.  NOt only did it hurt during the process, it was just as painful afterward during my shower.  I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product works great! It&#x60;s light weight and folds compact to fit in a bag for travel or to keep in a drawer. It takes me about seven or eight minutes to do a thorough job. I have used it a few times with no problems at all. If you have hair on your back and have been thinking to shave it off, I highly recommend this product. Runs on 2 AA batteries. You will feel better without the hair itching your back. Well worth the price. It took about 9 days to arrive with standard shipping. I used to use a back scratcher with my electric beard clipper taped to it.  I am so glad i don&#x60;t have to do that anymore..</li>
            <li> The only product out there that lets you do it yourself. Takes me about 3 minutes for my entire back - lifesaver. I bought this for twice the price when it first came out 5 or so years ago and it&#x27;s still going.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to shave (since i&#x27;m covered with hair) so i decided to try this buzzer. I couldn&#x27;t believe how easily it worked with little effort. I did get some irritation but most went away after showering. My only concern is how long it could last since it didn&#x27;t feel like it was assembled too well but i think i&#x27;ll get a few uses out of it before then. I would recommend trying this electric shaver to anyone before investing more money into other options.</li>
            <li> The design of the handle is great and makes it possible to easily reach anywhere on your back (or elsewhere for that matter).  It is possible to get a pretty good shave with it.  What I don&#x27;t understand is why they chose to go with the AA battery power.  This is the reason many (including myself) are complaigning about irritation and the feel of pulled hairs.  The blades are just not moving fast enough.  Pretty much any other electronic shaver/body groomer on the market will either be run off AC or have a pretty beefy rechargeable battery, but of course none of those have the handle necessary.  The profit they must be making off of each one of these must be outstanding, because the money is not going to materials.</li>
            <li> I have tried many ways to simplify the removal of back hair, but haven&#x27;t found what I was looking for, until now. This product CLEARLY is remarkable and does EXACTLY what I was looking for.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!!                                                       Sincerely,                                                      Jim</li>
            <li> I had never had my back waxed or shaved my back and it has been a bit out of hand back there for decades.  I wasn&#x27;t about to put my faith in a $22 product to get the job done at first.  I went for the expensive professional waxing at an upper end spa.  There was some pain involved.  But it was worth it as it pretty much made it through the summer with moderate growth.  But I was not about to spend $80 or more every three months and decided to give the Mangroomer a shot.  It worked pretty well and wasn&#x27;t too hard to use.  I still had some of the exfoliating roll on that I purchased from the spa for use after the waxing.  It helps prevent bumps and used it after my first Mangroomer use and I think that helped too.   I still believe that a professional waxing is the way to go for those who have never done a thing back there.  But this is fine for maitenance.</li>
            <li> Works great just have to be careful about irratation from the edges of clippers, but a close cut otherwise</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer.  Its awesome.  Does a great job!  This trimmer is powerful. It really does a good job at getting all the right spots that I can&#x27;t usually reach.</li>
            <li> This is by far the easiest trimmer I have ever used on my back. The job only took me about 10 minutes as apposed to the hour plus it would take me to use my regular trimmers. This was also very comfortable to use, it leaves small red marks, but those go away within minutes leaving you looking like a real man instead of a hairy beast. I have very fine hair on my back, and this tackled the hair without issue. I&#x27;m very glad that I bought this item.</li>
            <li> Great product, good idea, and design.  The materials are a little cheap though.  I&#x27;m going to be gentle with it.  Doesn&#x27;t completely remove all hair, basically keeps the grass mowed to a reasonable, much less visible height.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for several months now and am completely satisfied.  It works well for removing back hair that I can not reach with a regular trimmer.  Bottom line, it works as advertised and serves the purpose I bought it for.</li>
            <li> My best personal grooming gadget so far!!!</li>
            <li> This product for me made life very easy to reach the hard areas to get on your back! - Its compact, very easy to use and is quite powerful.  This is one of the main products I use in preparation for a modelling shoot!</li>
            <li> It done did trims all dah unwanted hair off my back since dats the only place where it grows.... dat and it shaved my kitty real good</li>
            <li> Just picked up the Mangroomer Back Hair Shaver today. With a spouse that doesn&#x27;t want to deal with a patchy carpet on my back, there have been few solutions until today. It is a bit tricky to get the hang of using it at first, but once you adjust to the opposite look to your movements and ensuring the blade lays flat on the skin, it works perfectly. The angles the handles are set at works well and it is light weight for easy handling. The motor is ample to get the job done even with thick patches in various spots and even with the first cut, it didn&#x27;t cause any skin irritation. Nice to purchase a product that works like it should. I will be anxious to see if it will perform over time in the same manner.</li>
            <li> I had no problems with the unit itself it worked well for alittle bit but didnt seem to have a lot of power.  It pulled my hair as it cut and then stopped working i dont think i would buy this product again.  It didnt come with any oil for the cutting blade and it takes AA batteries it would have been alot better if it had a built in batterie. Did what it should but was very cheap.</li>
            <li> This item is tricky to use at first but I gets easy quick! One of the best items I have bought in awhile. Gives a close shave that last. Great item</li>
            <li> Finally a product for guys who live alone..All you need is a 3 way mirror and you&#x27;re all set.A little awkward to use at first,but you get the hang of it pretty quickly..I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work properly, i was very dissapointed at the product, hair gets stuck between the blades and just cuts a little amount of hair. Not useful for my oppinion.</li>
            <li> I bought this 2 years ago and until recently has worked great. It takes about 15 minutes to get the entire back and shoulders. Some bleeding but nothing too dramatic that a shower can&#x27;t handle. I was very satisfied with the close shave it gave me. I got 8 sessions of 15 minutes each out of the Groomer over a 2 year period , so it comes out to just over $5 per session. I tried 4 different sets of new batteries and still nothing, unit was completely inoperative.     There was no response from customer service so I couldn&#x27;t get a handle on what was going on with the unit. So now I&#x27;m deciding whether I buy another one. $5 a session compared to what waxing costs is still a pretty good deal. I&#x27;ll keep looking out there for another product that may be more durable that has the long handle feature that separates this groomer from the others.</li>
            <li> When the Mangroomer arrived, I immediately noticed the flimsy materials making up the product.  I turned the switch to the \\&quot;on\\&quot; position, and nothing happened.  I tried different batteries to no avail.  Amazon indicated that I should return the product to the manufacturer.  I mailed the product back to the manufacturer and indicated the product was defective and I would like a new Mangroomer.  Several e-mails &amp; phone calls later, I have yet to hear from the company.  The Mangroomer is a waste of money, and I am highly disappointed that Amazon would sell such a shoddy item!</li>
            <li> I bought for a hairy back. It shaved it fairly close. It is battery operated and cheap plastic, but it works fine. It actually feels good like a back scratcher. You have to attack the hair from different angles and positions, but you can shave an entire back in less than 5 minutes. For me, about once per month works fine.</li>
            <li> Husband hates it, it doesn&#x27;t work like it was shown on TV, wish we hadden brought it</li>
            <li> good product @ great price!</li>
            <li> I have owned two of these over the last few years. It does do the job fairly well, especially after the first use....you have to use it regularly before the hair gets to long and thick. With regular use, the Mangroomer definitely does the job. My big complaint is the construction and durability....it will break eventually. I take care of it and don&#x27;t abuse it, however, it will eventually die for no apparent reason. The motor simply wears out. Plan on regular replacement. I wish I knew of a higher quality replacement. Just ordered another one until I find something better.</li>
            <li> This product really works. I just used it again this morning.  It actually shaves close , leaving my back nice and smooth.    It was a very good purchase.      Guy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly flexible and have used my old trimmer a few times to do my shaving with much success. This trimmer is very easy to use and the black handle is adjustable for longer lengths. The size of the head trimmer is appropriate for the task and two AA batteries (not included) are all that are needed to get started. The center of the back, the sides and shoulders were all easy to reach and I shaved everything using one hand (no switching was necessary). Compared to my older and smaller trimmer, I accomplished the task in less time (between 5 and 10 minutes on my first try) and it did a better job and my joints and muscles aren&#x27;t sore from all the contorted positions I needed to get into. I didn&#x27;t give it five stars because of the construction as it is made mostly of plastic and feels a little weak. I hope this will survive a few years. Perhaps future models will have materials that are a little stronger.</li>
            <li> If you have back hair in hard to reach places this product is for you. It uses 2 aa batteries for power. As far as cutting it is like a hot knife thru butter. I really could not belive how good a job that this product delivered. I waited unitil the following day to write this review. Unlike blades which made my back feel itchy there was no itch or irritation. Plus I did not use any shaving gel or any products to make shaving easier. I just opened the the box put in 2 batteries in the groomer, hit the ON switch and started grooming my back. It is just that easy. I can honestly say that I wish I bought this product sooner.</li>
            <li> It just plain doesn&#x27;t work.  It leaves stubble, not a smooth back.  Plus it&#x27;s flimsy so it doesn&#x27;t stay in position, and is awkwardly designed.  It seems like a good product, but it doesn&#x27;t work right.  The company does a good job of getting fake purchasers to spread buzz and positive reviews -- but it&#x27;s just hype and clever marketing.  It *might* work for a few people with a very certain hair type, very flat backs, or something...but I&#x27;ve tried it a few times and am very disappointed with this shaver.  Don&#x27;t buy it.      My recommended alternative is Veet for Sensitive Skin if you want to go smooth, or just an adjustable-length beard or hair clipper to trim.  Or you know...a girlfriend who&#x27;s seen your hairy back but loves you anyway.  Unfortunately they don&#x27;t sell those on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This product worked effectively twice and then started breaking down.  The battery cap started to fall off and the shaver would shut down every 30 seconds or so, even with new batteries.  not worth the money</li>
            <li> reaches all area&#x27;s of back easily.shaves close enough you can&#x27;t see stubble unless you&#x27;re one foot away.Its painless and leaves no rash or in grown hairs.grows back fast though. I&#x27;ll use it twice a week in the summer.Way better than any alternatives I&#x27;ve used.Totally worth the money.Hope it doesn&#x27;t dull fast.</li>
            <li> I rated this when I first got it but time is the best test of quality, right? Well, happy to say, I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year now and I LOVE IT! I use it often and have not had any issues with it. Simply change the batteries when the time is up on them and keep rockin&#x27; n&#x27; rollin&#x27;! My wife really likes when I take care of my body and so it makes me want to keep up on things like this. It feels like a back scratcher and it will leave red marks on your back for a while but it fades pretty quick. Unless you have someone to shave your back you really should consider getting this product. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone in the market for a back shaver!! :) Best of luck to all my hairy-backed friends!</li>
            <li> I should give this product four stars: it works quickly and efficiently at removing back hair. The item is lightweight and easy to maneuver but keep in mind if you are going to shave your back by yourself you really do need a 3 way mirror to see what you are doing. That said the item I received had a broken part inside the handle which rattled loudly. I had to take the thing apart to see what piece had broken off inside. Luckily the broken piece did not effect the performance of the unit. I couldn&#x27;t determine what it was anyway. Although lightweight, the ManGroomer is made of VERY cheap plastic: if you drop this thing on a hard surface I&#x27;m afraid it would crack or break. For $40, I wish it had been made of sturdier material. Also it does not come with a cap to protect the blade assembly. All-in-all I&#x27;m pleased with this product and do recommend it since it is really the only product of its kind I have seen.</li>
            <li> The first unit I received was defective - it wouldn&#x27;t work. So I contacted the folks at Mangroomer for a replacement. The new unit they sent - FREE OF CHARGE - works like a charm (they even sent it out to me by overnight Fedex). And to top it off, the gave me a free t-shirt! Ha!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very impressed with the product. If I have one comment for the company, it would be that they need to get their quality control in check to prevent defective units from going out in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this product. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. Mangroomer &#x3D; A+.</li>
            <li> I think that the mangroomer is a great product. Small and light weight. Works great to keep a clean smooth back or chest. Bout time a man can shave his own back! LOL-</li>
            <li> News flash guys: Women HATE back hair; shave it off!   I got this a month ago- It&#x27;s a great idea that I&#x27;m surprised no one financed a long time ago! Unfortunately it&#x27;s made super cheap for a forty dollar item; it&#x27;s lightweight and feels just plain cheap! I don&#x27;t like the way the hinge feels sloppy... but, my unit works fine and cuts good- actually too good.. it cut me up good! Once you learn how to angle it just so- and take your time w/ 50 mirrors around you- you&#x27;ll do fine. I am glad to have the product on the market- I just hope they make it better.</li>
            <li> Not sure I understand any of the negative reviews. This device works as advertised and provides a close and comfortable trimming.</li>
            <li> My Mangroomer came in last Friday!  I opened it, inserted batteries and was on my way.  I was AMAZED how easy it was to take the hair off the top of my back and then it came to the lower back and sides.  Looking in a double mirror, I found it awkward, so to avoid becoming frustrated, I turned away from the mirror, envisioned in my mind where the shaver should begin cutting, placed the shaver on the area I wanted shaved and slowly pulled the shaver across my back.  IT ONLY TOOK ONE SWIPE OVER EACH AREA THAT NEEDED SHAVING, and the hair on my back is of various textures.  Some straight, some curly, but when I was through, there was a pile of hair on the floor to be vacuumed.  I think the key to best results is closing your eyes, placing the shaver where you want it and then drag it \\&quot;VERY SLOWLY\\&quot; across that area.  Trying to look in the mirror and placing the shaver will be frustrating.  I \\&quot;actually\\&quot; look forward to using mine again.  Well worth the price!  I will buy another one for back-up.....no pun intended.  Best Wishes!</li>
            <li> This product works great &lt;br /&gt;I am 43 had never shaved my back &lt;br /&gt;Within 20 minutes I was done &lt;br /&gt;No irritation of skin at all &lt;br /&gt;Well worth the 40.00</li>
            <li> Finally, a tool that reach all the spots on your back that were so hard to shave. This is an excellent device and one that all man bears should consider if they want to shave their backs.</li>
            <li> It works great, although the first time you do have to go over your back several times to get it smooth. Cant wait to use it again. No Scratches on my back at all, love the feeling.</li>
            <li> I wish that it cost less, but not having to ask my wife to shave my back before I go swimming is worth every penny.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It does a great job and I can do the job quickly. Most importantly, I CAN DO IT MYSELF!</li>
            <li> The head broke the second time I used it and will not go back on, $40 for a one time use.</li>
            <li> very effective and very quick. even on my very thin back hair which I feared. I&#x27;m a woman and of course I dont want a hairy back. Ive been wearing strapless tops and dresses almost everyday this spring. YAAAAAAAAY!!!!!1 Ive love it. thak you.</li>
            <li> This back shaver is very unique and was designed to do a good job shaving  your own back. I have other grooming products, but was unable to reach certain areas of my back. I would have my wife help.The \\&quot;Mangroomer\\&quot; allows me to do it myself with the use of mirrors to make sure I did not miss any spots. The unit performed well and is simple to use. It has long flexible extendable/retractable joints which allows you to reach various parts of your own back. I used it once and I was pleased and so was my wife!</li>
            <li> I like many others wasn&#x27;t sure about buying this and spending 40 bucks for it.  I got it today and all I can say is WOW!  My back feels great, the hair is gone, my shirt feels better on my back and I feel better.  I am thrilled I can go to the pool and not have people staring at my back.  If you&#x27;re on the fence - order it the money is well spent and you&#x27;ll be pleased at how great your back feels.</li>
            <li> This does a good job on the back.  You&#x27;re usually good for about a week and a half to two weeks.  Good product.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend buying this item.  It does reach spots, but it barely trims hair at all and severely scratches skin.  Poor product, very disappointing!</li>
            <li> This product is great. Bought mine from Bed Bath and Beyond and it worked perfectly fine out of the box. The only con is that shaving your back seems easier in the video or pics than it really is even with mirrors. But some practice will improve my skills.</li>
            <li> My husband says this: Mangroomer works great. The only problem I had was trying not to make a mess all over the bathroom while looking in the mirror while shaving.</li>
            <li> Beware. This trimmer is PAINFUL and completely ineffective. Do not waste your time and money. It is not eligible for return and you WILL want to return it.. Cheaply made gimicky waste of money. Suck it up and ask a friend to trim your back.</li>
            <li> I found it a little awkward for the first 20 seconds or so, but when I got the hand of it it was just bloody awesome.  Couldn&#x27;t recommend this higher, actually the fact that I felt the need to spend the effort to recommend this, should indicate that I thought that it is worth the recommendation.  If you have back hair and you want a simple, fast and easy to maintain solution that just does the job without any issue then get this sucka. Cant believe that I have been trying to bend my arms all the way around using regular hand held clippers for so long.  Dudes, its just straight up perfect yo.  22.7 stars.</li>
            <li> All you have to do is figure out how to properly position your hands and arms, and it will reach everything.  Move it back and forth and it will clean you right up.  Some people worry about little scratches if the clipper is not completely flat........really ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stop acting like a girl, for god&#x27;s sake - the product does exactly what it claims to do</li>
            <li> The cost is great.  The shaver is definitely all Do-It-Yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It sucks to be hairy --- none of us asked to be this way.  I can think of anyone who would want to be hairy if they were fortunate enough to the right kind of DNA for it.  But for the ret of us who Absolutely Hate Being Hairy...This is the answer [so we don&#x27;t have to beg anyone else to do it for us].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the creator.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and saves you a lot of money and pain.  It&#x27;s made of plastic, I wish it were made of a more durable material.  It looks as if it would break if dropped.</li>
            <li> Unlike the trimmer from the same company, this trims/shaves to the skin so in essence it does a great job at that.  However the main drawback is that it&#x27;s very very loud.  I do mean loud, so don&#x27;t try this at night while others are sleeping. And i&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just the one i got, the shaver is very cheaply made, it&#x27;s very loose and does not hold it&#x27;s different angles.  Otherwise a decent working product.</li>
            <li> The Mangroomer broke after just 3 months. It was used about 3 times.    I went to use it one day and when I went to turn it on, it would not work.  I replaced the batteries and it still would not work. Apparently a wire or something electronic in the Mangroomer unit had become loose or burned out.    I barely even used this item.  It was a very big disappointment.    [...]    The item is very cheaply made. It is made of thin, brittle plastic and is very delicate.    When the Mangroomer was working (for the 3 times that I used it), it did do a good job of shaving the hair off of my back.    However, just like other reviews have commented, it did irritate and redden my skin.</li>
            <li> I Had this item over two years now , its very durable .&lt;br /&gt;It works well , and does the job !!</li>
            <li> its rips the hair out , painful</li>
            <li> I have had a hip replacement and therefore cannot bend over to shave me legs.  This implement is useful but could be much better.&lt;br /&gt;I leaves a rough stubble.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have bought this along time ago! It works great! Took off all my back hair and even scratched my itches. Don&#x27;t wait, get it now!!</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Took less than 5 minutes to groom my back. Like the handle extension. Directions say that you can plug it in or recharge it, but it only take 2 AA batteries with no recharge capability.</li>
            <li> well I used to use one of these (chargeable one) it was great I loved but somehow I lost it, so I ordered this one I thought its what I used to use it turns out it need&#x27;s Batteries (not included) and you need to change them every 5 mins then the handle was lose so its hard to control( and its nonreturnable  so I threw it away.....</li>
            <li> When I got it I was thinking I was going to be getting the same results I usually get when I try to remove my back hair. I always leave patches of hair. I managed to get every inch of my back and sides clean shaven. I am so happy with this and would suggest it to other guys. but I am surprised it is battery operated, I thought it would be chargeable but I am still impressed and very happy with it!</li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised how well this product worked. My biggest problem was triming hear on m,y back and this product did the job</li>
            <li> Great product for the guy who like to keep him self looking clean cut for the lady&#x27;s of the guys.works way better than I had expected.</li>
            <li> Only shaver that works.</li>
            <li> With design similar to what one would expect from the Sharper Image, I was surpised when I opened the package to find a product of such low quality I had to ponder whether I should have purchased it at a \\&quot;one dollar\\&quot; store.  I cannot recommend this product for $40 though I am at a loss as to what other product to recommend.  If you know of a product which makes grooming one&#x27;s back easy and is better built, please advise.</li>
            <li> A total waste of money. The adjustment can reach most of your back but the cutting instrument hurts and cuts into your skin. Leaves your back red and scratched. Occh! In addition it does not cut/shave the back well. You will have to go over the same areas more than once! Not worth the cash!</li>
            <li> I bought this but I can&#x27;t recommend it.  You have to hold the edge flat to the surface which is almost impossible when talking about your back. Either one side or the other digs into the skin.  It scratches and hurts. It&#x27;s sitting in my house gathering dust.</li>
            <li> it made of the poorest quality materials. Also it does not come with batteries. It did an fair job on my back. A smaller groomer I was using before does a better job but this is easier to reach those hard to get areas. So until someone comes up with a better made groomer this might be it.</li>
            <li> First time I used this, it worked \\&quot;ok\\&quot;. Not a very close shave, but better than nothing. The second time, my back ended up looking like I got beaten with a belt. I literally have red welts in the exact width of this thing&#x27;s shaving blade crisscrossing my back. And no, I didn&#x27;t press too hard, I let it rest against my skin while I slid it across.     So if you like that just tortured feeling, go for it. In my case, I&#x27;m leaning forward while typing this review.</li>
            <li> hey..it has a good reach..a little cheaply made, blades are good, overall- not bad.. but it could be a better product</li>
            <li> Husband used this and didn&#x27;t require any assistance!  Did the job easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these for a few years now.  It sits on a shelf and never gets used.  The first time I used it, it worked as advertised.  Every time afterwards it had less and less cutting power.  Changed batteries, took the head apart and cleaned it.  Every time it would cut on the first stroke or 2 and then just start pulling hairs.  It was faster for me to just use a beard trimmer and stretch and contort myself for 1/2 an hour.</li>
            <li> Does what it says.  Do-it-yourself back shaver.  Do not be concerned with the redness and marks on your back as you shave, it all goes away after a shower.</li>
            <li> This is my second experience with the Mangroomer;     After ordering one a few years ago when they first came out, i tried and tried to get it to work - it was literally among the most painful experiences of my life. After a few tries I gave up and realized it wasn&#x27;t for me. Felt like the product was pulling each and every hair out by the roots, not trimming.    I just recently decided to try again, and this time, it seems the product I got works like a charm. It feels pretty flimsy, and is nowhere near as solid as my normal clippers, but boy, it does the job. This 2nd try device has left me with no pain whatsoever, and closely and completely shaves off all that nasty back and shoulder hair I cant reach.     If you order one and have pain, send it back and try again; when it works, it works great. Very happy now.</li>
            <li> If anyone of you have back hair and want it removed by shaving it this is the best product. I have a lot of hair all over my body and I shave my back and the top part of my arm and his product is absolutely the best product. Very easy to use and it works.</li>
            <li> Not as easy as they make it look, but sufficient enough. I have scratched myself and cut myself a few times in harder to reach areas.</li>
            <li> This product is horrible it literally feels like you are scraping your skin off! the shaver  head is not angled like a normal shaver so it doesn&#x27;t cut the hair properly it feels like its ripping hair and cutting you at the same time! And unfortunately I&#x27;m not exaggerating. I would rather ask a stranger on the street to help me then use this anymore. And I have tried it 3 times with the same painful result everytime do not buy this it is garbage people.</li>
            <li> I put in the batteries and tried to turn it on but it would not start. What a joke.  Just by handling it you would notice how cheap it is.  Please do not waste your time and money buying this useless product.</li>
            <li> Product works great and best customer service of any company I have ever dealt with.  I ordered a replacement head for an outdated model and they shipped me a brand new shaver at no cost.  Will definitely remain a loyal customer and would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> It took me no time at all to figure this out, and a very short time to do my whole back without irritation of any kind.</li>
            <li> Works very well! Good price too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joe Schmoe</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not what I thought a product from Mangroomer would be but it will do the job. A fair value</li>
            <li> I owned the orginal mangroomer and it was great but I lost it in a move. Saw this one on Amazon and bought it. Now I should have written this review sooner but only began using it over summer. The blade does a better job cutting my back than shaving. I would suggest looking else where for a different brand of back shaver. I will say this, it was shipped fast.</li>
            <li> Bought this from Amazon over 3 years ago in 2012. It has been worth every penny of the 24 dollars or so I paid. I&#x27;ll get right to the point. I use this strictly for shaving my own hairy back. I am able to do it myself about once a month even with 2 torn rotator cuffs in my shoulders. This shaver bends around perfectly to get every part of my back. In the time I have owned it I have replaced the batteries maybe 3 or 4 times I don&#x27;t really remember. But this thing is so good I just ordered another one just in case this one ever decides to quit working. Get one and try it, you will like it, I guarantee it.</li>
            <li> Works great. You can lock the handle at various angles and the blades don&#x27;t pinch or hurt like some other trimmers. I&#x27;ve used it about 5 times so far.</li>
            <li> When I received this item I was surprised at how cheaply made it seems. The hinge in the center does not lock so the end of the groomer wobbles when you hold it by the handle. Was also surprised to find that this item operates on AA batteries instead of a chargable internal battery. Maybe I should have read the fine print on that one, so it&#x27;s on me. When I used the groomer it seems to work alright. With the exception of the wobbly handle it is easy to maneuver around my back and seems to cut easily. It&#x27;s not the closest shave, but it gets the job done. I have only had it a couple of weeks and have only used it once. I am curious to see how long it will last given it&#x27;s cheap construction. I hope it surprises me and lasts a long time, but I&#x27;m not holding my breath.</li>
            <li> Worked as described got to cut your back hair some how</li>
            <li> I did the wax. Lasts a long time but expensive and uncomfortable. Did the hair remover. Getting it on was a tough job, messy and uncomfortable. This shaver is easy and painless. It&#x27;s the way to go to keep yourself trimmed up nicely with minimum fuss and inconvenience.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my purchase.  It works exacly as promised.  Makes it much easier and faster to tidy up my back for the beach. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only thing that the listing does not tell you is that it is battery powered.  The product uses 2-AA batteries.  The batteries last a long time though.  I think I&#x27;ve used mine about half a dozen times and they are still going strong.</li>
            <li> This groomer is the BEST...Wish I could buy stock in the company...Once you use it you&#x27;ll understand why. Easy to use, just takes a time or two to get the feel.  I actually look foward to using it... Highly Recomend to anyone who&#x27;s gone the NAIR route only to say never again.</li>
            <li> The mangroomer works pretty well to get those hard to reach areas on your back, I found that the blades cut pretty close and as long as you don&#x27;t press too hard won&#x27;t cause much irritation. The unit is definitely cheaply constructed, which is fairly disappointing considering the price.</li>
            <li> This product is well made and did a great job at getting rid of my back hair. I always thought I&#x27;d just leave the hair on my back but now that I have this it makes it so easy to have a clean back that I am definitely going to make it a part of my routine. It is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different devices in the attempt to manage back hair.  Even if they worked they were always difficult to use in reaching all areas.  I had been keeping my eye out for a solution such as the mangroomer.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It works and it&#x27;s easy to use.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> All I can say is I bought one and it works great.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it, and the fact that I can do my back myslef, is just awesome.  My friend Dana, is also extrememly grateful, as it used to be her job to do this...&#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I received a defective product...    The Mangroomer doesn&#x27;t do the job it claims to do.  I&#x27;m very disappointed with the product.  It seems people are only happy with it for light touch ups.  Don&#x27;t buy if you are a first time back shaver or seasonal back shaver like myself.      *EDIT* As it turns out, I did receive a defective product.  The new Mangroomer works very well and I am completely satisfied.  Returning the original defective one was a breeze.  Both Mangroomer and Amazon were very helpful and provided great customer service.      I&#x27;d like to change my star rating to a 4 but I don&#x27;t know how.</li>
            <li> I purchased the MANGROOMER through Amazon.  To my pleasant surprise it arrived 3 days after I ordered it.  That&#x27;s as good as it got.  Took the device out of its package, read the instructions, inserted two fresh \\&quot;AA\\&quot; batteries and...it didn&#x27;t work.  Since it was only $40 plus tax, and I saw mostly positive comments on this site, I&#x27;m asking for a replacement to see if second time is a charm...stay tuned.  6/21/07 **UPDATE** 4 STARS - Contacted Amazon on 6/18/07, and they said they would ship new one immediately - received it two days later.  Put fresh batteries in and...it fired right up!!  Used it tonight and it worked great.  It&#x27;s better than duct taping an electric razor to a stick which I tried previously (I know, I know, but it did work, sort of...).  I try and trim my back hair every 1-1.5 weeks, so it wasn&#x27;t too much to cut through - 10 to 15 minutes.  If you&#x27;re starting out and you&#x27;ve got a carpet, use short strokes and it should get the job done, yet it may take awhile.  Or you may want to \\&quot;cut it down\\&quot; the first time, then go back a second time and finish the job.</li>
            <li> Been looking for a good back shaver for years and I have finally found one.  The head is wide enough to get a significant area in one swip.  It is also long enough to reach all spots of your back.  I got a close shave without any nicks.  Not much more to say other then it does the job.</li>
            <li> Very good ..handy and serves the purpose well (ie to get rid of the unwanted hair in the wrong places)</li>
            <li> Just trims it down still need to shave or wax.  Was easier just to shave my back</li>
            <li> Does the job well. Gets some getting used to.  Found it works better to go by feel than look in the mirror.</li>
            <li> I would rate this product 5 stars but the warranty is only 30 days.&lt;br /&gt;Not much confidence shown by the manufacturer in their product.&lt;br /&gt;Just received it and in less than 10 minutes I had a clean back and&lt;br /&gt;the floor cleaned up too! It doesn&#x27;t shave your back, but trims it&lt;br /&gt;very closely. I have light colored fine/soft hair. It did a good&lt;br /&gt;enough job that, at a glance my back looks hairless. I&#x27;m sure&lt;br /&gt;that anyone touching my back would feel some soft stubble.&lt;br /&gt;But this product is all about appearance and feeling good about the way&lt;br /&gt;you look. So, I give it a thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Rather cheaply made but effective enough. I was able to get it to work but it feels as though it will only last a short amount of time before it breaks.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for my son as I was always shaving his back for him.  Now he can do it himself and he is amazed how great it works!  He can now just pull it out and shave whenever! It&#x27;s not a close shave but he says he satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> The Mangrommer worked flawlessy and easily reach any area...  best of all it cut very close and cause no irritation at all.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> All I can say is this product does work well. I have used other Mens grooming shavers from the large global manufacturers who I would think would  have well funded R&amp;D departmant and could come up with the perfect back shaver, but all come up very short from my experience. The Man Groomer is the best back shave I have tried and will order a new one if and when this one dies. Yes I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This thing is the BEST THING EVER,easy to use,normal battery (AA),and simple.  Some people wrote that they cut or scratched there back.   I used it 3 times already without any kind of marks on my back.   GREAT THING every man with some back hair should have it,my girlfriend like it   so she dont have to shave my back,lol.</li>
            <li> The Mangroomer worked exactly as it was described. Fast and easy with not much of a learning curve. Requires batteries, so make sure you have 2 AAs sitting around, otherwise I believe the pro version has a rechargeable battery which is a nice feature.</li>
            <li> This device get the job done. You can get the back of your neck, back, legs, etc without having to stretch all over the place, plus it makes it easier to use the mirror to see what you are doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;Lets you reach anywhere without have to go into contortions&lt;br /&gt;Shaves reasonably close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t have rechargable battery&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t have AC adapter to plug into the wall&lt;br /&gt;Feels pretty cheap, but it didn&#x27;t break when I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendation: Buy</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I should of looked for a product like this a long time ago. It works great and you can reach your whole back without being a gymnast.</li>
            <li> I originally had an issue with this product, however when I talked to the customer service about it they were more than helpful. One of the best customer service I have dealt with.</li>
            <li> I had a problem with the hinge mechanism and another piece of the machinery but the customer service quickly replaced the product.  Correspondence with the company was quick, courteous, and generous. I&#x27;ve used this product for a couple of years now and find it so very useful.</li>
            <li> Able to get my whole back (thanks Italian hair genes) - works great but is a bit rough on the skin and can leave some red marks for an hour or so</li>
            <li> did not work well, broke on very 1st use. It broke into 5 pieces. No warranty!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;JUNK Not Worth the price. Waist of MOney. Dont Waist your time.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to work with rechargeable batteries. I only have rechargeable batteries at my house, and when I tried to pull some out of a device I wasn&#x27;t using to power this, it didn&#x27;t work. Tried it again with a second set, a third, and fourth. None worked. I remembered I had a device that shipped \\&quot;batteries-included\\&quot; so I pulled two out of that and popped &#x27;em in, and it started.  I don&#x27;t know why this is the case, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to like rechargeables. Else, it&#x27;s great. What I do is lay a towel out over the sink (makes cleanup a ton easier) and sorta lean/sit on it while I look over my shoulder at the mirror to see where I&#x27;m shaving. Cricks the neck a little, but that&#x27;s what a nice hot shower afterwards is for :D</li>
            <li> For years I have used different devices to shave the hair off my back and chest.  Mostly this has caused some in grown hairs, and reaching my back has been difficult.  The man groomer makes reaching my back so much easier, with zero in grown hairs.  I&#x27;m really happy with this purchase worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Well, I paid about $40 for this shaver and it looks, feels, and performs like it should cost about $7.50.  I guess it got the job done, but I am not sure how much longer it will continue to work.    I probably could have made one out of a standard shaver, a stick, and a rubber band and it would be more durable.</li>
            <li> Product works good, however the top keeps poping off. I had to use tape to keep it from falling apart during use. could be made a little better for the money.</li>
            <li> I read all the negative reviews.  yes when you get it, it does feel really cheap plastic, very lightweight.  Yes it can &#x27;scrape&#x27; like sandpaper if you go too hard.  I have moderate back hair, it works good, you have to go lightly, like someone lightly scratching your back, you also have to go slow, so go slow and just repeat over the area, if you rush you will not get a good cut.  It works and the length of the device makes it easier (the philips device looks small) to get to the areas of your back.  all I needed was a mirror with another  hand mirror, do your back then turn to the side and do each side.  yes it feels cheap but it works and has good length to get to all areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the Razorba, you attach a razor to it and then the angled handle is similar to mangroomer.  The razor grip did not like my triple blade shick razor and it was too small to hold anything other than cheap razor, so i cut up my back, yuck... and i threw it away.  mangroomer will take some getting used to, if you go slow and develop strategy to  get to all the places on your back you will be fine.  and it does at least fold up for travel and stores well.</li>
            <li> I have very scarce back hair, but there is some, and it has always bothered me.  I told my wife that I wanted to remove it.  The mangroomer does the trick.  It&#x27;s easy and I had the whole back done in five minutes.    I know that some people will complain about it irritating or hurting, but I think that&#x27;s just because the thicker the back hair the worse it is the first time.  Also, just let it glide over the skin...that means DON&#x27;T PRESS DOWN    Me?  No redness and no pain.  Love the product.</li>
            <li> The product is all its advertised to be.  It allows access to difficult to reach back areas and provides a smooth finish.  I have been extremely happy with the product thus far and would highly recommend it to anyone with unwanted body hair that prefers to take care of it at home as opposed to having it professionally removed.</li>
            <li> Save your money. This product is cheaply made, including the razor which felt like it was cutting the skin. The marketing on this product is far better than its effectiveness...</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000HQ0L2E MANGROOMER Do-It-Yourself Electric Back Hair Shaver]]  Can I give it zero stars? Cheaply made overall, and on mine the battery door wouldn&#x27;t latch back in place, once removed.    Hurts like blazes. I have a pretty good tolerance for pain and not particularly sensitive skin, but this thing is too painful to try to use.    Ineffective. My body hair is thick and coarse, and the Mangroomer doesn&#x27;t remove it at all; it feels like maybe it&#x27;s trying to yank it out by the roots.    Utterly worthless and a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I just bought this at Target today. I had to wait 25 minutes to get it because THEY didnt even have it on the shelves (nor a spot for it anywhere in the store). Target had to get it from the back. I should have taken the hint. This product sucks. My 10 dollar shaver does a better job at cutting my hair.     All the good reviews here must be made by the Mangroomer folks themselves...</li>
            <li> What makes me sick is that I&#x27;ve been using a hand held trimmer for years that I attached to a handle with tape. Congratulations to the guy that ran with it and will make a small fortune off of it.</li>
            <li> I have to agree with a lot of the others.... the Mangroomer does a good job of reaching all those hard-to-reach areas, but once it gets there, WATCH OUT.  It will cut, scrape, pinch and irritate your skin.  I&#x27;ve gotten serious skin infections after using the Mangroomer because it cuts the skin so readily.    I don&#x27;t know why they couldn&#x27;t have used a more sophisticated and better-designed razor, the one that&#x27;s there is extremely cheap and does a better job cutting skin than it does cutting hair.    I wish Norelco would make a device like this, using the razor mechanism in their BodyGroom, that would be a great product.</li>
            <li> I like to check amazons reviews when I buy anything. was very pleased to see alot of 5 star reviews, so I bought one. well! I was prepared for the quality to feel cheap, but so is the performance. I am not super hairy but it took alot, and I mean alot of shaving to get the job done, and I was red and sore for days. I waited two weeks before getting brave enough to give it a go agin with the same results, and it seemed to pull hair more. the next week I used it and the performance was even worst, then the fourth time it broke and dosent work anymore. I would try another to see if I just got a bum unit but not at [...]bucks.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I feel it only fair to eddit this with the following.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mike,&lt;br /&gt;We sincerely apologize for the problems you are having with your shaver.

Your satisfaction with our product is our top priority.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you and kindest regards,&lt;br /&gt;The MANGROOMER Team&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;So mangroomer replaced my first shaver, the second one has worked good for many years but I did have one problem. I would forget to get batteries, they would last awhile but it works better with fresher batteries. So I decided to get the new rechargeable shaver. So far this is the one, Great improvements, check it out even if you don&#x27;t think you would use it that often I would recommend[[ASIN:B00FULYKG4 MANGROOMER Ultimate Pro Back Shaver with 2 Shock Absorber Flex Heads, Power Hinge, Extreme Reach Handle and Power Burst]]</li>
            <li> Works well would recommend it</li>
            <li> I was very excited to order the mangroomer, it seemed like the perfect solution to a long time problem.  I have hair on my back.  The upper back is quite easy to get to, and I use a regular trimmer there.  However, the middle back is very difficult to reach.  The mangroomer looks like a great idea, and it is contructed well enough, though it seems a bit light, however, I found it to be well made.  The clipper however, would not clip my hair.  I tried it from all angles, slowly, flat and alligned to my back, against the grain, with the grain, sideways, but the trimmer was not very powerful.  I used my regular trimmer over the same areas that I could reach and it took the hair right off.      Based on my experience, I would not recommend this product.  Though I commend the innovative design, the clipper itself is too weak to cut hair.  Also, it was a bit painful to my skin, perhaps that is because it was just grabbing at the hairs and not clipping them.    I will return it to Amazon and post an update as to their service.  I expect a full refund, given that I tried the product and it does not work as Amazon advertised.    I commend the designers for their innovative idea, and only hope that they better design the clipper in the future.  I really would like this to work realiably.    Thank you.    EDIT:    I returned my mangroomer and got a full refund from Amazon (minus shipping of course).  I would recommend you try the product even if it didn&#x27;t work for me, given that the most you will lose is shipping.  I hope the designers come out with a new design because I will definitely try it then.</li>
            <li> This is a great tool! Although the casing is plastic, it feels very durable and works well. It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> First time I ever thought of shaving my back.  This unit works perfect. Very easy to use. Initial shaving should be done by someone using a razor. After that once every 10 days or so the mangroomer does the job. Unit feels cheap, but the bottom line is it does the job. Can&#x27;t wait for the summer!</li>
            <li> I was leery because you&#x27;d expect a soluntion to this problem to be more expensive.  The cutter is nice and wide,and it shaves surprisingly close and gets most hair on the first pass.  Not as close as a blade, sure, but close enough.  It&#x27;s a little hard at first to master the coordination looking in a mirror, and one of those double mirrors like in a dressing room would help, but it got the job done.  Good product, I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
            <li> After having tried darn near everything to shave my back, the Mangroomer has got it! it is definently the easiest way to shave your back by your self! I have tried Nair, tried the Razorba etc. this thing works great! It is true, unless you&#x27;ve done these other ways before getting a hang of working it will take a little getting used to! It&#x27;s nice that it dosen&#x27;t cut into you like a blade and it does get it down close to the skin. It is not super smooth like using a blade, but for me, this is close enough!  If you want to be shaved and don&#x27;t have help,then buy the Mangroomer!</li>
            <li> What a great buy! Light and easy to handle. I&#x27;ve had this about 4 days now. It&#x27;s so quick and easy to use compared to anything else I&#x27;ve been able to think of or that I&#x27;ve tried. On a scale of 1 to 10, (\\&quot;1\\&quot; being no hair and \\&quot;10\\&quot; being a hair shirt) I&#x27;m about a 5. The angle of the unit is a big advantage. And it&#x27;s adjustable. I can use it from the side, over the top, and from the bottom of my back. Also, the width of the trimming surface seems just right. It&#x27;s wide enough to cover a good sized area at a stroke, but not so wide that it can&#x27;t be effectively negotiated in any areas where my back is not fairly flat. Besides the ease of getting it on the suface of my back, what also amazed me was how surprisingly close it \\&quot;shaved\\&quot;. It&#x27;s a trimmer, not a shaver with a blade. So I was amazed at the close, smooth results. Where has this thing been all my life? (Or at least the last dozen years or so.) The only disadvantage that this groomer has in comparison to dipilatories like nair is that it needs to be done more often. But so what?! It&#x27;s surprisingly easy to use and there&#x27;s no smell or burn or mess. Nair is such a bad smelling, messy  hassle to use and apply to my back that I usually just keep my shirt on when I wish I didn&#x27;t have to for much of the summer. But not this year!</li>
            <li> I just received this product not more than 15 minutes ago and have immediately put it to use. It&#x27;s fantastic!! It worked even better than I had anticipated. Took all the hair off my hairy back! (On a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the hairiest, I&#x27;m easily a 7). Well worth the money! (One wax treatment I had done before cost me more). No feeling self-conscious in a tank top this summer! :)</li>
            <li> It was a little awkward at first and it wasn&#x27;t cutting well. Once I got sort of the hang of it, it was fine. It actually cuts closer than I thought it would. It was a little irritating, but not that bad. The MANGROOMER is well worth it if you don&#x27;t have someone to trim your back for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Mangroomer a few times and am relatively staisfied with it. The durability is somewhat questionable, however only due to perception, not to a problem. Closeness of the shave is acceptable. I would recommend it to anyone that wants to have a do-it-yourself soltution to removing back hair.</li>
            <li> I tried it last night and it works better than I thought it would.  In about 10 minutes all the hair on my back was gone.  Using this will be easier than other methods including asking my wife to help out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it maybe 3 times and during those times it functioned.  Yes it scratched and left marks, but I&#x27;m not too surprised that it did.  It removed the hair and the handle was helpful.    But on about my 4th time using it (after a long time just sitting there) it powered on for half a second and then died.  Inserted new batteries and it didn&#x27;t even turn on.  Tested the batteries...they&#x27;re fine.  Removed batteries, reinserted a few times...same thing.  I don&#x27;t see anything wrong with the connections the batteries are making.    So for a product to die after so little use is very sad.  And it wasn&#x27;t even the part I was most worried about (the somewhat flimsy feeling plastic shell).</li>
            <li> This was honestly one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made.  I hesitated to buy it because I saw a few reviews that said it did not cut efficiently, but I gave it a shot, and I&#x27;m extremely pleased with it.  And for what it&#x27;s worth, I am no slouch when it comes to back hair.  I have (had) a perfect bush of dark, coarse, Italian fur on my back.  If this thing cut through my thick tweed, it will work on yours.  I&#x27;m seriously so happy I could vomit.  I can finally walk around outside with my shirt off and look like a normal human being.  If you&#x27;re on the fence, my advice is to go for it.    Side note- I was a little unclear for a while as to the difference between this model and the \\&quot;pro\\&quot; model.  I wondered if since this model is half the price of the other model, that maybe it did not work as well.  That is not the case.  There is nothing deficient or lacking with this one.  The only differences I could see were that this model is battery operated whereas the other is rechargeable and has a cord, and I think something about the handle is different.  So if price is a factor and you&#x27;re just looking for something that will cut, this one is the one you want.</li>
            <li> Bought this in Summer 2007 for all those swimsuit outings and have been using it ever since!  It works great for me as my back hair grows in really sporadic areas and isn&#x27;t the thickest.  Also, as its not a straight edge, I get zero in-grown hairs which is key to me because you always see those guys with razor marks and in-grown hairs on their back.  Couple of recommendations:  1)  I had to tape down the blade head after 2 years of use after it kept popping off but still is effective. This saved me from buying a replacement head.  2)  Use this 1-2 days before going out in public.  Sometimes it causes some red marks on my back that look like scratches (not even 1/4 as bad as razors), but they will go away quickly after you use it for a while.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and was satisfied...kind of.  My first time the device lasted a few months and then it just died.  I replaced it with this second device and it only lasted a couple weeks.  I love the idea of the device and when it works it works great, but it just doesnt last very long.  Wish I could have gotten more for what I paid for.</li>
            <li> I have used this groomer a couple of times and have no complaints. It will do your chest hair too if that&#x27;s your bag, just follow it with a razor. For the back it&#x27;s easy to use although a little awkward reaching around yourself at first, but no big deal. I never had any razor burn or itching problems and luckily the hair isn&#x27;t growing back very fast so an occassional shave is all that is needed after the first time. I&#x27;d recommend this to any guy who has issues with back hair. Just buy this and shave it off, you&#x27;ll be happy with it!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t totally sure what to expect given that the negative reviews made this sound like it was cheap and it didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to say that I was pleasantly surprised. The shaver does &#x27;feel&#x27; cheap in that it&#x27;s very light weight, but it works very well - much better than anything I&#x27;ve tried in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak to long-term reliability as I&#x27;ve only had the shaver for a few days, but so far I&#x27;m pleased and I would recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li> Well designed, well constructed, and works great. It clipped my hair quickly and close to the skin. Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great product !! It saves money going for laser treatment. I used this products every summer for upper/lower back, it was unattractive. Very clean and smoothing.  I recommend to friend.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and used it three times.  The first time it worked great, second time (with fresh batteries) the power mechanism started to poop out but finished the job.  The third time (with fresh batteries) it simply quit halfway through using it.  I then purchased another one and the same sequence of events happened.  If they were smart, they would make one that actually plugs into the wall with better construction for the clippers and power mechanism.  I would pay double for that if it meant it wouldn&#x27;t die out after only three uses.  Each use basically cost me $14.00.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have this embarrassing problem of some back hair and all my life resented that. I never had the guts or the extra money to go do a laser surgery and would always feel uncomfortable in public on beaches, swimming pools etc.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for past 2 years now and this is everything I ever wanted. I use it about once or twice a month and NO, my hair did not get  hard as many people suspect in such products. Battery life is great, very very safe and efficient, blades needed no maintenance, only cleaning after use, very ergonomic (being an Industrial Engineer, I have some idea of Ergonomics), user friendly and prefectly priced as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its takes some time and trials to get used to do it by yourself because of the at-first awkward movement involved so its best if you can have someone else do it for you. I do wish it were more tighter at the hinge because especially if you are doing it yourself, then you need it to be firm when you work it at your back and not give in to the bending force.&lt;br /&gt;But its a minor design issue, so no problems there.</li>
            <li> this is a great product! i ordered it along time ago and i realize there is a better version out now but this did exactly what i needed it to do and still works til this day</li>
            <li> SERIOUSLY. I have NEVER written a review before because I just dont have the time and patience for it. But this time I wanted to come here so badly to write this review!! This back hair shaver is simply the best I have ever used and trust me, I HAVE TRIED THEM ALL OVER THE LAST 15 YEARS!! All the techniques you can possibly think of, I&#x27;ve done...This shaver puts an END to my search. Very efficient, easy to use, and most importantly: VERY AFFORDABLE!! It took me a third of the time that it was taking me on my last shaver that I thought it was pretty good. I&#x27;m stoked and DEFINITELY recommend it!! My back is so smooth and completely free of those UGLY hairs!! Thank you so much for making such a GREAT product!!</li>
            <li> I just got the Mangroomer and used it for the first time.  I was very impressed with its performance and did not suffer any of the nicks, scrapes, and cuts that others have complained about.  My back was red in spots, but that cleared up in a few minutes.  I used only one mirror and had a tough time getting at all of the spots, but eventually did.  The biggest drawback was that I really needed the arm to be longer.  I&#x27;m over 6 feet tall and had trouble reaching down on the middle of my back.  Still, I highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li> This is a good way to shave the back hair by yourself. It takes some getting to know how to find the direction the hairs in each section of the back lie. But over all it is easy to use and the adjustable length handle is handy. The only problem I find is the whole thing is really out of balance and difficult to compensate when looking in the mirror and keeping the cutter square on the back.</li>
            <li> Works very very  good.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Worth it.</li>
            <li> I wold like to tell you this works great,but I can&#x27;t My first Mangroomer worked ok at best at first. I didn&#x27;t use it much because it was such a misery. I swear these things never work the same way twice. It&#x27;s completely  aggravating running it over the same spot over and over and over. Only to have to keep doing it over and over. After you spend 100 years on just 2 inches of your back. Your ready to kill yourself. So after reading all of these GREAT reviews I figured I would buy another one. Out of the box I installed new batteries, after 25 minutes of a complete struggle with this waste of money. I had managed to run this razor over my back so many times my skin was red and nearly no back hair had been cut. I watched the razor comb the hair on my arm back and forth and not cut a SINGLE hair and the only thing this does for sure is irritate your skin. I could feel my life slipping away after 30 minutes,I then broke the MANGROOMER into pieces just to fit it in the small trash can in the bathroom. I really tried to make this work. I bought 2 and never complained until now. What garbage.</li>
            <li> This has got to be the worst product I have ever bought. What little hair that did come off of me with this thing was just pulled out. It doesn&#x27;t shave worth a darn. I&#x27;m looking into finding a way to return this product and I can&#x27;t recommend this product to my wort enemy!!</li>
            <li> This really works and I&#x27;m tall (6&#x27;6), it shaves my whole back with no strain.  The size of the shaver head will def surprise, it shaved entire back in less than 3 minutes.  I&#x27;ve read on here that it&#x27;s poorly designed, plastic and failed after a year...c&#x27;mon it&#x27;s like 30 bucks, do you expect stainless steel and a lifetime of use?  No, shave for several months than buy a new one.  It&#x27;s way better than the 15 plus years of frustration leading up to when I found the mangroomer...great product, good deal.</li>
            <li> I heard the ad on the radio and immediately went to the site thinking it was some lame gimmick. I read the other reviews that were positive I figure that it was worth a shot so I bought one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is what it is nothing fancy or space age just a battery powered clipper with a long bending handle and just like most simple things it works. I read about having to have the proper angle as a complaint and I technically would not argue that point but it was not like you had to pass over the same spot numerous of times because the angle had to be perfect. It still is the fastest thing I have ever used and got every spot with ease which might have been a first time for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it gentle on the skin no, it is a razor after all, but when done I put on my shirt and did not feel a thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend this item. It is one of those pleasant surprises that you buy thinking you just wasted some money and it turns out it becomes something you do not want to live without.</li>
            <li> Only used it once so far and it worked well.  This trimmer makes it easy to get to those hard to reach places.  It cuts pretty close for an electric trimmer, though it can rub your skin a bit if you trim at the wrong angle.  It is an awfully light trimmer so I worry about it&#x27;s long term durability.  However, when you figure you spend $15 on a bottle of Nair you can use twice, you only need to use this thing a half dozen times to come out ahead.  Plus no more chemical burns or funny smelling skin.  All and all, it seems to be well worth the $40</li>
            <li> This unit works, but primarily for maintenance. If you have a \\&quot;pelt\\&quot; it will not work well as the primary treatment. I had to remove as much hair as I could with an electric trimmer, and then use the Mangroomer. Then it functions to keep the hair down. So get someone to help you with the first trimming, and then use this to keep the back hair in check.</li>
            <li> product is solid.  works very well.  cant really complain about anything.  The only feature I would change is the ability to extend the handle completely straight instead of slightly curved which makes it a little hard to handle.  I dont think there is any other product like it out there.  I would recommend this product.  It does what it is suppose to do.</li>
            <li> Wow! Like some of the other guys, I was skeptical. I just used this for the first time though, and it works great. Pop a couple AA batteries in it and you&#x27;re ready to go. I shaved my whole back in 5 min. I&#x27;m not super hairy, but I had to do my whole back. If you&#x27;re thinking about getting this, do it, it&#x27;s worth it. I&#x27;m doing a triathlon at the end of the month, and now I don&#x27;t have to be embarrassed because of my hairy back. My only little complaint would be that it&#x27;s louder than I expected, but that doesn&#x27;t matter. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Money well spent!</li>
            <li> Everyone else is right -- it feels cheap. BUT, I&#x27;ve never been able to shave this easily, and it actually shaves closer than any of my other razors!    Take good care of it and you&#x27;ll enjoy a hairless back.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this product. It does not work, the idea is great and if it had a real razor attached it would be great. It is junk</li>
            <li> I received this trimmer a couple of days ago and have tried it and it work very well. I have a lot of hair on my back but the hair itself is not that thick. The trimmer cuts the hair short enough and as easy as it is to use I can trim my back more often if needed. I have been trimming my back for years and I have tried everything I am very glad to have something that works so well. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this item 5 stars is that there are no details on how to use it. Nothing that says to add batteries, or what size to use etc. I guessed and it work, but it would have been helpful to have the manufacture include it.</li>
            <li> For years I have been searching for an item that would get rid of unwanted body hair on my body, especially my back. Face it, the hairy gorilla look went away with the 70&#x27;s Disco era. Anyway I&#x27;ve tried everything from electric shavers, trimmers to waxing. The problem with shavers is they are not geared for you to shave your own back. They are made for your face only. Trimmers can get hair but then again they are an awkward shape for your back and you would basically have to be a contortionist to get a good trim and you would miss a lot of areas. Waxing- forget it! to painful. You would get the same results and pain if you just pulled the hair out with your hand. Basically the only way to get smooth skin would be to trim the hair and then have someone shave the area with shaving cream and a razor. However that can be difficult. Most people you would ask to do this job will not volunteer to do it so this device provides an alternative. This unit will not give you the closeness of a razor blade! I can&#x27;t belive some of the bad reviews on here. Are people that naieve? It&#x27;s a trimmer for god sakes. What it will do is trim the hair to a barely noticeable soft stubble, and no more. It took me about 4 minutes to do my whole back, and I have a forest back there believe me, so that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t understand why some people said it did&#x27;nt do a good job. It does take some practice to find out which direction your hair grows. On your back or front torso hair can grow in different directions depending on the area. The best result is when you shave against the \\&quot;grain\\&quot;. Just like shaving your face with a razor if you have a thick beard sometimes you have to shave against the grain or it will not come off. It&#x27;s the same with the Mangroomer. I tried trimming with the direction of hair growth and the hair stayed. Swithced directions and it all came off. The long adjustable handle makes it easy to reach all areas of your back. Uses 2 AA batteries which can become expensive if you trim alot. I use rechargeables. The trimming blade is fairly big so you can cover a lot of ground with one pass. Some other people complained that the blade scratched them. That means you are not holding it right if you get nicked. Keep the trimming blade flat against the skin at all times, not at an angle. All in all this is an innovative device.  I think the price a little high for the plastic construction of it. If you drop this on a hard floor it will probably break so be careful. But for right now very happy with it. Give it a try.</li>
            <li> Finally a product that I can do what I always wnated to do, remove hair from my back. I became a contortionist trying to shave my back. I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair on my back and it&#x27;s very light in color. However, I never liked having the hair. The Mangroomer removes all the hair without a problem.    Thank you for a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> This is almost an excellent product, but it doesn&#x27;t cut it.  I will probably keep it, but doubt I will use it much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The basic design concept is excellent - this design concept would really work if were executed well.  But this execution is near fatally flawed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem is lack of power and poor materials - totally out of whack with the cost of the thing.  For this money, they should be able to deliver a top notch product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as is, 2 AA batteries just doesn&#x27;t deliver enough power to drive the shave head.  Result:  lots of pulled hairs and slow, slow trimming.  And the materials choices are terrible - thing just feels cheap and badly made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, it does reach down your back or anywhere else you&#x27;d ever want extremely well.  TOP POINTS for that - as I say, design concept is good.  But unfortunately that doesn&#x27;t outweigh the negatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And in comparison to the Norelco Bodygroomer that I bought in the same order, Mangroomer isn&#x27;t even on the playing field.  Norelco is much, much better product.  And if you can reach your back, it&#x27;ll do everything this&#x27;ll do and more.</li>
            <li> To be perfectly frank, this product sucks.  It&#x27;s too powerful.  When you turn it on the force alone makes you second guess putting it against your skin.  I&#x27;ve given it a few tries now and each time it leaves red marks all over my back and burns for days.  Additionally, the angle is actually awkward because you can&#x27;t keep it in position, so when you hold it up and over your shoulder the latter half (with the blade) swings down against your skin.  I just can&#x27;t figure out why they didn&#x27;t work a little harder to perfect the product.  It&#x27;s not worth even $1.</li>
            <li> After trying a few other back shaving products I found this product. It exceed my expectations and works excellent. I have very fast growing course hair and have had no problem. It takes some practice to work out the angles to cover your whole back, but in time it&#x27;s a breeze. I&#x27;ve had the unit for almost a year now and it works like new. I felt compelled to write a review for those considering purchasing since it was so hard for me to find something that actually worked.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product.  It is cheaply made and does not work.  Worked ok for about 10 seconds and that was it. Worst product that I have ever bought. PIECE OF JUNK!!</li>
            <li> My back is pretty hairy, normally  not the hairiest at the beach or the gym, but usually a close second or third.  I have a lot of hair on my shoulders as well. Anyway, I was tired of looking myself with all that hair in the bathroom mirror (my wife was probably tired of it, too, but she was too nice to say anything about it),and wanted to give the MANGROOMER a try before something more radical like waxing or laser removal.    My first impression on opening up the packaging is that this thing is very cheaply made.  It is constructed out of flimsy plastic and it looks and feels like it could break quite easily.  The operation of the button and slider mechanism that extends the handle is not smooth at all. I had expected this from the reviews I read here, but it was still a disappointment given the price.    OK, but how does it work on a hairy back like mine?  I put in 2 AA batteries and went to work.  Initially, I did not think it was working.  Plus, it stung quite a bit when it grabbed hairs (note to MANGROOMER - higher quality blades would be nice!).  Nonetheless, I continued to plug away - up, down, sideways, diagonally, and eventually I saw that the hair was, in fact, coming off.      The handle is ingenious.  No problems reaching any part of my back.  I used a hand mirror and a bathroom mirror to guide myself. With a little practice, I found that I could aim it just about anywhere I wanted it to go.  45 minutes and two sets of Energizer batteries later, my back was reasonably clean, albeit with red marks all over (which went away after a day or so).  My skin was also quite tender for a few hours afterwards.  My back was not completely smooth.  There was a bit of stubble, but nothing you could see from more than 3 feet away. I assume that, much like an electric razor, if I keep using the MANGROOMER over time the shaves will get closer as my skin adjusts.       I would use the MANGROOMER in conjunction with another product, like the Phillips Norelco BG2020, or maybe even a regular disposable razor.  The BG2020 is more comfortable and the razor probably shaves a bit closer.  Unfortunately, you just can&#x27;t reach all areas of your back with either of them.  Use the BG2020 or a razor on the areas you can reach, and the MANGROOMER on the areas you can&#x27;t.  Have not tried the Razorba product, but I did not think it would work for me, at least at first, given the length and amount of hair on my back.  Now that I&#x27;ve got a good start, though, I might give it a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairy guy, shave my chest and back.  I&#x27;m somewhere between a 6-7 on a scale of 1-10, I&#x27;ve seen guys more hairy than me.  My friends call me carpet daddy and tell me I should leave my sweater at home when I&#x27;m at the pool.    This thing is battery powered, ok no big deal so I slap in two double A&#x27;s and I&#x27;m thinking ok this has got some power so here we go.  Ouch, not really that bad but not worth it to me.  It&#x27;s a great idea but maybe the blade is not sharp enough, not really sure but the discomfort is not worth it.  I gave up after a few seconds of pain, I guess it grabs your hairs and skin a little.    My Remington trimmer does a far better job, I can shave my back w/my trimmer but takes a lot of skill and patience, I&#x27;d rather have that than the dealing w/the discomfort of this mangroomer thing.</li>
            <li> Pretty good considering design/ergonomic difficulties with product like this. Requires some care &amp; practice to use effectively without scratching or nicking yourself. To get a close cut, and because shaver edge must move against skin while perpendicular to body, the top &amp; bottom blades are set at the same place--unlike, say, a regular barber&#x27;s electric trimmer on which the bottom blade extends a bit beyond the top blade and the shaver moves along the skin surface parallell to it. Hence, blades are more likely to nick the skin unles you hold the shaver edge evenly against the skin surface. That&#x27;s why you have to practice a bit, perhaps making a few runs with the shaver off. In any case, once you get the hang of it, it does a good enough job so that you no longer need to rely on your spouse or partner--or the sadists who do back waxing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a battery-powered hair trimmer that lets you get to those hard-to-reach places on your back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I have (which I could have given 4 stars for) is that while it is somewhat well-made, it WILL NOT take much abuse.  Don&#x27;t go rapping it on hard objects or drop it on a hard floor.  You might break it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s what happened to my first Mangroomer.  I eventually had it fail and had to use a soldering iron to reattach a broken wire, but even then it was quirky in its operation.  So, I got a new one.  For the new one, I&#x27;m going to drill a hole through the handle and run a lanyard through so I can have a wrist strap in case I drop it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver head snaps off easily, and a clean paint brush can sweep away any hair that accumulates in the mechanism.</li>
            <li> I have purchased a number of items for hair removal, this is the best I have used so far when it comes to&lt;br /&gt;reaching difficult spot to get to.</li>
            <li> Used this for the first and maybe last time yesterday.  If you have a little hair on your back, this is fine.  If you have more than a little (like me), it stunk.  Painful and awkward to use.  I had to ask my wife to finish it.  I will opt for a better trimmer and a bottle of Nair next time.  Did I mention it was Painful.  I like the idea of it, but not the product.  I would spend your money on a better trimmer.</li>
            <li> Should be sold for $19.95,,,,needs a feature to lock in place and open to a larger degree. But if ur looking for something in-expensive, this is ur product!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s battery operated so don&#x27;t expect a high powered tool here. The only way I can results with this is to use an up and down or back and forth type motion. My hair is not very coarse or thick but this just barely does the trick. If they would make one with a stronger motor and it plugged into the wall it would be a better product</li>
            <li> Had this for about a year. Worked pretty good but stopped shaving? I took completely apart and could y find any problems. Decent product. I just purchased a different kind. Cool I got to review this now that I just threw away last week. Good product for one year. I guess I had it that long.</li>
            <li> I love my husband but never loved his backhair.  I always felt guilty because whenever we were intimate, I was always distracted by &#x27;the hair&#x27; and my mind would wander.  Totally not fair to my guy.  I know it bothered him, but he was also embarrassed when I would make him sit in the bathroom and have his back shaved!  The Mangroomer is truly do-it-yourself and he can be in control of his grooming.  My husband is 6&#x27;2\\&quot; and also not very flexible, so this groomer has a perfect reach for him.  He handles it himself, and now it is smooth sailing!  No more distraction - and now when we are intimate I can focus on the task at hand!  Every man should buy one of these because seriously - where are your woman&#x27;s hands when she is touching you?</li>
            <li> This has got to be one of the greatest inventions ever.  Not only is my back very hairy, but the hair rubbing against my shirt makes it itch constantly throughout the day.  This drives me crazy.  I was skeptical when I ordered this, but it is really awesome.  It gives me a clean, itch-free back without bothering my wife.  I highly recommend it to any man suffering from \\&quot;bear back.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Okay, guys -- let&#x27;s be honest.  Ever since you started sprouting hair on areas like your back and shoulders, you&#x27;ve wondered how you could keep it under control.  You may have even taped a razor on a stick or experimented with some other contraption like that.  The ManGroomer makes managing that funky hair  that&#x27;s hard to reach quite easy.  It&#x27;s long enough and angles so you can get to those spots that you can&#x27;t ordinarily.  It&#x27;s basically an ordinary battery-operated clipper on a long handle.  Invest in this and enjoy the glow of knowing you&#x27;ve tamed that shrubbery that grows on your back!</li>
            <li> This works really well. A little flimsy, but it shaves very close. You can&#x27;t even tell I have back hair when I&#x27;m done, and it reaches every inch of my back.</li>
            <li> I am overall very pleased with this product. It is the only one of its kind that I have found and I have wondered with all the guys in the world shaving there backs these days, why someone hasn&#x27;t come up with this before. I have struggled for years trying to do it myself or wait on someone else to do it. The only complaint I have is that if you don&#x27;t keep the blade flat against your back, the plastic and metal edges will scratch the daylights out of you. It really is great once you master it. It does a better job than anything I have done previously!</li>
            <li> Product is everything represented.  Does the job in a few minutes in the comfort of your home.  Am impressed with the build quality of product.</li>
            <li> This product does everything it advertises. I&#x27;m still a bit awkward with keeping the cutting blades flat against my back, but that&#x27;s just a matter of practice. After being self-conscious about my chia-like back for years, I&#x27;m delighted to have purchased the groomer. I almost gave it five stars, but I&#x27;m kinda conservative with praise when I&#x27;m still getting used to a product.</li>
            <li> It was easy to use and got the job done.  Really helped because I have had both shoulders operated on and range of motion limits but the Mangroomer allows me to get rid of the back hair.</li>
            <li> By far the worst thing ever.  When I use it it feels like a cat is raking its claws against a midsummer&#x27;s sunburn.  Leaves marks on my back like happy hour at the local brothel.  Not only that, but it doesn&#x27;t even shave the hair.  Several passes over the same spot to get it even semi-clear, and it pulls and rips at your hair rather than clip it.  Look closely at the trim head and it looks like tiny lego blocks made to pinch hair off, doesn&#x27;t even look like a razor head.  It also bogs down worse than the internet of a 14 year old kid who just discovered online porn.  I&#x27;m a hairy guy, but not so hairy that a razor made for trimming back hair would have a rough time.  Terrible product, way overpriced, it&#x27;s a trap!</li>
            <li> My first impression was how cheap the item felt but I figured at $25 what could you expect? Well, it only made it through 3/4 of my first use before the shaver became dull and began pulling my hair out instead of cutting it. Think twice before buying this junk, you cannot return it.</li>
            <li> With this product a man doesn&#x27;t need a wife.  Easily shaves the entire back rather quickly and conveniently.  No scratching or other red marks (only initial &amp;#34;inflamation&amp;#34; after use, but goes away after a few minutes.  Cleans the back smoothly.  Love it. Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> My first Mangroomer seemed to have been effective over 2 years, or more. Blades no longer did their job even with the replacement of batteries. New one works great! What a necessary product for all men who cannot stand forest growing on their backs.</li>
            <li> This product is an excellent solution to an embarrassing problem, back hair! I&#x27;m not interested in paying for waxing, or the bumps that show up afterward, so this product is perfect. I&#x27;m not covered in thick hair, bit I have some patches of medium growth. This shaver does an awesome job of trimming the hair down to 1/8&amp;#34; or less and it becomes invisible. No irritation or problems and you get a little bit of a back scratch in the process. I had no trouble reaching every part of my back and could trim my entire body if I wished.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I needed this but it works perfectly and the hair falls away easily. The arm gets longer if you need so there is nothing stopping you from those hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> It was becoming increasingly bothersome to keep my back clear of hair until now.  This is a quick and effortless solution that is as easy as buzzing your whiskers.  I have told my friends and family about it.</li>
            <li> So I went through two of these things... Here are the pros and cons...    (The \\&quot;ouch\\&quot; part is at the end.)    PROs:  I used to have a hair on my back.   This thing gets rid of it no problems.  It&#x27;s a cordless electric shaver on a telescoping plastic stick.   So simple, yet so brilliant.  And a lot cheaper than laser hair removal.    CONs:  It&#x27;s a great product that needs to go through a second generation refinement.   The construction is generally flimsy.   The telescoping plastic arm rattles around more, the more you extend it.   I dropped it once, and the entire plastic housing came apart (had to get it replaced.)    OUCH:  The blades on my second trimmer are, dare I say, TOO sharp.   I am NOT putting extra pressure on the blade.  Yet if I am anything more than gentle when using it, my back gets all scratched up to the point where it looks like I was making out with a grizzly bear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve rarely purchased an item that works for less than 5 seconds - this is one of them.  The first time I used this product, it stopped working immediately.  Even if it had worked, the quality of construction is very flimsy.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> I NEVER GIVE REVIEWS BUT THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST PRODUCTS YOU WILL EVER BUY - NO NEED FOR HELP REACHING THOSE TOUGH SPOTS. THE KEY IS TO ALWAYS USE A NEW PAIR OF BATTERIES EVERYTIME YOU USE IT. ONLY NEGATIVE IS THAT IT WASN&#x27;T AVAILABLE YEARS AGO.</li>
            <li> For $40 this is a great product. It worked very well for me, no pulling or pain. Shaves closely. The only drawback is just the awkward angles involved, but that&#x27;s no fault of the product. Glad I got it, sorry I waited so long to buy.</li>
            <li> The angle and telescoping handle helps control and move the shaver where you need it to get the spots that use to be impossible to get.</li>
            <li> The ManGroomer just simply...Works Fine.... It does what it says it will do. My back is very hairy, the ManGroomer took it all off. Its light and easy to use...Yeah Im sure if you drop it... it will break... Well, so will my LapTop.  Just don&#x27;t drop it. It will get the hair off your back.</li>
            <li> Upon reading some of the reveiws for Mangroomer I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. It turns out that I believe it is well worth the money. With a little practice it was easy to use and worked well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it 3 times now for my moderate back hair. I think it would work well for light to moderate hair. I don&#x27;t think I would trust it for more intimate areas of my bod. Since my hair tends to lay down, a back and forth motion seemed to work best for me. It took about 15-20 minutes to do my back, shoulders, and upper arms. Fresh batteries make it work more efficiently. I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the quality for the price paid. The on/off switch is flimsy and the overall quality reminded me of a cheap flashlight. I would think twice before buying another product from this company. I thought about sending it back but it is handy and the adjustability of the handle is good though it feels fragile. I have gotten much better values from Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> cheap construction? check. but the relatively low price forgives this.    innovative design? check! now all this thing has to do is work a LITTLE BIT and it&#x27;ll get a 5-star from me, but..    complete unability to shave hair? check. what the hell? who tested this thing? even on my sparsest and thinnest body hair, this thing is INCREDIIBLY painful to use and totally unable to cut even a reasonable amount of hair.    if i had some peach fuzz on my arms, this would probably be fine, but i&#x27;m a man. we&#x27;re men. if there&#x27;s hair on our backs, it&#x27;s probably not little girly hair--it might be thick and coarse. or even KIND OF thick and coarse. if this sounds like you, avoid this product. i ignored the warnings of others and wasted $40--i have not been able to use this product beyond the first 5 minutes of wasted time. a painful experiment. &#x3D;/</li>
            <li> What is really remarkable about this product is that while it&#x27;s fully capable of shredding your flesh, it has a hard time cutting human hair. It&#x27;s really quite a feat. I assumed that this thing would be like my small personal groomer, just on an extended handle. It&#x27;s not. It seems there is too much of a gap between the cutting blades to do much. The teeth seem too tall as well, which is why it can grab so much skin, without cutting any hair.</li>
            <li> This thing snapped at my skin like it was mad at me. I&#x27;ve been using clippers my entire life and have NEVER been so scratched up. Everywhere I touched this thing to my skin it left stripes - I have already returned it and will say something positive now. Thank you Amazon for making it easy to return stuff!!!</li>
            <li> Works very well!  The surprise came when I found that the 2 batteries have a very long life.  It is comfortable to use and well designed.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Mangroomer it looked like it would work. the clipper is just junk. It&#x27;s so light when you first pick it up you feel how cheaply made it is. Only worked 2 times then died. I changed batteries nothing just dead.I wanted to give the Mangroomer 1 more chance so, I Ordered the other Mangroomer the improved one it&#x27;s like $10 more ( it&#x27;s all black one) Same thing junk. Save your money and time Don&#x27;t buy this it&#x27;s junk.</li>
            <li> Working good so far. Has a lot of reach. Shaves pretty close. Uses two AA batteries. Opens to 135 degree angle. Would like better if it open a little bit more. Not too expensive. About $25 from Amazon. Now just hope it lasts.</li>
            <li> Removes hair but a lot of care is required to not scratch the skin up</li>
            <li> Hard to use. Doesn&#x27;t shave close.</li>
            <li> Love it ...very easy to use and keeps me well groomed....</li>
            <li> Simply fabulous does everything it promises.</li>
            <li> Shaves pretty close for basically being just long handled clippers.  Make sure you have a couple of good mirrors, though.</li>
            <li> I really like it I use it all the time thank you</li>
            <li> Better than the old days of trying to get rid of unsightly hair!  Works and does what it was intended to do folks.  I would buy again when mine breaks.  I use it for cycling to get rid of hair because hair is bad!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Mangroomer is a great product that I&#x27;ve been using for a couple of years now. I had a slight issue with a product and their customer support team went above in beyond to fix the issue. I recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> Second one I&#x27;ve owned -- misplaced first one in a move.  I may not technically be a yeti, but I have the hair of one.  Mangroomer helps manage my unmanageable manliness.  It&#x27;s better than hacking up furballs.</li>
            <li> Bought our first one about 5 years ago and LOVED it!  Used it so much we wore it out but it lasted a long time!  Just bought our second one and we are just as happy with it.  It gets the job done!</li>
            <li> Is this perfect?  No.  But it does a hecka better job than anything I&#x27;ve used in the past.  I&#x27;m Italian so hair in places I don&#x27;t need it is my current and future life.  Shaving using this device is awkward to start but once you get it, it works well.  You can&#x27;t expect total hair removal (like if you got waxed or someone else shaved you) but it works and my back looks (and feels) smooth.  I am thrilled at the result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have several (more expensive) versions of this available and if this one continues to work, I might invest in a better version.  This is a solid investment for anyone who needs to reach areas that have so far been inaccessible.</li>
            <li> Great, practical, and it is so nice to be groomed!  I like the ease of use and recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Probably works better if you have less hair. I had issues with it pulling some hair. Seems to run well.</li>
            <li> Works great!  I have one spot on my back where I got hit with a baseball when i was young that grows hair now!  I usually have to ask someone to trim it off!  now i dont works great!</li>
            <li> It has an extension to reach lower backs or middle back for us hairy guys or ladies and the blade seem to last long quite a while at least a couple batteries loads full which is a fairly long time I feel much better  and confident with this razor and back hair groomer.</li>
            <li> Purchased in 2010, still works. That itself is saying something. Works as advertised, would purchase again when needed</li>
            <li> This back shaver works very well, can get to all areas on my back with no issues at all.  Definately a keeper.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, takes a few times to get use to it. Recommend not using the mirror!</li>
            <li> Not too bad but batteries drain quickly and isnt the easiest thing to use&lt;br /&gt;Could be configured to be more sturdy.</li>
            <li> I bought this because i have hair on my back that i cant reach, this solves that&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Arm bends in such a way that i can get to those hard to reach spots&lt;br /&gt;Blades are sharp and cut on the first go around&lt;br /&gt;Batteries last so far about 8 weeks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Blade is very sharp i walked away with more than one scratch marks on my shoulders&lt;br /&gt;the arm doesn&#x27;t lock very well have to really press the button on the arm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for about 8 weeks now without issue, I am glad i went with this one and not the rechargeable version. Be sure to clean the blades for longer life span, Would purchase again; Be sure to watch on sensitive areas where skin is thin, it will cut you.</li>
            <li> I had one of these I bought while I was deployed.  It fell and the head broke and I was really disappointed.  Took me forever to find one like it and while this one does not have close shaver on it, it does the job and I think it holds a nicer charge than my previous one.</li>
            <li> Does a pretty good job. It could use a stronger motor. Does pull hair if the battery gets too old.</li>
            <li> this product helps a lot especially when you are in a hurry and don&#x27;t have the patients  the best of its kind</li>
            <li> Horrible product.  My husband tried it and it does not work.  He went over the same place at least 10 times and it did not remove any hair.  He tried to shave in the opposite direction and it just pulled his hairs out, which was very painful.  Big waste of money.  Would have given 0 stars if I could.</li>
            <li> I saw the mangroomer on sale at the Burlington coat factory for 9.99 and I thought, for 10 bucks, I&#x27;ll give it a try. I don&#x27;t look like I have a carpet on my back, maybe a 4 on a scale of 1 to 10(10 being confused for a bear)and my hair isn&#x27;t thick either. Got it home and found it takes 2 AA batteries(no power cord). It feels light in hand but not flimsy. I turned it on and it has a quiet hum/buzz to it. I started on a small section with up and down strokes and looked in the mirror to see a nice clean area. I continued on my entire back and in 5 minutes I was done and looking like I did when I was in the 7th grade lol. You don&#x27;t have to use any force at all. Just run the head up and down, side to side and that&#x27;s it. It doesn&#x27;t come with any assorted guards and the blades don&#x27;t adjust but for getting rid of back hair, the setup it perfect as is. Since this is the first time I&#x27;ve trimmed my back, I have no ideal how long this new look will last but for now, It looks great!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this item it does a great job not only helping you to manscape your back, but also other areas of the body: legs, neck, chest...very convenient design and an all-around great product.</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift for my husband. He likes that he can shave his back himself (which I appreciate as well) and it does a good job. His only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t come with any sort of guard in case you wanted to use it in other areas but all in all he was very pleased.</li>
            <li> Nice way to keep your back &amp; back side smooth . Takes a little practice to get used to . But will get a clean shave .</li>
            <li> This item is advertised as &amp;#34;electric&amp;#34;, meaning it uses electricity to operate, when in fact, it runs on 2 AA batteries. The option of using AC current is non existent. I was going to return this item the day it arrived, as it used false advertising to sell the product, but I thought I&#x27;d at least try it out once. I was pleasantly surprised at the ease of using this product. It is nicely balanced, cuts hair without pulling, gives a close shave, and is lightweight. The great results I received overcame the deceptive advertising. I recommend this product...as long as you know it only runs on batteries.</li>
            <li> This is probably the most cost effective, and lest painful way to get rid of back hair.  Another plus is that you can do it by yourself, so you don&#x27;t have to show anyone else your embarrassing hair.  Just buy a small hand mirror from the dollar store, and use a bigger mirror, and you can have the hair off in a few minutes.  It did scratch me a little but it went away after a day, and was still much less painful than using a depilatory cream (which burned really bad).  Laser treatment is too expensive, and I&#x27;m too afraid to try waxing (which I heard is like $[...] each time), so it&#x27;s the mangroomer for now.</li>
            <li> It does what the ad says, but seriously, it&#x27;s $40 and disposable battery powered?  At that price, there should be internal nicads and a charger.  The plastic housing is a bit cheap and I seriously wonder how long it will last.      If this had been made by Conair and sold at Walmart it would have been $25, which is about the price it should be.    I understand the difficulty of getting the correct angle that was mentioned by another review.  The hinge in my unit is flimsy and doesn&#x27;t hold the angle real well.  We&#x27;ll see how long the blade and batteries last.</li>
            <li> pulls hairs out instead of cutting!!!  used it once and it hurt to use it....good idea but need to improve on it!!!</li>
            <li> I have a lot of experience with male grooming devices. I am a fairly hairy guy with a mildly hairy back. This thing could not cut one single hair from my back no matter what angle I tried. I am not sasquatch. I returned it and tried a second one just in case it was defective. I could not cut a single square inch on my back. It simply would not cut hair at all. A total piece of junk. Not sure how anyone could possibly have gotten any use of this thing unless I have alien hair. Avoid at all cost and furthermore extremely cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Definatley useful if you are like myself and would like to shave the backrug before you go to the beach.  It takes the hair off that it makes contact with pretty easily so keep it away from any hair you don&#x27;t want removed, it will slice through it like butter.     My only complaints are that the head is angled at 90 degrees while the arm only opens to about 135 degrees.  It is a little awkward when you are trying to get hairs around your lower back.  The head could also be a little wider.  For the shaver to work effectively you need to have the entire head level on your back.  Being so narrow and trying to shave with your arm behind you tends to make the head tilt.  A wider head or a head that can pivot and stay on your back would be useful.</li>
            <li> This was a good idea because of the long handle but mine only lasted a few months and then just stopped working.</li>
            <li> This product does scratch skin a little and does hurt just a little...but it does cut VERY close, so that is really expected.</li>
            <li> This thing works as advertised. Trimming back hair is like clearing a forest sometimes and this thing does the trick. Easy to use and the two double-A batteries required last the entire season. No more arm-breaking manuevers or using a clipper taped to a wire hanger. Just buy it. It&#x27;s so worth it. You&#x27;ll thank yourself later.</li>
            <li> Still learning to master it, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> Very useful, easy to use once you get the hang of looking in the mirror. Gets all the hard to reach areas of the back.</li>
            <li> Worth the money works very well</li>
            <li> It leaves stubble on your back, but does technically get the job done. If you have super sensitive skin then it may hurt. Can shave before a workout and not experience razor burn. Can also use on other parts of the body as closing the shaver does not null the blades (they&#x27;re still functional).&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I&#x27;ll say is that these aren&#x27;t made very well. It is obviously cheap and while I&#x27;ve had my current mangroomer for a year, it is my second one. My first one I dropped after one week of use and it literally shattered into a million pieces. Buy at own risk but if you want to be perfectly smooth in terms of body hair, you should probably go with a wax.</li>
            <li> This is a lifesaver haha. The design is great and I would recommend it to anyone needing a helping hand. My only complaint is that when you put it in a 90 degree bend it doesn&#x27;t stay locked in place so you have to continually keep bending it. Other than that it is a great product.</li>
            <li> If you have a hairy back and hate it like I do. Buy this. It&#x27;s easy and effective. Can&#x27;t go wrong for the price. I didn&#x27;t have any pain or red marks the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I did not use this product.  When it arrived, I discovered it was not truly an electric razor, it requires 2 AA batteries which is not identified on the webpage.</li>
            <li> Based on some of the reviews, I was not sure whether this product would work.  I do have some back hair, but not a lot.  All of my  back hair is gone and my skin is even smooth.  As a side note, this thing is an EXCELENT back scratcher as well.  I had no problem using it and I think it is a great product.</li>
            <li> very good, easy and confotable to use, good built and quality, I have it for 3 years no problem .</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this product after coming to the conclusion that having my back hair professionally removed (i.e., by electrolysis or laser treatment) would simply not be worth the cost. I don&#x27;t have a very thick layer of hair on my back, so I thought a do-it-yourself product such as the Mangroomer might handle my unwanted hair very nicely.    Thankfully, I was right.     The first time I used the Mangroomer I was somewhat disappointed. As many other reviewers have noted, the construction of the shaver is flimsy and it&#x27;s not as sturdy as most would hope. While it folds up nicely into a compact size, it does look fairly cheap. In addition, the blade itself is not very wide, so it takes longer to shave than seems practical. As far as performance, I was not so impressed at first because it took a very long time for me to remove most of my hair, and I don&#x27;t even have a very think layer on my back. It also doesn&#x27;t extend quite as far as I had expected, so reaching some of the most difficult areas of the back (particularly the lower-middle area) can be quite a nuisance. However, even though it was time-consuming initially, I did manage to remove most of my hair and it looked noticeably smooth and clean post-shave.    Since then, I&#x27;ve experimented with my shaving technique and I&#x27;ve cut down the overall time it takes to shave by a third, from about 30 minutes to 20 minutes. I also have virtually no redness/irritation, and I find that I only need to shave once a month to keep my back nearly hairless. It won&#x27;t remove your hair entirely (like shaving with a razor would), but it does remove nearly all of the hair. I&#x27;ve been impressed by how good it looks, and I&#x27;ve been really happy that I&#x27;ve had such good results at a fraction of the cost of a professional treatment.    I definitely recommend this product if you&#x27;re willing to be patient in learning how to use it correctly and if you do not have a significant amount of hair. I don&#x27;t think the Mangroomer would be strong enough to remove thick layers of hair, but it&#x27;s managed to rid of my hair quite easily and effectively.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few similar products, and this is the only one that gets the job done. Now my back is no problem. Love it.</li>
            <li> The only thing that could have made this better was if it was more expensive and built better. Maybe with a rechargeable battery pack, and a body made of carbon steel. Regardless of the fact that it&#x27;s made of cheap plastic and feels like a toy, the thing absolutely works like it says. Not only that, but for thirty something bucks if I had to buy a new one every time I needed my back done, it would still be faster, cheaper, less humiliating, and certainly less painful than getting some stranger torture me with wax. If you want to get rid of back hair, this is worth EVERY PENNY. Get one, for real.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting my back waxed for a few years and the cost is $40 (includes tip) for each visit. The Mangroomer works great and it has paid for itself. No, my back isn&#x27;t red or beat-up. I don&#x27;t have a wool sweater on my back. This is a god send.</li>
            <li> Had another one for a few years but the motor finally quit. liked it enough to buy another one. no regrets.</li>
            <li> I thought the mangroomer would be a great thing for my husband&#x27;s hairy back, however, once he tried it, I changed my mind!  It is very light-weight, which is nice, but it does not give a close shave and the other reviewers are correct in saying that you&#x27;d need a 3-way mirror to shave it correctly and thoroughly.  My husband gave it a try and had trouble with it staying on, almost like it sucked the battery juices right out. Then I gave it a try and thought a disposable razor would be much more efficient.  It did not give a close shave and it clogged up quickly!  We both agree that $40 is much too high for this product. Don&#x27;t waste your time people with hairy bodies!  Use Nair or a razor - much more efficient! Save the $40 for something more exciting and useful like a waxing!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over a year now. Works great and very happy with it.  Not sure why the negative reviews about it being painful to use. Come on, it&#x27;s a groomer for MEN.</li>
            <li> It takes a little practice, but if used correctly, the Mangroomer does a good job on my back.  Also my neck and shoulders.  It&#x27;s important to get the angle of the head just right, and move it slowly.  A 3-way mirror would be a definite help, but I can get by with a good wall mirror and a handheld mirror.  2 thumbs up for a great gadget!</li>
            <li> HAVE HAD A PROBLEM WITH GUERILLA BACK FOR YEARS NOT JUST FOR LOOKS BUT AMOUNT OF WARMTH (ADDAGE OF BODY HEAT) THIS HAS MADE ME NOT SO ASHAMED TO TAKE MY SHIRT OFF THANK YOU</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waxing at $45 a pop every few months for a couple of years and I grew tired of the pain and hair bumps that followed days after.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to use this product and it worked like a charm. Within a few minutes I was done. No pain, no irritation and no hair bumps 3 days later.&lt;br /&gt;I expect to use it once a month. That&#x27;s doable.</li>
            <li> I love it.  Does everything I need.  I was nervous purchasing it but easy to use and high quality.</li>
            <li> This shaver works great for me. I don&#x27;t know why others have trouble with it grabbing their hair. Maybe they&#x27;re trying to go too fast. But if you have any common sense you shouldn&#x27;t have any problem. It cuts great pretty much every where on the body.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and gets to every place on back easily.</li>
            <li> This thing works great... the only thing I don&#x27;t like is you can&#x27;t charge it.. 2 AA batteries required... beside that  I wish I would have bought this a long time ago... My wife likes it too. No more having to shave my back</li>
            <li> This trimmer does exactly what I wanted it to do and exactly what it claims to do. The design is better than anything I&#x27;ve used and my wife doesn&#x27;t have to help anymore. Thanks.</li>
            <li> When you first get this shaver it seems lightweight but it has held up well for me. It doesn&#x27;t use a lot of battery power and does a decent job on my back.</li>
            <li> Quality product, appropriately priced with decent battery life. Not as clean of a job as waxing but substantially easier and more convenient. Gentle &#x27;back and forth&#x27; movement seems to be most effective.</li>
            <li> The mangroomer is a convenient way to trim unwanted hair in the shower. It is easy to get to the &amp;#34;hard to get [laces&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairy guy and this thing is awesome. You can reach all those tough to get spots.</li>
            <li> worked better than expected.   I could feel it working so to do my back I didn&#x27;t even need a mirror. EXCELLENT</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.  It is not sharp enough to actually shave anything.  I had my wife try to shave my back with it thinking I wasn&#x27;t using enough pressure and still it barely did anything.</li>
            <li> I have only had to use this once...about two weeks ago when I received it. The Groomer gets surprisingly close. I was not expecting the device to provide such a close shave. There was a little reddening, but it disappeared within an hour. After pricing out the cost of waxing, even if this device lasts only a dozen or so times, I&#x27;m money ahead big time! (Cheapest Manwax service I found was $60!). Great product, great value, I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> so far I&#x27;ve been very pleased with how well it cuts and the area it covers. I do have some shoulder issues so it can be tough reaching certain areas at times around mid-upper back. But overall it works great.</li>
            <li> Frist time trying out this product, I was amazed at ease of use, and great results.&lt;br /&gt;Skin feels and looks super smooth and sleek, and results last for more than two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;A task that used to take me at least 20 contortion filled minutes and a big mess, now takes me 1/2 the time, is super easy and no mess at all.&lt;br /&gt;Life made simpler !</li>
            <li> when I unpacked this thing, I was disappointed, it&#x27;s very light and feels like it will break pretty easily. I also didn&#x27;t know it too 2 AA batteries, I just assumed it was rechargeable or corded, my fault but just be aware it takes them. I&#x27;m not sure about battery life at this point because I&#x27;m still using the ones I initially put in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this thing is so easy! took like 2 minutes to get rid of all my back hair I can&#x27;t believe how well this thing works, like one of the reviewers said you should use it like you would a back scratcher instead of using the mirror, I do use a mirror after I feel I&#x27;ve finished to touch up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have this Wahl shaving kit that I was using before to remove body hair, and this thing just puts it to shame, not even mentioning the fact that it&#x27;s far easier to reach the hair, but it cuts it like it&#x27;s nothing. a few users mentioned it scratching up your back, I have very sensitive skin and honestly it&#x27;s a not issue, it makes your back red for a few minutes but after it looks fantastic. my only gripe would be that it doesn&#x27;t flex all the way straight to 180 degrees, this is a pretty small issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so if it breaks, I&#x27;ll definitely be buying a new one same day, might go for the pro model next time, I wouldn&#x27;t mind paying 50 bucks for something like this but nicer. bottom line is, for 25 dollars this thing is an absolute steal.</li>
            <li> As I reviewed in the &amp;#34;Mangroomer,&amp;#34; the thirties are not friendly to men. Hair retreats to places that it shouldn&#x27;t and has never been as well as other horrors. This will help you in the battle against age. God Speed men.</li>
            <li> I would say i love this product as it is easy to use and does a great job but I have yet to get one to last more than a year ( I am on my third). And I don;t use it every day or even every week. I use it once a month tops. And even though I try fresh batteries after a year or so it just stops working. No idea why. I take care of my things so it is not dropped or abused and left with other items piled on top of it.</li>
            <li> I could focus on the cheaply made motion restricted handle or the low grade battery contacts. But the horrible performance is nothing short of frustrating.If you are serious about grooming, you might as well use garden snips. This item does not trim, barely cuts anything and quickly loses sharpness (1 usage). It pulls the hair and you will be embarrassed with the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty fat and this can still reach most the places. Sometimes it comes down at weird angles and kind of scratches up my back. I&#x27;m probably doing something wrong but I just pretend I got those scratches from rough and wild coitus.</li>
            <li> It works well enough. It doesn&#x27;t get very close, and can&#x27;t handle thick hair. Don&#x27;t expect a wax like shave from it, but it does reach any part of your back or body.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Just what I been needing. I do not know how I lived with out this. I recommend it for all</li>
            <li> where you put the batteries just completely broke into pieces when i went to change the batteries</li>
            <li> Takes the hair off as advertised.  A little on the light side and there is no way to lock the handle at the middle and that causes&lt;br /&gt;it to open up when you are trying to mow back there.</li>
            <li> This thing really works. I went from ape to man in about a minute. No pulling, no rash, no bumps. I felt kind of stupid for not buying one sooner. There is only one drawback, this thing is loud as hell.</li>
            <li> This razor works very well. Takes a while to get used to using it in a mirror or by feel but gives a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Perfect. I&#x27;ve been trying to find something that would do this job (other than my wife) for years. I&#x27;ve tried everything. This is the first solution. Don&#x27;t pay attention to some of the reviews - once you understand how this unit cuts you can make is work simply. The key is that the cutting unit is a &#x27;line&#x27; cutter. It is like if you took a thin pencil (or similar flat long object) and it only cut when it was totally flat against the desired area. It won&#x27;t cut if it&#x27;s not in contact with your skin. The whole thing - entire length - needs to be in contact with your skin. Once you understand this just guide the unit (somewhat tricky but understandable) along your back using mirrors or whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all - it could not be better. Therefore it is the full 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> This product does a decent job and it comes in handy with the handle.  However, it&#x27;s not a super close shave.  So it may last for a day before you have some stubble!</li>
            <li> It does get close for a trimmer style head.  It does reach.  It would be more user friendly if it had more than one head, a trimmer head and a shaver head.  But, only trimmer head available.  It is made of cheap plastic and falls apart after few uses.  Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Does not really perform very well. It actually sratches when you try to use it.  I really wish the design ahd been better.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a lot I like about this product.  First, it works.  The shape and fold-out handle let you reach nearly everywhere to trim your back.  Second, the batteries are entirely replaceable, so you&#x27;re not left with a useless shell when the usual ni-cad batteries die.  Third, the trimmer head lasts a long time, and can be replaced.  I&#x27;ve used mine for over a year with no problems, and would make the purchase again.  Good item!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used one before, but I like this on, I can keep my back and shoulders trimmed up so I don&#x27;t look like a silver back at the beach!</li>
            <li> This thing is VERY cheaply made. Just holding it in your hand you can feel it&#x27;s discount quality craftsmanship. That being said, it does its job well enough and was pretty inexpensive. As other people have mentioned, it does feel a little uncomfortable on your skin as you use it, almost like someone is scratching your back with the ridged side of a butter knife. But it reaches all the hard-to-reach areas and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. My routine is to use it before getting in the shower so all the little hairs wash off and my skin tone evens out, because after use you will definitely notice red irritation marks. But don&#x27;t worry, it goes away on its own after a few minutes. Overall, I am pleased with this unit!</li>
            <li> Not very hard to use, does the job well.</li>
            <li> The upgraded versions of this have a rechargeable battery that dies quickly. This takes batteries. As long as the batteries are new, then this thing runs perfect. You can by 24 batteries on amazon for $12 and change them once a month if you wanted to, that is a year supply. If not, run the batteries until dead. The blade could use changing maybe every six months. I tried razor blades and they effect me negatively, this is a good trimmer. Wish the head was just like a Wahl trimmer, but this definitely works well. I noticed that my hair grew back just the same time frame as a razor, yet I didn&#x27;t have the negative effects with this as I did with a razor blade. This does trim it down to the skin, so there is a smooth feeling, how long that last depends on who you are. Great reaching capability, feels soft on the skin. After a half of year or so, the head would not stay attached, so i rubber banded it, eventually threw it out, and got a razor shaver, but now i am back to using this. the head replacement cost $10, thats cheap. Should have just used this instead of the razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned one, before, and it does a great job at what it was made to do! I&#x27;ve had my first one for over 5 years and it was starting to go out, so it was time to get a new one! Your site had the cheapest one! Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li> I really liked this product. Not a very hairy back, but grew light patches of hair.  The Mangroomer removed with no problem.  The product died after a year and half.  This is very frustrating being I only used it maybe once per month.</li>
            <li> For the price of this shaver, I should have purchased it years ago!  Shaving your back isn&#x27;t the most romantic thing you can ask your significant other to do. Because of this, for the past several years I tried to do this task myself, often ending with less than desirable results. This product changed all of that for me and allows for me to get a smooth shave in less than 2 minutes. To give you a little background, the one trait that I inherited from the Italian side of my family is the body hair. My back tends to have patches of thick, dark hair. The Mangroomer works its way through those patches like my John Deer tractor on my lawn. Some other reviewers have mentioned that your back can turn red and seem slightly irritated after shaving. I have found that with a little practice you can completely avoid this all together; however, I never had any redness that lasted more than 30 minutes. It simply looked like someone was scratching my back and left marks with their finger nails. I certainly wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to purchase this shaver again!</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my college son.  He loves this shaver.  He gets wild long hairs on his back and likes to keep them shaved.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product.  It unfortunately doesn&#x27;t remove any hair. The razor is not effective.  The construction is cheep.  I think this is a good idea poorly executed.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item about a month ago.  The blade seized right out of the box so I contacted the manufacturer and they promised to send a replacement Mangroomer and also a ear and nose hair trimmer all free of charge.  I had not received anything in about two weeks so I contacted them again and they immediately mailed me a Professional model and the ear/nose hair trimmer.  I owned a regular Mangroomer a few years ago and used it extensively and I can say that the Professional model is worth the money.  It&#x27;s rechargeable and the blade is much softer on the skin.  The nose hair trimmer works very well too.</li>
            <li> This is my second mangroomer, my first one was dropped by careless roommate. The product works excellent it can get to all the spots. Do not use it in the shower, use it right when you get out.   No more painful waxing or having to cover up your back with a t shirt. Depending on your genes you might have to use the product twice a week but few minutes its worth it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a wookie-like hairy back, just kind of patchy back hair.  I thought surely this razor would clean up my back pretty well, and I&#x27;m sorry to say I have been let down by this product.  The power is inconsistent and the razor must not be sharp right out of the packaging, b/c it just didn&#x27;t work efficiently.  The idea is great, and I guess that is what convinced me to buy it.</li>
            <li> Bought Mangroomer for nephew 2 and a half years ago. It has been used regularly and did the job. The motor finally died this week and we are replacing with same product without even checking other options.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and as expected :-)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t trim hair well and cut me a few times in the process...</li>
            <li> My husband went into the bathroom with this little beauty and came out smiling about 1/2 hour later. He was able to groom without having to ask me to help and that is a good thing. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this thing I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair on my back but I have a couple of small patches on each side and I can&#x27;t reach them. this thing is PERFECTQQ</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband so I don&#x27;t have to help him all the time lol. He loves it! No complaints here. The blade doesn&#x27;t scratch or catch coarse hair on the body which is a big big big plus! It does it&#x27;s job and makes it easier for my husband to look as great as he does :)</li>
            <li> I ordered and used this product once satisfactorily.  Since there is not way to to clean the cutting mechanism, that&#x27;s all it was good for.  I contacted the company directly, and they shipped me a replacement, thinking it was faulty.  I used the replacement ONCE, and the same thing.  This product is very cheaply made and impossible to clean, so I wouldn&#x27;t pay $9.99 if they offered.</li>
            <li> This is one of those things that is so simple, you wonder why nobody thought of it before!  I bought one for myself but also got one for a friend as a gift.  Sometimes I wish it had a cord so I wouldn&#x27;t have to buy batteries.  However, the batteries I have in their now have lasted about a year, so it&#x27;s not too big of an issue.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Have never reviewed a product...ever.  Guys if you have back hair, do your significant other or family a favor and buy this product.  It&#x27;s great.  Easy to use and effective.  Yes it will leave some red marks the first time you use it and I did nick myself and saw some blood.  MAN UP!  Trust me girls, you will heal.  If you can&#x27;t figure  it out after 1 time, turn your man card in.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I like this groomer.  I will probably be ordering another one.  But it guys and you will like and and save some time.</li>
            <li> This is a must have for a at man with unwanted. Body hair</li>
            <li> Had one for over 2 years and finally gave out and got a new one right away. It works great and inspite of the fact it only lasted a little over 2 years, since I use it so often, that did not bother me.</li>
            <li> Works well. I&#x27;ve used others in the past that did not work as well. I like the fact that it takes standard batteries. My last one was rechargeable and the batteries were the first to fail. Then it&#x27;s worthless.</li>
            <li> This is one of those products you are hesitant to say you bought much less do a review on. So here it is. The design is good as it can reach any part of your back you need it to. the only con is that this can pull hair if you move fast.</li>
            <li> This thing does the job without breaking the bank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only concern is durability. This is my second.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this product at first. It allows to reach even the most difficult places very easily as designed. And initially the shave was very close. But after 4 or 5 uses the two pieces started coming apart at the joint. It is easily reassembled by unscrewing the piece that holds the joint together, replacing the arm, and screwing it back on. But this kept on happening. I noticed the arm&#x27;s two pieces came slightly apart allowing the hinge to slip out easily.  I have been able to get this to stay with an epoxy treatment.  So the arm stays on, but it is not the same.  The joint will twist backwards now making it much more difficult to get the hard areas.  Also I have only had this a few months but the shave is not nearly as close as initially.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would go with this type of oroduct but try a different brand due to the quality.  I am ordering the Remington and will see how that is.  It does not have a bending joint, so hopefully it will not be susceptible to this defect.</li>
            <li> I just used it once and it&#x27;s pretty good, the only thing is that my hair is thick and when I used this product it left my hair prickly and if I really wanted the hair all the way gone then I have to use my razor. It&#x27;s a great product and it got mostly all of the hair, it&#x27;s just if I wanted a smooth clean feeling I would need to use a razor after I was done with the mangroomer.</li>
            <li> I initially loved the man groomer. What a brilliantly simple concept that frees you from having to ask your best friend or significant other to get those hard to reach places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m  not super hairy but those annoying strays might as well be shag rugs. I used the man groomer twice a month for the six months that I&#x27;ve had it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tonight I when I reached for it the batteries were dead. Weird since it&#x27;s only been used 12 times. I have now tried 3 pair of brand new batteries  and the man groomer still won&#x27;t groom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After finding  the user manual I see that the warranty is only for 30 days. Wow. This is a huge disappointment. The avg person would use this device two or three times in a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved the man groomer but I don&#x27;t see myself buying another.</li>
            <li> This is great if you hate to wax</li>
            <li> Update. I just bought a new one to replace my old one. I got many many great shaved from it for the price and I&#x27;m still a satisfied customer. No need for the fancy model. This does a great job of scraping the barnacles off of your back and makes a great motorized back scratcher too. I do use it remove back hair but you will need to shave more often because it is not a close shave.</li>
            <li> This battery powered shaver works as advertised.  I would note that it shaves the best when you use a pushing away from you motion instead of pulling it toward you.  I wish that I had gotten this baby a long time ago for my back.  Unfortunately, the hair on my back grows fast and fairly thick and this works really well using a pushing type motion.  Buy It- So what if it&#x27;s battery powered!  It works!</li>
            <li> Smoooooth product. Every dude should be sporting this for back of the neck (with self haircuts) or any hard to reach unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> Good for reaching spots but doesn&#x27;t give as close of a shave as I would like.</li>
            <li> A genius created a gadget that solves SO many manly problems.  Works great and has become a personal grooming essential.  Quality construction.</li>
            <li> even with the extra handle makes it hard to use//bulky..be better off without the extra handle. did know was battery operated???????????</li>
            <li> Makes shaving easy, really like the design. But the heads are poorly built, abd wear out fast.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband as part of his x-mas gifts. He has always bothered me to help keep his back looking human,I haven&#x27;t seen or heard a peep from him since he&#x27;s opened this. I think I love it as much as he does. It does a wonderful job. Anyone thinking about purchasing this as a gift or for themselves don&#x27;t think twice, you&#x27;ll be glad you bought it.</li>
            <li> Hey ! This thing is the best!</li>
            <li> Works well. Wouldnt mind if it extended out totally flat. Versus the bend, but after use; it&#x27;s not difficult to adjust to.</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD PRODUCT QUICK SHIPPING.THANKS</li>
            <li> Painful, uses a lot of batteries, but gets the job done eventually. There are other products out there that have passed this one by for sure.</li>
            <li> Man groomer does the job.  Good buy for the price. Takes practice to get a technic that works, but overall good purchase.</li>
            <li> Saw this on Rachael Ray and my husband was intrigued by it. Nice handle and it works well for manscaping. Husband is pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Love this. Definitely makes grooming a lot easier. Essential for any man with back hair that does groom regularly. 2AA Batteries and your ready to go :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product a couple of years now.  I&#x27;ve had no problems with it and it has worked exactly as advertised.  It is a little difficult to keep it flat on the skin, but that is just part of reaching behind your back with an electric shaver.  A couple of quick passes takes care of the problem.</li>
            <li> This Mangroomer back hair shaver gets the job done and allows you to do it yourself.  This is their disposable battery, (2x AA&#x27;s), model and it works beautifully.  Amazon sells this at a very reasonable price, and delivery was flawless.  I also own their Pro model with rechargeable batteries, which is excellent too. It costs more but has a rubber-like coating that improves your grip, if getting a good grip is a problem. The cutting heads are identical, (and interchangeable), except for the black coating. If you shave your back often, you might prefer the rechargeable model.  I, however just use it occassionally in the warmer weather, and this disposable battery model is perfect. Because I also have the rechargeable model, I have removed the folding part of the handle, (an easy job). For areas where you don&#x27;t need the extra length of the fold-out handle, this makes the unit much easier to manuver.  Additionally, Mangroomer, if you email them, will replace any units that are not perfect! This includes replacing heads too. I think you will find this a great tool to have around and worth the price. I used to own the original Mangroomer from ten or more years ago.  These newer models are significantly better in terms of their capability to cut smoothly and without nicking or grabing you skin.  They have really come a long way.  Hope that helps.</li>
            <li> This product actually works and does a pretty good job at getting a close shave. I was a bit worried that it wouldn&#x27;t get close enough, but it does just fine. It&#x27;s an easy 5 minute task once a week to keep smooth.</li>
            <li> Worked ok (the product itself does have the \\&quot;Made in China\\&quot; feel to it, if you have a willing girlfriend/wife, might be easier to buy a cheap ELECTRIC hair trimmer and have her do it.</li>
            <li> There is such limited options out there for manscaping that I give this 5 stars when it should be 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Plus:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Works.&lt;br /&gt;- Long handle&lt;br /&gt;- Two double AA&#x27;s awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use Eneloops as they are the longest battery you can get.  Using any rechargeable device with a built in battery sucks because all batteries have a shorter life then usually the product. When the battery goes they can&#x27;t be replace so you end up throwing it out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Negative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The handle has multiple positions but they don&#x27;t &#x27;lock&#x27; adequately so it makes them pointless.  Either first or last position only but they get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Not as close of a shave as others devices I&#x27;ve used so you will have to shave slightly more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this item.  Mangroomer just needs to fix the handle so it locks in ALL positions.</li>
            <li> The razor pulls the hair out.</li>
            <li> Very easy to you and works better than I had expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s make up is kinda cheap, but it does what I need it to do.</li>
            <li> This product does not work.  It leaves hair all over and what it does cut is not smooth.</li>
            <li> the design isnt bad but the substandard materials used to make this fall way short, it does not work well at all.</li>
            <li> Ok, let&#x27;s face it, who wants to talk about back hair?  Nonetheless, having back hair makes me feel positively primate-like.  This product, thankfully, does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  I&#x27;ve managed to shave my back before, with a variety of home-made devices (like a razor or my Wahl trimmer attached to a stick), but this device made it effortless.  Whether your preferred method us \\&quot;over-the-shoulder\\&quot;, or from behind, this will get the job done.  I was a skeptic, to be sure, but I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Pros:  Works better than any other grooming tool designed for the back that I have tried.  In fact, I had been using Nair (which works great, too)  but at $6 a bottle the man-groomer will be much less expensive in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Good design, but mostly made of hard plastic.  Just don&#x27;t drop it on a hard floor and you should be ok.  For $40 I wish the outer casing would have been made of aluminum.</li>
            <li> I have been waiting years for this product. It works excellent, You will be glad you bought it!</li>
            <li> I have been getting my back waxed for a few years (at $40 a whack) and found the Mangroomer on Amazon a few months ago. At the price of one wax, I thought, why not try it? I have been generally satisfied with the results. In the winter (unless I am going somewhere that will require me to remove my shirt) I usually don&#x27;t bother with waxing as it is expensive and rather painful.   I used the Mangroomer after several months of hair neglect. My back hair REALLY grows fast and when I began and looked in the mirror, I thought \\&quot;no way\\&quot;. The unit takes a bit of patience and self training. The blades are sharp and will scratch you pretty well if you bear down, The trick is to glide it lightly over the skin and the blades will do a marvelous job. The first time I used it, I did produce a few scratches but they cleared up in a day. The shave was pretty good for a low priced tool and certainly a LOT easier than the Razorba that I have also used.  All in all, I would recommend this item for guys who are relatively patient and dexterous. If you are expecting perfection, then go spend $40 for a wax job. But if you want a perfectly adequate solution, then certainly invest $40 in this tool</li>
            <li> ....you want to look like you were attacked by an angry feral cat!  i found this extremely awkward to use and very uncomfortable.  feels cheaply, made razor is not effective.  after using this i came up with the mantra EMBRACE THE PELT!</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I was a bit concerned that this product might not hold up, as it seems a bit \\&quot;fragile\\&quot; in its construction.  Having said that, it performs very well and I&#x27;m pleased with the results.  We&#x27;ll see how long it lasts, but for now, I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product, I had mixed feelings. On the one hand, it is not easy to master and the first time out can be frustrating. On the other hand, it is a unique and helpful tool. If you are too modest to ask your significant other (or your kids - not!) to give that hairy back of yours a buzz cut, you should give this a try.  There are several challenges, but all can be overcome with care and practice.    First, read the directions.  The main guidance provided is to shave against the way the hair is growing - the \\&quot;grain\\&quot; of the hair. Most of your back hair grows down, so that means shaving \\&quot;up\\&quot; by extending the arm on the product and pulling it slowly up your back.  However, that is not the only direction that your back hair grows.  Anyone who has tried this product now knows the several directions that the long-ignored back hair can grow.    Next, don&#x27;t get hung up on the red splotches that you will see (in the mirror) on your back when you first start using this. They go away real fast.  Your back is just not used to coming in contact with something this sharp.  And it is not dangerously sharp, just irritating sharp at first.     Further, once you get a feel for this, I recommend NOT looking into the mirror but use this like you would use a back-scrubber or loofah for washing your back -- visualize it on your back and use long \\&quot;up\\&quot; strokes.  Doing it by \\&quot;feel\\&quot; will help keep the cutting edge flush against your skin to get a cleaner cut and avoid the red marks that you make when the cutting edge is slanted against your skin.    Using a hand mirror and the bathroom (or other fixed) mirror is the only way to get started.  However, everything goes backwards in the 2-mirror arrangement.  If you try to adjust the cutter by looking in the mirror/s as you turn it, you&#x27;ll likely end up twisting it more the wrong way.  Hence the advice to use it like a back brush, don&#x27;t always be looking in the mirror.    Best to use before taking a shower.  That way the cuthair that remains on your back will be washed off.    And finally, be ready for the challenge of doing the side of your back that is the same as the hand you favor - right-handed guys will have a much easier time getting to the left side of their backs, and vice versa.  But with patience and practice, I believe you can do both sides well.    It is best to check out your back in the mirror every few weeks or so to keep the forest down.  One of the reasons people get frustrated with this product is that the first time they use it is with long-ignored hair that is, well, long.  Regular use will not only give you practice, but you&#x27;ll be trimming smaller shrubs.    This is a handy gadget that will, over time, become part of your routine.  It is not perfect, but it is lightweight, cuts well when flush against the surface of your skin and more manageable than an electric shaver (or razor - gasp!) taped to a broom handle.</li>
            <li> I just tried it out, and it works fine. yes, the mangroomer is not a sturdy product, and if you drop it, it probably will break easily. It&#x27;s not for those guys that have a carpet on their back, but for touch ups. It does scratch your skin when shaving, and it will hurt a little if you have sensitive skin like I do.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I kept the receipt in case something happens, read the reviews from other people they are all right on about the quality and usage!</li>
            <li> This is the best option I have seen thus far! I am tired of those smelly liquides that just burn you&#x27;re skin... plus how do you get your hands on most of your back...  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This shaver works... It&#x27;s a little tricky to get used to at first but you can do a pretty good job without even looking in a mirrior. I bet it won&#x27;t last for more than a year... but it&#x27;s only 39 bucks most regular shavers cost about 100. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Trust me this is by far the best solution I have seen... Highly recomend! Thanks for inventing!</li>
            <li> Best product I&#x27;ve found for do-it-yourself back hair removal.  Seems fragile - may not survive drop on ceramic tile floor.</li>
            <li> It is good at cutting short hair but longer hair takes a couple of passes.</li>
            <li> An innovative product that just does not work very well. It does it&#x27;s job of removing unwanted hair, but it also takes a lot of skin with it. Your back may look like it&#x27;s had an encounter with a clawed creature, as mine did.&lt;br /&gt;The problem lies in the head design. It is bare metal against bare metal, like most shavers, but there is nothing preventing it from grabbing, or rubbing your skin right off your back. Since the moving blade is flush with the \\&quot;guard\\&quot;, it just chews you right up.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot give this product a recommendation until the head design improves.</li>
            <li> So, I ordered the mangroomer and then I read the reviews and I was thinking, \\&quot;Oh great, money wasted again.\\&quot;  I got the package, wasn&#x27;t really looking forward to it.  Opened the package, took it out, pulled off my shirt, stepped in the shower and bam.  After 3 minutes my back was clean as a brand spanking new chromed out whistle.  None of this &#x27;burning blade&#x27; problem or anything else.  It easily reached all the spots I needed it to, the whole back, with absolutely no problem.  I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Being your typical big, macho, hairy guy, I&#x27;ve got hair growing everywhere. So when I&#x27;m checking out this months Maxim magazine, I see the \\&quot;man groomer\\&quot;. For once, I thought, there&#x27;s a neat idea. So today I hit the local bed, bath and beyond and drop $40 on one of these gadgets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I popped a couple AA batteries in and pulled the t-shirt off. Bzzzzz... owch! Ok, so it pulls some hair. I go back and forth trying different angles and bupkis. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m no sasquach but I&#x27;ve got more hair than just fuzz. I was greatly dissappointed by this product. After evaluating first hand, I&#x27;d give this gadget a 3 out of 10. I&#x27;ll be returning it for a full refund tomorrow.</li>
            <li> I used mine 5 times then it broke. Its made of cheap plastic and leaves a lot of stubble. I also went through 2 sets of batteries.</li>
            <li> I use my webcam and laptop to see how I&#x27;m doing or have done with this product :)Yes I know it&#x27;s a terrific idea......Thank You !</li>
            <li> The handle designn is indeed a great accomplishment, even though it is made of very cheap plastic and it feels as if it could break at any moment. But for the price that&#x27;s okay, I suppose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real problem is the blade. It is extremely rough on the skin and it will not, repeat, WILL NOT cut hairs longer than a few millimeters. If you&#x27;ve a rather furry back, forget about this product. You will need to remove the hair some other way first, and then, perhaps, use this as a way to KEEP the hair short. Otherwise you&#x27;ll just cause yourself a lot of pain (did I mention the blade hurts like the devil?) for no reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By comparison, the much cheaper Remington BHT-2000 \\&quot;precision\\&quot; trimmer removes even the longest hairs with practically no pain at all. I almost dislocated a shoulder in trying, but it does work really well. Now I just have to find a way to strap the Remington on the Mangroomer&#x27;s handle...</li>
            <li> This product is far from excellent - and that&#x27;s what&#x27;s frustrating about it, because it should be.  Putting some clippers on a stick is not what I&#x27;d call an engineering feat and in fact, I but you could make a better one with a stick and some duct tape...but you won&#x27;t so read on.    Main complaints are that the clippers are really low quality and only work well with hair that&#x27;s already short.  The first time you use this thing you&#x27;ll be in pain and it will take over 1 hour to shave that hairy back (if you&#x27;re part simian like myself).  You&#x27;ll be tempted to send it back, but don&#x27;t.  After that first grueling session, if you keep a regular grooming regimen it will be much easier, faster, and way less painful.    Bottom line - it&#x27;s not a great product and it hurts at first but it&#x27;s the only way I know of to have a back that&#x27;s not apelike and for that alone I would recommend you buy it.  You&#x27;ll be amazed at how much better you look!</li>
            <li> The Mangroomer does what they say, it makes it easier to shave your back, however, the first few times I used it I ended up with scratches all over my back. Good idea, just takes a long time to get used to it.</li>
            <li> I purchased it from Amazon.com.  The first time I used it, it cut into my skin and made me actually bleed.  It is very painful.  I&#x27;ve used similar products prior to this one, but have never had as many problems with them.  I do not recommend this product for anyone.</li>
            <li> Waxing is pricey and painful and asking someone else to help shave your back is embarrassing so a product such as this one seems logical.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting miracles, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting this to really hurt either.    Firstly, this thing is so flimsy.  It&#x27;s made of light plastic and is hard to extend fully.  If you drop it once it&#x27;ll likely break in half.  That aside, it scratched up my skin leaving big, pink sore patches.  If I persisted it may have caused bleeding.  It feels horrible and the injuries are still visible over a week later.  All that and it barely works - it didn&#x27;t evenly or fully remove the hair.    Don&#x27;t waste you time or cash on this.</li>
            <li> The Mangroomer is a nice tool for those that have a lot of back hair going. Positives- Gets rid of even the longest hairs on the back and is relatively easy to use right out of the box. Also it does not seem to need a lot of maintenance.  Negatives- You still might need someone else to help get to those hard to reach places since the handle is not quite long enough for that. Also, it does not provide a close shave.  Overall I recommend this product since other than waxing or laser it&#x27;s the only option out for men with hairy backs.</li>
            <li> I have used several different types of Self-Groomers for back hair. This does cut hair but it&#x27;s not very impressive and there is a lot of afterwork to do.</li>
            <li> I dropped this once and it stopped working. The plastic used to make it isn&#x27;t very strong. The razor head seemed to not hold anymore because the plastic cracked. Threw it away.</li>
            <li> This makes life so much easier.</li>
            <li> Purchased mangroomer quite a while ago&amp; it has not disappointed</li>
            <li> I have thought about buying this for a long time, and finally decided to because of the good price on Amazon.com When I got the Mangroomer, it was easy to put the batteries in and easy to figure out how to use it. It does take a little while to get use to tilting the head correctly to shave the hair effectively, but once you get the hang of it, it works great.     I do find the angle to feel a little flimsy, when you snap it into the specific angle you want, it wiggles, a benefit of this, is it allows the mangroomer to move and adjust easier to your back. but they could have spend a little more engineering to make it feel less cheaply made.     I have had this for a week, used it once, cant wait to try it again. No longer do I have to worry about hair all over my back. The extender does a great job getting to the lowest part of my back and I would recommend this to anyone who wants to get rid of hair on their back.</li>
            <li> This is a clipper, not a shaver.  The difference, in my opinion, is the length of hair left.  With this clipper, you can expect a stubble to be left behind.  Leaving a little stubble may be preferable to a close shave: some men develop ingrown hairs when close shaving their backs.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re buying this for the handle, which allows you to reach all points of your back.  If you&#x27;ve ever tried this with a normal clipper, you can appreciate it.  You probably won&#x27;t want to use this clipper where an ordinary clipper can be used more comfortably and with better results.&lt;br /&gt;The clipper head passes over the skin at about a 90 degree angle.  It&#x27;s a bit uncomfortable and it&#x27;s difficult to closely follow all of the small contours of the back.  For an improvement, an angled head with a soft plastic comb (with rounded teeth) on it could help reduce scratching and possibly allow for a more even cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: if you&#x27;ve got a very hairy back and you just want to clear away the bulk of it, then this clipper will work for you.</li>
            <li> It does the job pretty well the only thing keeping it from 5 stars is it feels really cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a couple years now, bought a new one because my old one finally bit the dust.  This thing is the most fabulous invention, if you have back hair shame.  Buy this thing!  NOW!</li>
            <li> Handy and efficient, does exactly what it describes. Definitely worth the money. Would recommend it to anyone with mild back hair.</li>
            <li> Works superbly. close shave. Big blade, but haven&#x27;t yet figured out how to replace it later, once it wears out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prompt delivery, delivered in NJ 3 days after placing order via free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus this does a good job shaving the butt, chest (do not go too close to the nipples), upper thighs (definitely stay clear of the &amp;#34;twig &amp; berries&amp;#34;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are not getting a close enough shave, check the angle of the blade against the skin, it should be perpendicular, not slanting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Use sewing machine oil to lubrucate the blade (not any other type of oil), it will then last much longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a truly great product.</li>
            <li> I originally wrote a negative review for this product as it took considerable amount of effort to do the job and it really cut my back up in the process. I wrote the negative review and almost immediately was contacted by the company offering their appoligies and a prompt replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy to say that the replacement I received works perfectly. No more cuts and this time I only had to make a few passes to do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe I must have received a bad unit, but was pleasantly suprised by the company&#x27;s effort to make things right. The company immediately sent me a replacement along with some additional mangroomer wipes, one of their other products, and I received the replacement within 2 business days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have a working unit I am very happy with the performance and equally impressed with their customer service. I would recommend if you happen to receive a unit like mine that wasn&#x27;t trimming efficiently or is cutting up your back to give the company a chance as they really stand behind their product. After they wrote me I was able to reach them back at sales@mangroomer.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I assure you I do not work for the company, but find it really rare these days for a company to do customer service right, even for a $20 product.</li>
            <li> This product is great. I wish the clippers were a bit more heavy duty as I have a good amount of back hair. It takes me a couple goes at my back to get it complete void of hair. But the fact that I don&#x27;t have to rely on others to shave my back is what does it. The arm reaches everywhere. The bend allows to get leverage. I do wish this came with a charger rather than batteries. It does scratch a bit.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that does it&#x27;s intended job.  Nice and close shave lasts like 2-3 weeks.  More economical then going to get waxed and doesn&#x27;t leave ingrown hairs.  Another plus is that it reaches all areas fairly easily.  Doesn&#x27;t run through batteries as some other products of the like.  However, I was expecting it to come with a optional cord to plug in.  Battery use makes it more portable and easier to manuver. It is also supper light.</li>
            <li> Cheap and scratches the hell out of your back if you don&#x27;t have the angle correct.  Don&#x27;t bother with this one.</li>
            <li> Need to get rid of that back hair before hitting the pool and don&#x27;t want to ask anyone else to help you out.  Works surprisingly well.  Feels a little cheap, but has not broken on me so far.  Just don&#x27;t drop it or I&#x27;m sure it will crack.  Razor is nice and wide and works well.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this get rid of that pesky back hair.  It isn&#x27;t especially heavy duty, but does the job.  It has a large head and extends so far it would probably go around two people.</li>
            <li> This product does do the job but not very effectively. it does pull hair if it has any length so don&#x27;t wait too long between uses.it is very cheaply built,the handle cracked the first time I used it so it is now taped.is fairly easy to use but for the money I think it was over priced.....</li>
            <li> I recieved this product broken and tried to get someone to help me with no satisfaction. I took pictures of the broken product and sent them to the specified party with no satisfaction.</li>
            <li> This invention, along with the bamboo backscratcher, completely alleviates the need for a live in girlfriend- and for a fraction of the cost. My only wonder, is what the benefit is to the higher end (read: expensive) model...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had this for a year- and I cannot give it enough kudos.</li>
            <li> Is it simple to use?  Yes and no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I read the reviews, one person took the time to describe the challenge and how to use a fair technique on cutting back hair.  I&#x27;m not that guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I like the MANGROOMER.  It does what it says it does.  YOU have to take the time to find the right way to hold it so it works effectively and efficiently.  It&#x27;s going to take a little time to get it figured out, but basically it&#x27;s simple to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works fine and lasts a long time!  I give it a thumbs up!!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave cleanly and it snags and pulls hairs. Painful at times.</li>
            <li> It does works for longer hair. It doesn&#x27;t remove tiny hairs because the razor head is too large. It extends far down your back and it feels good to scratch an itch. I really like this product. It was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> Suprisingly effective</li>
            <li> Just buy it and enjoy the benefits as good as a wet shave for me. I have medium density back hair and really wanted to do something about it and this little groomer was the solution. I have no idea what the 1 and 2 star raters are talking about this thing works and for $20 bucks come on take a chance.&lt;br /&gt;I pulled it out of the box popped two double AA batteries in and 10 minutes later no back hair. Finish was very smooth, I immediately had my wife apply Jojoba Oil to deal with the slight skin abrasion from the groomer, I think I was pushing too hard in the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;Card in box says for the first two years if you have any problems with the groomer you can call them for a replacement unit, so trying this out is nearly risk free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6 use update&lt;br /&gt;Still going strong after 6 uses on my back and on the same set of batteries. The very slight skin abrasion has gone away with subsequent uses as my skin has gotten used to the shaver and it is still a very smooth shave. I have also gotten a lot more efficient with the shaver with a little practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;18 Month update&lt;br /&gt;Still works great and my technique is really down just takes me minutes every 2-3 weeks to touch my back up one observation I use the remington blade saver spray to disinfect and lube the blades and this seems to do a great job of preserving the sharpness and cleaning away hair and dead skin. I do not think you could get closer even with a wet blade shave.</li>
            <li> Bought one for each of the three men in our family.  Not only works for the guys but makes the ladies happy too (no more cries of &amp;#34;help&amp;#34; from the shower).</li>
            <li> Get the more expensive one that plugs in. The batteries wear out. But it does not hurt when you use it.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Joint in handle could have a greater range of motion, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Works great! Perfect item for a man with a hairy body! Easy do it yourself item. Best purchase I have made</li>
            <li> It works really well, little tough to get used to at first. It does do a great job! My only suggestion is if when fully closed you could extend the head of the shaver out.</li>
            <li> It does its job.  Not fancy at all.  No &amp;#34;solid&amp;#34; feeling.  Not smooth on the skin... but it does what is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I received a Mangroomer back hair trimmer as a gift and it worked great for about 16 months of occasional use and then the motor quit.  I posted a one star review here noting the short life of the unit and shortly after the Mangroomer company contacted me with an offer to send a new unit in exchange for revising my one star review (they sent, I edited).  After using the replacement Mangroomer unit no more than 5 - 6 times, the motor on it quit working as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I wrote in my initial review, these trimmers are simply not durable.  The hair on my back is very fine, thin, and sparse.  It&#x27;s NOT the thick, coarse hair some guys have on their backs.  So it&#x27;s not like the motors in these two failed units were being strained to get the job done.  Furthermore, after receiving the second unit, I took the first one apart in a failed attempt to repair it.  The components used to make these seem incredibly cheap.  The motor looks like an inexpensive, generic motor you&#x27;d see in a child&#x27;s toy purchased at a dollar store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve now moved on to a Phillips Bodygroom Pro and am very happy with it so far.  While reaching back hair during trimming is not as convenient compared to the Mangroomer, the Bodygroom Pro does a better overall job and is useful for trimming other than just back hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to add that that representative from Mangroomer who contacted me after the first unit quit working was very courteous and it appeared they want to stand behind their product.  However, after the failure of two consecutive units in such a relatively short period of time, I think it&#x27;s important to provide this feedback for potential Mangroomer buyers.</li>
            <li> Bought this in 2007 and it still works in 2013.  This is a very effective product.  I use it about once a month and I love still love it.</li>
            <li> This thing is rather cheap and doesn&#x27;t work that well. I would really not recommend buying it. You are better off getting someone to cut your back hair with a trimmer.</li>
            <li> I was a little dubious about this product but it did the job perfectly. I don&#x27;t have a great deal of back hair so I can&#x27;t speak for the effectiveness in that case but I&#x27;m completely happy with the results. The Mangroomer is somewhat cheaply made and I did have to snap the case back to together around the blades, but its held up the several times I&#x27;ve used it, no idea of the long term durability though.</li>
            <li> This product leaves nasty scatches all over your body, Used this product 6-7 times before I gave up on it. It bites you and leaves nasty scratches from the rough blade edges. Not a good design.</li>
            <li> The man groomer is the ultimate man tool...if you have a hairy man back like I do then this thing is a requirement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who deems necessary.</li>
            <li> This product operates on 2 AA Batteries is not included inside packaging. It is a bad product because it doesn&#x27;t cut hair. Before I bought this product I couldn&#x27;t I didn&#x27;t read Mangroomer works with 2 AA batteries. I can not return it because of return policy. I am not happy with this product I would like to have my money back o at list change this product.  Abraham</li>
            <li> i am still at this day amazed what made me buy this cheap piece of plastic. i dont have any use for it and really not happy with the purchase either i thought this was a different product and this was something else totally. i wouldnt recommend anyone to buy this but if you have to this looks and feels cheap as well and now that i warned you, you are on your own. shipping was fast and thats about it</li>
            <li> This shaver allows men to shave in places, we haven&#x27;t seen (and maybe don&#x27;t really want to see) without a mirror.  Does not scratch your skin, and hair grows back without itching....  A Guy Must Have!!!!</li>
            <li> Perfect to do it yourself</li>
            <li> I love this little awesome shaver.I would recommend to anyone with hair issues in any place of the body as it can reach almost anywhere.</li>
            <li> This does not work at all well. The shaving head is at a bad angle. It should be designed at an optimal, gentle angle, like regular hair clippers, but the head is at a right angle to my back and doesn&#x27;t shave well and scratches my back&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John</li>
            <li> It took some time to understand how the product works.  It&#x27;s hard to keep it clean. And it requires some good hand eye coordination. :)</li>
            <li> The ManGroomer does as advertises. it shaves your back. I will gladly recommend this product to any man with hair on their backs. I previously used a Remington BHT600. It was great also did the job and was waterproof and allowed me to trim other areas, but i had lost my charger while moving and a replacement was just as costly as a new one. So i opted for the mangroomer after reading the reviews. First let me say this gives a much closer shave than the Remington bht600, but its not as easy to use. You have to do long slow strides over the area and can be tricky to maneuver at times and feels awkward in the hands. Once you use it for a couple minutes it gets easier to use. after roughly 15 minutes of tricky mirror angling i was finished. The results were a clean back. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> The shaver is amazing to help get rid of some of that unwanted hair in places where you might not be able to reach. Definitely recommend this product and seller</li>
            <li> worked great no problems Easy to use would buy again</li>
            <li> I read various reviews about this product from various places and that one word kept coming up all the time, \\&quot;smooth\\&quot;, and for all I had my reservations about this &#x27;shaver&#x27; in the first place, I put aside such skepticism and gave it a go anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side there isn&#x27;t an area of your back that you cannot reach with this thing. It&#x27;s also light and easy to maneuver. It folds away neatly which is good for storage, discretion and traveling. However, I find its main short coming to be the end result. The word &#x27;smooth&#x27; isn&#x27;t the word I&#x27;d use to describe it, the shaver itself also does feel kind of flimsy from a build quality perspective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m disappointed with both the product and myself for buying it. In hindsight it&#x27;s obvious that a shaver with a handle isn&#x27;t going to give someone &#x27;smooth&#x27; results. Think of a &#x27;shaved head&#x27;, the hair isn&#x27;t exactly gone, it&#x27;s just cropped. For all the adjustable handle is good and it folds away neatly for your convenience, the end result is really what I was looking for when I bought this item, and it just didn&#x27;t deliver what I was lead to hope it would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d urge someone to think long and hard before you purchase this item yourself, you likely won&#x27;t get smooth results if you&#x27;re anything up to average on the hairy scale, but you will get convenience and from a distance it does give my back that smooth appearance, it&#x27;s just a shame that close up I look like a dalmatian with the stubble it&#x27;s left behind.</li>
            <li> This junk didn&#x27;t work at all it pulled the hair on my back and didn&#x27;t cut any of it off I was very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.  Gets a clean shave and I don&#x27;t have to ask my wife to shave my back anymore!</li>
            <li> Works well.  Takes a little getting used to.  Static on the plastic handle collects clipped hair.  Not necessarily a bad thing.</li>
            <li> First off it wasn&#x27;t clear clear anywhere that this was not rechargeable.  Second, It pulls on the hair only enough to cause pain but not to cut it or even rip it out.  Imagine a wax job where pulling the wax lasts for 20 minutes and you still have the hair.  Thought it was because my hair was course but my Philips cuts jsut fine except for the short handle.  I may bust the head off this thing and duct tape on something else. I have an average amount of hair on my back so I&#x27;m not a Gorilla!</li>
            <li> really a waste of time and plastic. scrapes and pulls far more than it cuts. just skip it and tape a razor to a stick or to a tree or anything. this device was pretty much worthless&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;edit:&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer contacted me to discuss by product review. they are certain that i received a faulty unit and are sending me another to try out. keep in mind that this unit was purchased over 5 years ago and discarded. i just wrote the review today. so i may review in better light after i try the replacement. at least their customer service is top notch</li>
            <li> The shaver arrived on time.  I tried it first day and worked well.  I wanted a product that was easy to use and that would keep my hair trimmed and this one did the job as promised at a good price.</li>
            <li> It works.  At least for me.  I got scared off of ordering a replacement head because of some of the fit issues people had, but for the money, and my last one hung on for a couple of years, I just grabbed a new one.  I can&#x27;t speak to how well it cleans up really thick hair, or dark hair, but it works great for me.  Keep the bottom blade hitting your skin first and it won&#x27;t bite you.  It&#x27;s easier to go around your sides than it is over your shoulders.  That&#x27;s about it really.  I guess if your body hair is like the hair on your head or face, this would have some trouble.  Otherwise, I totally recommend this.</li>
            <li> I purchased one a year ago and the model at that time was underpowered and pulled the hair on my back. Then it only lasted a year.</li>
            <li> Holy cow, this thing is awesome, shaves pretty much everywhere, doesn&#x27;t get a perfect cut, but it does the bulk of the work amazingly! No pain, no bumps, no cuts! I used it on my arms, legs, feet, back, stomach, chest, its great for everywhere and doesn&#x27;t hurt one bit!</li>
            <li> This shaver works great !!!  Cuts the hair very short and doesn&#x27;t cut the skin like with regular clippers when you&#x27;re not paying close attention.  Wish it was make a little sturdier.  Feels a little cheap but works well.</li>
            <li> The reason I gave this item 2 stars is not because it doesn&#x27;t work (for awhile)... but because of the quality of the product.  The blade on this starts becoming dull after appx 6 times of using it.  It will still cut, but not without moving very slowly across the area you are removing hair from.  (The first few uses will provide an amazing close &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; and moves through hair quickly and efficiently).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no way to change blades as the head is sealed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dropped the unit one time and the on/off switch came flying out and could not be re-inserted because the unit is &amp;#34;sealed&amp;#34; and cannot be opened without destroying it.  The unit was stuck in the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; position (which is, in a way, a mixed blessing) so the only way to turn it off was to remove one of the batteries and then re-insert when I wanted to use it.  Oh, and the battery cover is held in place by a very flimsy plastic clip... which stops working after a few times of opening the compartment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased the pro version of this item to see if it&#x27;s any better.  After all, it really does work (when new) and I see the pro has some much improved features.  We will see...</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic back hair removal product. I&#x27;ve used this unit 5x since I purchased it &amp; I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I was using a hair removal product but use this exclusively now every 2 wks. &amp; I would recommend this product to any man with back hair issues.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty bummed about buying this product, seeing how badly it works, and not being able to return it!!!  The arm isn&#x27;t stable in its&#x27; extended position, and almost ends up collapsing completely while it&#x27;s in use.  It feels cheap to the touch, and there is nothing that covers the blade to keep it from getting dull and dinged between uses.  I have never had problems with Amazon before, but will make sure I check the return policy before buying something like this again.</li>
            <li> Unless you want to gross out your lady friend , do it yourself ! Wish the head was on a swivel</li>
            <li> IM SO SEXY NOW! this thing literally cuts as close and a razor...keep it oiled and use good batteries and should be good to go!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this since 2006, and while I can&#x27;t say I use it all that much, I can say that I&#x27;ve used it periodically over the years, and it still works. The battery life isn&#x27;t so great anymore, but it still lasts long enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not fantastic, and your back won&#x27;t look like a baby&#x27;s butt after you&#x27;re done, but it does do an effective job of reducing the amount of visible hair once you learn the proper directions to pull in on various areas of your back.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because of the thick hairy jungle that is my back.  It started to work just fine but after a bout a quarter way through it started pulling at the hair on my back and halfway through left me with welts and scrapes allover the one side of my back. I tried the other side and it just stopped working, I would go over the same spot 3 or 4 times and no hair would be cut. I am quite hairy but not so hairy that it would&#x27;ve caused the MANGROOMER to stop working. Not a great product, fairly cheap.</li>
            <li> This shaver is great for removing back hair easily. I&#x27;ve had it for 2 years and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> This is a unique product that helps get the tough spots.  It works fairly well and there has been no issues yet but could be constructed better in my opinion.  Overall a great idea.</li>
            <li> Does not work - get clogged with hair and all it&#x27;s useful for is an expensive back scratcher.  I am very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> The shaver broke the first time I used it so I taped it together. It lasted only a few time after so I threw it away.</li>
            <li> For years now I&#x27;ve been subjected to the embarrassment of having a hairy back. Conventional shavers just didn&#x27;t cut it as they didn&#x27;t allow full access to my entire back. And get someone else to shave it? Are you kidding? I had a hairy back - no one had touched me in years! But not anymore! Now with the MANGROOMER Do-It-Yourself Electric Back Hair Shaver I can have a silky smooth back all year long! And the ladies love it!</li>
            <li> I wish I had invented this... it works great. I had expected it to be a waste of money, but it wasn&#x27;t. Does what it says it does.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Doesn&#x27;t shave. Just pulls hair. I tried it on my arm as a tester and wasn&#x27;t a fan.</li>
            <li> Needs a remote camera device on it so you can see you got all the back hair off.</li>
            <li> The construction is a little janky, but it works. I&#x27;m not sure what the other brands have to offer, but I felt it did well for the price and what I expected out of it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t work and we called Amozon and they told us to contact mangroomer and we did.  It still isn&#x27;t resolved.</li>
            <li> The product didnt even work and it was very cheaply made. Horrible product! I would not suggest this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It really serves its purpose without having to ask someone for help. That&#x27;s embarrassing. I see that there is a new version, but I don&#x27;t know what the difference is. I would definately buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have been using my Mangroomer for about 6-months now and it&#x27;s still working perfectly. This product really saves me the trouble of trying to use a regular razor to get my back and my wife is much happier!</li>
            <li> I thought this would work for back hair (it&#x27;s cheap) it does&#x27;t work and it doesn&#x27;t fold easy.  It&#x27;s crap... Gave a try a few times just doesnt work...</li>
            <li> The item arrived quickly. I found item to be light weight but not flimsy. Having to put in batteries was a pain but the more expensive one has the built battery, not a huge deal. The blade did not scratch, it did cause a little redness but that is normal. I&#x27;ve had some experience doing this before. For light hair this product is excellent, however if you&#x27;ve got the Fangorn Forest on your back, I&#x27;d get something more heavy duty.</li>
            <li> This product took a bit of finessing to get it started. It was not just as simple as turning it on......I had to fiddle a lot. Finally though, it appears to be working well. The length of the handle is more than long enough to reach every part of my back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Mangroomer (the battery operated model) for over 6 years and it has never let me down.  I have, in the past, been waxed, had someone shave my back, tried an epilator _ouch!!,  and sugaring all of which are embarrassing and, except for the shave method, get pricey.  I am quite hairy and the Mangroomer takes care of it all.  It took a bit getting used to, and I have to be careful around my sides and lower back because my skin is more sensitive there. But now it&#x27;s a breeze.  It takes no more than 20 minutes.  I am 6-2 and 210 lbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, I do my sides first, feeling the path without a mirror, in a horizontal pattern.  Then I do the upper and middle from the over the shoulder method, pulling up instead of trying to push it down.  It&#x27;s like mowing the lawn and getting a good back scratch!  It does leave a slight red mark here and there so I&#x27;ve learned to trim a day in advance of any shirtless outing. I use a handled bath brush to brush away the shaved hair so I&#x27;m assured I get everything.  It does leave a very faint stubble though where the hair is thickest.  Once I&#x27;m done I use an apricot body scrub with a body brush and then apply some lotion with a lotion applicator for the back(another great invention).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this trimmer and it worked wonderfully the first time I tried.  Was simple to use and cut the hair well.  I read some reviews about having to get the angle right, etc, but didn&#x27;t have any issues.  I wish it were rechargable but it is great even with batteries.  TWO THUMBS UP!</li>
            <li> made just well enough to do the job...</li>
            <li> Excellent, have always hated back hair, now can get it gone by myself</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY!!!!!This was a horrible product it only worked for literally about 10 seconds then it quit and wouldnt start working again.  DO NOT BUY!!!!</li>
            <li> At first the plastic design feels a little flimsy but after using, it&#x27;s pretty solid. It&#x27;s kind of awkward trying to get the right angles the first time but you get the hang of it.  Genius product if you ask me! Be sure to pick up 2 AA batteries.</li>
            <li> Third or fourth one of these that I purchased over the years. Just like one previous reviewer said they last for just about a year so whether you buy the rechargeable or this cheaper version don&#x27;t expect there to be much of a difference in the life expectancy. But overall it does the job and does it well which is why I buy them year after year!</li>
            <li> Works very well, saves a ton of time, and affordable. Have been using it for a couple months now and haven&#x27;t had to change the batteries yet. Definitely glad I purchased this,</li>
            <li> I just received this product.  I shaved half (left side) of my back with it.  Then compared to the right side.  I never knew how much hair I had on my back.  My back hair was not as thick as some but it was bad enough that I did not want to take my shirt off at the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just finished using it for the first time.  It was easy and took about 15 minutes to do my whole back.  I will get better at it since I know it will take a little bit of practice.  As I get better at it I think it would not take longer than 6 or 7 minutes.  I tried it with some older batteries then found new batteries.  Go get some new batteries before using this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great idea but it they could find a way to make it a little more flexible, it would be prefect.  Also, because I had to keep going over certain spots trying to make sure I got everything, by the time I finished, I had little red welts (temporary) that looked like I had spent some time in an s&amp;m club.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no gorilla but it works great and if this thing irritates your skin you probably whine a lot.  Works great</li>
            <li> This item worked incredibly well.  I can&#x27;t believe how close it got and the ease in which it removed that pesky back hair.  I&#x27;ll say this, it was an odd feeling having my shirt touch my back for the first time in longer than I can remember.  I would definitely suggest this product to anyone who is in the slightest self conscious about their back hair.  With it, there is no more worrying about taking your shirt off and no embarrassment about having anyone else do the dirty job for you.</li>
            <li> I must say that I can&#x27;t get over how close this thing shaves. Very impressed with the results. Worth not having to ask my wife to help me out while in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> This is the most impressive product design I have seen in a long time.  The engineering is amazing -- kudos to the team that put this together.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It does a good job, although it does irritate my skin.  I have a hard time getting the right angle.  \\&quot;Works best with a 3-way mirror\\&quot; -- now that&#x27;s funny.  Most people do not have a 3 way mirror in their house, and I am not about to go shave my back at J.C. Penny haha. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I use a handheld mirror and my bathroom mirror.  It works well.  Even though it irritated a lot, it didn&#x27;t cut, and as I learn how to do the angles better, I will have less irritation. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am surprised that this doesn&#x27;t mention shaving the neck.  I used it on my neck and it did a good job.  It also did a good job on the shoulders, upper arms, and underarms. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After placing the order I regretted it -- I thought it would be $40 down the drain, but I was happily wrong -- this product is EXCELLENT.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with the MANGROOMER. The shave was not close at all. I am better off with a razor. I will get a closeer shave with a razor...!! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT....!!</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great design. It trims back hair without pulling it. The handle enables easy reach to all locations. It works perfectly out of the box.</li>
            <li> The MANGROOMER worked exactly as it said it would.  I have no trouble using it on my body.  It does help to be in front of a mirror to be able to see what you are doing.  It did not chafe or irritate my skin at all.  I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Although a tad leary after reading some of the reviews I went ahead and bought it (at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond w/20% off coupon!). I have to say, it worked very well, did not leave me scratched or scarred. It did a great job. I am very happy especially after the de-furring of my back :) Came in handy during the last 2 weeks heat wave! I&#x27;d recommend it to any fellow man-bear.</li>
            <li> I thought this worked well. All the flexible angles one can use made it easy to reach all areas of the back. The blades were sharp and di a great job very quickly</li>
            <li> Wow.  So I was skeptical, but went for it, because I hate my back hair.  I took it out of the package and the shaving head was in two pieces.  Not good.  Who knows if it works?  I didn&#x27;t even get to try it.  Customer lost.  Returning...    Updated - I called the company before returning it and they took my info and said they&#x27;d get back to me in 48 hours after reviewing the sale from Amazon, then likely send a replacement.  They never got back to me.  Brutal.</li>
            <li> I wish I could meet the hairy man that invented this product! I used to duct tape my clippers to long sticks and come up with all sorts of ways to shave my own back. On the other hand there are only so many times you can ask people to help you shave your back, as well.     This thing is amazing... It cuts nice and close, runs on batteries (2 AA) so there is no cord or power needed. It does a great job, cuts close, never jams up, and gets every spot on your back with ease! This is the perfect gift for any man that has a healthy set of body hair and likes to keep it under control!</li>
            <li> I use this in concert with an Andis ceramic clipper with a 000 blade and a man-made contraption so I can reach my back side. The Mangroomer is simply too weak to shred through my \\&quot;back forest,\\&quot; so I&#x27;ve retained the Andis and the \\&quot;short pole\\&quot; and just finish with the Mangroomer.    I&#x27;ve thrown a pair of AA lithiums into this battery-operated plastic contraption, but even they are insufficient to chop down the \\&quot;trees\\&quot; in my forest. The other thing to keep in mind is NOT to press too hard when using this as doing so is akin to the carving people used to do to their scalps.    I think they would do well to produce a more robust unit in the future, one that is metallic and AC-powered. Some attention should also be given to protecting skin from carving, but as for closeness it&#x27;s a pretty darned good shave. This is a pretty decent first shot at a product, and I understand why they wouldn&#x27;t have come out with both guns blazing on the initial release with no idea what kind of response they might see. The extra close shave that this product affords keeps the itches at bay. This product allowed me to maintain a weekly maintenance schedule and avoid the itchies I used to experience about 4 days after clipping with the Andis.</li>
            <li> The packaging sucks, and it seems to be made with standard poor production Chinese methods, but the thing works great. Close shave, easy to use and the angle of it really really works well.    Worth 40 dollars.</li>
            <li> So the angle works wonderfully for my mans back. He uses it and is satisfied with the quality of shave</li>
            <li> To All,    DO NOT buy this product. It doesn&#x27;t work very well if at all. The only thing it&#x27;s good for is duct taping a cordless to the handle so I can shave my back with a razor that actually works! If you are considering this product.......DON&#x27;T! It&#x27;s a rip off!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Even with the hand held mirror I struggle to get all of the hair off my back. I&#x27;m a bit frustrated with the mangroomer, but I just started using it so I&#x27;ll give it some time.</li>
            <li> the only problem with this product is that the motor stops working for no reason after a few uses. End</li>
            <li> It has a good design, and was easy to use. Not as close of a shave as I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and works great.  No more depending on asking someone else to shave your back.  Do it when you want with the Mangroomer.</li>
            <li> I can reach everywhere with this. No more struggling trying to reach. Just wish I had it sooner. The batteries last forever.</li>
            <li> Awsome piece of equipment</li>
            <li> Ive found it! Ive found the holy grail, this is the next best invention after fire.  I discovered parts of back never before known to the modern world.  After using this, I had a certain swagger usually reversed for only athletes, movie stars, and political figures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone knows how to invest, please, please, let me know.  Want to get some ownership before this baby goes public. IPO 2015!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ticker Symbol: MAN</li>
            <li> It is A LOT stronger than what it looks. This thing shaves any part of your body! I even use it as a trimmer for my face</li>
            <li> Alright - it does what it says, which is trim back hair, but there are 3 issues. 1, it still only trims, so you do have stubble on your back, and it&#x27;s a little prickly for a few days, plus wearing shirts will feel weird. Haha. 2- the sides will cut your back if you don&#x27;t pay attention to the angle of it. It took about 4 times to get it down without many scratches. You&#x27;ll still get them though. 3- sometimes it gets stuck on hair if there&#x27;s too much or you move it too quickly, so you&#x27;ll want to find your speed. Hope this helps</li>
            <li> Surprised, but it actually works pretty well. After a couple passes I can assure a fairly decent cut. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Finally caved in to pressure to remove back hair&lt;br /&gt;The product worked well&lt;br /&gt;A couple of pulls and nicks&lt;br /&gt;Batt not included</li>
            <li> Savior for a hairy man!!  The product came as advertised and in record time.  I will not hesitate to use this group again.</li>
            <li> Gave this as a gift- he really likes it!</li>
            <li> Well it does make a big difference on my back and other areas that I was unhappy with all these years!!!&lt;br /&gt;very easy to use too, no cuts or bruises.</li>
            <li> The blades are uncomfortable and not very effective. I haven&#x27;t found a back shaver that works well, though, so it is about equal to the others. As in, none of them are any good.</li>
            <li> works great.  you have to concentrate and hold the head square to your skin or it wont cut.  common sense.  happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I got my product it does not work.. it did not have any a Manuel too.  I feel cheated.. I need help here. I need my money back or a replacement how do I go about this???????????</li>
            <li> Mangroomer really works great to get the hair off your chest, back and nether parts; a must for athletes; oesn&#x27;t nick or scratch like trying to clean up with a regular hair trimmer. Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I read all the negative reviews on this and still went to buy it hoping they were just being overly critical.    This device is the worst clipper I&#x27;ve ever had...would have been better to attach a stick to my beard trimmer.    It&#x27;s horribly cheap plastic, like something you&#x27;d buy at a flea market...the blade is way too close to the skin and makes it look like you made love with a wolverine when you&#x27;re done, then you go to take a shower and that&#x27;s the most excruciating shower you&#x27;ll probably ever have.    The only reason this thing got 2 stars from me is because it is the only thing like it I could find and I applaud the inventor of the idea...the product itself is a ripp off and not worth it at half the price!</li>
            <li> This thing has a great design approach hampered by an extremely poor cutting device.  Basically it barely worked, and it will be going back to Amazon.</li>
            <li> The directions suggest it may take time for skin to adjust/experience minor irritation ---- to clip the hair (sure I have some, but I&#x27;m not sasquatch) seemed to also take a layer of skin with it... it is a rather awkward tool to use.  Rather uncomfortable--for days!  I&#x27;ll just stick with Nair.</li>
            <li> I am a hairy guy and the the product is a very welcome tool to make myself more presentable. I have a couple of things to add though.     First, I hesitate to call the Mangroomer a \\&quot;shaver.\\&quot; It does not \\&quot;shave\\&quot; nor does it leave your skin smooth without trace of hair. It is more like a clipper, although it does clip the hair very close to the skin. The end result would be something like what you would see if you shaved the area and looked at it the next day or so. Basically stubble.    Next, the clipper can be abrasive. You have to be careful not to press too hard or else your skin will get hurt. Just provide enough pressure so that the clipper makes contact with your skin. No more, or you may end up as disgruntled as some reviewers here seem to be. This pain is easy to avoid, so don&#x27;t condemn the Mangroomer just because you aren&#x27;t using it the right way.    Lastly, some people complain that the clipper won&#x27;t cut hair, and say that it pulls instead. This is the result of trying to clip an area too quickly. If you go slow and steady, then the clipper will work better. The best way to use the clipper is to move it in the opposite direction of the hair growth while simultaneously moving it back and forth about an inch, if that makes sense. Instead of just getting an area in one wide sweep, go slow and move the clipper back and forth in an effort to get all the hair. I will admit that if you are clipping long hair, the trimmer may pull slightly. But you shouldn&#x27;t have long hair once you start clipping it regularly!    I have tried shaving my back with the Razorba. While it worked great the first time, I ended up getting a bunch of ingrown hairs and razor bumps on my neck, shoulders and back. When I tried to shave my back again a few days later, the razor cut into all the bumps caused by the first session and it was a horrible experience. What I do now is attach my cheap Remington foil shaver (about $30 on Amazon and works beautifully. I use it for my face regularly) tothe Razorba head (instead of a razor blade) with two zip ties and shave my back with it. This is a great way to get a smooth feel to the area you want to rid hair from if using an actual razor blade won&#x27;t work for you. The Mangroomer removes the hair enough so the foil shaver is functional (foil shavers only shave stubble - don&#x27;t try them on longer growth. They pull!) and the foil shaver makes everything smooth.    One last tip is to use lithium batteries. My Mangroomer eats normal batteries from breakfast.    Oh, and waxing hurts like hell, and is very expensive. This is what works best for me. Hopefully it helps someone else out.    From one hairy guy to another.</li>
            <li> i read the reviews of the mangroomer before i purchased one and they helped. i hope my review will help others. i didnt want to deal with the mess of trying to shave my back with a razor and shaving cream, so i felt the mangroomer would be much easier. i will tell you my experience. so far, it works. the first time you use the mangroomer, it is difficult and hurts a bit and will take 20-30 minutes. i got frustrated and was unsure if i was doing it correctly because it was taking so long. but patience and a little determination prevailed and my back is finally hair free. is it as close as a razor shave? probably not, but that was not my intention, nor do i feel it will be the intention of most of you. we just want to go swimming without a rug on our backs and the mangroomer shaves it close enough to accomplish that. after the first shave, you get more comfortable with using it and it is much easier. i use it probably twice a month and am happy with the results. the only bad part of my purchase was that my mangroomer stopped working after about three uses. but i then experienced probably the greatest customer service experience in my life. i emailed the customer service folks and they almost overnited me a new one with no questions asked the next day! no problems since then.</li>
            <li> Given the amount of hair on my back, I&#x27;ve always suspected that Darwin was correct when he hypothesized that we evolved from the apes.  Perhaps, I&#x27;m the missing link that anthropologists have been seeking.  Regardless of my potential scientific or freak-show value, the \\&quot;ManGroomer\\&quot; has thus far proven to be the device I&#x27;ve been seeking.      Having been \\&quot;blessed\\&quot; with as much back hair as the furriest of primates, this, why-didn&#x27;t-I-think-of-this-first, device groomed me with remarkable ease and almost no discomfort beyond some general and short-lived irritation - similar to when a women&#x27;s nails would dig in and scrape across my back during my much less furry, collegiate and early marriage years.      With several mowings behind me now, I continue to be very pleased with this product.  Okay, the handle could be a little more rigid, but it was simple to use and left me almost as smooth as when my wife performed the uneviable and much dreaded task of clean shaving me so that I could go to the beach without scaring innocent children.      Perhaps, the only thing that really disappoints me is that Mike Rowe and the rest of the strong-stomached crew of Dirty Jobs probably won&#x27;t be filming a deforestation episode here after all.  All that said, I consider this thing to be money well spent.      Good luck and happy grooming, my testosterone-rich and folically-blessed brethren.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried the Mangroomer, it had been a while since I been clipped and the hair was a little long, but not exactly bushy.  There seemed to be more pulling then clipping and I finally had to use regular clippers to remove the hair.  I was convinced I lost my $40.  The second time I had about a 1/4 inch of growth and it worked like a charm taking it down close, not razor close but good enough.  It takes some getting used to working backwards in the mirrow, but overall it does what its intended to do.  Just keep in mind a short base of hair is required.</li>
            <li> No in depth review needed.  It shaves your back hair in seconds versus minutes trying to do it yourself with a razor.  No more having someone do it for you (embarrassing).  The shave isn&#x27;t super close, but sufficient.  I use it about every other week.  Love it.  Couldn&#x27;t do without it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m puzzled by some of the negative reviews because this thing is, IMO, a fabulous product.  Finally, a trimmer that is powerful and a solution to all those hard-to-reach areas.  Charges are quick, easy and last, too.  Plan to buy a couple this year for gifts.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t look like a circus sideshow act anymore. Thanks Mangroomer!!!</li>
            <li> I have had one of these for quite a while and the head finally went out.  I purchased this one and it has picked up where the old on left off.</li>
            <li> I bought the Mangroomer specifically for my back. I&#x27;m not the hairiest guy in the world but I am hairier then most men. I do full upper body shaves every two weeks or so and I needed something to get to my back, the only part on my upper body I had never shaved before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was as easy as one, two and three. And it actually works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a $5 large mirror I bought off Amazon, I just turned my back to the bathroom mirror and used the hand mirror to see the job. You simply open the Mangroomer up and bring the shaving head up and down slowly, but not too slowly, for most your back. For hair areas lower and areas that grow in a different direction and are hard to shave, you just come in from your sides. I easily did my entire back from my neck down to my top crack in less then 5 minutes. I showered right after, dried off, and I was amazed at how good of a job such a cheap and simple product did. I had only a few small areas where I could feel stuble, so next time I will just take an extra minute to do those better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting a so-so product but I got a winner. I will use nothing but this for back shaving needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m picky. And after I use a clippers to shave my head, face, chest and arms, I use a blade and cream on my arms and chest. So I&#x27;m smooth. And the job the Mangroomer does on my back may not be razor and cream smooth, but it&#x27;s pretty close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with purchase. I saw there was a more expensive Mangroomer, I have no idea how good that one works, but I could ask for nothing more then this one.</li>
            <li> I bought this model on May 19th, 2007, and used it for several years.  It worked great for me.  It shaved close (not quite to the skin, but so close you&#x27;d really have to look close to see any hair).  It stayed sharp.  I never even had to replace the shave head.  Unfortunately, I knocked it off the counter about 2 months ago, breaking it beyond repair.  Since I was so happy with it, I didn&#x27;t hesitate to buy the same item again on June 30th, 2012.  I finally had to use it this morning for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;This product is completely unusable.&lt;br /&gt;The shave head just catches and pulls the hair.&lt;br /&gt;The handle will not stay in the unfolded position.&lt;br /&gt;It causes pain of inconvenience, as well as physical pain.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m extremely disappointed by how awful this product has become since I bought the first one over five years ago.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been over a month since I bought it and the packaging is long gone, so I&#x27;m sure I won&#x27;t be allowed to return it, but I&#x27;m going to try.&lt;br /&gt;-&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve amended the review to add an additional star for the efforts put forward by Mangroomer to try to provide a fully working device.&lt;br /&gt;Mangroomer stood by their offer in the reply to my initial review and sent out a replacement, though not without additional minor inconveniences (see reply string for details).  Unfortunately, the first replacement I received was actually worse at cutting hair than the one it was replacing.  The first one I received in 2012 would cut the hair for about 1/2 an inch before snagging; the replacement immediately snagged hair.  Mangroomer, understandably, wanted to make sure I wasn&#x27;t using the device improperly.  After explaining that I&#x27;d been using this device properly, they sent another replacement.&lt;br /&gt;The second replacement works without snagging and pulling hair.  Unfortunately, it does not work nearly as well as the one that I bought back in 2007, but if I go over an area several times, it will eventually cut the hair decently.&lt;br /&gt;The good news is that Mangroomer appears to really want to make sure their customers are satisfied.  However, there is either a huge difference in quality between what they used to produce and what they are producing today, or I was just extremely lucky with the device I bought in 2007.</li>
            <li> This shaver will trim your hair, but not shave it close like a foil razor. I ended up using a Norelco body groom, which gets very close without irritation. I still use the Mangroomer occasionally to reach places I cannot reach with the NOrelco, which has a very short handle. I can only use the Mangroomer by holding it with the upper end of the handle, the part near the razor head. If I try to use the lower handle past the point where the folding joint is located, the razor flops around and is uncontrollable. Did anyone every bother to test this thing? They developed a long folding handle which would probably work very well, except that it won&#x27;t hold it&#x27;s angle and just flops all over the place. Really annoying!!!</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my husband. He had one for several years, and then it finally died. His previous one had a charger; I didn&#x27;t realize this one runs on AA batteries. It does say Do-It-yourself ELECTRIC back hair shaver, right?? Only two days after he started using it, the cover to the battery house fell off, and it&#x27;s no where to be found.  Got the first one at Bed, Bath, and Beyond. Guess I&#x27;ll have to go back to getting this there.</li>
            <li> Exceeded my expectations. It&#x27;s designed so well I didn&#x27;t get any breakout or skin trouble after using it. I&#x27;ve tried waxing and shaving my back and both resulted in terrible skin for weeks. Great device.</li>
            <li> Should have bought this years ago.  Exceeded my expectations ten-fold.</li>
            <li> IT  MADE A PERFECT GIFT FOR MY COLLEGE SON..  ARRIVED QUICKLY AND IN PERFECT CONDITION  My son says that it works great and is easily used</li>
            <li> Good lord, what is with these people entering reviews that the MANGROOMER Do-It-Yourself Electric Back Hair Shaver couldn&#x27;t groom their hairs?  Did you insert fresh batteries?  The MANGROOMER  becomes a whirling dervish, unleashing ruin and devastation in its path.  \\&quot;You&#x27;ve ruined your own lands, you&#x27;ll not ruin mine!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being of fair skin, I have a rather decent amount of moles.  I would say, hmm, perhaps 3 or 4 exceeding one millimeter on my back.  I used to have some on my face as well, but those were swiftly frozen off after entering puberty when they became a hazard during my bi-weekly shaving ritual.  In addition to the 3 or 4 I mentioned earlier, I also have a decent amount of \\&quot;flat\\&quot; moles (a few freckles here and there as well) on my back &amp; shoulders.  Now, the upraised moles and the flat moles, some of them have this annoying tendency to sprout hairs.  You see, I don&#x27;t have any hair on my back, except, err, the little downy white hairs.  Unless, that is, it happens to be the progeny of one of the said moles, in which case it is a striking &#x27;midnight black&#x27; color, coarse, and quite visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike certain World Series of Poker players, I don&#x27;t cherish these mole hairs.  You certainly wouldn&#x27;t see my faintly tanned, extremely white self on national TV with a 3 inch black hair growing out of a rather unfortunately located facial mole (as was the case with the aforementioned professional gambler -- perhaps a means to distract his opponents?).  However, these moles on my back do sprout such hairs and while my back is otherwise hairless, these clusters of black hairs become a subject of amusement which, sadly, lends fuel to my anxiety whilst cavorting amongst my colleagues, relaxing in a sauna, streaking naked across various sporting events, or what have you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first saw the MANGROOMER, I thought I had found my Eden.. a salvation.. a weighty burden to finally be lifted off of my shoulders.  Ah, such a finely crafted instrument.It certainly would take a man of great intelligence to design such a device -- let alone to produce it in such a fashion....  sturdy, robust, yet maintaining a sleek metallic look, all despite the cheap plastic and manufacturing methods used in its design.  These most certainly involved massive cost cutting in the materials, production, and wages of the (skilled) employees, all to make it affordable to the likes of people like myself.  For this, I must applaud MANGROOMER, as they certainly have achieved that goal with the MANGROOMER Do-It-Yourself Electric Back Hair Shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, moving on to my personal experience with the MANGROOMER Do-It-Yourself Electric Back Hair Shaver.  I put in some batteries, turned it on, placed it on my back and felt excruciating pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.... but, of course, the story doesn&#x27;t end there.  Despite this, I endeavored to continue with my MANGROOMING.  After perhaps 30 seconds of debilitating pain, I broke into a cold sweat.... this MANGROOMING was going to be quite an effort, for certain.  Luckily, shortly thereafter I noticed that this wasn&#x27;t a cold sweat at all, it was just a copious amount of blood flowing down my ravaged back, presumably from the mole I had forgotten about and had, well, MANGROOMED, I suppose you could say.  This mole... removed... just for the cost of the MANGROOMER Do-It-Yourself Electric Back Hair Shaver which happens to be much cheaper than a dermatologist if one&#x27;s insurance fails to cover said removal.  You could possibly even say the MANGROOMER Do-It-Yourself Electric Back Hair Shaver saved me ~$100, as many of these upraised moles were removed at a later date at a cost much higher than the $20 that I paid for the MANGROOMER Do-It-Yourself Electric Back Hair Shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why two stars?  Well, not just because it saved me a hundred or two from getting moles sliced or frozen off, but it also just so happens that the MANGROOMER Do-It-Yourself Electric Back Hair Shaver is much more convenient &amp;kinder on the skin than a razor as an &#x27;inbetween&#x27; haircut tool, to trim off encroaching mullet hairs on the back of one&#x27;s neck; it also proved useful on sideburns.... and, dare I say, when my batteries were near dead and the MANGROOMER Do-It-Yourself Electric Back Hair Shaver was struggling to draw enough power to continue to MANGROOM, I actually *did* find that it was good for removing a few stray back (&amp; back of shoulder) hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, after the batteries were replaced, the MANGROOMER Do-It-Yourself Electric Back Hair Shaver once again became a weapon of mass destruction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short:  If you just have some stray hairs on your back, avoid this.  If you have upraised moles on your back, don&#x27;t place blind faith in your ability to maneuver the MANGROOMER Do-It-Yourself Electric Back Hair Shaver.  It takes hours, if not days, of training with this instrument in order to learn how to handle it and to become a MANGROOMING professional.  On the plus side, if you do happen to have fair skin and a mole here or there, you could save a few hundred bucks and just MANGROOM it off, instead of going to see a dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, your back will resemble that of someone that just had a rly, rly bad nightmare about Freddy Krueger.</li>
            <li> Good idea... poor execution</li>
            <li> I got this as a partial sincere, partial gag-gift for my younger brother for Christmas. It took him forever to try it out, but he said it works. I was skeptical for a while, worried that it&#x27;d be too good to be true, but I&#x27;m very relieved that it works. Thank goodness.:)</li>
            <li> It does good. Does tend to wear out after couple months. It is Better to before hair gets too long</li>
            <li> OMG I wish I would of seen this years ago.. always struggled with unsightly back hair and this thing is amazing and easy to use to remove it.  I can actually take my shirt off in a public setting and not worry about my furry back!  Love it!</li>
            <li> I have been using my shaver and razor to get my back hair cut...I got pretty good at it, but i was getting tired of the process of doing this for my back...Then i saw this online, checked and saw if Amazon carried it and bought it...Just used this product for the first time and WOW what a product...Guys if your like me and don&#x27;t want to wax or go get laser treatments to remove your back hair, this is without a doubt the product for you...Don&#x27;t wait like i did and ladies tired of shaving your man&#x27;s back then get him this for Christmas or get it for him now!</li>
            <li> This unit works as it should but it is not easy to use and you must be careful of the angle of the trimmer head.  It is time consuming and does not make a clean pass so multiple passes are needed over the entire skin surface to get a reasonable result.  I have used it multiple times since purchase and wish there was a better reasonably priced alternative but this is satisfactory and gets the job done solo.  Update: Keeping the hair shorter lets the unit work much better.  After getting the hang of using the shaver it works awesome.  Buying another as the price has come down and after six years I figure I might as well go ahead and get another.  The original is going strong but can&#x27;t last forever.</li>
            <li> It actually worked well, for the first three or four uses, but then the blades seem to develop rounded edges. They should rename it:  \\&quot;DISPOSABLE MANGROOMER\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Yes this is my 2nd.  one cause the first died after about 4 months. It was the cordless one. In the listing it say electric, i thought that it plugged into the wall, No it uses two AA batteries!! But they do work Great!!</li>
            <li> I have wanted to get one of these since I first heard about it years ago. I&#x27;m glad I did, it&#x27;s easy to operate and works well. Just go slow and follow the directions and it will work for you too. I&#x27;m not sure how long the batteries last since I haven&#x27;t had it that long.</li>
            <li> The item was delivered extremely quick. My friend asked me to order it for her boyfiend. He loved it so he asked me to order one for his buddy. They are both very happy.</li>
            <li> If you are a man looking to get hair off of your body, particularly your back, this is superb product to help keep you groom. Women do not like hairy backs. Take a hint guys.</li>
            <li> This product is a great idea in concept. I know how difficult it can be to reach certain places on your back if you&#x27;ve got hair that you like to keep well groomed. I purchased this thinking it would make life much easier when it came to maintaining my back hair. Unfortunately, using this product did not go as well as I&#x27;d hoped....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read many of the reviews before purchasing the Mangroomer and many of them mentioned that it will feel a little painful the first time you use it because you&#x27;re not used to how it makes contact with your skin. I was expecting pain, and while it was a little uncomfortable, it wasn&#x27;t anything too ridiculous and I was able to dispose of the unwanted hair on my back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time I used it, however, was a completely different story. Not only was it causing me way more pain than before, it wasn&#x27;t even cutting any of the hair! I tried for 15 minutes to align the cutting edge with my skin just right so that it would do its job to no avail. It felt more like it was scraping against skin and trying to pull the hairs from their roots rather than cutting them. I even tried oiling the blades before deciding on this review, thinking maybe they had dried out like many other clippers I have used. No improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that this item was battery powered also played a role. It seemed like the cutting edge couldn&#x27;t vibrate fast enough to actually cut the hair and was pulling it instead. Any set of clippers I&#x27;ve used in the past has had an AC adapter with it. After using this battery powered one, I will definitely make certain any future purchases come with that adapter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be wary of purchasing this item.</li>
            <li> gets the job done and it shaves close enough to make it appear as if you have no back hair, even though there will be some stubble left over. my only beef is that the razor head is very weak. my back isn&#x27;t even THAT hairy and the razor will often times get stopped up by the hair. it gets the job done though. worth the money.</li>
            <li> Not much else to say.  Relatively simple piece of technology, doesn&#x27;t cut you and makes life a lot less acrobatic</li>
            <li> This item exceeded my expections . I would definately suggest to anyone considering this item to buy it . I should of bought one years ago</li>
            <li> A man beast.  I grow hair in places you wouldn&#x27;t believe.  Worst part is that I&#x27;m Asian...100% Asian.  Ever seen a hairy Asian?  THAT&#x27;S RIGHT YOU HAVEN&#x27;T.  And well, not only am I hairy, I&#x27;d put Sashquatch to shame.  It&#x27;s sad really....but anyway, this here Mangroomer has allowed me to return back to my pre-pubescent hairless Asian ways.  Except for the genitalia region.  That&#x27;s still full bush mode.  Why do we Asians only grow massive amounts of hair there?  It&#x27;s genetic discrimination if you ask me.</li>
            <li> So I bought this a few days ago and when it arived I was excited to try it out. When I opened the box I felt let down, I was expecting something well put together but it felt  very flimsy. So I placed the batteries in and gave it a shot and to my freaking surprise it worked pretty freaking well. It took a few more passes to get it all off but it did the job. Worth the $25 bucks I spent. I would have given it 5 stars but I thought it could be more solid. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> The good news is that the design of this product enables it to reach every inch of your back - if your a contortionist like that guy Turk on America&#x27;s Got Talent! The bad news is that it has the clipping power of an amoeba on valium. What they don&#x27;t tell you is that it is powered by two AA bateries. A gentle summer breeze has more effect on my back hair than this wimpy clipper. And I&#x27;m no Neanderthal, either. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this farce of a clipper. I just wish that someone had written this review for me to read before I bought it.</li>
            <li> This product is not hype, it works. Trims hair close but doesn&#x27;t give you razor bumps or make you itch. Works with regular batteries and reaches every which way. This is my second one because my first one was stolen! Someone must of had a hairy back! Now your wife or gf won&#x27;t have to trim your back. For what it&#x27;s worth, I am not super hairy, I would say you would need an initial cut with a beefier trimmer before using this for maintenance.</li>
            <li> If you buy the ManGroomer, brace yourself. Doing the job will take a LONG time, and it&#x27;s gonna hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you look at the pictures, notice that the clipper head is nearly perpendicular to the shaft of the device. Holding it as intended (or any other way you can think of) corrects this, so that the blades are exactly perpendicular to your skin. So the cutters don&#x27;t cut the hair, they cut your skin, and PULL the hairs. I tried this for a painful half-hour or so before my man pride would finally (and every bit as hairy I was at the start) allow me to admit that I had missed this fatal flaw before buying the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reviewers who reported the ManGroomer effective either failed to mention they had help, or were lying about using it alone. The only way to get the cutter to do anything to the hair but annoy it is to stand two feet behind yourself, ignore the extensible handle, and hold the main body at a shallow angle to the skin so that the head is almost parallel to the surface, as you would a clipper used on a beard, sideburns, or a dog. Just for fun, I tried this on part of my chest, and it worked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just in case you&#x27;re wondering, the angled handle will not let you circumvent this problem. The number of angles is limited, the one you need is not one of the possibilities, and the arms don&#x27;t lock in place anyway, so even if you come close, it just falls down. Oh and, by the way, they don&#x27;t tell you (some reviewers did), but this is not an \\&quot;electric\\&quot; device. It takes AA batteries, so if for some bizarre reason you wanted one, this would be the better buy over the costlier rechargeable version.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have bought multiple over the years</li>
            <li> Most of you may think that having a forest of bushy hair that goes from hole to head is an incurable disease. For those of you that believe this let me tell the tale of \\&quot;Pappy\\&quot;. This tale begins innocently enough when a young man hit puberty a time most young men receive a gift of a little bit of additional hair at this tender age, but not Pappy. Pappy got hair in every imaginable place as he grew older. First the normal places, then it extended to his chest in inhumanly possible amounts and then it started to get worse, his eye brows became one. It was like the \\&quot;Lord of the rings\\&quot; there could be only one brow for Pappy, but alas that was just the beginning. It was about this time that Pappy was starting to gain weight, very normal for a young man of his age, but for Pappy it was much different. He was gaining 2-3 pounds a week, not from muscle or a growth spurt (Pappy stopped growing around the 4th grade), but because the amount of hair on his back was multiplying faster then rabbits. Soon Pappy could not go to beach anymore without fear of embarrassment. To back hair Pappy would soon become like Michael Jordon is to basketball, in fact people in college called him \\&quot;Hair Jordon\\&quot;. This \\&quot;disease\\&quot; caused Pappy to become withdrawn and it caused him some long term damage that years of therapy have still not fixed, you ask how bad could this damage be? He still roots for the Cowboys and Dodgers. If that is not a horrible disease I do not know what is. Anyhow on to how this product saved this young mans life. He was becoming more and more withdrawn, until one his friends recommended this product. Now Pappy was familiar with commercial versions used in barber shops and they could do little to the forest of back hair he had. He would have to buy a new set about once a month because the hair on his back would wear the motor out. On a normal grooming session to get Pappy to beach his friends would need to spend hours helping him. That is why this product is such a revelation.You think that extended handle doesn&#x27;t do anything, well friends it gave Pappy his life back. He now could groom his back on his own with the help of a large mirror and several industrial sized trash bags. This thing breezes through back hair like a knife through butter. Of course in this case it would be a one hell of a lot of butter. Having this has transformed Pappy, he is back to being the life of the party. This thing is a miracle device it has given us our friend back (well except for the Cowboy and Dodger thing). He even owns a pair of watercraft now. The only disadvantage I can see of this device is that he will be more likely to get skin cancer because his back hair no longer protects him. We have asked the company to make Pappy one of their sponsored athletes, because the product is that good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about two years, and it works really well.  It takes some time to do it well -- it&#x27;s tough to see back there!  But since getting the knack of using it, the results have been more than satisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also runs a very long time on a set of alkaline batteries.  I would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> got it how it was described.. works great easy to operate easy to clean quality is awesome a a a</li>
            <li> Greattt product!Will purchase again and highly recommend!!Cuts smooth without any problems.If you use good quality batteries you&#x27;ll see it perform flawless!!</li>
            <li> Great for those hard to reach areas.. aka the lower middle back...</li>
            <li> He has a hairy back. It&#x27;s gross so I got him this. He is now less hairy and slightly less gross</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second mangroomer in about 4 years. I have disgustingly thick back, shoulder, and upper arm hair (everywhere really). This product is good at getting through the thick hair, but I generally have to follow up with a razor to remove stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product feels cheap, but it works well enough for the money. The motor starts to go after a couple years - I have to smack the head to get it started sometimes. I wish there was a higher quality product, but I also appreciate the weight (light) since it does take a while to clean up my back.</li>
            <li> It is a very modest &amp;#34;trimmer&amp;#34; that&#x27;s not super powerful.  It does the job tho, that is a fact.  Kinda loud but it can reach everywhere.</li>
            <li> wow,no more painful back waxing,i been working out for the past 5 years and i always want my back to look hairless and smooth,in 15 min you can the best clean back and best part u do it by your self pain free.</li>
            <li> the cheaper FYI shaver had a better blade, but they don&#x27;t make them anymore.  If this item had that blade, it would be a 5.  Still, it&#x27;s adequate.</li>
            <li> To be honest, if you have a standard trimmer and a girlfriend, just ask her to help you. This doesn&#x27;t work very well and it sometimes pulls at the hair more than it trims it. That can be painful and that&#x27;s when it actually works. It also had a very flimsy feel overall.</li>
            <li> I like the product and the easy ordering process and impressed by the quick delivery time. The product itself is easy to use and effectivebut it would be even better if the blades would trim easier. It seems they could be sharper.</li>
            <li> Lightweight and easy to use, not a shaver but a good trimmer. Would buy again if the need arises. Thanks</li>
            <li> We ordered this about a month ago to replace a 4 year old identical product that worked like a charm. Went to use it for the first time last weekend and it won&#x27;t turn on! The window to return or replace it has apparently passed. We are very disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> Arrived with a chip in the plastic next to the power switch right out of the box which I was initially concerned about but decided it wasn&#x27;t that much of a problem. Now the thing does not work unless you hit it a few times and hold it just the right way and even then it is very prone to starting and stopping. I would recommend this product to my worst enemy. Spend the extra bucks and make sure you get a quality groomer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: Mangroomer sent me a new shaver at no extra charge and it arrived within a couple days which was nice, I still cannot comment on the durability of the product seeing as I&#x27;ve only had the second shaver for a few minutes but the customer service of this company is superb and that matters more to me than their products, I would not hesitate to buy from Mangroomer again.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.  The handle works great to reach areas, the shaver itself is complete garbage. Constantly getting snagged and choked up on even the thinnest and lightest of hair.  Completely useless, I would like a refund.</li>
            <li> This really does the job. Excellent reach, you won&#x27;t miss a square inch. This is exactly what you need to buy if you want to shave your back.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s back shaving time...Men do yourself a favor stop asking your girl to shave your back. This is a must have for dudes whose hair has left their heads and graduated to their backs. Life just keeps giving up one extra gift after another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works. You don&#x27;t have to be Gumby. Fully functional and effective. Takes batteries so no cords get in the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m the proud owner of a hairless back thanks to my mangroomer!</li>
            <li> This has really helped me out a ton. I have coarse hair and this takes it all off my back. I do notice that it only cuts good when pushing, or in the forward motion, not pulling backward. So I go with it and the whole shave takes a small fraction of what it used to take with a standard clipper. Batteries last very good. After a few months I&#x27;m still on the original set I put in which are the newest high-power ones that Duracell makes.</li>
            <li> Works for my brother not  me</li>
            <li> The product is a good idea, just needs to be improved. This particular product is useless. Does not work as intended. Doesnt work at all pretty much. I would like to see this company improve the shaver part by upgrading its cutting ability. I would also like to see a internal battery rather than the throw aways, I wouldnt mind spending extra money for a better product.</li>
            <li> Does the job, easy to use.  I have used it several times now and found that it works as advertised.  As a bonus, it comes with an extendable, slide out handle which I didn&#x27;t expect.</li>
            <li> the handle feels flimsy as if it may break off, but it gets the job done. shaver doesnt pull or snag.</li>
            <li> overall a good product, the trimmers work great for me. I dont have a ton of back hair, bit it is noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;my hair is dark and straight, not thick and curly, which some reviewers said it didnt work for.&lt;br /&gt;4-stars because it would be cool if it had a full range of movement on the arm, it doesnt go to a straight 180&#x27; (which would be a straight line)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used four of these over the past six years, replacing them as they wear out (they start pulling hair rather than cutting).  They used to last about one year on average.  My last one wore out after three months.  Its replacement has stopped cutting and started pulling hair after three weeks.  The quality isn&#x27;t there anymore, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Really tried to like it, but didn&#x27;t work like I had hoped. Didn&#x27;t remove hair in a very consistent manner and caused irritation. DId not use but 3-4 times and threw away.</li>
            <li> Main problem - the blade design is horrible. The teeth are not sharp and I have to pass it over an area a dozen times to see a noticeable result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition it is made of the cheapest plastic I have ever seen; I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to survive a fall of the counter onto a tile floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worst of all, Amazon doesn&#x27;t let you return it. Waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will add pictures.</li>
            <li> i like the ergonomics of this product and the reach but the shaving head pulls at my hair rather than cutting.  Ouch.</li>
            <li> I only gave it one star because you can&#x27;t give it a zero. My husband opened the box and went thru the intructions, put in batteries and started shaving. It worked well for about five minutes and it stopped cutting. He tried cleaning it several times but it didn&#x27;t help. I also tried to return it and it is marked unreturnable. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM!!!</li>
            <li> I got my MANGROOMER yesterday, put in 2 AA batteries, hopped into the bathtub so that hair cleanup would be easy, and proceeded to groom my back. 5 minutes later, the job was done very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many things over the years to address my hairy back. Self shaving was impossible, waxing was very painful and lasted less than a month, and laser removal was even more painful with limited success. I had 6 treatments which cost over $1500. The sessions were brutal: I can still remember the smell of burning flesh. The big problems were that laser will not work on gray, white or blonde hair and, no matter what they say, it hurts like hell. The good news was about half of my hair was effectively, permanently removed so what&#x27;s left  is no longer very thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this situation, the MANGROOMER works real well. After using it, there is visually no hair and the skin is pretty smooth. I&#x27;ll probably need to repeat every week or so. Reaching every spot was easy and I gathered the shaved hair from the bottom of the tub so the drain won&#x27;t clog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m totally satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as an xmas present well before xmas.  Xmas came, my bro was so excited to use this and it never worked.  At all.  And this is my 2nd time with this product failing.  I guess others have better success, but i&#x27;m not supporting this lame product again.  sorry</li>
            <li> It just works, simple, a genuis invention, it took me all of five minutes to go from hairy to smooth, amazing, I almost can&#x27;t wait for it to grow back to use it again... almost.</li>
            <li> This thing works pretty well. It is very useful if you are not a contortionist and have an annoying patch of hair on your back. It unfortunately seems like its not really made too well, but what do you expect for $25?</li>
            <li> Great!!!, excelent!!, 100%</li>
            <li> Works great, AND you kind of get your own back scratching that is better than those bamboo back scratching sticks ... point being, it is fun to use.  Gives a quick clean up once every week or two.  You&#x27;ll need two mirrors though.</li>
            <li> Breaks after 6m to a year at the elbow. This is my second one. You won&#x27;t get more than a year. They need to reinforce the joint section.</li>
            <li> I really needed this!!!! So glad I came across it online. No more back hair for me :)</li>
            <li> Worked great for about six months. The head is weak now it won&#x27;t stay together</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re manly, you&#x27;re probably hairy.  If you&#x27;re of European decent, the chances of this are even greater.  Been using this for several years now and women will love you for it.  A well groomed body is just more appealing.  I&#x27;m sure the same probably holds true if your significant other is of the same sex ;-)</li>
            <li> Really good, Batteries last a long time.</li>
            <li> These things suck.  Super tacky feel.  Crappy plastic. Doesnt telescope very nicely at all. Doesnt shave well. The shaving head rusted completely within about 6 months.  Only got to use it about 4 times.  Dont get one. Its a piece of s***.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to shave my back with ease.  Very easy to use and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it.</li>
            <li> I just got this thing out of the package and thought I would give it a try. My back is still stinging. At first I thought I just had the angel wrong, but I tried to cut the hair on my arm for a test, and same thing it just crabs and pulls the hair, and then it only cut in sporadic patches. This thing is junk!</li>
            <li> The product itself is a bit cheap feeling but it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received the first one it did not turn so I contacted customer service by email and they were fast and friendly.  They were able to replace it with no issue after i sent them some pictures of the current one. They also sent a free gift for my trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really impressed with it and I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> For any dude with hair in hard to reach places this is a must have. These last for years, give a nice close shave, and are by far the best option I have found.</li>
            <li> If you hate looking in the mirror in the morning because you feel like Sasquatch is looking back at you, and you have more hair on your back than on your head, this is the device you need; especially if you are in-between &amp;#34;significant others&amp;#34; and there is no one available to use a razor on your back.  It will not shave you as cleanly as a razor with foam but it will do a very respectable job.  It uses 2 AA batteries and is very light weight.  The foldable handle and extension allow you to reach every area of your back - though it takes a bit of practice to figure out the best angle to approach different areas of your back from.  I found that slow and easy, and with a very light pressure works best.  Move the shaver back and forth very slowly over the same area and virtually all the unsightly hair is caught in only two passes.  You will see some red marks on your back after the first couple uses, but they will vanish in 15 minutes.  I have had no experience with the Mangroomer pulling or gouging.  It&#x27;s very smooth.  The trimming is much finer and better than the trimming I get from the trimmer on my Braun foil head shaver which cost over $200.  One caution I would offer: while this works great on one&#x27;s back and could be used to do some manscaping for clean, sharp lines down below, I would never use this on sensitive areas with loose skin, if you get my drift.  I think the  chances of pulls or nips from the cutting head are just too likely.  Stick to the Gillette or Schick multi-blade and foam for that area!  But for the stated purpose, this is an indispensable grooming device to get rid of unwanted body hair.</li>
            <li> Does a great job and is easy to use.  Don&#x27;t expect a BBS shave it is just like using trimmers.</li>
            <li> Great product. Does the job well. Very happy with my purchase. Recommend it to all as a must have for your grooming needs.</li>
            <li> I just used it for the first time today.  It tore my back up pretty good because I couldn&#x27;t get the right angles, but it got the job done.  Nothing really special about it, but I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product....works very good as advertised. I would definitely recommend this product</li>
            <li> This is great for me to use on my legs because I can&#x27;t bend down far enough to shave anymore.</li>
            <li> This product was definitely worth the money. Now i can get rid of embaressing back hair by myself with no hassle. Totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I had given this to lmy son-in-law a few years ago and he loved it.  I actually gave it as a &amp;#34;gag gift&amp;#34; and found out that he really thought it a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I had razor burn all over my back.  When I I went to gym my back was on fire from sweat. Not recommend for a back shaver.</li>
            <li> I NEVER EVER HAVE TO SHAVE HIS BACK AGAIN!!! Which I am so beyond thankful for cause EW, hairy back man is NASTY... Thank gawd for this product cause that would end up SO bad... DIVORCE bad...</li>
            <li> Works pretty good. Very easy to use on the areas needed.</li>
            <li> It does what it should, but it eats through batteries. Other than that, really great product!</li>
            <li> I bought this and the nose hair trimmer for my husband and he still says these were the best gifts I ever gave him!</li>
            <li> Received the product in a timely fashion, but took a lot just to get it to operate.  Once it was operational, the clippers didn&#x27;t do anything but vibrate.  Did not shave anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon did not allow for return either even within 30 days.</li>
            <li> This product has been advertised on t.v.  It really works, allowing a person to reach the areas that are almost impossible to reach.</li>
            <li> Works perfect!  Cuts perfectly works perfectly--DOES NOT HURT...some reviews said that, but  no issues at all.  I find the product very easy to use.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product!! He uses it to shave his head, chest hair and back hair.  Clean and close shave.</li>
            <li> This groomer is fantastic. I cuts really close and is easy to manuever. The shipping was fast, and I would recommend this product to all that want an easy way to remove unwanted back hair!</li>
            <li> It works well if you need to shave off unwanted hair and you don&#x27;t have anyone to help you reach those areas.</li>
            <li> It does a good job. Reaches most places with ease because of the extending handle and it also cuts well!</li>
            <li> This product works very much good . Before I use it there is hair , and I only get date with picture of girl in magazine . After I use it there is no hair , and I get date with Svetlana Gorbuchinski who works at magazine stand .</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I&#x27;ve been growing some fine but very noticeable hair on my back. I&#x27;m 6&#x27;2&amp;#34; so that&#x27;s a lot of real estate back there for hair to grow on. This is a good, easy, painless way to get rid of that hair. I&#x27;ve tried waxing before, but it was expensive, painful, and for the amount and thinness of hair that I have, probably not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Mangroomer is powerful enough to cut right through without snagging, pulling, or cutting. In the beginning, I got scratched up a good bit trying to use it, but that&#x27;s because it takes some getting used to the awkwardness of directing this long, telescoping machine up and down your back, especially if you&#x27;re using a mirror for guidance, which throws off your sense of forward/backward/left/right a little. Otherwise, no major cuts or nicks, no bleeding, so it&#x27;s a relatively safe item. It&#x27;s also not very loud and the battery life is pretty good. It also folds up neatly so you can put it away. It&#x27;s a pretty close shave and when I look at my back in the mirror afterwards, I can&#x27;t even see any noticeable stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could foresee that maybe it wouldn&#x27;t cut so well through very thick back hair and might even leave the appearance and feel of stubble/shadow. But that&#x27;s just an assumption. Give it a try for yourself.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by how tough and effective this gadget was. I had seen one at an overstock store several years ago and I thought it was a novel idea for someone with back hair (I didn&#x27;t have any at the time.) Now that I do, I&#x27;m very insecure about it, and would have my girlfriend use a beard trimmer to clean up my back before a day at the pool or beach. Now that I&#x27;m single, I needed to find a way to do it myself. Somewhat expensive, but very useful. I was originally disapointed when I opened the package because of how lightweight and cheap it felt, but when I loaded the batteries and fired it up, I was amazed at how well it cut hair, how fast the blades moved, and how easy it was to use. The extending and bending arm is a big help. I can reach everywhere I need to, and my back doesn&#x27;t feel irritated or inflamed after using. The blades are set up in a way that will not harm you, unlike many trimmers not specifically designed for this purpose. I have used it a few times now, and greatly appreciate it.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, if you need your back scratched, you can use it without turning it on, and it works great.</li>
            <li> recommend it highly. works great, easy to use and does a great job reaching those hard to reach places. buy it.</li>
            <li> i received this today, put the batteries in and used the product. it sucked!!!! does not trim/shave/or even rip hairs out as advertised. if i could return it i would but its a personal hygene product so i cant. matter of fact id ask for twice my money back for wasting my time. i can not express my disappointment enough.</li>
            <li> be careful of the blade… That is the most flimsy piece of plastic and can break</li>
            <li> Since I live on a tropical island i go to the beach a lot.  Like a lot of men I have a lot of body hair.  No one wants to see that!  I use this product about once a month to keep the back hair away.</li>
            <li> This device helps to remove unwanted hair from hard to reach places by yourself. So now I can remove my shirt and not be embarrassed.</li>
            <li> Great back shaver!! A mush have for the guy with a hairy back! Never have to ask my wife to shave my back again. Really works well!</li>
            <li> Product does what it says it would do albeit awkward to use but would be fine after using it a few times.  Unfortunately...it wouldn&#x27;t even start up the 2nd time I tried to use it.  Changed and tried multiple sets of other batteries...dead.  Tried to return but apparently, this product has a no return policy...so I was screwed.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty much just garbage</li>
            <li> My wife asked me what I wanted for Father&#x27;s Day, I half jokingly said a back groomer with an extendable handle. This has certainly met my expectations. The handle extends to allow me to literally get every inch of my back. My shoulder mobility is about the only limitation there is for it! I will say that it does not get you perfectly smooth, and that&#x27;s understandable considering that it&#x27;s not a straight razor. For the packaging and all I would have expected a cleaning brush or something, and was kind of disappointed to see that it didn&#x27;t come with one. After the first use it is obvious that it doesn&#x27;t need one; blow off the blades and rock and roll. The compact design is nice, but it is certainly bigger than my shaving bag. I use it bi-weekly and it&#x27;s holding up fine. Due to not needing it often, I expect my 2 AAs to last for quite a while.</li>
            <li> The on/off button is not very good. Often I just pull the batteries because I can&#x27;t get it to turn off. This happened just the second time I used it and has been this way ever since. It does trim nicely.</li>
            <li> This product exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> This is the less expensive model, but works very well, especially for the price. The unit is very simple, but sturdy, and should meet your needs.</li>
            <li> Works great for one month, then quits working right after the Amazon return policy expires. I purchased a second shaver with the same results. Not recommended.</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome. If you know a guy with a hairy back and you want it to not be hairy, then this is the perfect gift/tool.</li>
            <li> PRO: Makes the entire process quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: Flimsy, and seems poorly made. (Mine actually came shipped with a small crack, do to this the blade didn&#x27;t even move. I had to open it up and fasten the small motor so it would make contact with the plastic connector for the blade.) It sometimes scratches your back when you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean you can&#x27;t expect much for something this cheap but for the money it works, just invest in some rechargeable batteries.</li>
            <li> item works as ecpected.  Very sharp and does leave marks on your body/back that take a few days to go away.  I would recommend this product,</li>
            <li> I use this often, only for my back. Once every three shaves it requires fresh batteries or it painfully pulls my hair</li>
            <li> just used my new mangroomer.  2ed one ,first one lasted a few years after much use.  this thing is a must if you back hair!!!  super easy .. battery&#x27;s last along time too.  I only hope they keep making this thing..  Thanks MANGROOMER.</li>
            <li> Dulls quickly and painfully rips hair out.</li>
            <li> Works well. Does not cut into skin.  Not as close as I would like, but better than others.</li>
            <li> I always read reviews but rarely write them. This product sort of threw me for a loop because of all the good reviews it got.&lt;br /&gt;Right out of the box it felt very flimsy. Then I was surprised that it ran on two AA batteries which will not stay in place unless you put the battery cap on, and even the battery cap had to be pushed into place a few times before it barely clicked shut. When I finaly went to use it, It lasted  less then 30 seconds and the blades locked onto eachother I took the blades apart, freed them up a few times , samething happens.&lt;br /&gt;When I went to return it I found out that it&#x27;s an item that can&#x27;t be returned, I guess that means I&#x27;m out the $24.97.  I would think that they would tell you that it can&#x27;t be returned before you buy something.</li>
            <li> good information about the shipment is provided and I get the item even faster than what was minted to .</li>
            <li> Well it does allow you to shave your back- but the trimmer does not give you a close shave!  So you get a less hairy back, but it&#x27;s still a hairy back!!</li>
            <li> This is easily the poorest quality item I&#x27;ve ever bought. I would give it zero or negative stars if I could.  It is extremely lightweight to the point of fragility, and feels like it will fall apart in your hand when you take it out of the box. Upon switching it on, I realized that the power switch wasn&#x27;t actually connected to anything inside the unit, but instead just slid freely back and forth. Thus, of course, it would not actually turn on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, in this case the logical thing to do is simply return it for a replacement (if you don&#x27;t object to an item whose construction materials would need a significant upgrade to approach the quality of a cheap Happy Meal toy) or a refund. Unfortunately, this is when you find it that Amazon will not accept this item as a return. A little digging reveals that if the item is damaged you can refer to the refunds policy - which simply refers you back to the returns page, which informs you to look at the refunds policy, which refers you to the returns page...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miserable experience, not worthy of the quality of product nor of service I expect from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have used this twice and it works as advertised if not better.....I like the fact that it takes regular batteries because when built in rechargeables die then its garbage, also seen some posts that said it pulls their hair out, not sure why unless your batteries are weak, I have a older &amp;#34;chic&amp;#34; model, now that yanks the hairs out.....lol  This one is easy to use, I would highly recommend.....</li>
            <li> Broke on first use. Worked poorly for the 45 seconds it did work. Avoid this product at all costs. Enough said!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairy dude. Norse Viking hairy. This electric razor cuts right through it, no fuss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find this product to be far easier to use than my Razorba. It works on hair of any length, can be used out of the shower, and allows me to shave my entire back more quickly and easily than if I were to use the Razorba.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Razorba, however, gives a much closer shave. If having no hair is important to you, I recommend getting both - you&#x27;ll need the Mangroomer to get rid of the bulk of your hair, then the Razorba to shave the rest smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your goal is only to cut down on the number of sasquatch sightings when you go to the beach, this is all you&#x27;ll need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others have mentioned that the quality of build and plastic feel cheap; I disagree. This isn&#x27;t built to be expensive or durable, but mine doesn&#x27;t feel shoddy or fragile. I expect that if I take care of it (and don&#x27;t drop it on the tile floor), it will last at least a few years, which is enough value for what I paid.</li>
            <li> This product is a great idea, but cheaply made.  The quality is no better than you&#x27;d find at a $5 shaver at a flea market.  It left razor burn all over my back because the blade guard is apparently non-existent.  At $25, I expected much more.  I will be returning the item.</li>
            <li> works well, not hard to maneuver with either arm, comfort and quick, The sound is barely audible and results are easily seen close cut each time.</li>
            <li> Great manscaper. Keep in mind it does not give you a shave close cut.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to pull your back hair out at the roots - especially in those tender, hard to reach areas at the small of your back - then this is the product for you. Dull blades from Day 1 will tug and snag every last hair from your back. It&#x27;s like a s***ty bikini wax for your back.</li>
            <li> pros:&lt;br /&gt;- does what it says&lt;br /&gt;- reaches anywhere on my back&lt;br /&gt;- cuts smooth, no raxor burn&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons&lt;br /&gt;- very cheaply made, feels like it will break any day&lt;br /&gt;- the handles rattle when it&#x27;s on</li>
            <li> This shaver feels flimsy like the cheapest child&#x27;s toy.  You will want to set it down carefully and hold it with a gentle grip, lest you inadvertently crack it open by squeezing a little too hard.  But, it does turn on.. it does have a shaver head.. The angle is GREAT for reaching your back.  It feels like it is ripping hair out by the roots, more than cutting them with blades... but if you don&#x27;t mind the pain the hair IS getting removed.  I gave it three stars instead of 2 because it WILL accomplish the goal, and there are very few products that I know of that fill this niche.  if I could I would rate the performance a 3 or 4 and the quality a -1.  I really believe I will accidentally break this soon.</li>
            <li> What a total disappointment this product is. Very cheaply made piece of plastic! I ordered it directly from man groomer and it took 10 days to get here. After useing it just 2 times the thing broke in 2 pieces right where it swivels. Total junk product! Also it uses battery&#x27;s so you can&#x27;t plug it in to recharge. Save your money and buy something else!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more than impressed with this razor. They&#x27;re hard to find in stores so it&#x27;s better to buy it here online. If you&#x27;re planning on shaving your back for the beach, just make sure you shave at least the day before because your back will have scratch marks from the razor. They&#x27;ll go away in a day and best of all your back will have no hair anyway. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this!!</li>
            <li> Buy this only if you want to tear and rip your back apart.  I felt like I had been dragged down the road on my back afetr the first use.  It soon found a new home in my garbage can.  I couldn&#x27;t even fathom putting it in our garage sale and letting some other poor sap go through the same as me.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because unlike what some ppl have said this really does work and does so quite well</li>
            <li> It worked well for one year, and then it broke down completely.  Now it doesn&#x27;t even power up, so I&#x27;ll have to throw it away.</li>
            <li> I got it, used it and love it.  I used it from neck-to-toe with great ease.  One of the best buys I made this year.</li>
            <li> I was given this as a gift, and was very excited...however, it didn&#x27;t work. Tried multiple times to use it, and tested to make sure the blades were functioning...even still, it didn&#x27;t get the job done. I&#x27;m looking for its replacement.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my son.  Easy to use. Makes him feel more confident without his shirt.  Would recommend.  Great Product! Nice!</li>
