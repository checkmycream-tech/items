            <li>I had been using the Burt&#x27;s Bee baby products since my daughter was born and was happy with them for years.  </li>

            <li>and it&#x27;s a great stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li>My kids hair smells good for days.</li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>This shampoo is amazing.</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>It really smells great and does a good</li>
            <li>I wish I could use it more often because it smells lovely!</li>
            <li>(I have very fine, oily roots hair).</li>
            <li>and I love the scent.</li>
            <li>This was a gift for my grand daughter.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is over the top perfumy smelling and does not smell at all like mango, which I had hoped for, or even carrot.  </li>
            <li>It cleans better than Shea butter shampoo, which is why I started using it on my hair and also my son&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is okay</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this shampoo.</li>
            <li>So much fuller and great shine.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is great with a lot of slip (very moisturizing).</li>
            <li>(Btw, scent is very strong for those of you who can&#x27;t handle strong smells)</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s all good!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not HORRIBLE or anything, but strong for my taste.  </li>
            <li>I was able to find this online at Target on sale for eight dollars free shipping.</li>
            <li>; that I could easily use it to detangle both times I&#x27;ve used it.  </li>
            <li>Also, concerning the smell,  yes, the smell is strong (the orange blossom is what you smell)</li>
            <li>That perfume smell is insanely strong still 2 days out and even rinsing it another time.  </li>
            <li>The smell is strong on my hair though and reminds me of some ingredient in hair dye.</li>
            <li>, it has a fairly strong almost perfume like smell that&#x27;s a bit over-powering for my tastes.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this shampoo because it has some of my favorite things in it (carrot oil!</li>
            <li>This shampoo is very moisturizing, and that&#x27;s saying a lot as I have tried many!</li>
            <li>(this is important to me, you can google that on your own)and</li>
            <li>I picked this up cheap at Target, which is why I gave it a try.</li>
            <li>His hair smells just as great the next day.</li>
            <li>on Amazon and with Prime free shipping I&#x27;m golden :)</li>
            <li>My hair looks clean and softer now and my waves aren&#x27;t poofy and frizzy.</li>
            <li>my regular shampoo (Organix BKT shampoo- smells amazing like coconut and more foamy-sudsy)</li>
            <li>But this shampoo makes my hair feel clean and</li>
            <li>And the smell is pretty strong too, like a mens cologne.&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>Product received quickly</li>
            <li>I love this brand and their natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>His hair is so soft and I absolutely love the way it smells.</li>
            <li>this product  might work but not if you use it on a little girl esp on mixed beautiful curls:)</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>So i use the shea moisture head to toe wash on her hair its alot better and actually foams up to leather and rinse.</li>
            <li>the first commenter,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Shea Moisture products since they first hit the shelves.</li>
            <li>And the first ingredient is water.</li>
            <li>Bought this in hopes of taming my girls ong, curly, tangly, dry, yet fine hair and wanting to stay on the more natural side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>b/c it pulls my hair and generally makes the shower take SO much longer, when my curls look just as good if I only wash the scalp.</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the smell is strong and perfume-y.  </li>
            <li>It cleans her hair very well.</li>
            <li>It lathers really well.</li>
            <li>I can use the shampoo alone and combing is generally much easier than it ever had been.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had other favorite products that have been discontinued</li>
            <li>Needed the bottle to still be as full as possible to return without hassles.</li>
            <li>When I first sniffed it in the bottle, it gave me an instant headache, but I figured maybe once it was mixed with water and then rinsed out, it wouldn&#x27;t be so strong.  </li>
            <li>Also, I should note that the shampoo is not tear free, so be aware if using it on little ones.</li>
            <li>so if your&#x27;e going to waste your money/time, you might as well buy from there instead and be able to return it easier.</li>
            <li>This may work better on very coarse hair, or hair that needs the oils to define tight curls, but it is definitely not for fine hair.</li>
            <li>I was so glad to see it on sale (for less!)</li>
            <li>I then rub it between my hands (it does make bubbles) and slip it under the curls and rub it right onto my scalp, and work any extra suds over my curls if they need it</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a natural smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>7 year old loves the smell because she says it smells like Grandma.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My daughter has sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and it leaves her hair soft</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend for the whole family.</li>
            <li>but my daughter loves how it makes her soft and shiney , even with all of the chlorine</li>
            <li>Leaves hair so soft that I don&#x27;t need to use a conditioner on my kids hair</li>
            <li>Just tried this shampoo and conditioner on my 1yr old daughter today.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 5 yr old son.</li>
            <li>I was extremely surprised that it gave my curls</li>
            <li>OH SO soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a mix between a natural smell that you might want to taste and a body spray perfume smell.</li>
            <li>First I tried using just the shampoo, their hair was too dry and tangly.  </li>
            <li>In the past we used Burt&#x27;s Bees and it was fine, but I had to use conditioner</li>
            <li>My Target recently stopped carrying this particular fragrance/product</li>
            <li>hair has gotten progressively more curly in places in recent years and now I have tangles that are hard to deal with.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing, did make my daughters hair a little greasier than normal.  </li>
            <li>Its barely soapy</li>
            <li>Now that my daughter is old enough we ask her to close her eyes as well</li>
            <li>I have long hair and normally just condition the ends.</li>
            <li>This shampoo does not dry our hair out, but provides moisture and also helps melt the tangles.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use much, first of all, but even the little I did use made my hair feel dry/stripped immediately and tangled.</li>
            <li>However, we have found the smell is a little overwhelming (at least on our 20 month old).  </li>
            <li>This method really cuts down on styling time.</li>
            <li>Add to that wanting to use natural products and your choices are limited.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll say in regards to one person&#x27;s comments about the product leaving hair flat and/or sticky, that I&#x27;ve generally found it means the product is not rinsed out well enough.</li>

            <li> I can hardly stand to have my girls heads near me</li>

            <li> and though I have never tried mango butter before this, I really expected to like it)</li>
            <li> We use a washcloth or a closed hand over their eyes before we start to rinse so no soap gets into their eyes.  </li>
            <li> We have to braid her hair wet at night to even have a chance managing it in the morning.</li>
            <li> A little bit seems to go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> However, I found it made her hair seem stronger once washed which I needed because the other baby shampoo I was using was breaking her hair.</li>
            <li> Her hair is not dry, just flyaways, but I gave it a shot because I&#x27;d consider her hair delicate</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t the typical foamy-sudsy</li>
            <li> My daughter has tight ringlet curls that tangle no matter what.</li>
            <li> Its labeled for dry &amp; delicate.</li>
            <li> A little goes a loooong way.</li>
            <li> this is the only shampoo I can use without irritating her scalp....</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money since this is not cheep shampoo.</li>
            <li> This does seem to tame it a bit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what in the shampoo did this to my hair</li>
            <li> Not sure how her hair is responding to it yet.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if both products are to blame or just the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, shampooing has been a big battle because of tangles.</li>
            <li> When i put it in my daughters hair its hard to leather it.</li>
            <li> In fact, I&#x27;m not sure why I haven&#x27;t made the switch already!</li>
            <li> Its hard to brush and is not a good shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seriously considering his shampoo for myself as well.</li>
            <li> it pours out onto your hand but it is still very thick.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like that matching conditioner has unhealthy oil in it</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m addicted.</li>
            <li> This left my daughters hair looking awful.</li>
            <li> The conditioner wasn&#x27;t as silky which was weird.</li>
            <li> or it was Game Over!</li>
            <li> WRONG!  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Works great and I love the scent. My kids hair smells good for days.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this shampoo because it has some of my favorite things in it (carrot oil! and though I have never tried mango butter before this, I really expected to like it) however, that was not the case. You don&#x27;t need to use much, first of all, but even the little I did use made my hair feel dry/stripped immediately and tangled. I&#x27;m not sure what in the shampoo did this to my hair (all shea moisture products have no sulfates  but this one stripped like a sulfate shampoo), but I&#x27;m thinking it may be the lactic acid. It was an ingredient i noticed was in the shampoo but not in the conditioner. Also, concerning the smell,  yes, the smell is strong (the orange blossom is what you smell) but I think it&#x27;s nice. It&#x27;s not a perfume it&#x27;s a natural smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t think I will be purchasing again. Still searching for my perfect shampoo!</li>
            <li> This shampoo works well.  However, we have found the smell is a little overwhelming (at least on our 20 month old).  It sometimes seem that the smell actually grows stronger on the second day.  Also, I should note that the shampoo is not tear free, so be aware if using it on little ones.</li>
            <li> Product received quickly This was a gift for my grand daughter.  Not sure how her hair is responding to it yet.</li>
            <li> It smells great thats about it. Its barely soapy so u have to use a ton of it. When i put it in my daughters hair its hard to leather it. It just feels like gel. So i use the shea moisture head to toe wash on her hair its alot better and actually foams up to leather and rinse. If ur baby has short hair like little boys this product  might work but not if you use it on a little girl esp on mixed beautiful curls:)</li>
            <li> Bought this in hopes of taming my girls ong, curly, tangly, dry, yet fine hair and wanting to stay on the more natural side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did nothing to actually moisturize the hair (only made it greasy) and did not help with tangles.  First I tried using just the shampoo, their hair was too dry and tangly.  So I then tried with the conditioner - still wasn&#x27;t moisturized, was greasy instead, and still tangly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is over the top perfumy smelling and does not smell at all like mango, which I had hoped for, or even carrot.  When I first sniffed it in the bottle, it gave me an instant headache, but I figured maybe once it was mixed with water and then rinsed out, it wouldn&#x27;t be so strong.  WRONG!  That perfume smell is insanely strong still 2 days out and even rinsing it another time.  I can hardly stand to have my girls heads near me right now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 7 year old loves the smell because she says it smells like Grandma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enough said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except that it&#x27;s cheaper at target online so if your&#x27;e going to waste your money/time, you might as well buy from there instead and be able to return it easier.</li>
            <li> My daughter has sensitive skin this is the only shampoo I can use without irritating her scalp....and it leaves her hair soft</li>
            <li> I had been using the Burt&#x27;s Bee baby products since my daughter was born and was happy with them for years.  Now when my daughter was 2-1/2 and my son was 6 months we smelled this at a Target store and decided to give it a shot.  It doesn&#x27;t have the paraben chemicals in it (this is important to me, you can google that on your own)and it smells really good.  After trying it, this is all that we will use on our kids now.  It really smells great and does a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike the first commenter, I have not used the conditioner - maybe that is what the problem was with her child?  Or maybe we just have different opinions.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy a conditioner for a kid anyway until they are in their teens or appear to have a need for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I often see questions on these types of products to see if they burn the kids eyes as well, and I cannot say.  We use a washcloth or a closed hand over their eyes before we start to rinse so no soap gets into their eyes.  Now that my daughter is old enough we ask her to close her eyes as well and we have never had any problems.</li>
            <li> I love this brand and their natural ingredients. The smell is strong on my hair though and reminds me of some ingredient in hair dye. I am Caucasian so I mix this with my Aussie shampoo because if i use it by Itself my roots and scalp are too oily. I follow up using the shea butter conditioner as a leave in. My hair looks clean and softer now and my waves aren&#x27;t poofy and frizzy. This method really cuts down on styling time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Shea Moisture products since they first hit the shelves. I used to use the Shea butter moisture shampoo. It&#x27;s a great shampoo for moisturizing. When the kids shampoo came out, I thought I&#x27;d try it for my daughter. It cleans her hair very well. It cleans better than Shea butter shampoo, which is why I started using it on my hair and also my son&#x27;s hair. This shampoo does not dry our hair out, but provides moisture and also helps melt the tangles. I would definitely recommend for the whole family.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is okay, it has a fairly strong almost perfume like smell that&#x27;s a bit over-powering for my tastes.  Very moisturizing, did make my daughters hair a little greasier than normal.  It will work, but I probably will go back to the Pear MOPS shampoo.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this at Target but had to write a review after throwing the rest of it in the trash.  It left my kids hair unmanageable.  Its hard to brush and is not a good shampoo.  I wanted to like it and kept trying but its in the trash now where it belongs.  I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money since this is not cheep shampoo.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is very moisturizing, and that&#x27;s saying a lot as I have tried many! It lathers really well. A little goes a loooong way. Definitely worth the price. I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> Smell is way too perfumey for me but my daughter loves how it makes her soft and shiney , even with all of the chlorine her hair is exposed to. So despite the smell we are buying again.&lt;br /&gt;Update for us is that I don&#x27;t think this shampoo cleans well enough. I feel like my hair is unwashed the day after I use this.</li>
            <li> I was able to find this online at Target on sale for eight dollars free shipping. This left my daughters hair looking awful. Its labeled for dry &amp; delicate. Her hair is not dry, just flyaways, but I gave it a shot because I&#x27;d consider her hair delicate, she is two. Her hair looked so oily after using this with the conditioner. When I read the ingredients the second &amp; third ingredients are an oil. So no wonder. And the first ingredient is water. This may work better on very coarse hair, or hair that needs the oils to define tight curls, but it is definitely not for fine hair. Even her ringlet curls that she has disappeared from the weight of this product, left her hair stringy looking. And the smell is pretty strong too, like a mens cologne.&lt;br /&gt;Note: I did just copy &amp; paste this review that I wrote from the conditioner. I am not sure if both products are to blame or just the conditioner. But I was not going to wash with just the shampoo to find that out. Needed the bottle to still be as full as possible to return without hassles.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of the smell, but it&#x27;s okay. My daughter has kind of crazy, wavy hair. This does seem to tame it a bit.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this shampoo. Leaves hair so soft that I don&#x27;t need to use a conditioner on my kids hair so only one product and one wash!</li>
            <li> I bought this at target. I use on myself and kids. Love it! Totally change health of my hair. So much fuller and great shine. Don&#x27;t like that matching conditioner has unhealthy oil in it so we just shampoo now. Wish it was organic!</li>
            <li> Just tried this shampoo and conditioner on my 1yr old daughter today. The shampoo is great with a lot of slip (very moisturizing). The conditioner wasn&#x27;t as silky which was weird. However, I found it made her hair seem stronger once washed which I needed because the other baby shampoo I was using was breaking her hair. I will continue to use this as long as it does not cause any irritation or breakage. So far it&#x27;s all good!  I will update y&#x27;all next week to give you an overall review. (Btw, scent is very strong for those of you who can&#x27;t handle strong smells)</li>
            <li> I have long hair and normally just condition the ends. Every once and a while, I like to use this shampoo (on my ends) as a cleanser. I tried it once on my roots but it&#x27;s just too oily for my hair (I have very fine, oily roots hair). I picked this up cheap at Target, which is why I gave it a try. I wish I could use it more often because it smells lovely! When I do use it on my ends, it doesn&#x27;t overly strip my hair (which would leave it dry and brittle if it did). Conditioner also works well on my ends!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 5 yr old son. This shampoo is amazing. His hair is so soft and I absolutely love the way it smells. I only use a small drop and it goes a long way. His hair smells just as great the next day. This is a product I will always hv on hand and it&#x27;s a great stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li> I tried this recently b/c I have a Keratin treatment coming up to soften my 3c curls and I wanted a sulfate-free and sodium chloride-free shampoo (got it from Sally Beauty supply for 8 or 9$).  It isn&#x27;t the typical foamy-sudsy shampoo-- it pours out onto your hand but it is still very thick.  I then rub it between my hands (it does make bubbles) and slip it under the curls and rub it right onto my scalp, and work any extra suds over my curls if they need it (curly hair doesn&#x27;t get oily/dirty except at the scalp).  I was extremely surprised that it gave my curls so such &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; that I could easily use it to detangle both times I&#x27;ve used it.  I detangle with my regular shampoo (Organix BKT shampoo- smells amazing like coconut and more foamy-sudsy) infrequently (1x per week) b/c it pulls my hair and generally makes the shower take SO much longer, when my curls look just as good if I only wash the scalp. But this shampoo makes my hair feel clean and OH SO soft. Even when I&#x27;m out of the shower it looks smoother and happier. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the smell is strong and perfume-y.  It&#x27;s not HORRIBLE or anything, but strong for my taste.  It&#x27;s a mix between a natural smell that you might want to taste and a body spray perfume smell.</li>
            <li> My daughter has tight ringlet curls that tangle no matter what. We have to braid her hair wet at night to even have a chance managing it in the morning. Needless to say, shampooing has been a big battle because of tangles. Add to that wanting to use natural products and your choices are limited. In the past we used Burt&#x27;s Bees and it was fine, but I had to use conditioner or it was Game Over! I found his product at Target and gave it a try. Now, I&#x27;m addicted. I can use the shampoo alone and combing is generally much easier than it ever had been. Adding the conditioner helps, but is not necessary. The smell of this product is DIVINE. I&#x27;ll admit that when I put my girls to bed, I lie there just smelling their hair, and for me it has now become synonymous with my children. My Target recently stopped carrying this particular fragrance/product and I bought every bottle I could. I&#x27;ve had other favorite products that have been discontinued and I shudder to think of that happening with this shampoo. I was so glad to see it on sale (for less!) on Amazon and with Prime free shipping I&#x27;m golden :)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll say in regards to one person&#x27;s comments about the product leaving hair flat and/or sticky, that I&#x27;ve generally found it means the product is not rinsed out well enough. A little bit seems to go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;My hair has gotten progressively more curly in places in recent years and now I have tangles that are hard to deal with. I&#x27;m seriously considering his shampoo for myself as well. In fact, I&#x27;m not sure why I haven&#x27;t made the switch already!</li>
