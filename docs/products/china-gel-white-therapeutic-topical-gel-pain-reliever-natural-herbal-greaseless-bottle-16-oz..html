            <li>the lavendar is the note i pick up most often when he uses it, &amp; when i use it i smell the minty menthol.</li>
            <li>--its is best to use a conditioing and moisturizing cream after it dries or you get dry patchy skin  </li>
            <li>The original works so much better.</li>
            <li>Natural ingredients and pleasant smelling.  </li>
            <li>China Gel has still been very therapeutic because it helped soothe the surrounding muscles that are affected by my nerve damage/pain!!!</li>
            <li>This gel is great for minor arthritis and muscle pain.  </li>
            <li>but if it was only muscle pain, I know China Gel would be even more effective against pain.  </li>
            <li>I love China Gel and can&#x27;t live without it!!</li>
            <li>Someone my husband works with sent me a full jar of this product.</li>
            <li>It works better than most other gels, probably because of the lavender which helps me feel more relaxed.</li>
            <li>This product works very well!!  </li>
            <li>The after effects are worth any discomfort.</li>
            <li>Recently started moving more and am using it on my sore foot - quick relief.</li>
            <li>The white China gel is okay....</li>
            <li>My yoga students love when I apply this to their shoulders and lower back before we begin our practice.</li>
            <li>It is convenient, but I like to use things to the very last drop, if I can, &amp; I presume that I won&#x27;t be able to with a pump.</li>
            <li>I bought a 5 pack sampler from Amazon, so I can give it to anyone I know who suffers from arthritis, because someone who I did not know, was kind enough to send me a jar of this wonderful pain reliever.</li>
            <li>this not only works better than anything I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s chiropractor recommended it because not only is it effective, but also it is all natural and does not have a lot of chemical additives.</li>
            <li>Really relieves pain... first got it through my Chryopractoe</li>
            <li>Hi,  I ordered this because I had used it before, and it really seems to help with my muscle pain.  </li>
            <li>this is the five star ointment/gel/cream that really works..</li>
            <li>Really works for me.  </li>
            <li>Very spa like.</li>
            <li>and the product soaks in very well.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t greasy at all, and doesn&#x27;t smell so much like liniment.</li>
            <li>particular jar is made to accommodate a pump you can purchase separately for it, but my husband just dips his fingers in &amp; doesnt care.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this stuff-</li>
            <li>For a topical application, I like this gel very much.  </li>
            <li>And it really helps relieve some of the pain in my lower back.  </li>
            <li>I have frequent migraines and neck issues and this gets me through.</li>
            <li>Thr beat topical gel fast</li>
            <li>It amazes me how quickly it works and how long the effects last!</li>
            <li>At first the gel has a topical discomfort like topical muscle relaxer.</li>

            <li> Best gel I have used, it was recommended to me and I have given samples to many friends.  This is my second purchase of this item</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product for those of us with muscles or joints that ache.  Have used many products to help with sore joints, but this is by far the best I have used.  I have helped others I know with soreness or aches by letting them try this wonderful product.  I use it (especially on my knees) after a workout.  It amazes me how quickly it works and how long the effects last!</li>
            <li> Hi,  I ordered this because I had used it before, and it really seems to help with my muscle pain.  I received the product in a pump, though.  It is convenient, but I like to use things to the very last drop, if I can, &amp; I presume that I won&#x27;t be able to with a pump.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  Excellent delivery time!  And it really helps relieve some of the pain in my lower back.  My pain is nerve damage but if it was only muscle pain, I know China Gel would be even more effective against pain.  China Gel has still been very therapeutic because it helped soothe the surrounding muscles that are affected by my nerve damage/pain!!!</li>
            <li> For a topical application, I like this gel very much.  It is greaseless and while there is a stronger smell to it when initially applied, it does dissipate after a while and not linger as some others do.  I do feel relief from aches and pains after using this.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best!! Sorry it took me so long to try the free sample I picked up along the way...  Everyone responds differently to stuff, but this is my go to gel when my neck, back, or leg muscles are inflamed....</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive the white gel but got the colored one.</li>
            <li> At first the gel has a topical discomfort like topical muscle relaxer. It has a menthol type smell and cooling sensation. The after effects are worth any discomfort. Apparently this works for deeper pain like hip and joint pain.</li>
            <li> this is the five star ointment/gel/cream that really works..omly one problem --its is best to use a conditioing and moisturizing cream after it dries or you get dry patchy skin  thats the ONLY side effect... A  must buy !!</li>
            <li> I love this!  Really works for me.  Recently started moving more and am using it on my sore foot - quick relief.</li>
            <li> THis product does not eave a greasy residue like Icy Hot. Smells better. Very spa like. Lots of lavender and camphor. I&#x27;ve purchased from Amazon several times. It works wonders or my tension headaches.</li>
            <li> It is great.  It feels like BenGay.</li>
            <li> Great soother after yoga or workouts. Strong smell, but pleasant. Wash your hands well (I wear a thin rubber glove) so you do not accidentally touch your eyes after application.&lt;br /&gt;But we love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I use it each night for relief of my pain as result of spinal stenosis. It works.</li>
            <li> I was in pain all the time and I still am. China gel relieves the pain and gives me instant relief. It is an unbelievable product. Someone my husband works with sent me a full jar of this product. He calls it a miracle product. I probably would not have tried it if he did not send me a jar. It is a miracle product. I am still in pain, but once I apply it, I get instant relief that last for hours. I bought a 5 pack sampler from Amazon, so I can give it to anyone I know who suffers from arthritis, because someone who I did not know, was kind enough to send me a jar of this wonderful pain reliever.</li>
            <li> Love China Gel! I use it for neck adjustments after my yoga classes and the students come more for that than the class!</li>
            <li> We use this in our Yoga studio and my students/members absolutely love it! They ask for it by name and immediately want to use it before a class when they come in. Everyone raves about it and now we would love to sell it in our studio because of its popularity ! the stuff is awesome!</li>
            <li> the  best gel in the work a works like a charm, i use for evrything any pain, next day is gone</li>

            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this stuff-I have frequent migraines and neck issues and this gets me through.</li>

            <li> My husband has been using this for years and he swears by it.  He puts it anywhere he has a sore muscle or joint.  He uses it every time before he goes out and plays golf -- which is 4 times a week!  We have recommended this to friends as well and they now use it all the time too.</li>
            <li> This gel is great for minor arthritis and muscle pain.  Natural ingredients and pleasant smelling.  Mentioned it to my doctor who researched it and was impressed.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this product.</li>
            <li> this not only works better than anything I&#x27;ve used but it smells good!</li>
