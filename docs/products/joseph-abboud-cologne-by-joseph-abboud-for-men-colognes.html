            <li>From Varvatos to Gaultier, from Egyptian and Arabian oils straight from the apothecary..</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon</li>
            <li>I decided on this particular fragrance , I was informed it was no longer available.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon to the the rescue!.&lt;br</li>

            <li> This has always been one of my favorite fragrances, but it became very difficult to find for a while.  </li>
            <li> We were excited to find it on Amazon but have been disappointed in the purchase.  </li>
            <li> It has little of the fragrance of the Joseph Abboud product I&#x27;ve been using for years.  </li>
            <li> Its a heavy spice/lightly wooded scent.</li>
            <li> Second, I&#x27;m not sure why, but the quality of the product itself is poor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not sure how to rate this.  </li>
            <li> In addition, when I&#x27;ve used Abboud products in the past the frangrance lasted at least 24 hours.  </li>
            <li> If the dating game were based on smell...</li>
            <li> and leaves bad smell on your body.</li>
            <li> It smells like some of the ingredients have gone bad.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed with this purchase.  </li>

            <li> I always loved this fragrance for the Fall months especially. It&#x27;s a very woody/spicy scent that reminds me of the Fall. It has a long lasting projection and smells very classy. I don&#x27;t know why this didn&#x27;t catch on more in the 90&#x27;s. It was and is underappreciated.</li>
            <li> Ive always love this scent,very satisfied with purchase,its exactly what I expected,have it on as I\\&quot;m typing.If you like sweet smelling cologne this is the one</li>
            <li> I came across a sampler at a Mens store last month .When I decided on this particular fragrance , I was informed it was no longer available.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon to the the rescue!.&lt;br /&gt;My bottle arrived on time ,full bottle, smelled great. Its a heavy spice/lightly wooded scent. More of a winter fragrance. Apparently it has been around since the 90&#x27;s and I got in on it as it was going out. Theres nothing like it so far that I&#x27;ve tried. ,&lt;br /&gt;Very satistfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> If the dating game were based on smell...this cologne would be outlawed.  Earthy but you don&#x27;t smell like a hippie.  Herby but you don&#x27;t smell like a hippie.  Woodsy but you don&#x27;t smell like a woody hippie.  It&#x27;s the smell of Fall rolled into a bottle with-a pumpkin pie rolled into a hickory fire rolled into a vanilla muffin served by a band of giggling angels.  Over the past 15 years I&#x27;ve had more women, young and old ask me what I was wearing and yes it was because they actually loved the smell.  From Varvatos to Gaultier, from Egyptian and Arabian oils straight from the apothecary..this is the animal that tames them all.  It&#x27;s a shame it&#x27;s not widely distributed anymore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not sure how to rate this.  Three stars just doesn&#x27;t seem fair, but for the bottle we received neither does 4 or 5.  I really do love this fragrance... A  LOT!... just not the exact bottle we received.  My husband used to wear this when you could still find it in several department stores and wow, best ever!  For whatever reason this isn&#x27;t carried by most stores anymore and we actually thought it was no longer produced.  We were excited to find it on Amazon but have been disappointed in the purchase.  It&#x27;s almost like the bottle was old.  It smells ok, but if this was the first bottle I&#x27;d ever smelled there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;d reorder...it&#x27;s just not that great.  I&#x27;ve read recently that it is actually still manufactured so we&#x27;re going to order another bottle from a different seller and hope it&#x27;s what we expect.</li>
            <li> This has always been one of my favorite fragrances, but it became very difficult to find for a while.  I was so glad when I discovered it through Amazon.</li>
            <li> My friend had been looking for this particular fragrane for quite some time.  I told him that if it is anywhere to be found, it would be on Amazon.  It made a great Birthday gift.</li>
            <li> This cologne smell very strong like plastic materials. and leaves bad smell on your body. You can find better smell at the dollar store.</li>
            <li> Love the scent, however, the 1.5 Oz bottle was only 2/3 full</li>
            <li> Disappointed with this purchase.  First, the bottle arrived less than full. Second, I&#x27;m not sure why, but the quality of the product itself is poor.  It has little of the fragrance of the Joseph Abboud product I&#x27;ve been using for years.  In addition, when I&#x27;ve used Abboud products in the past the frangrance lasted at least 24 hours.  This fades within hours.</li>
            <li> I got this product for my fiancee.......he had been looking for it everywhere and couldn&#x27;t find it. He was so happy when I told him I ordered not 1 but 2 bottles for him</li>
            <li> Love this!  Totally unique.</li>
            <li> I love cedar wood note and this cologne has it. Funny the very first time i smelled it i didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Elegant and sophisticated cologne, smooth, cool, not overpowering..  Will definitely buy for other men in my family in the future.</li>
            <li> i was given a tiny sample of this frangrance about 15yrs ago and have always talked about it! When i asked around nobody knew what I was talking about! Thanks to Amazon i finally found it. It is unbelievable, intoxicating, unique! I bought two!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember Joseph Abboud smelling like this!  It smells like some of the ingredients have gone bad.  I thought I would get full bottles, but BOTH of the bottles I received look JUST LIKE THE PICTURE--ONLY 3/4 FULL!  Amazon doesn&#x27;t allow returns on fragrances (they&#x27;re a &amp;#34;hazardous material&amp;#34;, give me a break!), so I&#x27;m stuck with this inferior product.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best smelling men&#x27;s cologne&#x27;s on the market!&lt;br /&gt;It has a rich body and is very attractive to others.</li>
            <li> This has always been a favorite and this purchase was reasonable and shipped quickly. It&#x27;s not a fragance I normally see in stores so having a convenient sourse is great.</li>
            <li> Classic, original, non-mainstreem. This is why I use this fragrance.  This stands out as one of the best, non advertised fragrances.</li>
