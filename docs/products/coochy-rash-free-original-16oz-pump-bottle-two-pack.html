            <li>Even great for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>BEST MONEY EVER SPENT!</li>
            <li>I recommend it to anyone who likes a clean shave. :)</li>
            <li>It lathers up on your skin, stays where you put it, and doesn&#x27;t wash away as easily as others do in the shower.  </li>
            <li>This product is great, I feel super young again</li>
            <li>Great price for two huge bottles, they should last forever!!</li>
            <li>It is stated (on the can) that this Shave Creme is Rash Free.  </li>
            <li>This is so smooth &amp; no irrating anywhere any longer.  </li>
            <li>It is a rash free shave cream.</li>
            <li>Best shaving cream ever for every body part (especially the downstairs sensitive part)!</li>
            <li>Been using this product for about 2 years, tried others but always return to the original.</li>
            <li>Works great for the wife&#x27;s ladybusiness and for my down below regions too!</li>
            <li>This will absolutely give you the closest shave and leave you feeling so smooth.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li>This goes on more like a lotion and is therefore clear when you put it on.  </li>
            <li>Sooo worth it</li>
            <li>I received it very quick and it was a new bottle design.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Much better deal than the local stores</li>
            <li>it is the best no more red underarms etc</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much like lotion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really working well serving the purpose</li>
            <li>I ordered this because it said that it was the original just bigger bottle, but it smell like my dogs flee shampoo.</li>
            <li>It turned out to be the same great product as usual.  </li>
            <li>The first week it was iffy but second week of smoothness and softer new growth makes this worth its cost.</li>
            <li>Skin is left soft and smooth for weeks.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>definatly worth the price and its a larger bottle than you think it is!</li>
            <li>I live by it.</li>
            <li>Really like the two huge bottles, it will last for a very long time!!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find this product locally, but thanks to Amazon I could get it.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin extremely soft too.</li>
            <li>Reminds me of the way an Adult toy store smells.  </li>
            <li>Works well on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Works well makes skin soft after as well.</li>
            <li>This is, by far, the nicest shave cream I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Normally my neck gets pretty sensitive and a little red after shaving, especially if it&#x27;s not after a hot shower.</li>
            <li>Really helps with dry skin in the winter.</li>
            <li>It really does soften up stiff hair and lets the shave go much easier.  </li>
            <li>If you look carefully at the &amp;#34;Ingredients&amp;#34; this product contains much the same as laundry softeners.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little pricey at first, but it lasts forever.  </li>
            <li>One like that I have with the product is it makes a good conditioner for my hair (man with a buzz cut in upper mid-west and cold dry winters).</li>
            <li>It also really softens the hair if you leave it on for a little bit which means that it shaves easier.  </li>
            <li>All in all a decent product, just won&#x27;t buy again solely due to the smell!</li>
            <li>I have really coarse hair and after a few weeks of using seems softer and rash has died down significantly.</li>

            <li> I have really coarse hair and after a few weeks of using seems softer and rash has died down significantly.</li>
            <li> Much more expensive through other sites.</li>
            <li> how long it lasts.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I noticed my skin has not been as dry shaving with this product.</li>
            <li> For those used to using regular shaving cream, a little tip.  </li>
            <li> I use it to shave other areas on my body and never have razor burns, bumps, rash, nothing.</li>
            <li> You will notice the difference between this shaving cream &amp; all other, I promise you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s replaced normal shave cream and Shave Secret for my face/neck as well.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and there is a lot in this bottle!  </li>
            <li> I will NEVER spend another dime on any other shaving product.</li>
            <li> , tried this once and now as long as my blade is sharp, i&#x27;m itch and nasty burn free!!</li>
            <li> Will never go back to those common foam shaving creams sold in all department stores.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical and a bit worried when this arrived and looked different from the last time I got his for my wife.</li>
            <li> I started using it a little over a year and a half ago and was immediately hooked.  </li>
            <li> I have heard of this for a few years, I&#x27;ve always been skeptical but finally gave in.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not made for women of color because our hair is not as thin as others &amp; it takes a lot of effort for this to work!</li>
            <li> I guess, but the smell is hard to get used too.  </li>
            <li> So yes, it is a little expensive but not when you take into consideration</li>
            <li> On the bottle it even says you can use it as a deep conditioner for your hair, which I tried and it wasn&#x27;t half bad!</li>
            <li> but it sucks as a shaving cream!</li>
            <li> Normal shaving creme is terrible for shaving in some areas.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I was skeptical and a bit worried when this arrived and looked different from the last time I got his for my wife. It turned out to be the same great product as usual.  And what a great price!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this product locally, but thanks to Amazon I could get it. Product just as described. Great for shaving or as a conditioner. Thanks!</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s okay...  I guess, but the smell is hard to get used too.  Reminds me of the way an Adult toy store smells.  It also doesn&#x27;t keep you from getting rash/razor burn.  All in all a decent product, just won&#x27;t buy again solely due to the smell!</li>
            <li> I have really coarse hair and after a few weeks of using seems softer and rash has died down significantly. The first week it was iffy but second week of smoothness and softer new growth makes this worth its cost.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!! Works well on my sensitive skin. Minimizes razor bump!! Also smells good in which is also a plus.</li>
            <li> Great value for this product. Much more expensive through other sites. Great product. Really helps with dry skin in the winter.</li>
            <li> I use this lotion and my daughter use it everytime we shave. We never have any rashes anymore. I recommend this poduct to all women of all ages.</li>
            <li> This shave cream works like nothing else for shaving anywhere on the body.  My wife and I both use it all over for any shaving needs.  It really does soften up stiff hair and lets the shave go much easier.  It&#x27;s replaced normal shave cream and Shave Secret for my face/neck as well.  Normally my neck gets pretty sensitive and a little red after shaving, especially if it&#x27;s not after a hot shower. With this I can bear shaving without and it&#x27;s not a problem.  Put this on and rub it in for a minute or two to let it absorb into the hair and you are good to go.  Works great for the wife&#x27;s ladybusiness and for my down below regions too!</li>
            <li> Great price for two huge bottles, they should last forever!! Much better deal than the local stores and you could even give one as a gift.</li>
            <li> Very nice and leaves your skin smooth.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a couple years now.  Works well for both men and women.  One like that I have with the product is it makes a good conditioner for my hair (man with a buzz cut in upper mid-west and cold dry winters).</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a couple of years now. I live by it. I actually have my boyfriend using it for his face now too. Never a bump or burn. Always silky smooth and smells great.</li>
            <li> It is stated (on the can) that this Shave Creme is Rash Free.  IT IS NOT!  After just ONE shave my skin came up in a rash.  If you look carefully at the &amp;#34;Ingredients&amp;#34; this product contains much the same as laundry softeners.  So if your skin is allergic to those (as is mine) then DO NOT BUY this this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff ROCKS!! I&#x27;m a dude and have always had problems with razor burn, tried this once and now as long as my blade is sharp, i&#x27;m itch and nasty burn free!! definatly worth the price and its a larger bottle than you think it is! this will last me forever!</li>
            <li> No razor burn ever.  A nice clean shave. Perfect. Better than any shaving cream for sure.  I buy it again and again.</li>
            <li> The best shave cream!  I have sensitive skin and this is the only cream that does not irritate my skin!</li>
            <li> What a great product...GF loves to use this and I can wait every night to see the end result.....mmmmmmmm nice</li>
            <li> I ordered this because it said that it was the original just bigger bottle, but it smell like my dogs flee shampoo. Works good though.</li>
            <li> It worked...sort of! It&#x27;s definitely not made for women of color because our hair is not as thin as others &amp; it takes a lot of effort for this to work! Rash...it prevented that...but it sucks as a shaving cream!</li>
            <li> this product is awesome and I use it on all the areas I need to shave. I noticed my skin has not been as dry shaving with this product.</li>
            <li> I received it very quick and it was a new bottle design. It was very sexy! Will definitely be ordering again!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, perfect shave gel.  Been using this product for about 2 years, tried others but always return to the original.</li>
            <li> I am so glad there is a product like this.  Normal shaving creme is terrible for shaving in some areas.  This is so smooth &amp; no irrating anywhere any longer.  Really like the two huge bottles, it will last for a very long time!!</li>
            <li> This is the best shave cream I have ever used.  It&#x27;s a little pricey at first, but it lasts forever.  I think this set lasted about eight months and that includes shaving underarms, legs, etc. for women.  Definitely worth the money.  For those used to using regular shaving cream, a little tip.  This goes on more like a lotion and is therefore clear when you put it on.  While you can&#x27;t see it when you&#x27;re in the shower, you can definitely see a glimmer on your legs and you&#x27;ll know which areas you have and have not shaved already.</li>
            <li> It makes my legs smooth and shaving rash free! It does everything is promises. i would and have recommended this product to friends.</li>
            <li> Best product on the market</li>
            <li> She was happy to get a new supply for Christmas. After using it that night, she said \\&quot;That&#x27;s the good stuff!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It is a rash free shave cream. no shave bumps now. even bought a bottle for my fiance. he says it works on his face like nothing he has used. works for even his face. Works well makes skin soft after as well. Will buy from again</li>
            <li> This product is great, I feel super young again and I there are absolutely no razor bumps, the shaved area actually feels soft. I recommend it to anyone who likes a clean shave. :)</li>
            <li> This is, by far, the nicest shave cream I have ever used.  I started using it a little over a year and a half ago and was immediately hooked.  One thing you should know: it lasts forever!  A little goes a long way and there is a lot in this bottle!  I bought the two pack here and I expect the two bottles to last me a year.  So yes, it is a little expensive but not when you take into consideration how long it lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finer details:  It lathers up on your skin, stays where you put it, and doesn&#x27;t wash away as easily as others do in the shower.  It also really softens the hair if you leave it on for a little bit which means that it shaves easier.  On the bottle it even says you can use it as a deep conditioner for your hair, which I tried and it wasn&#x27;t half bad!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff....total must have for shaving everywhere! Cannot do without it! Even great for sensitive skin.  Just buy it!</li>
            <li> This is the best shaving cream out there! Was recommended to me at a sex bachelorette party so I thought I would give it a try. This will absolutely give you the closest shave and leave you feeling so smooth. Once you buy it, you will never want anything else!</li>
            <li> this product is absolutely AMAZING ! I will NEVER spend another dime on any other shaving product. This is the only product that I have found that holds up to all it promises!</li>
            <li> I have heard of this for a few years, I&#x27;ve always been skeptical but finally gave in. BEST MONEY EVER SPENT! I&#x27;m in love this leaves your legs feeling like silk (unlike conditioner) everywhere I shave I use this it is the best no more red underarms etc love love love this will always replace! If you are thinking of trying just do it! Sooo worth it</li>
