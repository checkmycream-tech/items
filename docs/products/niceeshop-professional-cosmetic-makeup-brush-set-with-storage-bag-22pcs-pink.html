            <li>These brushes are great I love them!</li>
            <li>I am assuming the glue wasnt very good because I used warm water but not too warm as I was concerned abt burning/melting/scorching the bristles.</li>
            <li>she loved it</li>
            <li>it was good in the beginning</li>
            <li>A good blending brush.</li>

            <li>the bristles where in a good condition as well.  </li>
            <li>Good buy.</li>

            <li>this collection was a good move.</li>

            <li>They are good quality</li>
            <li>Great deal for getting every size / kind of makeup brush / applicators you could think of.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>

            <li>The case is good quality too.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve used just like 3 o 4 brushes until now, but they still are good</li>
            <li>I gave them 2 stars because there are a lot of brushes for the price and they will make excellent disposable paint brushes for crafts and detailed house painting.</li>
            <li>which was good...</li>
            <li>They are good for patting on eye shadows and work well for concealer application too.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other Brushes: The eyelash and eyebrow combs are good brushes.  </li>
            <li>Its not quality brushes but its good for concealer or contouring.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re getting what you paid for with this one, there are some good brushes in there, like the blush brushes, some eye shadow brushes, and</li>
            <li>So, whatever the good reviews are...from make up artists????</li>
            <li>Good investment.</li>
            <li>I had to give each brush a good wash with soap before using them.</li>
            <li>Good quality for the price.</li>
            <li>Aside from the odor the materials used arent good for applying make up.</li>

            <li>You just need a blending brush :)</li>
            <li>With a couple trips to YouTube I was able to figure them out</li>
            <li>I still had to buy some extra brushes because it not in the set but its an awesome start!</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Cute  </li>
            <li>For that price it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>many repeat brush</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say this should be more like nine dollars instead of twelve, given the type of brushes and smell issue.</li>
            <li>overall a good set of beginner brushes !!</li>
            <li>Well for that price you cant really expect great quality brushes, so they are okay.</li>

            <li>22 brushes for under $20 I was like ok some thing&#x27;s up</li>
            <li>but like I said, whatever the brush is made of isn&#x27;t my favorite.</li>
            <li>More of it got lost and stuck in the brush itself more than it did on my eyelids.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t satisfied, so I&#x27;m just re selling this to someone else.</li>

            <li>Came in a safe package.</li>
            <li>think it&#x27;d be better to invest in better brushes from the start.</li>
            <li>These brushes are very nice, cheap, and worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brushes are nice not as soft as I thought they would be, but still very nice.</li>
            <li>but they are super super cute and a great price.</li>
            <li>and pretty I tell everyone about this brushes!!!</li>
            <li>just looking at them, to the super soft bristles, I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say leaving the price aside that these brushes are the most amazing and lovely I&#x27;ve ever had, better than high end designer or bran brushes.</li>
            <li>the brushes were soft and beautiful.</li>
            <li>they are pretty and made with good material.</li>
            <li>There are a LOT of brushes and I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use every one yet, but they are soft and beautiful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited to use these!</li>
            <li>I was sooooooo excited to get my brushes in the mail!</li>
            <li>Lovely set, easy to transport</li>
            <li>Just about the only thing they are good for is the eyeliner brushes which you can buy just as good elf one&#x27;s for $1.</li>
            <li>The brushes are nice enough, and I&#x27;m happy with them as they are.</li>
            <li>Amazing totally fell in love with the brush set!!</li>
            <li>Other wise great</li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t irritate my face which i love, because i had that problem with the synthetic brushes, but these are just fantastic.</li>
            <li>Cute simple bag adorable brushes, looks just like the picture, the brushes themselves aren&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li>It was in great condition and the brushes were extremely soft.</li>
            <li>Great quality and soft brushes.</li>
            <li>I was able to get a light application of blush</li>
            <li>I wish it was easier to close the case and keep the brushes more secure, but it works for what I need.</li>
            <li>I looved at about 500 brush sets on Amazon, and was weary to choose this one, as I am INCREDIBLY picky about everything, especially my brushes.</li>
            <li>They were really soft and great for applying makeup.</li>
            <li>On top of that they are so pretty they look nice just sitting in my bathroom</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and the brushes work great with liquid and powdered makeup.  </li>
            <li>I would have loved this as a gift when in high school!</li>
            <li>It looked good and seemed to be appreciated.  </li>
            <li>Really cute brushes priced very fair haven&#x27;t used them all but so far so good only three starts because they are a bit softer than I need to blend and etc</li>
            <li>The awesome pink color doesn&#x27;t hurt either!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use most of the brushes that came with this set but for the price, it was worth it!</li>
            <li>glue didn&#x27;t hold the brushes together well but other than that it&#x27;s a great product !!</li>
            <li>The bristles are as good as new!</li>
            <li>Bristles fall out easily.</li>
            <li>yes it comes out easily</li>
            <li>the hair from the brushes fall off easily.</li>
            <li>But you get so many great smaller ones</li>
            <li>But the makeup stains them easily because of their colour..</li>
            <li>they broke way to easy.</li>
            <li>It rolls up and ties for easy storage.</li>
            <li>They would work great wet to get a nice defined edge.</li>
            <li>They are so soft and the assortment is impressive, makes me feel like a real pro artist.</li>
            <li>Lol The metallic pink metal has a nice finish and</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to store in your bag without it taking up a lot of room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Another thing I discovered is that the brushes stain easily.</li>
            <li>There is a strong plastic smell to it and</li>
            <li>but they have really strong smell like paint and it won&#x27;t go away.</li>
            <li>It was  good would&#x27;ve liked different styles, but it was good over all I really liked the color same as the pictures</li>
            <li>bag has a strong and chemical odor, I threw it out</li>
            <li>(odor is not that strong, i dont know why they complain about it)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Strongly recommended.</li>
            <li>(strong smell plastic)</li>
            <li>they do have a strong odor of paint but go away after washing them</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not even sure it&#x27;s painted because the finish is really well done and has a nice matte finish to it.</li>
            <li>I liked it very much</li>
            <li>I definitely feel confident using these brushes on my clients!! :)</li>
            <li>5 stars for the price of these brushes, I was pleasantly surprised how nice they are!</li>
            <li>otherwise pretty nice quality...</li>
            <li>I tried using these while my normal makeup brushes were drying after washing them and it took a lot longer to do my makeup with not as good of color payoff.</li>
            <li>Love love love these brushes good quality they don&#x27;t shed,and the color is just overall fun</li>
            <li>and they picked it up just fine</li>
            <li>For the money you pay, they&#x27;re fine.</li>
            <li>WORK FINE</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought a set almost exact to this one from amazon before and those were a lot better and had more of a  variety of brushes.</li>
            <li>I use the super BB powder by physicians formula and most brushes will apply this powder and make it look cakey.</li>
            <li>Very soft, and good coverage.</li>
            <li>Just received my new brush set today, I can honestly say I love them.  </li>
            <li>I love my brushes they are so soft and there is so many of them!</li>
            <li>Brushes are very pretty and soft, nice color and nice selection.</li>

            <li>But there great totally recommend them&lt;br</li>
            <li>its worth buying them :)</li>
            <li>I really like these brushes-from the bright bubblegum pink that makes me happy</li>
            <li>But hey totally worth the price you get them at :)</li>
            <li>These brushes are incredibly worth the price I paid, and even more.</li>
            <li>Otherwise these brushes are fantastic.</li>
            <li>Great for teens starting out with makeup .</li>
            <li>I knew I was ordering something cheap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These brushes were cheap.</li>
            <li>The brushes are cheap, they don&#x27;t hold makeup well, but they get the job done.</li>
            <li>When I want light makeup, I use these brushes.</li>
            <li>The brushes looked cheap and its been a month since I checked on the brushes, they still stink.</li>
            <li>they are too light to hold onto the powder use for foundation or shadows.&lt;br</li>
            <li>really cheap</li>
            <li>Definitely worth for the price :)</li>
            <li>They fit my every need.</li>
            <li>Such a great deal</li>
            <li>What can you spect when you bye cheap</li>
            <li>I have had these brushes for a few months now and Im very happy with them.</li>
            <li>If you are a beginner or just need some brushes for light makeup application these will suffice.</li>
            <li>Packaging was great for shipping, each individual brush had plastic wrap.</li>
            <li>It is a cheap product and cannot recommend it.  </li>
            <li>There good quality and are made from natural hair</li>
            <li>There is a good variety of face brushes which gives you many different ways to apply your products.  </li>
            <li>So soft it blends everything good</li>
            <li>The brushes are insanely soft, and good quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These brushes are very nice, the pink color is very pretty!!</li>
            <li>Amazing bought these thinking they would be good for travel and for other people makeup</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot and congrats !!!</li>
            <li>They look exactly like the picture!!</li>
            <li>It is (obviously for the price) synthetic, but works very nicely.</li>
            <li>They are very worth the price</li>
            <li>ii took a while before i received them, but when i did get them i liked them havent tried them yet, but i love the hair is soft and full and they do not fill flimsy</li>
            <li>i can not achieve a great look with flat brushes.</li>
            <li>Really good brushes,the sticks are just really long, they are really soft to my skin and work great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell of the bag isn&#x27;t super strong, but it&#x27;s there, and I found that after smelling it (it was sitting on my desk while I worked)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for amateur makeup users but don&#x27;t count on getting a good blending brush in this set.</li>
            <li>The powder brush in this set was so soft, it gently whisped my powder on and set my makeup beautifully.</li>
            <li>mostly cause I was excited over them being my first brush pack</li>
            <li>and I was so excited</li>
            <li>This came as expected and it&#x27;s beautiful</li>
            <li>defintely worth 15$ !</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to apply makeup, very soft and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a great value and pretty too!</li>
            <li>I love the pink and the way the brushes look and feel they are very soft but not the best quality the powder and concealer brushes I won&#x27;t be using but other than that they are great</li>
            <li>Would be perfect but the dark haired brushes started losing hair the first time I used them.</li>
            <li>Natural bristles are better because they&#x27;re coarser and attract more powder on each bristle.</li>
            <li>I have the sets of brushes, but this is my favorite because they are so cute, soft, and work for everything I need them for.</li>
            <li>I bought them to clean my keyboard with.</li>
            <li>so you do not have to keep wiping the brush clean in between color changes.</li>
            <li>overall great product, worth the price.</li>
            <li>Extremely soft i love it!</li>
            <li>The brushes came right on time and they looked just as they were in the pictures!</li>
            <li>Over all, these are great to have and the color is a soft glowing pink, they are just adorable!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re someone easily bothered by strong smells you really should avoid this set.</li>
            <li>love them super soft nd fast shipping(:!!!!</li>
            <li>I was super excited to buy/</li>
            <li>these are gorgeous to have, and any girl that wants to have some fancy makeup brushes with high quality should buy these.  </li>
            <li>These a soft and amazing.  </li>
            <li>Soft nice brushes, i would recommend these to anyone.</li>
            <li>I love the color of this product so much.</li>
            <li>but they are soft and feel nice on the touch</li>
            <li>It was nice and soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Summary: The brushes are good quality overall.  </li>
            <li>I bought this as gift for my niece who does her own makeup like a professional.</li>
            <li>Good enough for the price.</li>
            <li>Not condensed enough to get a good use out of them.</li>
            <li>The bristles are nice and smooth and the pink colored tips make it stylish.</li>
            <li>Nothing really professional about it, to be honest.</li>
            <li>Not a bad purchase for the price.</li>
            <li>For a long time I&#x27;ve wanted theses brushes, they are super adorable, and I liked the price.</li>
            <li>However, the brushes more on the plasticky side compared to other cheap brushes I own.</li>
            <li>Wood handles come off easy had to use hot glue gun to keep them on</li>
            <li>They do have a strong smell but you should wash them first anyway.</li>
            <li>nothing fancy but its a pretty color and does its job protecting the brushes and makes them easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>I still haven&#x27;t even used every single one yet, but they&#x27;re all really nice!</li>
            <li>but I was honestly blown away by how soft and gentle they are!!</li>
            <li>There are a few good brushes in the set but for the most part, they do not apply makeup well at all.</li>
            <li>They are so Soft and the brushes are an Amazing size i would Reperchase this item its worth every penny</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pink, soft and perfect for girls.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my sister last year and was so excited to see that they are still her favorite brushes!</li>
            <li>And the case is super neat.</li>
            <li>so I had to super glue them.</li>
            <li>Still an amazing deal and so cute with the pink tips!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Still an amazing deal and so cute with the pink tips!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brushes are super soft,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>It is cute and the pink looks nice.</li>
            <li>the Quality of the hair on the brush its self is cheap but it came very fast</li>
            <li>I got this in pink and it&#x27;s just amazing!</li>
            <li>These brushes are very soft but also very cheap.</li>
            <li>, I have some nice makeup and it barely puts it on my face, but it could just be me.</li>
            <li>The face brushes alone make the set worth buying and the other brushes are great too.  </li>
            <li>Great simple brushes if your starting out in makeup or just imaging around, not professional grade but good quality!</li>
            <li>Very pretty brushes</li>
            <li>They are very soft and none of the hair falls out which is super important!</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re really soft and easy to use!</li>
            <li>This was such a good deal and had other good reviews I thought I would try them out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had these for about 6 months already and they still work like brand new :)</li>
            <li>Thank you spoil much!!</li>
            <li>I received this only three days after ordering it, and I love them!</li>
            <li>This was a pretty packaging!</li>
            <li>I almost always do a cut crease look with a dark color blended out toward outer eye fading to a light color, and these brushes make it seem like I finish faster; with so many sizes it is easy to choose just the right one for the placement of the shadow and that gives me control to get the precise look that I am trying to achieve.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall: They are soft, strong (so far), a nice size for my face.&lt;br /&gt;Face</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for both professional and personal use and really easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>I only wish there was a wider variety of brushes but they are very good for anyone who is starting to build up their brush collection.</li>
            <li>These are great, use them everyday.</li>
            <li>A few stray strands when it came it, but a relatively great product for the price.</li>
            <li>The brushes are so soft, yet really grab the product and blend amazingly.</li>
            <li>The bag kind of smells like nail polish remover but that wasn&#x27;t a big deal to me.</li>
            <li>If so, it&#x27;s kind of a pain because I&#x27;m worried the smell will transfer back to the brushes, and therefore I can&#x27;t use the bag to store them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it...</li>
            <li>The brushes have no odor.&lt;br /&gt;Overall the brushes are definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t worth spending money</li>
            <li>spend it in something useful</li>
            <li>I received my 22pcs Cosmetic Makeup Brushes in the mail today, &amp; I was taking them out of the cute pink bag and one of my brushes the top piece came off.</li>
            <li>They came in their pink bag, really good packaged.</li>
            <li>they are so soft , &amp; so cute .</li>
            <li>I like the cokor and the brusehes are useful a lot.</li>
            <li>So soft and fluffy and pick up the perfect amount of product.</li>
            <li>WORTH THE PRICE</li>
            <li>but overall they are nice brushes.</li>
            <li>I think my favorite by far, though was the powder brush.</li>
            <li>they don&#x27;s clump, they are soft and I love using these brushes when I do my makeup.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft, and lovely.</li>
            <li>the are ok too soft</li>
            <li>Well i think they are worth the price..</li>
            <li>So worth the money.</li>
            <li>They are easy to clean and they are soft.</li>
            <li>they are so soft and cute.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice pearly pink and it really smooth, almost like leather.</li>
            <li>The brushes are by no mean &amp;#34;high quality&amp;#34; but they easily get the job well.</li>
            <li>I received my order super fast!</li>
            <li>Good brushes just don&#x27;t seem to pick up powders as well as other brushes</li>
            <li>The pink packaging is super cute!  </li>
            <li>Three of the brushes broke right away.  </li>
            <li>but it is pretty soft and the smell is okay.</li>
            <li>but when they did love them their soft pretty haven&#x27;t used them yet</li>
            <li>i havent used yet because they have a strong odor, and they must be washed im a very busy hair dresser and make up artis i havent had the time</li>
            <li>but i loved the brushes that i did get , thanks , very pretty pink</li>
            <li>They are SUPER soft, which is good in some ways (they feel amazing on your skin) and not so good in others (make up application is a little more difficult).</li>
            <li>Bristles of the brush had a cute pink too it and it was easy to handle.</li>
            <li>brushes\\&quot;........ Okay, First of all, it&#x27;s pretty clear you&#x27;re still selling them.</li>
            <li>in all, it&#x27;s not bad, but I didn&#x27;t really have any expectations.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t wash the brushes right away, it does stain the brush (I use baby shampoo to clean my brush normally but did also had to use some Dawn dishsoap which seems to remove the powder and foundation off the brush</li>
            <li>Too soft for my taste, the fan brushes work nicely, and so do the eye shadow brushes but everything else was way too soft.</li>
            <li>The brush are soft to the skin and is easy to wash.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Overall: They are easily stained because of their color and smell when they come out of the package (though the smell is easily fixed with a wash of the brushes)&lt;br /&gt;Face</li>
            <li>The brushes are really soft and good quality especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I got these brushes super fast</li>
            <li>There were a lot of brushes to choose from and they were very soft, which is important.  </li>
            <li>Super soft!!!</li>
            <li>The large ones are good for a light dusting of powder and not much else because they are so soft.</li>
            <li>The smaller brushes are fine though!</li>
            <li>overall it is a pretty good product comes with whats shown and comes in a timely manner, i barely use any of these brushes but it was worth the 14 bucks</li>
            <li>They would be fine for a child who likes to play with her mommy&#x27;s old make up.</li>
            <li>Soft bristles, love the easy roll up back, for the cost</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very soft to the touch, easy to clean, and give the impression of professional brushes.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very soft and user friendly.</li>
            <li>so they were all brand new and clean.</li>
            <li>I will admit that they did smell like paint when I first got them</li>
            <li>I had the last one from them for 2 1/2 years and they still were ok to use.</li>
            <li>Ive had to hot glue</li>
            <li>so I am pretty picky with my brushes, these nurses did not pick up makeup well.</li>
            <li>The brushes Just came in and the first thing i did was check how sturdy they are.</li>
            <li>Fall apart at first wash and suck at applying makeup.</li>
            <li>They did smell a bit funny at first</li>
            <li>Well they are pretty</li>
            <li>Weeks later it&#x27;s better but still noticeable.</li>
            <li>The color is pretty and the sleeve that holds the brushes is durable.</li>
            <li>but overall I am pleased with the quality.</li>
            <li>Overall ok brushes</li>
            <li>Additionally, one of the brushes broke at the metal attachment to the handle the first week of use,  </li>
            <li>and it keeps everything so nice and organized &amp; its PINK &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not angry, I just wish I had listened to the reviews.</li>
            <li>ELF studio brushes are $3 each and have way such a better quality.</li>
            <li>It has so many different brushes.</li>
            <li>Threw them out on the first try...... 👎</li>
            <li>They were exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li>Like they used hot glue</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try spraying the ends with MAC Fix+ or the similar one by elf and see if I have better luck.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>The eye shadow brushes could be better they also could have added a blending eye shadow brush but overall work well for me.</li>
            <li>There is a ton of different size eyeshadow brushes which is my favorite type of brush.  </li>
            <li>These are the first cosmetic brushes I&#x27;ve used to put on makeup</li>
            <li>It came earlier than expected, and was beautifully packaged.</li>
            <li>They pick up powder pretty well (comparable to E.L.F.&#x27;s brushes)</li>
            <li>Looked a bit different then the picture,but they are still cute &amp; work pretty well.</li>
            <li>These bushes are really pretty</li>
            <li>but they don&#x27;t exactly work well.</li>
            <li>but overall it was ok</li>
            <li>And the brushes hold up very well after you washed them!</li>
            <li>The only reason why I didnt give 5 stars is becuase I wish it had more variety...</li>
            <li>The first thing that happened was all of the bristles fell out of one of the brushes.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t shed but since this was my first makeup brush set</li>
            <li>It comes with many tiny brushes that have no use, and the ones that have a descent size don&#x27;t pick the powder and shadows at all.</li>
            <li>I would definitely try more items from this company...</li>
            <li>They are my first brush set</li>
            <li>Colors are pretty.</li>
            <li>they feel rough and kind of sting against your face.</li>
            <li>When they first came they smelled like plastic</li>
            <li>These are really cute, and work well enough.</li>
            <li>It gives me exactly what I needed to do my makeup.</li>
            <li>These are an ok into brush set but the smaller brushes have had some shedding.</li>
            <li>Pretty to look at</li>
            <li>Product is exactly like pictured and described.</li>
            <li>I was so surprised at how cheap this was</li>
            <li>Shipping was surprisingly fast!</li>
            <li>I just purchased a set of brushes from ecotools-- not as expensive as Sephora brands but still great quality!</li>
            <li>few the brush is good but not all for the eye brushes</li>
            <li>Make sure you clean them after use, since they&#x27;re white they can certainly stain, but it doesn&#x27;t take away from the fact that they&#x27;re sooooo SOFT!!</li>
            <li>The brushes are SUPER SOFT!!</li>
            <li>The pink bag had a very strong smell when it first arrived.</li>
            <li>When they arrived I noticed the color is slightly different from what it appears on the photo (more like a bright pink or light purple), and the pink bag smells funny</li>
            <li>The case smells like any brand new product that is packaged in plastic which is nothing to complain about, unless you&#x27;re pregnant.</li>
            <li>If it really bothers me, I&#x27;ll just give them over to a friend who is starting out in the make up world and look for better deals on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I gifted vy surprised to my 14 years old daughter.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be a good set for someone just getting into makeup, however I bought a more expensive brand for me.</li>
            <li>Some name brand brushes cost more than this whole set did for only one brush!</li>
            <li>only thing is if you do use a pigmented eyeshadow (like sugarpill) make sure the wash them right away because they do stain but other than that, I love how they blend in eyeshadow.&lt;br</li>
            <li>She was surprised by the great quality and softness of the brushes, and the wide varieties and the way they are placed inside in a professional way!</li>
            <li>Super soft brushes !</li>
            <li>The brushes are super soft and gentle to the touch!</li>
            <li>I bought these when I first got into makeup because I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first time I bought the whole set of brush.</li>
            <li>first off I would like to say, they shipped fast.....</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found brushes that I honestly love in a long time.</li>
            <li>Thank you sooooo much for fast delivery!</li>
            <li>not to mention the look soooo sooo cute, the handle feels like wood and it has a lovely color, the brushes themselves are white with pink tips just like in the pictures</li>
            <li>People compliment on how soft they are - which is true -</li>
            <li>it can easily be glued back on, but it speaks to the quality of the product.  </li>
            <li>The brushes make it easy for you to blend your makeup but this set doesn&#x27;t come with an eye shadow blending brush and there are 3 or 4 brushes that are very similar to each</li>
            <li>I ordered them for my daughter and she is very particular on her brushes</li>
            <li>The brushes are super soft.</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and get something from a popular bland.</li>
            <li>Although they are super soft.</li>
            <li>Pure garbage.</li>
            <li>it was love at first sight, for a girl that loves pink just as much as I do</li>
            <li>so soft and sturdy and very pretty.</li>
            <li>I use them to do my make up everyday and they are still good as new</li>
            <li>You might be able to use the flat eyeshadow brushes for packing on color, if it is a high pigmented shadow.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are super soft and work really well (;&lt;br /&gt;one of them did come in two pieces but</li>
            <li>Pretty decent products compare to what you pay.</li>
            <li>I received them so fast.</li>
            <li>My sister is very jealous</li>
            <li>This brushes are more like eyeshadow brushes&amp; blush too , NOT REALLY BLENDING BRUSHES</li>
            <li>Not a fan of pink, but i must say these brushes are so cute in person.</li>
            <li>Blush and powder brushes are very flimsy.</li>
            <li>the brushes r really goood</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t top of the line, but I expected that for what I paid.</li>
            <li>The wife really likes these brushes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;2)I really don&#x27;t like that it doesn&#x27;t have the names of the brushes or even just numbers on them.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t pick up powder eyeshadow very well and have no softness.</li>
            <li>They also are very flimsy and too bendy.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it a whole lot</li>
            <li>I purchased the pink one and love it.</li>
            <li>Like very toxic paint.</li>
            <li>however I didn&#x27;t expect much considering what I paid.</li>
            <li>The plastic stench coming off the case is really quite ferocious.</li>
            <li>Shed a lot and don&#x27;t grab the makeup very well.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li>I really like it this product, it fill out my expectations</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much, it is 15$.</li>
            <li>I cannot complain I didn&#x27;t pay too much for them</li>
            <li>Very well made and sturdy.</li>
            <li>The brushes are very well made, no fallout.</li>
            <li>They transfer pigments very well.</li>
            <li>There really cheep</li>
            <li>Reading the comments and rates i see that some persons tell they didn´t take much product, but for me work it.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>Som elf them are really unuseful.</li>
            <li>Very affordable for the amount you get.</li>
            <li>The packaging had a very plastic scent but has vanished over time.</li>
            <li>absolutely recommend them .</li>
            <li>the package is pink they are supper cute</li>
            <li>Love my set and the pink matches my hello kitty holders.</li>
            <li>They perform really well.</li>
            <li>You really have to dig.</li>
            <li>The brushes are better made than I expected.</li>
            <li>I was concerned about the real fur thing, but they dont feel like real fur</li>
            <li>is that the case and brushes are more of a metallic pink.</li>
            <li>I was worried because she is very selective on her brushes since she is a hair stylist</li>
            <li>I would really recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li>, they&#x27;re really bulky when you roll it up.</li>
            <li>so you will have a whole array of brushes to fill out your brush collection for that stuff</li>
            <li>AND I LOVE PINK.</li>
            <li>Not a thing to dislike about this product, very affordable.</li>
            <li>So when you consider the price it doesn&#x27;t matter much, unless you want them or need them soon.</li>
            <li>pedal\\&quot; colored handles (I was expecting them to be more of a pink color like shown in the picture</li>
            <li>but anyways they are really cheap for all these brushes i totally recommend them!</li>
            <li>i really like the case.</li>
            <li>didnt really workout for me  </li>
            <li>She says she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>Love the pearl pink case too.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this product for a couple months now and have used 3 pieces out of the whole thing.  </li>
            <li>Each piece has been used maybe a handful of times, I&#x27;m not someone who wears makeup much.  </li>
            <li>I got the brushes about a week after I bought them they came packeged very well</li>
            <li>The face brushes don&#x27;t pick up that much product.</li>
            <li>My daughter really likes the makeup brushes and uses them every day</li>
            <li>but they weren&#x27;t very pricey</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really convenient to take it on the go with you if you&#x27;re traveling.</li>
            <li>My daughter loves this set .. it is nicely made not cheap looking.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The powder brush and the eyebrow brush are probably the only thing useful and those things alone aren&#x27;t worth what I paid for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Only way more soft.</li>
            <li>it was a few things i liked in the kit tho</li>
            <li>Not only it&#x27;s ine of my favorite colors, the brushes amazingly soft.</li>
            <li>The face brushes are awesome, the eye brushes are a little too stiff.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll guess i&#x27;ll just have to super glue it back on, but other then that the brushes are very cute and very soft.</li>
            <li>The brushes are not horrible or useless but are still not the best because of their stiff nature.  </li>
            <li>Very soft and blends very well!</li>
            <li>Other than that everything else about the product is top notch.</li>
            <li>I love them and they are pink!</li>
            <li>I washed my brushes and they went back to their original form..</li>
            <li>but nothing a little hot glue won&#x27;t fix love em over all</li>
            <li>Other than that I absolutely love them.</li>
            <li>I love pink!</li>
            <li>They are pretty &amp; all BUT don&#x27;t feel soft ennought on face!</li>
            <li>These type of stiff flat brushes are great for concealer, primer, cream products, lipstick, gel liner, etc.</li>
            <li>I was worried when I got them that they wouldn&#x27;t be soft, but they are super soft!</li>
            <li>the brushes were soft and the bristles didn&#x27;t shed that much when i first washed it.</li>
            <li>not good for eye shadow get real hair brushes for that and not synthetic, but good for blending esp.</li>
            <li>The cons: the smell it off the package was very strong but it went away after a few hours, so be prepared but don&#x27;t worry.</li>
            <li>I love the pink color and the bag, I did a whole face, they are extremely soft and I had no problem picking up eye shadow or face powder.  </li>
            <li>the first week just opened them and aired them out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really chic, stylish, and above all, actually works!</li>
            <li>Like I said I threw more that half to trash can.</li>
            <li>They are so soft and the pink bag is cute.</li>
            <li>but my powder brush had to be super glued back together at the metal piece.</li>
            <li>These brushes are decent if you do not want to spend alot of money on brushes.</li>
            <li>They are really soft (much softer than EcoTools, E.L.F, and Real Technique - in my opinion)&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>I expected a set of medium/small brushes but received nice big brushes.  </li>
            <li>I typically use six or seven colors in the different areas of the eye (bright inner corner, light or bright lid, crease, upper crease, transition color, highlight brow area, and dark outer area that meets the wing of the liner) while overlapping and blending throughly the middle section.</li>
            <li>A few of the brushes broke pretty easily.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recomended</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had high hopes for these</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>but you will need to supplement a few other brushes to be really happy with your makeup application.</li>
            <li>Many of the brushes are just flat &amp;#34;packing&amp;#34; brushes, but in different sizes.</li>
            <li>It seemed to be a little more plastic</li>
            <li>The little leather case that it came in is absolutely adorable; it looks well constructed.</li>
            <li>It is decent for new make up users.</li>
            <li>A few single bristles will try to come out but other than that these babies are very good!</li>
            <li>i thought the pink wrap was cheap looking.</li>
            <li>They are soft to the touch and feel like they are made really well.</li>
            <li>The pink wrap case feels cheap, but it is fully functional.</li>
            <li>Beauty protective case with very well made, soft brushes.  </li>
            <li>This set is absolutely PERFECT.The bristles feel soft and are flexible,something I look for in brushes.</li>
            <li>is very visible and you can clearly tell which ones I&#x27;ve used and which ones I haven&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I bought this for the smaller brushes and its worth it just for them.</li>
            <li>The first four brushes from the left including the small fan brush are pretty flimsy and are better suited for dusting excess powder/shadow.</li>
            <li>I have 6 different brush sets and I recommend first picking up the Real Techniques Core Collection for face brushes and</li>
            <li>Which i really love a firm eyeshadow brush and this is what I am the pickiest with.</li>
            <li>Worth double the price!</li>
            <li>had to use one of the large face brush for foundation because I don&#x27;t really like the actually foundation brush since it leaves noticeable lines and doesn&#x27;t blend well</li>
            <li>Other than that they feel cheap; you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>I found use for them as spares in my emergency work kit and travel kit, but other than that save your money and buy the cheap ones at Target (</li>
            <li>Spraying a little Fix+ works very well with these brushes to make a precise application of color.</li>
            <li>Spraying a little Fix+ works very well with these brushes to make a precise application of color.</li>
            <li>Just wanted a new set</li>
            <li>Purchased this item for my mom, she needed new brushes and eyeshadow.  </li>
            <li>Okay so I was really excited to get these because they&#x27;re pink and very cute, but I was somewhat disappointed.</li>
            <li>The brushes are Not stiff enough:/ brushes need to be fuller/thicker!  </li>
            <li>Bristles are soft and the variety of brushes is useful for different kinds of make up application.</li>
            <li>The only reason I give it 2 stars is because a couple eye brushes are OK and I like the color pink.</li>
            <li>The big fluffy one is nice</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s nice, especially if you tend to be heavy handed.</li>
            <li>They are also very soft</li>
            <li>She says they&#x27;re well-made, very soft, and that the pouch roll that they come in is well made.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft.</li>
            <li>They are very soft.</li>
            <li>They are not flimsy and they are very soft.</li>
            <li>but they are very soft.</li>
            <li>The brushes are really soft and stiff which makes applying makeup so much better.</li>
            <li>The eyeshadow brushes are all pretty much the same, just slightly angled differently from one another, and they are VERY flat, so it might be a good deal if you&#x27;re really hurting for eyeshadow brushes and short on cash</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super soft and lasted me for a long time too...</li>
            <li>I never knew brushes could be this soft!</li>
            <li>(: they are so soft!</li>
            <li>This is my first time getting a brush set this big</li>
            <li>they are so soft!</li>
            <li>They are pretty big and the case smells like chemicals/plastic, but that smell goes away after about a week.</li>
            <li>she said they are still as soft as the day i gave them to her, and they stayed in tact!</li>
            <li>They are so soft!</li>
            <li>They do not shed at all and are so soft!</li>
            <li>I could not stop putting these on my face, there sooooo soft!</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on them!</li>
            <li>they brushes are soooooo soft!</li>
            <li>only downfall I can think of is that the case that comes with it has a very strong paint smell, but that dissipates after a few hours or so.</li>
            <li>I knew better, but based on all the positive reviews I forwent my past experiences and ordered these brushes because of their low price.</li>
            <li>recommend these brushes to anyone needing a new set who dosn&#x27;t want to or can&#x27;t spend the money on a professional set.</li>
            <li>I will honestly say that I was pretty skeptical when I received these brushes in the mail.</li>
            <li>I received my item quickly and sooner than expected.</li>
            <li>The big brushes are ok, but the smaller eyeshadow brushes are not soft enough to make pretty gradient mixes.</li>
            <li>They smell a little funky but if you wash them it will be fine.</li>
            <li>I think OVERALL, this product is good and comparable (if not slightly better) to E.L.F&#x27;s standard brushes.  </li>
            <li>The only thing is is that I have had to super glue the handles back to them.</li>
            <li>The face brushes are alright, but I think the pictures are a little misleading as one or more look tapered and they are definitely not; they are more or less different sizes of powder brushes, excluding the wider ones, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I guess I can&#x27;t really say I expected too much out of this set.</li>
            <li>SOFT SOFT SOFT</li>
            <li>It got here four days early.</li>
            <li>The bristles r soft</li>
            <li>On one brush all the bristles came off completely after I cleaned it with brush cleaner.</li>
            <li>The brushes are so soft.</li>
            <li>but they are too soft.</li>
            <li>the eyebrow brush came un attached which can easily be fixed</li>
            <li>Brushes where soft and didn&#x27;t fall apart.</li>
            <li>would really recommend this set to any knowledgeable makeup beginners or anyone who just needs some extra brushes for working on friends &amp; family</li>
            <li>They all came in tact and the bristles were soft.</li>
            <li>, they are soft but they do not cover.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and there was no shedding.</li>
            <li>I prefer the feeling of natural, but you cannot expect that for this price.</li>
            <li>There soooooooooooo soft.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to see that they included almost every brush you could want.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any problems with them as far as hairs falling out</li>
            <li>Second, after a whole month of making us wait, all you can do is say cancel the order????</li>
            <li>Brushes are too soft and do not hold make up on them.</li>
            <li>They also apply makeup well and are not harsh on your face.&lt;br /&gt;Eye shadow Brushes:  </li>
            <li>I felt like I was just brushing my face the brushes were to soft</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re really soft and there are brushes for everything,  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-they are supper supper soft</li>
            <li>The bristles are extremely soft.</li>
            <li>soft buy not too soft so as to soak up the product.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived before time.</li>
            <li>They were all soft except one.</li>
            <li>I have 3 toddlers and wanted a complete brush set without spending a lot</li>
            <li>but again I had no trouble getting the look</li>
            <li>make up for a natural look to smokey eyes.</li>
            <li>But I still enjoy it and use it everyday.</li>
            <li>They got here early and well packaged</li>
            <li>Brushes are supper soft...</li>
            <li>The hairs are incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft, but not firm.</li>
            <li>Aside from the smell the brush bristles are soft but not even, some are longer than others.</li>
            <li>So far, nothing came off yet.</li>
            <li>you will not belive how soft they are .</li>
            <li>It completely fell apart.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off buying a few inexpensive but different brushes.</li>
            <li>but you will probably need to pick up a few better eyeshadow brushes, especially for blending, as there is nothing in here that works for that.</li>
            <li>I ended up buying a more expensive 5 piece set of brushes but it is worth it because I use them all.</li>
            <li>in a few of the brushes the aluminium fitting was set wobbly on the wooden handle, so I had to glue them.</li>
            <li>The brush set needs more fluffy eye brushes though, there all flat like concealer brushes.</li>
            <li>brushes are really useless because they aren&#x27;t strong enough they bend to easy (</li>
            <li>but everything else you pretty much will give to your little sister or use them for crafties.  </li>
            <li>other than that it useful , &amp;</li>
            <li>Other then the fact that they are easily stained and you get many of the same concealer brushes I have no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;Eye shadow Brushes:  These brushes are a weak point in the set.  </li>
            <li>I bought these brushes around this time last year and I still have them and they are still just like new!</li>
            <li>I think make for kids messing around, this would be cute, but not if you&#x27;re serious about your makeup</li>
            <li>Overall I would highly recommend..</li>
            <li>The bigger brushes are soft, but the smaller eye shadow brushes are more stiff.</li>
            <li>The ties are really long, so you have to wrap it around a couple times and then tie it which can be time time consuming, but something that doesn&#x27;t really bother me.</li>
            <li>There is no blending brush, and a lot of the angled brushes are a bit too big to use on normal eyes for your crease.</li>
            <li>Some brushes were super soft, and some were too stiff to use correctly.</li>
            <li>the only down side is that , when you clean your brushes , sometimes the makeup stains them , also the face &amp; eyes bruhes don&#x27;t pick up the eyeshadow , or powder that well .</li>
            <li>but the next day I did spray a little of Febreze on it and let it air dry for about 2 more days and the smell was nearly gone)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Be gentle and build up color, yes the small brushes are fairly stiff but if you use a light hand they will work very well.</li>
            <li>Be gentle and build up color, yes the small brushes are fairly stiff but if you use a light hand they will work very well.</li>
            <li>Soft, very well made pink case.</li>
            <li>I really like the soft pink in the picture but what ever.</li>
            <li>nothing major</li>
            <li>They are so pretty and the pink bag is gorg!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re synthetic (made of the same type of smooth stiff material foundation brushes are made of)</li>
            <li>It wouldn&#x27;t really pick up loose powder at all.</li>
            <li>And the case is strong and thick with a shiny pink fabric - very girly.</li>
            <li>My brushes had minimal smell (they smelled like new products in new packaging.)</li>
            <li>The large fan brush was damaged when they arrived, a lot of repeat brushes and not really what I was hoping for...</li>
            <li>Very cheap, don&#x27;t waste your money, not worth it at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Aside from just sucking in general, two of the brushes broke off from the handle within a week.</li>
            <li>they are cheap but still such a waste !</li>
            <li>It barely picks up my makeup</li>
            <li>I barely use it.</li>
            <li>The brush seems pretty secured to the handle - there are some MINOR imperfections such as in three of my brushes there were alittle glue on the handle, but also not a big deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not a total waste of money and I can&#x27;t complain too much for the price but won&#x27;t be reaching for these as much as I&#x27;d hoped after reading the rave review on here    </li>
            <li>so soft the smell of the packaging only lasted like for a day</li>
            <li>I only give it three stars because it is advertised as professional.</li>
            <li>If you want an inexpensive and high quality brush set that lasts for a long time, this is your set!</li>
            <li>The only complaint i have is that the tops seem to break off quite easily.</li>
            <li>However, I just use some dish washing soap and a little bit of water and it gets off most of the eye shadow, but sometimes there is still a little bit of stains</li>
            <li>Small brushes were unnecessary but overall very pleased!</li>
            <li>Pretty pink handles, soft, also pink tipped and no shedding brushes.</li>
            <li>Yes, the brushes are very soft, but almost too soft to where they don&#x27;t pick up much color and are hard to blend with.</li>
            <li>you just need to know how to use them and not make this fact as an excuse to say that they&#x27;re  not good because there are many</li>
            <li>the pink tips on the white brissels really make them pop.</li>
            <li>so I love playing with different eyeshadows and techniques -- these brushes are not great.</li>
            <li>Everything looks fine other than it arrived missing one brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- a few hairs will fall off the first time you use it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m upping my rating to 5 stars because if you are willing to give these a chance and think a little outside the box</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m upping my rating to 5 stars because if you are willing to give these a chance and think a little outside the box</li>
            <li>But it has too little brushes and the top is too small as well.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft and not rough or harsh on mmy sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>though, the hairs on the brush kind of shed, so you have to use them delicately, but not complaining because they are a cheap price compared to other expensive brushes.</li>
            <li>They are really soft, but very stiff and don&#x27;t pick up eyeshadow or any powder very well at all.</li>

            <li> These brushes are great I love them!</li>
            <li> I am assuming the glue wasnt very good because I used warm water but not too warm as I was concerned abt burning/melting/scorching the bristles.</li>
            <li> she loved it</li>
            <li> it was good in the beginning</li>

            <li> Good buy.</li>
            <li> But they are a lot of brushes do its good</li>
            <li> this collection was a good move.</li>
            <li> They are good brushes but wiped my eye shadow off instead of applying it.</li>
            <li> They are good quality</li>
            <li> Great deal for getting every size / kind of makeup brush / applicators you could think of.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> they are good</li>
            <li> The case is good quality too.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve used just like 3 o 4 brushes until now, but they still are good</li>
            <li> I gave them 2 stars because there are a lot of brushes for the price and they will make excellent disposable paint brushes for crafts and detailed house painting.</li>
            <li> which was good...</li>
            <li> They are good for patting on eye shadows and work well for concealer application too.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other Brushes: The eyelash and eyebrow combs are good brushes.  </li>
            <li> Its not quality brushes but its good for concealer or contouring.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re getting what you paid for with this one, there are some good brushes in there, like the blush brushes, some eye shadow brushes, and</li>
            <li> So, whatever the good reviews are...from make up artists????</li>
            <li> Good investment.</li>
            <li> I had to give each brush a good wash with soap before using them.</li>
            <li> Good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> Aside from the odor the materials used arent good for applying make up.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Overall, these are really pretty and great as a gift.</li>
            <li> Not the best brushes , they barely pick up any product.</li>

            <li> I was happy with my products it was delivered very quickly, there are really soft probably it doesn&#x27;t come from a good brand</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Love all of the angles.</li>
            <li> overall great deal!</li>
            <li> and I have so many brushes</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t pleased with these whatsoever.</li>
            <li> and I am glad I got this.</li>
            <li> but it ok for me</li>
            <li> All in All they are okay.</li>
            <li> and i totally love it.</li>
            <li> You get so many brushes for so cheap!!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> You just need a blending brush :)</li>
            <li> With a couple trips to YouTube I was able to figure them out</li>
            <li> I still had to buy some extra brushes because it not in the set but its an awesome start!</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Cute  </li>
            <li> For that price it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> many repeat brush</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say this should be more like nine dollars instead of twelve, given the type of brushes and smell issue.</li>
            <li> overall a good set of beginner brushes !!</li>
            <li> Well for that price you cant really expect great quality brushes, so they are okay.</li>
            <li> They just look cute.</li>

            <li> 22 brushes for under $20 I was like ok some thing&#x27;s up</li>
            <li> but like I said, whatever the brush is made of isn&#x27;t my favorite.</li>
            <li> More of it got lost and stuck in the brush itself more than it did on my eyelids.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t satisfied, so I&#x27;m just re selling this to someone else.</li>
            <li> I suggest elf brushes if you guys want better, and cheap brushes!</li>
            <li> ok I give it 2 out of 5 stars</li>
            <li> but okay for the price.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m really glad</li>
            <li> Came in a safe package.</li>
            <li> think it&#x27;d be better to invest in better brushes from the start.</li>
            <li> These brushes are very nice, cheap, and worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brushes are nice not as soft as I thought they would be, but still very nice.</li>
            <li> but they are super super cute and a great price.</li>
            <li> and pretty I tell everyone about this brushes!!!</li>
            <li> just looking at them, to the super soft bristles, I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say leaving the price aside that these brushes are the most amazing and lovely I&#x27;ve ever had, better than high end designer or bran brushes.</li>
            <li> the brushes were soft and beautiful.</li>
            <li> they are pretty and made with good material.</li>
            <li> There are a LOT of brushes and I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use every one yet, but they are soft and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited to use these!</li>
            <li> I was sooooooo excited to get my brushes in the mail!</li>
            <li> Lovely set, easy to transport</li>
            <li> Just about the only thing they are good for is the eyeliner brushes which you can buy just as good elf one&#x27;s for $1.</li>
            <li> The brushes are nice enough, and I&#x27;m happy with them as they are.</li>
            <li> Amazing totally fell in love with the brush set!!</li>
            <li> Other wise great</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t irritate my face which i love, because i had that problem with the synthetic brushes, but these are just fantastic.</li>
            <li> Cute simple bag adorable brushes, looks just like the picture, the brushes themselves aren&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li> It was in great condition and the brushes were extremely soft.</li>
            <li> Great quality and soft brushes.</li>
            <li> I was able to get a light application of blush</li>
            <li> I wish it was easier to close the case and keep the brushes more secure, but it works for what I need.</li>
            <li> I looved at about 500 brush sets on Amazon, and was weary to choose this one, as I am INCREDIBLY picky about everything, especially my brushes.</li>
            <li> They were really soft and great for applying makeup.</li>
            <li> On top of that they are so pretty they look nice just sitting in my bathroom</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and the brushes work great with liquid and powdered makeup.  </li>
            <li> I would have loved this as a gift when in high school!</li>
            <li> It looked good and seemed to be appreciated.  </li>
            <li> Really cute brushes priced very fair haven&#x27;t used them all but so far so good only three starts because they are a bit softer than I need to blend and etc</li>
            <li> The awesome pink color doesn&#x27;t hurt either!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use most of the brushes that came with this set but for the price, it was worth it!</li>
            <li> glue didn&#x27;t hold the brushes together well but other than that it&#x27;s a great product !!</li>
            <li> The bristles are as good as new!</li>
            <li> Bristles fall out easily.</li>
            <li> yes it comes out easily</li>
            <li> the hair from the brushes fall off easily.</li>
            <li> But you get so many great smaller ones</li>
            <li> But the makeup stains them easily because of their colour..</li>
            <li> they broke way to easy.</li>
            <li> It rolls up and ties for easy storage.</li>
            <li> They would work great wet to get a nice defined edge.</li>
            <li> They are so soft and the assortment is impressive, makes me feel like a real pro artist.</li>
            <li> Lol The metallic pink metal has a nice finish and</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to store in your bag without it taking up a lot of room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Another thing I discovered is that the brushes stain easily.</li>
            <li> There is a strong plastic smell to it and</li>
            <li> but they have really strong smell like paint and it won&#x27;t go away.</li>
            <li> It was  good would&#x27;ve liked different styles, but it was good over all I really liked the color same as the pictures</li>
            <li> bag has a strong and chemical odor, I threw it out</li>
            <li> (odor is not that strong, i dont know why they complain about it)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Strongly recommended.</li>
            <li> (strong smell plastic)</li>
            <li> they do have a strong odor of paint but go away after washing them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even sure it&#x27;s painted because the finish is really well done and has a nice matte finish to it.</li>
            <li> I liked it very much</li>
            <li> I definitely feel confident using these brushes on my clients!! :)</li>
            <li> 5 stars for the price of these brushes, I was pleasantly surprised how nice they are!</li>
            <li> otherwise pretty nice quality...</li>
            <li> I tried using these while my normal makeup brushes were drying after washing them and it took a lot longer to do my makeup with not as good of color payoff.</li>
            <li> Love love love these brushes good quality they don&#x27;t shed,and the color is just overall fun</li>
            <li> and they picked it up just fine</li>
            <li> For the money you pay, they&#x27;re fine.</li>
            <li> WORK FINE</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a set almost exact to this one from amazon before and those were a lot better and had more of a  variety of brushes.</li>
            <li> I use the super BB powder by physicians formula and most brushes will apply this powder and make it look cakey.</li>
            <li> Very soft, and good coverage.</li>
            <li> Just received my new brush set today, I can honestly say I love them.  </li>
            <li> I love my brushes they are so soft and there is so many of them!</li>
            <li> Brushes are very pretty and soft, nice color and nice selection.</li>

            <li> Made cheap, my brushes fell apart within two months.</li>

            <li> But there great totally recommend them&lt;br</li>
            <li> its worth buying them :)</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes-from the bright bubblegum pink that makes me happy</li>
            <li> But hey totally worth the price you get them at :)</li>
            <li> These brushes are incredibly worth the price I paid, and even more.</li>
            <li> Otherwise these brushes are fantastic.</li>
            <li> Great for teens starting out with makeup .</li>
            <li> I knew I was ordering something cheap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These brushes were cheap.</li>
            <li> The brushes are cheap, they don&#x27;t hold makeup well, but they get the job done.</li>
            <li> When I want light makeup, I use these brushes.</li>
            <li> The brushes looked cheap and its been a month since I checked on the brushes, they still stink.</li>
            <li> they are too light to hold onto the powder use for foundation or shadows.&lt;br</li>
            <li> really cheap</li>
            <li> Definitely worth for the price :)</li>
            <li> They fit my every need.</li>
            <li> Such a great deal</li>
            <li> What can you spect when you bye cheap</li>
            <li> I have had these brushes for a few months now and Im very happy with them.</li>
            <li> If you are a beginner or just need some brushes for light makeup application these will suffice.</li>
            <li> Packaging was great for shipping, each individual brush had plastic wrap.</li>
            <li> It is a cheap product and cannot recommend it.  </li>
            <li> There good quality and are made from natural hair</li>
            <li> There is a good variety of face brushes which gives you many different ways to apply your products.  </li>
            <li> So soft it blends everything good</li>
            <li> The brushes are insanely soft, and good quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These brushes are very nice, the pink color is very pretty!!</li>
            <li> Amazing bought these thinking they would be good for travel and for other people makeup</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot and congrats !!!</li>
            <li> They look exactly like the picture!!</li>
            <li> It is (obviously for the price) synthetic, but works very nicely.</li>
            <li> They are very worth the price</li>
            <li> ii took a while before i received them, but when i did get them i liked them havent tried them yet, but i love the hair is soft and full and they do not fill flimsy</li>
            <li> i can not achieve a great look with flat brushes.</li>
            <li> Really good brushes,the sticks are just really long, they are really soft to my skin and work great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell of the bag isn&#x27;t super strong, but it&#x27;s there, and I found that after smelling it (it was sitting on my desk while I worked)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for amateur makeup users but don&#x27;t count on getting a good blending brush in this set.</li>
            <li> The powder brush in this set was so soft, it gently whisped my powder on and set my makeup beautifully.</li>
            <li> mostly cause I was excited over them being my first brush pack</li>
            <li> and I was so excited</li>
            <li> This came as expected and it&#x27;s beautiful</li>
            <li> defintely worth 15$ !</li>
            <li> Worth the money!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to apply makeup, very soft and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a great value and pretty too!</li>
            <li> I love the pink and the way the brushes look and feel they are very soft but not the best quality the powder and concealer brushes I won&#x27;t be using but other than that they are great</li>
            <li> Would be perfect but the dark haired brushes started losing hair the first time I used them.</li>
            <li> Natural bristles are better because they&#x27;re coarser and attract more powder on each bristle.</li>
            <li> I have the sets of brushes, but this is my favorite because they are so cute, soft, and work for everything I need them for.</li>
            <li> I bought them to clean my keyboard with.</li>
            <li> so you do not have to keep wiping the brush clean in between color changes.</li>
            <li> overall great product, worth the price.</li>
            <li> Extremely soft i love it!</li>
            <li> The brushes came right on time and they looked just as they were in the pictures!</li>
            <li> Over all, these are great to have and the color is a soft glowing pink, they are just adorable!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re someone easily bothered by strong smells you really should avoid this set.</li>
            <li> love them super soft nd fast shipping(:!!!!</li>
            <li> I was super excited to buy/</li>
            <li> these are gorgeous to have, and any girl that wants to have some fancy makeup brushes with high quality should buy these.  </li>
            <li> These a soft and amazing.  </li>
            <li> Soft nice brushes, i would recommend these to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love the color of this product so much.</li>
            <li> but they are soft and feel nice on the touch</li>
            <li> It was nice and soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Summary: The brushes are good quality overall.  </li>
            <li> I bought this as gift for my niece who does her own makeup like a professional.</li>
            <li> Good enough for the price.</li>
            <li> Not condensed enough to get a good use out of them.</li>
            <li> The bristles are nice and smooth and the pink colored tips make it stylish.</li>
            <li> Nothing really professional about it, to be honest.</li>
            <li> Not a bad purchase for the price.</li>
            <li> For a long time I&#x27;ve wanted theses brushes, they are super adorable, and I liked the price.</li>
            <li> However, the brushes more on the plasticky side compared to other cheap brushes I own.</li>
            <li> Wood handles come off easy had to use hot glue gun to keep them on</li>
            <li> They do have a strong smell but you should wash them first anyway.</li>
            <li> nothing fancy but its a pretty color and does its job protecting the brushes and makes them easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> I still haven&#x27;t even used every single one yet, but they&#x27;re all really nice!</li>
            <li> but I was honestly blown away by how soft and gentle they are!!</li>
            <li> There are a few good brushes in the set but for the most part, they do not apply makeup well at all.</li>
            <li> They are so Soft and the brushes are an Amazing size i would Reperchase this item its worth every penny</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pink, soft and perfect for girls.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister last year and was so excited to see that they are still her favorite brushes!</li>
            <li> And the case is super neat.</li>
            <li> so I had to super glue them.</li>
            <li> Still an amazing deal and so cute with the pink tips!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Still an amazing deal and so cute with the pink tips!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brushes are super soft,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> It is cute and the pink looks nice.</li>
            <li> the Quality of the hair on the brush its self is cheap but it came very fast</li>
            <li> I got this in pink and it&#x27;s just amazing!</li>
            <li> These brushes are very soft but also very cheap.</li>
            <li> , I have some nice makeup and it barely puts it on my face, but it could just be me.</li>
            <li> The face brushes alone make the set worth buying and the other brushes are great too.  </li>
            <li> Great simple brushes if your starting out in makeup or just imaging around, not professional grade but good quality!</li>
            <li> Very pretty brushes</li>
            <li> They are very soft and none of the hair falls out which is super important!</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re really soft and easy to use!</li>
            <li> This was such a good deal and had other good reviews I thought I would try them out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these for about 6 months already and they still work like brand new :)</li>
            <li> Thank you spoil much!!</li>
            <li> I received this only three days after ordering it, and I love them!</li>
            <li> This was a pretty packaging!</li>
            <li> I almost always do a cut crease look with a dark color blended out toward outer eye fading to a light color, and these brushes make it seem like I finish faster; with so many sizes it is easy to choose just the right one for the placement of the shadow and that gives me control to get the precise look that I am trying to achieve.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall: They are soft, strong (so far), a nice size for my face.&lt;br /&gt;Face</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for both professional and personal use and really easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> I only wish there was a wider variety of brushes but they are very good for anyone who is starting to build up their brush collection.</li>
            <li> These are great, use them everyday.</li>
            <li> A few stray strands when it came it, but a relatively great product for the price.</li>
            <li> The brushes are so soft, yet really grab the product and blend amazingly.</li>
            <li> The bag kind of smells like nail polish remover but that wasn&#x27;t a big deal to me.</li>
            <li> If so, it&#x27;s kind of a pain because I&#x27;m worried the smell will transfer back to the brushes, and therefore I can&#x27;t use the bag to store them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it...</li>
            <li> The brushes have no odor.&lt;br /&gt;Overall the brushes are definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t worth spending money</li>
            <li> spend it in something useful</li>
            <li> I received my 22pcs Cosmetic Makeup Brushes in the mail today, &amp; I was taking them out of the cute pink bag and one of my brushes the top piece came off.</li>
            <li> They came in their pink bag, really good packaged.</li>
            <li> they are so soft , &amp; so cute .</li>
            <li> I like the cokor and the brusehes are useful a lot.</li>
            <li> So soft and fluffy and pick up the perfect amount of product.</li>
            <li> WORTH THE PRICE</li>
            <li> but overall they are nice brushes.</li>
            <li> I think my favorite by far, though was the powder brush.</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;s clump, they are soft and I love using these brushes when I do my makeup.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft, and lovely.</li>
            <li> the are ok too soft</li>
            <li> Well i think they are worth the price..</li>
            <li> So worth the money.</li>
            <li> They are easy to clean and they are soft.</li>
            <li> they are so soft and cute.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice pearly pink and it really smooth, almost like leather.</li>
            <li> The brushes are by no mean &amp;#34;high quality&amp;#34; but they easily get the job well.</li>
            <li> I received my order super fast!</li>
            <li> Good brushes just don&#x27;t seem to pick up powders as well as other brushes</li>
            <li> The pink packaging is super cute!  </li>
            <li> Three of the brushes broke right away.  </li>
            <li> but it is pretty soft and the smell is okay.</li>
            <li> but when they did love them their soft pretty haven&#x27;t used them yet</li>
            <li> i havent used yet because they have a strong odor, and they must be washed im a very busy hair dresser and make up artis i havent had the time</li>
            <li> but i loved the brushes that i did get , thanks , very pretty pink</li>
            <li> They are SUPER soft, which is good in some ways (they feel amazing on your skin) and not so good in others (make up application is a little more difficult).</li>
            <li> Bristles of the brush had a cute pink too it and it was easy to handle.</li>
            <li> brushes\\&quot;........ Okay, First of all, it&#x27;s pretty clear you&#x27;re still selling them.</li>
            <li> in all, it&#x27;s not bad, but I didn&#x27;t really have any expectations.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t wash the brushes right away, it does stain the brush (I use baby shampoo to clean my brush normally but did also had to use some Dawn dishsoap which seems to remove the powder and foundation off the brush</li>
            <li> Too soft for my taste, the fan brushes work nicely, and so do the eye shadow brushes but everything else was way too soft.</li>
            <li> The brush are soft to the skin and is easy to wash.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Overall: They are easily stained because of their color and smell when they come out of the package (though the smell is easily fixed with a wash of the brushes)&lt;br /&gt;Face</li>
            <li> The brushes are really soft and good quality especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I got these brushes super fast</li>
            <li> There were a lot of brushes to choose from and they were very soft, which is important.  </li>
            <li> Super soft!!!</li>
            <li> The large ones are good for a light dusting of powder and not much else because they are so soft.</li>
            <li> The smaller brushes are fine though!</li>
            <li> overall it is a pretty good product comes with whats shown and comes in a timely manner, i barely use any of these brushes but it was worth the 14 bucks</li>
            <li> They would be fine for a child who likes to play with her mommy&#x27;s old make up.</li>
            <li> Soft bristles, love the easy roll up back, for the cost</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very soft to the touch, easy to clean, and give the impression of professional brushes.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very soft and user friendly.</li>
            <li> so they were all brand new and clean.</li>
            <li> I will admit that they did smell like paint when I first got them</li>
            <li> I had the last one from them for 2 1/2 years and they still were ok to use.</li>
            <li> Ive had to hot glue</li>
            <li> so I am pretty picky with my brushes, these nurses did not pick up makeup well.</li>
            <li> The brushes Just came in and the first thing i did was check how sturdy they are.</li>
            <li> Fall apart at first wash and suck at applying makeup.</li>
            <li> They did smell a bit funny at first</li>
            <li> Well they are pretty</li>
            <li> Weeks later it&#x27;s better but still noticeable.</li>
            <li> The color is pretty and the sleeve that holds the brushes is durable.</li>
            <li> but overall I am pleased with the quality.</li>
            <li> Overall ok brushes</li>
            <li> Additionally, one of the brushes broke at the metal attachment to the handle the first week of use,  </li>
            <li> and it keeps everything so nice and organized &amp; its PINK &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not angry, I just wish I had listened to the reviews.</li>
            <li> ELF studio brushes are $3 each and have way such a better quality.</li>
            <li> It has so many different brushes.</li>
            <li> Threw them out on the first try...... 👎</li>
            <li> They were exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> Like they used hot glue</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try spraying the ends with MAC Fix+ or the similar one by elf and see if I have better luck.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> The eye shadow brushes could be better they also could have added a blending eye shadow brush but overall work well for me.</li>
            <li> There is a ton of different size eyeshadow brushes which is my favorite type of brush.  </li>
            <li> These are the first cosmetic brushes I&#x27;ve used to put on makeup</li>
            <li> It came earlier than expected, and was beautifully packaged.</li>
            <li> They pick up powder pretty well (comparable to E.L.F.&#x27;s brushes)</li>
            <li> Looked a bit different then the picture,but they are still cute &amp; work pretty well.</li>
            <li> These bushes are really pretty</li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t exactly work well.</li>
            <li> but overall it was ok</li>
            <li> And the brushes hold up very well after you washed them!</li>
            <li> The only reason why I didnt give 5 stars is becuase I wish it had more variety...</li>
            <li> The first thing that happened was all of the bristles fell out of one of the brushes.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t shed but since this was my first makeup brush set</li>
            <li> It comes with many tiny brushes that have no use, and the ones that have a descent size don&#x27;t pick the powder and shadows at all.</li>
            <li> I would definitely try more items from this company...</li>
            <li> They are my first brush set</li>
            <li> Colors are pretty.</li>
            <li> they feel rough and kind of sting against your face.</li>
            <li> When they first came they smelled like plastic</li>
            <li> These are really cute, and work well enough.</li>
            <li> It gives me exactly what I needed to do my makeup.</li>
            <li> These are an ok into brush set but the smaller brushes have had some shedding.</li>
            <li> Pretty to look at</li>
            <li> Product is exactly like pictured and described.</li>
            <li> I was so surprised at how cheap this was</li>
            <li> Shipping was surprisingly fast!</li>
            <li> I just purchased a set of brushes from ecotools-- not as expensive as Sephora brands but still great quality!</li>
            <li> few the brush is good but not all for the eye brushes</li>
            <li> Make sure you clean them after use, since they&#x27;re white they can certainly stain, but it doesn&#x27;t take away from the fact that they&#x27;re sooooo SOFT!!</li>
            <li> The brushes are SUPER SOFT!!</li>
            <li> The pink bag had a very strong smell when it first arrived.</li>
            <li> When they arrived I noticed the color is slightly different from what it appears on the photo (more like a bright pink or light purple), and the pink bag smells funny</li>
            <li> The case smells like any brand new product that is packaged in plastic which is nothing to complain about, unless you&#x27;re pregnant.</li>
            <li> If it really bothers me, I&#x27;ll just give them over to a friend who is starting out in the make up world and look for better deals on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I gifted vy surprised to my 14 years old daughter.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a good set for someone just getting into makeup, however I bought a more expensive brand for me.</li>
            <li> Some name brand brushes cost more than this whole set did for only one brush!</li>
            <li> only thing is if you do use a pigmented eyeshadow (like sugarpill) make sure the wash them right away because they do stain but other than that, I love how they blend in eyeshadow.&lt;br</li>
            <li> She was surprised by the great quality and softness of the brushes, and the wide varieties and the way they are placed inside in a professional way!</li>
            <li> Super soft brushes !</li>
            <li> The brushes are super soft and gentle to the touch!</li>
            <li> I bought these when I first got into makeup because I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first time I bought the whole set of brush.</li>
            <li> first off I would like to say, they shipped fast.....</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found brushes that I honestly love in a long time.</li>
            <li> Thank you sooooo much for fast delivery!</li>
            <li> not to mention the look soooo sooo cute, the handle feels like wood and it has a lovely color, the brushes themselves are white with pink tips just like in the pictures</li>
            <li> People compliment on how soft they are - which is true -</li>
            <li> it can easily be glued back on, but it speaks to the quality of the product.  </li>
            <li> The brushes make it easy for you to blend your makeup but this set doesn&#x27;t come with an eye shadow blending brush and there are 3 or 4 brushes that are very similar to each</li>
            <li> I ordered them for my daughter and she is very particular on her brushes</li>
            <li> The brushes are super soft.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and get something from a popular bland.</li>
            <li> Although they are super soft.</li>
            <li> Pure garbage.</li>
            <li> it was love at first sight, for a girl that loves pink just as much as I do</li>
            <li> so soft and sturdy and very pretty.</li>
            <li> I use them to do my make up everyday and they are still good as new</li>
            <li> You might be able to use the flat eyeshadow brushes for packing on color, if it is a high pigmented shadow.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are super soft and work really well (;&lt;br /&gt;one of them did come in two pieces but</li>
            <li> Pretty decent products compare to what you pay.</li>
            <li> I received them so fast.</li>
            <li> My sister is very jealous</li>
            <li> This brushes are more like eyeshadow brushes&amp; blush too , NOT REALLY BLENDING BRUSHES</li>
            <li> Not a fan of pink, but i must say these brushes are so cute in person.</li>
            <li> Blush and powder brushes are very flimsy.</li>
            <li> the brushes r really goood</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t top of the line, but I expected that for what I paid.</li>
            <li> The wife really likes these brushes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;2)I really don&#x27;t like that it doesn&#x27;t have the names of the brushes or even just numbers on them.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t pick up powder eyeshadow very well and have no softness.</li>
            <li> They also are very flimsy and too bendy.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it a whole lot</li>
            <li> I purchased the pink one and love it.</li>
            <li> Like very toxic paint.</li>
            <li> however I didn&#x27;t expect much considering what I paid.</li>
            <li> The plastic stench coming off the case is really quite ferocious.</li>
            <li> Shed a lot and don&#x27;t grab the makeup very well.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> I really like it this product, it fill out my expectations</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much, it is 15$.</li>
            <li> I cannot complain I didn&#x27;t pay too much for them</li>
            <li> Very well made and sturdy.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very well made, no fallout.</li>
            <li> They transfer pigments very well.</li>
            <li> There really cheep</li>
            <li> Reading the comments and rates i see that some persons tell they didn´t take much product, but for me work it.</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> Som elf them are really unuseful.</li>
            <li> Very affordable for the amount you get.</li>
            <li> The packaging had a very plastic scent but has vanished over time.</li>
            <li> absolutely recommend them .</li>
            <li> the package is pink they are supper cute</li>
            <li> Love my set and the pink matches my hello kitty holders.</li>
            <li> They perform really well.</li>
            <li> You really have to dig.</li>
            <li> The brushes are better made than I expected.</li>
            <li> I was concerned about the real fur thing, but they dont feel like real fur</li>
            <li> is that the case and brushes are more of a metallic pink.</li>
            <li> I was worried because she is very selective on her brushes since she is a hair stylist</li>
            <li> I would really recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> , they&#x27;re really bulky when you roll it up.</li>
            <li> so you will have a whole array of brushes to fill out your brush collection for that stuff</li>
            <li> AND I LOVE PINK.</li>
            <li> Not a thing to dislike about this product, very affordable.</li>
            <li> So when you consider the price it doesn&#x27;t matter much, unless you want them or need them soon.</li>
            <li> pedal\\&quot; colored handles (I was expecting them to be more of a pink color like shown in the picture</li>
            <li> but anyways they are really cheap for all these brushes i totally recommend them!</li>
            <li> i really like the case.</li>
            <li> didnt really workout for me  </li>
            <li> She says she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> Love the pearl pink case too.</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a couple months now and have used 3 pieces out of the whole thing.  </li>
            <li> Each piece has been used maybe a handful of times, I&#x27;m not someone who wears makeup much.  </li>
            <li> I got the brushes about a week after I bought them they came packeged very well</li>
            <li> The face brushes don&#x27;t pick up that much product.</li>
            <li> My daughter really likes the makeup brushes and uses them every day</li>
            <li> but they weren&#x27;t very pricey</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really convenient to take it on the go with you if you&#x27;re traveling.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this set .. it is nicely made not cheap looking.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The powder brush and the eyebrow brush are probably the only thing useful and those things alone aren&#x27;t worth what I paid for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Only way more soft.</li>
            <li> it was a few things i liked in the kit tho</li>
            <li> Not only it&#x27;s ine of my favorite colors, the brushes amazingly soft.</li>
            <li> The face brushes are awesome, the eye brushes are a little too stiff.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll guess i&#x27;ll just have to super glue it back on, but other then that the brushes are very cute and very soft.</li>
            <li> The brushes are not horrible or useless but are still not the best because of their stiff nature.  </li>
            <li> Very soft and blends very well!</li>
            <li> Other than that everything else about the product is top notch.</li>
            <li> I love them and they are pink!</li>
            <li> I washed my brushes and they went back to their original form..</li>
            <li> but nothing a little hot glue won&#x27;t fix love em over all</li>
            <li> Other than that I absolutely love them.</li>
            <li> I love pink!</li>
            <li> They are pretty &amp; all BUT don&#x27;t feel soft ennought on face!</li>
            <li> These type of stiff flat brushes are great for concealer, primer, cream products, lipstick, gel liner, etc.</li>
            <li> I was worried when I got them that they wouldn&#x27;t be soft, but they are super soft!</li>
            <li> the brushes were soft and the bristles didn&#x27;t shed that much when i first washed it.</li>
            <li> not good for eye shadow get real hair brushes for that and not synthetic, but good for blending esp.</li>
            <li> The cons: the smell it off the package was very strong but it went away after a few hours, so be prepared but don&#x27;t worry.</li>
            <li> I love the pink color and the bag, I did a whole face, they are extremely soft and I had no problem picking up eye shadow or face powder.  </li>
            <li> the first week just opened them and aired them out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really chic, stylish, and above all, actually works!</li>
            <li> Like I said I threw more that half to trash can.</li>
            <li> They are so soft and the pink bag is cute.</li>
            <li> but my powder brush had to be super glued back together at the metal piece.</li>
            <li> These brushes are decent if you do not want to spend alot of money on brushes.</li>
            <li> They are really soft (much softer than EcoTools, E.L.F, and Real Technique - in my opinion)&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> I expected a set of medium/small brushes but received nice big brushes.  </li>
            <li> I typically use six or seven colors in the different areas of the eye (bright inner corner, light or bright lid, crease, upper crease, transition color, highlight brow area, and dark outer area that meets the wing of the liner) while overlapping and blending throughly the middle section.</li>
            <li> A few of the brushes broke pretty easily.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recomended</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had high hopes for these</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> but you will need to supplement a few other brushes to be really happy with your makeup application.</li>
            <li> Many of the brushes are just flat &amp;#34;packing&amp;#34; brushes, but in different sizes.</li>
            <li> It seemed to be a little more plastic</li>
            <li> The little leather case that it came in is absolutely adorable; it looks well constructed.</li>
            <li> It is decent for new make up users.</li>
            <li> A few single bristles will try to come out but other than that these babies are very good!</li>
            <li> i thought the pink wrap was cheap looking.</li>
            <li> They are soft to the touch and feel like they are made really well.</li>
            <li> The pink wrap case feels cheap, but it is fully functional.</li>
            <li> Beauty protective case with very well made, soft brushes.  </li>
            <li> This set is absolutely PERFECT.The bristles feel soft and are flexible,something I look for in brushes.</li>
            <li> is very visible and you can clearly tell which ones I&#x27;ve used and which ones I haven&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the smaller brushes and its worth it just for them.</li>
            <li> The first four brushes from the left including the small fan brush are pretty flimsy and are better suited for dusting excess powder/shadow.</li>
            <li> I have 6 different brush sets and I recommend first picking up the Real Techniques Core Collection for face brushes and</li>
            <li> Which i really love a firm eyeshadow brush and this is what I am the pickiest with.</li>
            <li> Worth double the price!</li>
            <li> had to use one of the large face brush for foundation because I don&#x27;t really like the actually foundation brush since it leaves noticeable lines and doesn&#x27;t blend well</li>
            <li> Other than that they feel cheap; you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I found use for them as spares in my emergency work kit and travel kit, but other than that save your money and buy the cheap ones at Target (</li>
            <li> Spraying a little Fix+ works very well with these brushes to make a precise application of color.</li>

            <li> Just wanted a new set</li>
            <li> Purchased this item for my mom, she needed new brushes and eyeshadow.  </li>
            <li> Okay so I was really excited to get these because they&#x27;re pink and very cute, but I was somewhat disappointed.</li>
            <li> The brushes are Not stiff enough:/ brushes need to be fuller/thicker!  </li>
            <li> Bristles are soft and the variety of brushes is useful for different kinds of make up application.</li>
            <li> The only reason I give it 2 stars is because a couple eye brushes are OK and I like the color pink.</li>
            <li> The big fluffy one is nice</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s nice, especially if you tend to be heavy handed.</li>
            <li> They are also very soft</li>
            <li> She says they&#x27;re well-made, very soft, and that the pouch roll that they come in is well made.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft.</li>
            <li> They are very soft.</li>
            <li> They are not flimsy and they are very soft.</li>
            <li> but they are very soft.</li>
            <li> The brushes are really soft and stiff which makes applying makeup so much better.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow brushes are all pretty much the same, just slightly angled differently from one another, and they are VERY flat, so it might be a good deal if you&#x27;re really hurting for eyeshadow brushes and short on cash</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super soft and lasted me for a long time too...</li>
            <li> I never knew brushes could be this soft!</li>
            <li> (: they are so soft!</li>
            <li> This is my first time getting a brush set this big</li>
            <li> they are so soft!</li>
            <li> They are pretty big and the case smells like chemicals/plastic, but that smell goes away after about a week.</li>
            <li> she said they are still as soft as the day i gave them to her, and they stayed in tact!</li>
            <li> They are so soft!</li>
            <li> They do not shed at all and are so soft!</li>
            <li> I could not stop putting these on my face, there sooooo soft!</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on them!</li>
            <li> they brushes are soooooo soft!</li>
            <li> only downfall I can think of is that the case that comes with it has a very strong paint smell, but that dissipates after a few hours or so.</li>
            <li> I knew better, but based on all the positive reviews I forwent my past experiences and ordered these brushes because of their low price.</li>
            <li> recommend these brushes to anyone needing a new set who dosn&#x27;t want to or can&#x27;t spend the money on a professional set.</li>
            <li> I will honestly say that I was pretty skeptical when I received these brushes in the mail.</li>
            <li> I received my item quickly and sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> The big brushes are ok, but the smaller eyeshadow brushes are not soft enough to make pretty gradient mixes.</li>
            <li> They smell a little funky but if you wash them it will be fine.</li>
            <li> I think OVERALL, this product is good and comparable (if not slightly better) to E.L.F&#x27;s standard brushes.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is is that I have had to super glue the handles back to them.</li>
            <li> The face brushes are alright, but I think the pictures are a little misleading as one or more look tapered and they are definitely not; they are more or less different sizes of powder brushes, excluding the wider ones, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I guess I can&#x27;t really say I expected too much out of this set.</li>
            <li> SOFT SOFT SOFT</li>
            <li> It got here four days early.</li>
            <li> The bristles r soft</li>
            <li> On one brush all the bristles came off completely after I cleaned it with brush cleaner.</li>
            <li> The brushes are so soft.</li>
            <li> but they are too soft.</li>
            <li> the eyebrow brush came un attached which can easily be fixed</li>
            <li> Brushes where soft and didn&#x27;t fall apart.</li>
            <li> would really recommend this set to any knowledgeable makeup beginners or anyone who just needs some extra brushes for working on friends &amp; family</li>
            <li> They all came in tact and the bristles were soft.</li>
            <li> , they are soft but they do not cover.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and there was no shedding.</li>
            <li> I prefer the feeling of natural, but you cannot expect that for this price.</li>
            <li> There soooooooooooo soft.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see that they included almost every brush you could want.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any problems with them as far as hairs falling out</li>
            <li> Second, after a whole month of making us wait, all you can do is say cancel the order????</li>
            <li> Brushes are too soft and do not hold make up on them.</li>
            <li> They also apply makeup well and are not harsh on your face.&lt;br /&gt;Eye shadow Brushes:  </li>
            <li> I felt like I was just brushing my face the brushes were to soft</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re really soft and there are brushes for everything,  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-they are supper supper soft</li>
            <li> The bristles are extremely soft.</li>
            <li> soft buy not too soft so as to soak up the product.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived before time.</li>
            <li> They were all soft except one.</li>
            <li> I have 3 toddlers and wanted a complete brush set without spending a lot</li>
            <li> but again I had no trouble getting the look</li>
            <li> make up for a natural look to smokey eyes.</li>
            <li> But I still enjoy it and use it everyday.</li>
            <li> They got here early and well packaged</li>
            <li> Brushes are supper soft...</li>
            <li> The hairs are incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft, but not firm.</li>
            <li> Aside from the smell the brush bristles are soft but not even, some are longer than others.</li>
            <li> So far, nothing came off yet.</li>
            <li> you will not belive how soft they are .</li>
            <li> It completely fell apart.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off buying a few inexpensive but different brushes.</li>
            <li> but you will probably need to pick up a few better eyeshadow brushes, especially for blending, as there is nothing in here that works for that.</li>
            <li> I ended up buying a more expensive 5 piece set of brushes but it is worth it because I use them all.</li>
            <li> in a few of the brushes the aluminium fitting was set wobbly on the wooden handle, so I had to glue them.</li>
            <li> The brush set needs more fluffy eye brushes though, there all flat like concealer brushes.</li>
            <li> brushes are really useless because they aren&#x27;t strong enough they bend to easy (</li>
            <li> but everything else you pretty much will give to your little sister or use them for crafties.  </li>
            <li> other than that it useful , &amp;</li>
            <li> Other then the fact that they are easily stained and you get many of the same concealer brushes I have no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;Eye shadow Brushes:  These brushes are a weak point in the set.  </li>
            <li> I bought these brushes around this time last year and I still have them and they are still just like new!</li>
            <li> I think make for kids messing around, this would be cute, but not if you&#x27;re serious about your makeup</li>
            <li> Overall I would highly recommend..</li>
            <li> The bigger brushes are soft, but the smaller eye shadow brushes are more stiff.</li>
            <li> The ties are really long, so you have to wrap it around a couple times and then tie it which can be time time consuming, but something that doesn&#x27;t really bother me.</li>
            <li> There is no blending brush, and a lot of the angled brushes are a bit too big to use on normal eyes for your crease.</li>
            <li> Some brushes were super soft, and some were too stiff to use correctly.</li>
            <li> the only down side is that , when you clean your brushes , sometimes the makeup stains them , also the face &amp; eyes bruhes don&#x27;t pick up the eyeshadow , or powder that well .</li>
            <li> but the next day I did spray a little of Febreze on it and let it air dry for about 2 more days and the smell was nearly gone)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be gentle and build up color, yes the small brushes are fairly stiff but if you use a light hand they will work very well.</li>
            <li> Be gentle and build up color, yes the small brushes are fairly stiff but if you use a light hand they will work very well.</li>
            <li> Soft, very well made pink case.</li>
            <li> I really like the soft pink in the picture but what ever.</li>
            <li> nothing major</li>
            <li> They are so pretty and the pink bag is gorg!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re synthetic (made of the same type of smooth stiff material foundation brushes are made of)</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t really pick up loose powder at all.</li>
            <li> And the case is strong and thick with a shiny pink fabric - very girly.</li>
            <li> My brushes had minimal smell (they smelled like new products in new packaging.)</li>
            <li> The large fan brush was damaged when they arrived, a lot of repeat brushes and not really what I was hoping for...</li>
            <li> Very cheap, don&#x27;t waste your money, not worth it at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Aside from just sucking in general, two of the brushes broke off from the handle within a week.</li>
            <li> they are cheap but still such a waste !</li>
            <li> It barely picks up my makeup</li>
            <li> I barely use it.</li>
            <li> The brush seems pretty secured to the handle - there are some MINOR imperfections such as in three of my brushes there were alittle glue on the handle, but also not a big deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not a total waste of money and I can&#x27;t complain too much for the price but won&#x27;t be reaching for these as much as I&#x27;d hoped after reading the rave review on here    </li>
            <li> so soft the smell of the packaging only lasted like for a day</li>
            <li> I only give it three stars because it is advertised as professional.</li>
            <li> If you want an inexpensive and high quality brush set that lasts for a long time, this is your set!</li>
            <li> The only complaint i have is that the tops seem to break off quite easily.</li>
            <li> However, I just use some dish washing soap and a little bit of water and it gets off most of the eye shadow, but sometimes there is still a little bit of stains</li>
            <li> Small brushes were unnecessary but overall very pleased!</li>
            <li> Pretty pink handles, soft, also pink tipped and no shedding brushes.</li>
            <li> Yes, the brushes are very soft, but almost too soft to where they don&#x27;t pick up much color and are hard to blend with.</li>
            <li> you just need to know how to use them and not make this fact as an excuse to say that they&#x27;re  not good because there are many</li>
            <li> the pink tips on the white brissels really make them pop.</li>
            <li> so I love playing with different eyeshadows and techniques -- these brushes are not great.</li>
            <li> Everything looks fine other than it arrived missing one brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- a few hairs will fall off the first time you use it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m upping my rating to 5 stars because if you are willing to give these a chance and think a little outside the box</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m upping my rating to 5 stars because if you are willing to give these a chance and think a little outside the box</li>
            <li> But it has too little brushes and the top is too small as well.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft and not rough or harsh on mmy sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> though, the hairs on the brush kind of shed, so you have to use them delicately, but not complaining because they are a cheap price compared to other expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> They are really soft, but very stiff and don&#x27;t pick up eyeshadow or any powder very well at all.</li>
            <li> I have had a hard time washing these after using them with liquid lipsticks but all eye makeup powders/creams and foundations have come right out.</li>
            <li> One of the fan brushes barely has any bristles on it, its super thin.</li>
            <li> I was kind of hesitant to order the product because I couldn&#x27;t believe the price and shipping, but I was wrong!</li>
            <li> Missing the contouring brush expected there to be more different type of brushes least a verity.  </li>
            <li> I tend to use the eyeliner brushes for my eyebrows and the small size of it works very well for that purpose.  </li>
            <li> Brushes are too flat.</li>
            <li> All the brushes are flat not rounded.</li>
            <li> The only problem would be that it took very long to receive them.</li>
            <li> They are smooth for a brush and couldn&#x27;t hold much make up and bad at doing the job.</li>
            <li> It looked really cheap, disappointed with first impression.</li>
            <li> The softness and varying lengths of the brushes allows for seemless blending with the various types of shadow I have used: matte, shimmery, loose pigment, pencil, liquid/wet.</li>
            <li> Be open minded and you can use some brushes for other uses than they are intended, for example I packed on a crease color with a small \\&quot;eyeshadow brush\\&quot; and blended it out gently with the fan brush.</li>
            <li> Be open minded and you can use some brushes for other uses than they are intended, for example I packed on a crease color with a small \\&quot;eyeshadow brush\\&quot; and blended it out gently with the fan brush.</li>
            <li> Some of the larger brushes come with a little plastic case over the bristles to keep them in place, and I thought that added to the value of the item in general.</li>
            <li> They do not pick up makeup hardly at all and what they do pick up doesn&#x27;t apply to the face very well....</li>
            <li> I have used expensive and cheap brushing both for painting and makeup</li>
            <li> Other than that, they are extremely soft and I looove the pink!</li>
            <li> I got mine earlier than expected</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it for long</li>
            <li> a few flaws, but they can be fixed.</li>
            <li> probably will not ever use these brushes so this was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> The bristles were soft a d fluffy, picked up eyeshadow, foundation,</li>
            <li> One reviewer mentioned there is an odor to the pink packaging, but that will likely fade.</li>
            <li> However I already expected it since I did not pay extra for it to be delivered faster.</li>
            <li> and no, these are not professional quality brushes</li>
            <li> Definitely not professional, though.</li>
            <li> I have had it for a long time now, hairs have not fallen.</li>
            <li> I guess that&#x27;s to be expected from a white brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing is that my contour brush with broken the first time I tried it.</li>
            <li> The little square brush is for tight lining your lashes, where you pack on gel eyeliner right into your lash line for dark, luscious lashes.</li>
            <li> They are not very high quality and not dense at all.</li>
            <li> Not to mention the delivery of this item came earlier than expected!  </li>
            <li> And a couple brushes shredded a little but nothing major.</li>
            <li> but i do have other brushes im using, overall i like the look</li>
            <li> tried wetting one of the brushes and the water bubbled up and the brush felt dry.</li>
            <li> the brushes do not blend (I used my regular &#x27;old&#x27; brushes and tried to use these at least to blend)</li>
            <li> My main complaint would be about the eyeshadow brushes.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re sooo soft, and despite what other reviews had to say, they are extremely durable!!</li>
            <li> The glue inside came loose and all the hair fell out.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> and the wait for delivery wasn&#x27;t long at all!!</li>
            <li> -Thankfully I have an extra from a previous set</li>
            <li> And after using them a few days the mascara thing came off, and the handle on one of them is loose, also I got a couple brushes that weren&#x27;t the same color as the rest.</li>
            <li> Shedding comes with every brush--especially if you&#x27;re not familiar with proper care and cleansing; shedding happens either way.</li>
            <li> I received this brush set before expected.</li>
            <li> But they are all basically concealer brushes in different sizes except for a few face ones.</li>
            <li> The brushes are a lot harder than I would of expected.</li>
            <li> For example, the &amp;#34;stipple&amp;#34; brush that is in there is so flimsy that I can&#x27;t even consider it a stipple brush… there is absolutely no firm-ness to the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> These brushes came faster than expected.</li>
            <li> Not as quite as I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> ..loved the color pink</li>
            <li> They ended up lasting for a few months</li>
            <li> I have the pink one.</li>
            <li> yes the color is pink</li>
            <li> and i think they ALL are missing one brush, it looks like its one of the tiny ones for eye-shadow but no biggie the rest will deff do it for you</li>
            <li> They came with a chemical like wet paint smell to them.</li>
            <li> The pink packaging smells like spray paint.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;ve only had the set for a few months.</li>
            <li> so they are not perfect but they are definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Mine is a baby pink maybe a shade or two darker.</li>
            <li> so I can do a heavy eye since they only peak through from under the tips of my bangs)</li>
            <li> but that is probably because I pull and squeeze them harder than I</li>
            <li> My brushes and the pink brush holder bag did have a smell like leather and paint</li>
            <li> Just an FYI though, there are few of the same type of brushes within the set.</li>
            <li> Although I have not yet used this product, a few bristles have came out of the big brushes already.</li>
            <li> Brushes are nice &amp; soft, but why does the product stink so so bad?!?!</li>
            <li> I am not saying the stiff ones are bad or unuseful, but they all do the similar thing then why they offer so many of them?</li>
            <li> (I did hand washed my pink bag with some detergent and let it air dry - did get rid of the smell a little bit that day</li>
            <li> Also if the ferrel comes off the handle big deal, just paint on a little nail polish &amp; push those suckers back on, they will stay on after that.hat</li>
            <li> Also if the ferrel comes off the handle big deal, just paint on a little nail polish &amp; push those suckers back on, they will stay on after that.</li>
            <li> The only thing i hate is the smell, they smell to strong like paint</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to other people</li>
            <li> I have to pack my eye shadow on instead of sweep it across the lid due to the fact the product can&#x27;t stick to the brush and it causes a lot of fall out.</li>
            <li> And not to mention pink!</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re excited about having a bunch of &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34;  brushes for this low of a price you&#x27;ll be vey disappointed.</li>
            <li> But when I want pigmented makeup, I have to use my other makeup brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> pink!..</li>
            <li> Based on other reviews, I&#x27;ve seen a lot of complaints about shedding.</li>
            <li> other than that</li>
            <li> Pink!</li>
            <li> one for my self, and other two for my sisters.</li>
            <li> It did have a smell that I read in the other reviews, but I opened it up and the smell is gone now.</li>
            <li> i would have chosen an other.</li>
            <li> If there was one criticism I had to say about the bag that other people might observe as well</li>
            <li> they also feel very rough on my skin.</li>
            <li> I like the big brushes in this set but somehow disappointed with the eye brushes because they are all the stiff ones and there are NO fluffy eye brushes at all in the whole set.</li>
            <li> but after I got them I might just stick with these and replace them easily if they ever get too bad.</li>
            <li> For instance, if I&#x27;m using a black eye shadow, you can no longer see the pink ends of the bristles.</li>
            <li> Not very good brushes, I only use like 3 of them, the rest are craps.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very very soft and i haven&#x27;t noticed them getting thin over time.</li>
            <li> But the small brushes are all FLAT</li>
            <li> cause I wish that few brushes for your eyes could of been fluffy, instead of all pointed and flat brushes.</li>
            <li> They had a certain weird smell to them and took forever to be delivered.</li>
            <li> Also I put a little hair gel on my fan brush while it was wet to make it stiffer</li>
            <li> Also I put a little hair gel on my fan brush while it was wet to make it stiffer</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical when I first ordered these brushes.  </li>
            <li> The eye shadow brushes arent fluffy and they are flat and stiff</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I don&#x27;t believe I received an oblique eyebrow brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While the brushes themselves are soft to the touch, the handles come off as if they were glued with a thin sheet of adhesive.</li>
            <li> with 22 pieces, i have a brush for everything i need, plus some extras for other eye shadow colors!</li>
            <li> They are stiff, not very multi-purpose, and have some repeats.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend, the less you spend, the less the quality.</li>
            <li> for about half an hour, it gave me a headache.</li>
            <li> I knew to expect the smell when I received them because I had read the previous reviews.  </li>
            <li> Half my brushes fell apart,  </li>
            <li> By reading the reviews when i was planning on buying these brushes , i was expecting less than what i got .</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that there wasn&#x27;t a traditional kabuki brush (I&#x27;ve had my first one for years</li>
            <li> Its also slightly shiny.</li>
            <li> I had to deduct half of a star from this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But..they did have an odd odor.</li>
            <li> Came in the mail in less than 4 days.</li>
            <li> Awkward fake leather smell on the case, but it seemed like it was made nice too.</li>
            <li> (I have long black hair with thick bangs that hang to the pupil level</li>
            <li> These synthetic brushes are not a good choice for makeup application because they don&#x27;t pick up enough powder to be affective.  </li>
            <li> I use a shadow primer all the time and still couldn&#x27;t get the product to stick to my eyelid because the brush is not good enough at holding the powder.</li>
            <li> Arrived pretty fast, but on of my brushes was completely broken highly disappointed. .</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re decent for the price, so it wasn&#x27;t too bad of a loss, but these definitely won&#x27;t go the distance.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my sister who is just staying to wear makeup and got a little jealous when it came in, I almost kept it for myself</li>
            <li> They did come with a little funky smell but</li>
            <li> Purchase this a month ago expecting to recieve this just in time for my little sister&#x27;s birthday.</li>
            <li> and the little make up the brushes did pick up</li>
            <li> I just wish the handles were a little shorter.</li>
            <li> That one felt like it was burnt a little</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t so disappointed that only a few brushes had proper plastic protectors; the smaller brushes were just wrapped in disposable plastic.</li>
            <li> only thing is I opened the package and 3 of the brushes were broken.. not cool...</li>
            <li> I suggest any other set of brushes except this one!!</li>
            <li> I gave it a 4 out of 5 stars because it was missing one thing.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not like I have some cheap crap</li>
            <li> i guess it was kinda a waste of money for me</li>
            <li> However, one brush was missing from the 22 piece set.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush set to replace a few brushes I have had for a while.</li>
            <li> But the brush types are redundant.  </li>
            <li> however, the brushes for eyeshadow aren&#x27;t fluffy.</li>
            <li> You will use it everyday if you treat each look and each eye as an outlet for creativity.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> and I probably got a few bristle coming out</li>
            <li> while I need the fluffy ones but not offered any?</li>
            <li> So if you are looking for fluffy eye brushes, look somewhere else &amp; skip this set.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Instead of multiple eyshadow brushes I wish it had a blending brush and thin eye brow brush...</li>
            <li> The quality is absolutely horrible and they are not satisfactory for applying any kind of make up.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
            <li> Got these a few days ago they smell like spray paint and plastic.</li>
            <li> The brushes aren&#x27;t dense at all, so I do think a lot of my makeup goes to waste.</li>
            <li> They are really stiff, all of them,  even the ones that are supposed to be fluffy.</li>
            <li> As other reviews have stated some people complained of a smell coming from the packaging or make up brushes themselves,  but that was not the case with me.  </li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but boy was I wrong!</li>
            <li> the foundation brush is a little too small for my taste.</li>
            <li> Like other reviews the bag smells really bad but the brushes are very soft &amp; I can&#x27;t wait to try them out.</li>
            <li> The only bad brush was the big fan one.</li>
            <li> Other than that, i have no complaints!!!</li>
            <li> The case a small amount of smell but nothing so severe that it can not be tolerated</li>
            <li> I got every brush and the only thing im sad about</li>
            <li> Bottom line is it&#x27;s pointless getting these brushes .</li>
            <li> A lot of repetitive brushes also</li>
            <li> the only thing that i have to bad about these brushes is one of the brushes came loose</li>
            <li> I ordered this to have all the tools to do make up which I&#x27;m not very good at.</li>
            <li> Eyeshadow brushes are very thin and flat, and do not pick up product well.</li>
            <li> they are very stiff</li>
            <li> Really, as hard a I tried these brushes wouldn&#x27;t pick up any useable amount of powder or eye shadow.</li>
            <li> What I did not read in the reviews was how crappy these brushes are, they pick up absolutely NO product and when they finally do, it does not transfer onto your eyelid/ face which was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for these, and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
            <li> I had hoped that it would be at least usable.</li>
            <li> Trying to find a sucker to give them to...</li>
            <li> each brush was in plastic nothing missing or broken</li>
            <li> but seriously it sucks&lt;</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about this product</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not a really good one</li>
            <li> These brushes are complete crap.</li>
            <li> I am in my late twenties, and when I opened it I was as exited as a teenager!</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s very hard to pick up color with them.</li>
            <li> Instead I received and ugly brownish pink set of brushes.</li>
            <li> The product poorly made after two weeks the bristles started to fall out and by the end of month they were bald.</li>
            <li> The eye shadow brushes are not great but can still get the job done.  </li>
            <li> However I did not expect the quality to be this poor.  </li>
            <li> So i re-purposed the ones that weren&#x27;t to thin as painting brushes.</li>
            <li> The brushes end up staining, no matter how much you wash them and look terrible after three uses.</li>
            <li> these ones were not great with both of the sets together</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that when i opened the box they were in, I was hit with this awful paint thinner smell!</li>
            <li> These brushes are not ideal for make up.</li>
            <li> Little disappointed</li>
            <li> i use them everyday and not one thing has went wrong!!</li>
            <li> They are completely useless with eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> really sorry to say that</li>
            <li> 22 pieces for around $15 - you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> well ill</li>
            <li> I might make use out of painting with them, if the fake hairs don&#x27;t keep falling out.</li>
            <li> Useless piece of s</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on the reviews but find this set of brushes 3/4 useless.</li>
            <li> fells like expensive ones.</li>
            <li> Seriously, If you are contemplating on getting these, you will NOT regret it!!</li>
            <li> when I apply the eye shadow slowly through out my application the hairs in the brush fall out . :(</li>
            <li> They shed like crazy.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t mad or anything  </li>
            <li> i was so mad</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like impossible for me to get them to hold product on them.</li>
            <li> The brushes themselves aren&#x27;t so bad.</li>
            <li> the quality was really bad.</li>
            <li> so I ignored the bad comments and bought them.</li>
            <li> is so bad</li>
            <li> bad quality, i don&#x27;t like it</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t want to give them to a friend and the friend be disappointed too.</li>

            <li> Cheap brushes. But Hey you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for...</li>
            <li> love these they are amazing</li>
            <li> Excellent quality for a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> The only thing i hate is the smell, they smell to strong like paint</li>
            <li> Love this brush set! Everything was there when i got it. Perfect condition. Soft nice brushes, i would recommend these to anyone.</li>
            <li> 5 stars for the price of these brushes, I was pleasantly surprised how nice they are! Very pleased!</li>
            <li> I rate it a four star only because when it was shipped i noticed one of the brush bristles already starting to shed. Other than that everything else about the product is top notch. From the brush guards to the beautiful makeup brush clutch, I cannot complain. &#x3D;) I love the color of this product so much. It is just like the picture.</li>
            <li> It got here four days early. They are so soft and the pink bag is cute. I&#x27;m so excited to use these!</li>
            <li> These are soooo good! The bristles r soft and they do not fall out when I was them. The 1 issue I had when I washed these was that, ! handle fell out of the co-joined part where the brush head is attached... I am assuming the glue wasnt very good because I used warm water but not too warm as I was concerned abt burning/melting/scorching the bristles. Over all, these are great to have and the color is a soft glowing pink, they are just adorable! I loved loved loved these. I still have them after 4 years.</li>
            <li> I never knew brushes could be this soft! I always thought the ones I had were great, but these put those brushes to shame!</li>
            <li> Made cheap, my brushes fell apart within two months.</li>
            <li> Too soft for my taste, the fan brushes work nicely, and so do the eye shadow brushes but everything else was way too soft. Especially the foundation brush. It&#x27;s a nice beginner set though.</li>
            <li> Very soft and blends very well!</li>
            <li> got for my sons girlfriend. she loved it</li>
            <li> These are great, use them everyday. Love all of the angles. The fibers do not come out.</li>
            <li> Great brush, smoothness as desired in cosmetic brush</li>
            <li> The color of the brushes I received were off color. Instead I received and ugly brownish pink set of brushes. It looked really cheap, disappointed with first impression. So I immediately had to return.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with my brushes!!(: they are so soft! I received them so fast. They were delivered 3 days after I purchased them!! I am very happy with them. I have not used them yet but I will definitely write another review regarding how they work. I will admit that they did smell like paint when I first got them but I just let them lay out with the bag open and the smell went away after an hour so it wasn&#x27;t that big of a deal. Over all I am very happy with my purchase and very excited to start using them!!(:</li>
            <li> The brushes came right on time and they looked just as they were in the pictures! they&#x27;re really soft and easy to use! no fallout! overall great deal!</li>
            <li> These brushes are so great! They are very soft and none of the hair falls out which is super important! I love them and they are pink!</li>
            <li> it was good in the beginning mostly cause I was excited over them being my first brush pack but after I awhile I realized how cheaply made they are. Bristles fall out easily. On one brush all the bristles came off completely after I cleaned it with brush cleaner. The eyeshadow brushes don&#x27;t do a very good job of applying eyeshadow</li>
            <li> Nice set of brushes.I had the last one from them for 2 1/2 years and they still were ok to use.Just wanted a new set</li>
            <li> Would be perfect but the dark haired brushes started losing hair the first time I used them. Other wise great</li>
            <li> Like other reviews the bag smells really bad but the brushes are very soft &amp; I can&#x27;t wait to try them out. I just like to remind people you get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> The brushes are falling apart! While the brushes themselves are soft to the touch, the handles come off as if they were glued with a thin sheet of adhesive. Ive had to hot glue ALL of them back on.</li>
            <li> They smell a little funky but if you wash them it will be fine. They are also very soft</li>
            <li> I received my order super fast! I&#x27;m very pleased with the brushes and absolutely love the case. The brushes are so soft. The price was great too! My sister is very jealous so I will be ordering one for her soon! Thank you! 👍😃</li>
            <li> Missing the contouring brush expected there to be more different type of brushes least a verity.  next time I will do some research. I&#x27;m not a makeup artist but like to do my make up every now and then</li>
            <li> These are great, especially since there soo cheap. I got mine earlier than expected and I have so many brushes I don&#x27;t even use them all. Great deal and the little case is cute too. :)</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t pleased with these whatsoever. People compliment on how soft they are - which is true - but they are too soft. They are completely useless with eyeshadow. It&#x27;s like impossible for me to get them to hold product on them. Out of the entire set I only use one of the puffy ones to apply my finishing powder...the rest just sit there...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from just sucking in general, two of the brushes broke off from the handle within a week. Methinks it&#x27;s time to go back to Sigma. &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> i thought the pink wrap was cheap looking. the brushes were soft and the bristles didn&#x27;t shed that much when i first washed it.</li>
            <li> This is my first time getting a brush set this big and I am glad I got this. It&#x27;s very easy to apply makeup, very soft and easy to clean. I gave it a 4 out of 5 stars because it was missing one thing. A good blending brush. But besides that, it is a great brush set.</li>
            <li> The product poorly made after two weeks the bristles started to fall out and by the end of month they were bald. Don&#x27;t buy its crap</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my sister who is just staying to wear makeup and got a little jealous when it came in, I almost kept it for myself</li>
            <li> I am a makeup artist so I am pretty picky with my brushes, these nurses did not pick up makeup well. They are very fine and the makeup does not stick to the brush but they are super super cute and a great price. I ended up giving them to my mom as a gift and she likes them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always great when the item comes before you expect it!! The product is Amazing!!  I washed my brushes and they went back to their original form..</li>
            <li> I bought these when I first got into makeup because I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much. A year later I still have all of them and use them every day!! They&#x27;re very soft and user friendly. I&#x27;ve cleaned them a plethora of times with olive oil and soap and they still look great. If you want an inexpensive and high quality brush set that lasts for a long time, this is your set!</li>
            <li> This brushes are more like eyeshadow brushes&amp; blush too , NOT REALLY BLENDING BRUSHES But there great totally recommend them&lt;br /&gt; !!!</li>
            <li> Not a fan of pink, but i must say these brushes are so cute in person. they are so soft!</li>
            <li> These brushes are very soft but also very cheap. There are a few good brushes in the set but for the most part, they do not apply makeup well at all. I would not recommend, the less you spend, the less the quality.</li>
            <li> Its Amazing They are so Soft and the brushes are an Amazing size i would Reperchase this item its worth every penny</li>
            <li> Some brushes were super soft, and some were too stiff to use correctly. Chemical smell of the brush roll goes away after a couple days of exposure.</li>
            <li> Brushes are very pretty and soft, nice color and nice selection. Blush and powder brushes are very flimsy. Eyeshadow brushes are very thin and flat, and do not pick up product well. I would not recommend or re-purchase these brushes.</li>
            <li> I liked it very much yes it comes out easily but it ok for me the brushes r really goood that al that matters</li>
            <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift for my sister so I have not given yet so unsure how they are, but I love the feel of them and hope my sister loves them!!!</li>
            <li> you get a lot of brushes for a great price. They aren&#x27;t top of the line, but I expected that for what I paid. Two sets and only one feral had come off the handle, but I glued it and haven&#x27;t had a problem since.</li>
            <li> The brushes Just came in and the first thing i did was check how sturdy they are. Neither the brushes nor their hair come off when I tug so thats good, BUT the eyebrow brush came un attached which can easily be fixed but still, scares me about the quality of the brushes. All in All they are okay.</li>
            <li> Amazing totally fell in love with the brush set!!.... I recommend it to everyone perfect gift set also ! !</li>
            <li> The wife really likes these brushes. She says they&#x27;re well-made, very soft, and that the pouch roll that they come in is well made.</li>
            <li> The quality is not as I thought.</li>
            <li> i got these brushes for xmas and i just love them! hair doesn&#x27;t fall out when i tugged on them…great brush set! its worth buying them :)</li>
            <li> These brushes came in and yes when you open them they have a smell, but I let it sit open for a couple minutes and the smell went away. Brushes where soft and didn&#x27;t fall apart. the bristles where in a good condition as well.  I would recommend this to other people</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with procedure and receipt of product.  I bought this for my teen daughter and she is sooo happy with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this makeup brush set and i totally love it. It&#x27;s pink, soft and perfect for girls. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> I got what I was expecting it was a gift for my sister and she was happy wen she saw it</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing. I haven&#x27;t had any shedding. You get so many brushes for so cheap!!&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is that this set doesn&#x27;t have is a blending brush. So I just purchased a blending brush for cheap&lt;br /&gt;(http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/seller/at-a-glance.html?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;seller&#x3D;A21DQMWYKNA0PT)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looooovvvveeee these brushes. They are pretty big and the case smells like chemicals/plastic, but that smell goes away after about a week. I received this brush set before expected. Seriously, If you are contemplating on getting these, you will NOT regret it!! You just need a blending brush :)</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes-from the bright bubblegum pink that makes me happy just looking at them, to the super soft bristles, I am very happy with this product. Now I&#x27;m not saying its perfect but you get what you pay for&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had 2 problems with this product&lt;br /&gt;1) That eyebrow comb is redonk-Thankfully I have an extra from a previous set so I didn&#x27;t have to go out and buy another one but seriously it sucks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)I really don&#x27;t like that it doesn&#x27;t have the names of the brushes or even just numbers on them. With a couple trips to YouTube I was able to figure them out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would really recommend this set to any knowledgeable makeup beginners or anyone who just needs some extra brushes for working on friends &amp; family</li>
            <li> They are great! A few single bristles will try to come out but other than that these babies are very good!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it for long but, It doesn&#x27;t shed at all.. I still had to buy some extra brushes because it not in the set but its an awesome start!</li>
            <li> Love it. Nothing about these brushes that i disklike. 😍😍</li>
            <li> Terrible  brushes. Fall apart at first wash and suck at applying makeup. DO NOT BUY!!!!!</li>
            <li> Cute  but the makeup does not get on the bristles. I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Pretty pink handles, soft, also pink tipped and no shedding brushes. Soft, very well made pink case. I like the feel of it.&lt;br /&gt;Great quality! Very pleased!</li>
            <li> For that price it&#x27;s ok but it&#x27;s not a really good one&lt;br /&gt;To many repeat brush I don&#x27;t recommend .</li>
            <li> These brushes are really good quality for the price, can&#x27;t beat it! The bag kind of smells like nail polish remover but that wasn&#x27;t a big deal to me. I love these brushes!</li>
            <li> They all came in tact and the bristles were soft. They smell like spray paint so they need airing out. But hey totally worth the price you get them at :)</li>
            <li> Very soft and work great! Good buy. Haven&#x27;t had any problem with the hairs falling out as others have stated. They did smell a bit funny at first but it went away.</li>
            <li> Great product. It fulfilled its purpose and exceeded expectations that I had. It is perfect for everyone and should be received by all. Great product.</li>
            <li> Really good brushes,the sticks are just really long, they are really soft to my skin and work great. I would recommend these.</li>
            <li> Definitely keep in mind that you get what you paid for. I thought that even if the brushes were okay, it&#x27;s a great price for the amount you get. They are SUPER soft, which is good in some ways (they feel amazing on your skin) and not so good in others (make up application is a little more difficult). The eyeshadow brushes are all pretty much the same, just slightly angled differently from one another, and they are VERY flat, so it might be a good deal if you&#x27;re really hurting for eyeshadow brushes and short on cash or if you want to get started with make up. The face brushes are alright, but I think the pictures are a little misleading as one or more look tapered and they are definitely not; they are more or less different sizes of powder brushes, excluding the wider ones, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of the bag isn&#x27;t super strong, but it&#x27;s there, and I found that after smelling it (it was sitting on my desk while I worked) for about half an hour, it gave me a headache. The brushes carried the smell with it but I washed them before using them and all is well. I tried hand washing the bag, and the smell hasn&#x27;t left, so I believe it&#x27;s here to stay. If so, it&#x27;s kind of a pain because I&#x27;m worried the smell will transfer back to the brushes, and therefore I can&#x27;t use the bag to store them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s not bad, but I didn&#x27;t really have any expectations. I&#x27;d say this should be more like nine dollars instead of twelve, given the type of brushes and smell issue. If it really bothers me, I&#x27;ll just give them over to a friend who is starting out in the make up world and look for better deals on Amazon.</li>
            <li> jeez i just love love love these brushes!! they&#x27;re sooo soft, and despite what other reviews had to say, they are extremely durable!! i use them everyday and not one thing has went wrong!! definitely buy these!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister last year and was so excited to see that they are still her favorite brushes! she said they are still as soft as the day i gave them to her, and they stayed in tact! No pesky brush hairs falling out all over the place! i think i might buy again, this time for myself!</li>
            <li> watch my review for these on youtube !! [...]&lt;br /&gt;I love these brushes ! a few flaws, but they can be fixed. overall a good set of beginner brushes !!</li>
            <li> Well for that price you cant really expect great quality brushes, so they are okay. But they are all basically concealer brushes in different sizes except for a few face ones. The eye shadow brushes arent fluffy and they are flat and stiff so they dont blend. They just look cute.</li>
            <li> Well they are pretty but i don&#x27;t like the brushes, they are soft but they do not cover. But they are a lot of brushes do its good</li>
            <li> Brushes are too flat. They are not puffy like &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; brushes are supposed to be. Would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> The brushes are a lot harder than I would of expected. They don&#x27;t pick up powder eyeshadow very well and have no softness.</li>
            <li> I am in love with my brushes!!! They did come with a little funky smell but that&#x27;s just because of the packaging it goes away!!</li>
            <li> OMG I was amazed to see all the brushes!! And the case is super neat. I recommend to everyone. I&#x27;m not a makeup expert or anything but I can&#x27;t wait to try these out!!</li>
            <li> I was super excited to buy/get these makeup brushes and was extremely disappointed when they came.  I knew to expect the smell when I received them because I had read the previous reviews.  It took about 3 weeks for the bag itself to finally get rid of the smell (just wash the brushes and that smell will leave).  What I did not read in the reviews was how crappy these brushes are, they pick up absolutely NO product and when they finally do, it does not transfer onto your eyelid/ face which was very disappointing. They also are very flimsy and too bendy. For example, the &amp;#34;stipple&amp;#34; brush that is in there is so flimsy that I can&#x27;t even consider it a stipple brush… there is absolutely no firm-ness to the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I probably will not ever use these brushes so this was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my granddaughter, and she is thrilled with it.  She is still experimenting, but we feel buying this collection was a good move.</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes around this time last year and I still have them and they are still just like new! They&#x27;re inexpensive and pretty damn great if you ask me. I&#x27;ve never had any problems with any of these brushes. HIGHLY recomended</li>
            <li> It was supposed to come in Monday and I got it on Saturday. It was a great surprise! The brushes are soft and there was no shedding. I haven&#x27;t used it a whole lot but they do the job. Plus I love the color :) planning on ordering two more as Christmas presents!</li>
            <li> Soooo many brushes to choose from. I purchased the pink one and love it. It is (obviously for the price) synthetic, but works very nicely. I prefer the feeling of natural, but you cannot expect that for this price. It is a great product and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushes just got them and already used them. There soooooooooooo soft. There good quality and are made from natural hair they don&#x27;t irritate my face which i love, because i had that problem with the synthetic brushes, but these are just fantastic. This is something i recommend to anyone who does there makeup on a daily bases.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter as a starter set and was disappointed. Almost all of the brushes are basically the same only a slightly different size. You will not be able to learn any good makeup techniques with these brushes. You&#x27;re better off buying a few inexpensive but different brushes. Plus they smell horrible! Like very toxic paint. They actually gave my daughter a headache. Weeks later it&#x27;s better but still noticeable.</li>
            <li> I use these brushes as a travel set for when not at home. Perfect because the case keeps things organized and clean.</li>
            <li> The color is pretty and the sleeve that holds the brushes is durable. There is a strong plastic smell to it and the hair from the brushes fall off easily. It is decent for new make up users.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend this product. It&#x27;s good for amateur makeup users but don&#x27;t count on getting a good blending brush in this set. Many of the brushes are just flat &amp;#34;packing&amp;#34; brushes, but in different sizes. A few of the brushes broke pretty easily. They&#x27;re decent for the price, so it wasn&#x27;t too bad of a loss, but these definitely won&#x27;t go the distance.</li>
            <li> they dont pick up at all&lt;br /&gt;there cute thats all&lt;br /&gt;wouldnt buy i guess its what i get for the price</li>
            <li> Brushes started to fall apart the 2nd day I had them.</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes for my sister, but they were so great I had to buy myself a set as well. They are very worth the price and the wait for delivery wasn&#x27;t long at all!!</li>
            <li> These brushed arrived and I was so excited but they have really strong smell like paint and it won&#x27;t go away.</li>
            <li> I will honestly say that I was pretty skeptical when I received these brushes in the mail. 22 brushes for under $20 I was like ok some thing&#x27;s up but it&#x27;s worth it...not gonna lie they are AMAZING!! Love love love my brushes!! They didn&#x27;t smell (just of the plastic from the wrapping) I just simply removed the wrapping and washed the brushes with antibacterial soap. The bristles were soft a d fluffy, picked up eyeshadow, foundation, blush great. I absolutely love my brushes! Happy I did chance it about bought them! Thank you spoil much!!</li>
            <li> the brush is made of plastic not hair. few the brush is good but not all for the eye brushes</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this set .. it is nicely made not cheap looking. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Some of the brushes shed a bit but overall I am pleased with the quality. You get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> These brushes came faster than expected. The packaging was wonderful. They are soft to the touch and feel like they are made really well. I was surprised to see that they included almost every brush you could want. Awkward fake leather smell on the case, but it seemed like it was made nice too. I can&#x27;t wait to try these out!</li>
            <li> for the price the quality is great, i know it isn&#x27;t the best out there but it is pretty soft and the smell is okay. it smells like plastic or something. i like it :D</li>
            <li> Half my brushes fell apart,  however I didn&#x27;t expect much considering what I paid. Overall ok brushes</li>
            <li> I ordered these brushes as a &amp;#34;getting started&amp;#34; point. They are so soft! I haven&#x27;t had any problems with them as far as hairs falling out but my powder brush had to be super glued back together at the metal piece. Other than that, i have no complaints!!!</li>
            <li> Purchase this a month ago expecting to recieve this just in time for my little sister&#x27;s birthday. A month later, we never received it. I sent them an email and the only response they gave me was that \\&quot;it was lost in mail and they didn&#x27;t have anymore brushes\\&quot;........ Okay, First of all, it&#x27;s pretty clear you&#x27;re still selling them. Second, after a whole month of making us wait, all you can do is say cancel the order???? Some service....</li>
            <li> The brushes themselves aren&#x27;t so bad. Very good value for the money but the plastic case... Oh my word. The plastic stench coming off the case is really quite ferocious. If you&#x27;re someone easily bothered by strong smells you really should avoid this set.</li>
            <li> They are good brushes but wiped my eye shadow off instead of applying it. They are good quality but like I said, whatever the brush is made of isn&#x27;t my favorite.</li>
            <li> Great deal for getting every size / kind of makeup brush / applicators you could think of.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to store and or travel with you&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased!!</li>
            <li> Cute simple bag adorable brushes, looks just like the picture, the brushes themselves aren&#x27;t that great. Shed a lot and don&#x27;t grab the makeup very well.</li>
            <li> perfect and beautiful</li>
            <li> Not as quite as I expected it to be. It seemed to be a little more plastic then I realized.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first time I bought the whole set of brush. The brush are soft to the skin and is easy to wash.</li>
            <li> I was happy with my products it was delivered very quickly, there are really soft probably it doesn&#x27;t come from a good brand but i love the brushes it was a good price.</li>
            <li> these are nice im no makeup arrtist or anything but they are soft and feel nice on the touch..loved the color pink they are good..totally recomend to buy</li>
            <li> These are great. I bought this for the smaller brushes and its worth it just for them. The large ones are good for a light dusting of powder and not much else because they are so soft. But you get so many great smaller ones I really don&#x27;t mind. The case is good quality too.</li>
            <li> Theses were horrible. The glue inside came loose and all the hair fell out.&lt;br /&gt;Also the quality was really bad.</li>
            <li> I really like it this product, it fill out my expectations, I&#x27;ve used just like 3 o 4 brushes until now, but they still are good</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much, it is 15$. But I was looking forward to use them the minute they came. However, the brushes more on the plasticky side compared to other cheap brushes I own. The pick up of product wasn&#x27;t great either. More of it got lost and stuck in the brush itself more than it did on my eyelids. I wasn&#x27;t satisfied, so I&#x27;m just re selling this to someone else. I suggest elf brushes if you guys want better, and cheap brushes!</li>
            <li> This came as expected and it&#x27;s beautiful but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the best material used for it. It barely picks up my makeup and it&#x27;s not like I have some cheap crap, I have some nice makeup and it barely puts it on my face, but it could just be me. I think make for kids messing around, this would be cute, but not if you&#x27;re serious about your makeup</li>
            <li> Everything looks fine other than it arrived missing one brush. One reviewer mentioned there is an odor to the pink packaging, but that will likely fade.</li>
            <li> Brushes are too soft and do not hold make up on them.</li>
            <li> I knew better, but based on all the positive reviews I forwent my past experiences and ordered these brushes because of their low price. These synthetic brushes are not a good choice for makeup application because they don&#x27;t pick up enough powder to be affective.  Natural bristles are better because they&#x27;re coarser and attract more powder on each bristle. Really, as hard a I tried these brushes wouldn&#x27;t pick up any useable amount of powder or eye shadow. Additionally, one of the brushes broke at the metal attachment to the handle the first week of use,  it can easily be glued back on, but it speaks to the quality of the product.  I gave them 2 stars because there are a lot of brushes for the price and they will make excellent disposable paint brushes for crafts and detailed house painting.</li>
            <li> It was nice and soft. Bristles of the brush had a cute pink too it and it was easy to handle.</li>
            <li> It was  good would&#x27;ve liked different styles, but it was good over all I really liked the color same as the pictures</li>
            <li> These brushes are decent if you do not want to spend alot of money on brushes. They ended up lasting for a few months then the brush broke off the metal part. I cannot complain I didn&#x27;t pay too much for them</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! They are great. The only thing is is that I have had to super glue the handles back to them.</li>
            <li> these are gorgeous to have, and any girl that wants to have some fancy makeup brushes with high quality should buy these.  Make sure you clean them after use, since they&#x27;re white they can certainly stain, but it doesn&#x27;t take away from the fact that they&#x27;re sooooo SOFT!! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> The brushes are Not stiff enough:/ brushes need to be fuller/thicker!  They ok I give it 2 out of 5 stars</li>
            <li> great brush set! Very well made and sturdy. The only thing is that my contour brush with broken the first time I tried it. Otherwise I absolutely love this set!</li>
            <li> first off I would like to say, they shipped fast..... which was good... only thing is I opened the package and 3 of the brushes were broken.. not cool...</li>
            <li> These brushes are very nice, cheap, and worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Overall: They are soft, strong (so far), a nice size for my face.&lt;br /&gt;Face Brushes: The face brushes are the best part of this set and make it very worth buying.  There is a good variety of face brushes which gives you many different ways to apply your products.  They also apply makeup well and are not harsh on your face.&lt;br /&gt;Eye shadow Brushes:  They are good for patting on eye shadows and work well for concealer application too.&lt;br /&gt;Other Brushes: The eyelash and eyebrow combs are good brushes.  I tend to use the eyeliner brushes for my eyebrows and the small size of it works very well for that purpose.  I have not yet used the lip brush with product, but by sliding it on my lips it seems like it would be great for applying products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Overall: They are easily stained because of their color and smell when they come out of the package (though the smell is easily fixed with a wash of the brushes)&lt;br /&gt;Face Brushes: Other then the fact that they are easily stained and you get many of the same concealer brushes I have no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;Eye shadow Brushes:  These brushes are a weak point in the set.  They are stiff, not very multi-purpose, and have some repeats.  The brushes are not horrible or useless but are still not the best because of their stiff nature.  If you are buying this set only for eye shadow brushes I recommend not buying it at all.&lt;br /&gt;Other brushes: My only complaint is that I don&#x27;t believe I received an oblique eyebrow brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: The brushes are good quality overall.  The face brushes alone make the set worth buying and the other brushes are great too.  The eye shadow brushes are not great but can still get the job done.  I would definitely recommend buying.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! They are great brushes for the price. Great value! The awesome pink color doesn&#x27;t hurt either!</li>
            <li> There are no eye shadow blending brushes, and one of the brushes had bristles falling out. but okay for the price.</li>
            <li> two pieces seemed to be missin but i loved the brushes that i did get , thanks , very pretty pink</li>
            <li> The brushes are very well made, no fallout. They transfer pigments very well. Everything came wrapped in plastic so they were all brand new and clean. The brushes make it easy for you to blend your makeup but this set doesn&#x27;t come with an eye shadow blending brush and there are 3 or 4 brushes that are very similar to each other.&lt;br /&gt;The bag has a strong and chemical odor, I threw it out and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend anyone to keep it and instead find another travel case or storage place. The brushes have no odor.&lt;br /&gt;Overall the brushes are definitely worth the price. I would have given 5 stars except for the bag.</li>
            <li> great price for such a good variety of brushes and they are a nice quality too I bring this with me every weekend I spend at my boyfriends and it keeps everything so nice and organized &amp; its PINK &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sturdy, &amp; let&#x27;s face it.... adorable. The face brushes are awesome, the eye brushes are a little too stiff. I have to pack my eye shadow on instead of sweep it across the lid due to the fact the product can&#x27;t stick to the brush and it causes a lot of fall out. I&#x27;d still buy them again.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical when I first ordered these brushes.  I ordered them for my daughter and she is very particular on her brushes but I was extremely happy when they were exactly what she wanted.  There were a lot of brushes to choose from and they were very soft, which is important.  Besides the quality being great, they&#x27;re cute as well.  Not to mention the delivery of this item came earlier than expected!  I would definitely recommend and am thinking about purchasing them for myself.</li>
            <li> There really cheep , they didn&#x27;t hold makeup on I felt like I was just brushing my face the brushes were to soft wasn&#x27;t worth spending money spend it in something useful I would say</li>
            <li> The brushes don&#x27;t hold the make up !! it&#x27;s totally useless all of them!!! I couldn&#x27;t use any of them except the eyebrow brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;yes they are cheap but still such a waste !&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really sorry to say that but it&#x27;s the truth..</li>
            <li> I was kind of hesitant to order the product because I couldn&#x27;t believe the price and shipping, but I was wrong! I received this only three days after ordering it, and I love them! The quality is superb, especially for the price I paid. These brushes are incredibly worth the price I paid, and even more. They are fantastic!</li>
            <li> The brushes work really well for me, the price was excellent and they make the job. Reading the comments and rates i see that some persons tell they didn´t take much product, but for me work it.</li>
            <li> Awesome awesome AWESOME brushes. I was thinking about buying sigma brushes and these would just be for temporary use but after I got them I might just stick with these and replace them easily if they ever get too bad. The price is AMAZING for the quality of brushes you get! They&#x27;re very soft to the touch, easy to clean, and give the impression of professional brushes. And the carrying case is just a plus! I would recommend these brushes to anyone and everyone! Love love love them and don&#x27;t see the point in getting $100+ brushes when I have ones of equal quality!</li>
            <li> Love love love these brushes good quality they don&#x27;t shed,and the color is just overall fun and pretty I tell everyone about this brushes!!! You won&#x27;t regret this purchase!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft. I have the pink one. A few stray strands when it came it, but a relatively great product for the price.</li>
            <li> I can only think of one improvement: state which brush is which and what it&#x27;s used for!!!! Otherwise these brushes are fantastic. They don&#x27;t shed at all! But the makeup stains them easily because of their colour.. Oh well.</li>
            <li> I bought this as gift for my niece who does her own makeup like a professional. She absolutely loves it. It&#x27;s such a great value and pretty too!</li>
            <li> Soft bristles, love the easy roll up back, for the cost these are great brushes for a beginning makeup artist.</li>
            <li> Great simple brushes if your starting out in makeup or just imaging around, not professional grade but good quality!</li>
            <li> I have the sets of brushes, but this is my favorite because they are so cute, soft, and work for everything I need them for.</li>
            <li> Wood handles come off easy had to use hot glue gun to keep them on</li>
            <li> Som elf them are really unuseful. But in all ıt is OK</li>
            <li> excellent brushes... haven&#x27;t even used them all! love them</li>
            <li> I ordered this to have all the tools to do make up which I&#x27;m not very good at. I gave it 4 stars instead of five because I think it should have come with a list of what each brush is for for people like me. I don&#x27;t know what most of them are for. And the case smells from being dyed I guess over time it will fade I know.</li>
            <li> I didnt like how the brushes worked they are very stiff and i just couldnt use them properly i guess it was kinda a waste of money for me</li>
            <li> My brushes had minimal smell (they smelled like new products in new packaging.) I have had a hard time washing these after using them with liquid lipsticks but all eye makeup powders/creams and foundations have come right out. I have not seen any fallout and the brushes seem to be sturdy.</li>
            <li> 22 pieces for around $15 - you can&#x27;t go wrong. The pink wrap case feels cheap, but it is fully functional. The brushes are by no mean &amp;#34;high quality&amp;#34; but they easily get the job well. I would buy again when they wear out.</li>
            <li> These brushes are awesome! I am in love with them. I haven&#x27;t found brushes that I honestly love in a long time. They are very soft. Some of the brushes come with a brush cover. Over all would recommend for someone who is starting out to use brushes.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE the brushes! I still haven&#x27;t even used every single one yet, but they&#x27;re all really nice! Bristles are soft and the variety of brushes is useful for different kinds of make up application.</li>
            <li> My gf loved this !!! She was surprised by the great quality and softness of the brushes, and the wide varieties and the way they are placed inside in a professional way!</li>
            <li> The brushes are great but the case it comes in smells of paint thinner. I haven&#x27;t washed them yet but hopefully the smell will come out. Other than that, they are extremely soft and I looove the pink!</li>
            <li> I Love this set!  It Works great for make up application. The pink packaging is super cute!  Super Great purchase!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great makeup brush set I use it every day to put on my makeup and I love it</li>
            <li> , Love Love Love!!!&lt;br /&gt;They are super soft and work really well (;&lt;br /&gt;one of them did come in two pieces but nothing major i just pushed the brush part back in place, but i think i&#x27;ll blame that on the delivery. I LOVE these brushes so much and the price is GREAT!</li>
            <li> I received my 22pcs Cosmetic Makeup Brushes in the mail today, &amp; I was taking them out of the cute pink bag and one of my brushes the top piece came off. I wasn&#x27;t mad or anything  but I&#x27;ll guess i&#x27;ll just have to super glue it back on, but other then that the brushes are very cute and very soft.</li>
            <li> got it for my friend n she love it!!!!</li>
            <li> These brushes are great I love them! Very affordable for the amount you get.</li>
            <li> I received my item quickly and sooner than expected. It was in great condition and the brushes were extremely soft. The case a small amount of smell but nothing so severe that it can not be tolerated</li>
            <li> The brushes are really soft and good quality especially for the price. And not to mention pink! I use them to do my make up everyday and they are still good as new</li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft and great quality! The packaging had a very plastic scent but has vanished over time. However, one brush was missing from the 22 piece set.</li>
            <li> I knew not to expect actual &amp;#34;Professional&amp;#34; grade quality at this price even though that is what was presented in the description.  However I did not expect the quality to be this poor.  I gave them one star for the appearance. The odor of the &amp;#34;faux leather&amp;#34; bag was so overpowering it gave me a headache.  The odor was like petroleum based which I guess that is what the plastic would be made of but I could not tolerate it at all, I had to pack it back up immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can not say that I would recommend these brushes to anyone.</li>
            <li> They came in their pink bag, really good packaged. All the brushes had their own plastic cover, the hair didn&#x27;t fall. they&#x27;re really soft and there are brushes for everything,  you just need to know how to use them and not make this fact as an excuse to say that they&#x27;re  not good because there are many and you dont know how to use them. if you dont know what they are for, look for a guide that show you what each of them do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Estas brochas vienen muy bien empaquetadas, en su bolsa rosada. Cada una de ella tiene su propio envoltorio plástico. El pelo no se les sale, son muy suaves y este set cuenta con una gran variación de brochas para todo lo necesario. En caso que no sepan para que sirve alguna, Busquen guías en Internet que les muestran los usos de cada brocha.</li>
            <li> This was such a good deal and had other good reviews I thought I would try them out. Boo! They are really stiff, all of them,  even the ones that are supposed to be fluffy. Very cheap, don&#x27;t waste your money, not worth it at all.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!!! The brushes are sooooo soft, great quality, don&#x27;t shed, and are packaged so nicely!!!! They do not shed at all and are so soft! Softer then any brush I&#x27;ve ever felt! I recommend them to everyone!</li>
            <li> Beauty protective case with very well made, soft brushes.  I like the texture of the case and the way you can roll it and tie it.</li>
            <li> All I have to say is, you get what you pay for. Its not quality brushes but its good for concealer or contouring.  All the brushes are flat not rounded.</li>
            <li> love these brushes ! they are so soft , &amp; so cute . absolutely recommend them . i got them like 2 days after i ordered them . MUST HAVE ! the only down side is that , when you clean your brushes , sometimes the makeup stains them , also the face &amp; eyes bruhes don&#x27;t pick up the eyeshadow , or powder that well . other than that it useful , &amp; the case is great . defintely worth 15$ !</li>
            <li> Do not buy these brushes unless you want the hair to be all over your face! If your going to spend money un brushes I suggest any other set of brushes except this one!!</li>
            <li> They are amazing, work perfectly . Great for teens starting out with makeup . They are so soft!A great purchase</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my daughter for her birthday and&lt;br /&gt;These came very fast and are beautiful. They are Great quality.</li>
            <li> Ok if your like me and takes all the comments in consideration for your purchase well ill tell you all about them.&lt;br /&gt;- yes yes the color is pink the package is pink they are supper cute&lt;br /&gt;- they do smell probably the first week just opened them and aired them out. the odor will go away. (odor is not that strong, i dont know why they complain about it)&lt;br /&gt;- i read a couple of reviews and i think they ALL are missing one brush, it looks like its one of the tiny ones for eye-shadow but no biggie the rest will deff do it for you&lt;br /&gt;- They do pick up make up well. i saw some reviews where people complain about this but it also depends what kinda of make up it is. i have mac studio fix and they picked it up just fine&lt;br /&gt;-they are supper supper soft&lt;br /&gt;- a few hairs will fall off the first time you use it but after that it wont.&lt;br /&gt;overall they are freaking great SPECIALLY FOR THE PRICE YOU PAY !!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RECOMMEND IT</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome. I like the cokor and the brusehes are useful a lot. Strongly recommended. he he he he he~</li>
            <li> Super soft brushes ! no hair falls out &amp; no smell to it. Didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star rating because I had to trim some of the bigger brushes since the hair was sticking up.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with these brushes!!! Ok,  so I placed an order for them Friday May 23, and received them today! , Monday the 26. I have already applied make up using already 4 of the brushes,  and let me tell you they work like a charm.  As other reviews have stated some people complained of a smell coming from the packaging or make up brushes themselves,  but that was not the case with me.  NO smell is or has been present. I&#x27;m so glad I purchased these.  Great job seller!  Thank you sooooo much for fast delivery!</li>
            <li> For a long time I&#x27;ve wanted theses brushes, they are super adorable, and I liked the price. They came with a chemical like wet paint smell to them. And after using them a few days the mascara thing came off, and the handle on one of them is loose, also I got a couple brushes that weren&#x27;t the same color as the rest. P.s. The eyebrow brush wast what they showed in the pic.</li>
            <li> By reading the reviews when i was planning on buying these brushes , i was expecting less than what i got . BUT NO when i got these brushes theyyyy wereeee perfectt! So soft it blends everything good i just love it!!!!!❤️</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re getting what you paid for with this one, there are some good brushes in there, like the blush brushes, some eye shadow brushes, and the brow comb things but everything else you pretty much will give to your little sister or use them for crafties.  if you&#x27;re excited about having a bunch of &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34;  brushes for this low of a price you&#x27;ll be vey disappointed.</li>
            <li> i absolutely hated this set! the brushes do not pick up the makeup. they also feel very rough on my skin. and the little make up the brushes did pick up it wasn&#x27;t applied evenly. i do not recommend i guess i got what i paid for</li>
            <li> I read the reviews after ordering this. I had hoped that it would be at least usable. I knew I was ordering something cheap. The make up doesn&#x27;t stay on the brush and it just goes all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The powder brush and the eyebrow brush are probably the only thing useful and those things alone aren&#x27;t worth what I paid for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried wetting one of the brushes and the water bubbled up and the brush felt dry. These brushes are not ideal for make up. I might make use out of painting with them, if the fake hairs don&#x27;t keep falling out. I&#x27;m not angry, I just wish I had listened to the reviews. So, whatever the good reviews are...from make up artists???? - I sincerely question your professionalism.</li>
            <li> they broke way to easy.</li>
            <li> Love my set and the pink matches my hello kitty holders. Whoo!</li>
            <li> I gifted vy surprised to my 14 years old daughter. She wooowed !!!! Thanks a lot and congrats !!! regards</li>
            <li> The bristles are extremely soft. I just wish the handles were a little shorter. But I would recommend because of the quality you get for the price!</li>
            <li> They perform really well. I love the feel of them and the way they are able to apply makeup. Good investment.</li>
            <li> I was so impressed first off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushes were cheap. I paid overall $15&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started my brush collection with these awesome brushes. I have washed them and used them for almost 8 months. let me say that there is no fallout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only thing is if you do use a pigmented eyeshadow (like sugarpill) make sure the wash them right away because they do stain but other than that, I love how they blend in eyeshadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the face brushes pick up blush and powder very nice.</li>
            <li> These brushes don&#x27;t pick the product up very good. You really have to dig.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy these to use with make-up. I bought them to clean my keyboard with. Packaging and shipping were great. The brushes are better made than I expected. They are not flimsy and they are very soft. And I love the carrying case for them. I think the price for them is very good and well worth it. These will last me a lot longer than the aerosol sprays I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li> The chemical smell of these brushes was AWFUL when I opened it. I had to give each brush a good wash with soap before using them. The brushes are cheap, they don&#x27;t hold makeup well, but they get the job done. When I want light makeup, I use these brushes. But when I want pigmented makeup, I have to use my other makeup brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, these are really pretty and great as a gift.</li>
            <li> Packaging and brushes are great some did come undone in the package but nothing a little hot glue won&#x27;t fix love em over all but they aren&#x27;t the best</li>
            <li> I bought this set about 5 months ago. I barely use it. The quality isn&#x27;t great. They shed like crazy. 2 brushes fell apart before I even used them. One of the fan brushes barely has any bristles on it, its super thin. The only reason I give it 2 stars is because a couple eye brushes are OK and I like the color pink. Other than that they feel cheap; you get what you pay for. I wouldn&#x27;t buy these again. ELF studio brushes are $3 each and have way such a better quality.</li>
            <li> Purchased this item for my mom, she needed new brushes and eyeshadow.  She is very pleased, &amp; now she&#x27;s not threatening to take mines.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush set to replace a few brushes I have had for a while. This was my favorite color..pink!.. and it was a great value. It has so many different brushes. Great quality and soft brushes. Comes with a nice bag and each brush has it&#x27;s own slot. It rolls up and ties for easy storage. Please with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Good quality for the price. The brush set needs more fluffy eye brushes though, there all flat like concealer brushes. otherwise pretty nice quality...</li>
            <li> This set is absolutely PERFECT.The bristles feel soft and are flexible,something I look for in brushes.Can&#x27;t wait to use them !</li>
            <li> Love these! Love the color and texture of the brushes. I like that it came with it&#x27;s on carrying case so they stay nicer longer</li>
            <li> It does not pick up even the best pigmented eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> The pink packaging smells like spray paint. Not a fan of the coloring, but they are great brushes!!! Love it</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing! So soft and fluffy and pick up the perfect amount of product. They are so pretty and the pink bag is gorg! Perfect price and you definitely get what u pay for! I recommend these to everyone!!!!</li>
            <li> the brushes reaked of chemicals from the factory. The brushes looked cheap and its been a month since I checked on the brushes, they still stink. Aside from the odor the materials used arent good for applying make up. they are too light to hold onto the powder use for foundation or shadows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;youre better off going to sallys or sephora for a set.</li>
            <li> We bought this for my daughter for her birthday and she is absolutely thrilled with it. It has all the brushes she had wanted and she loves the case they come in as well. Thank you!</li>
            <li> good product, brushes are holding up well</li>
            <li> love them super soft nd fast shipping(:!!!!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes.&lt;br /&gt;So soft buy not too soft so as to soak up the product.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived before time.</li>
            <li> love all of the brushes</li>
            <li> Its affordable and has a good quality.  But the brush types are redundant.  But its ok its just how u use them.</li>
            <li> Every type of brush I would want, terrific quality, unbeatable price!</li>
            <li> I got these brushes super fast and ive been using them every day and i simply love them</li>
            <li> The brushes are SUPER SOFT!! I went through every make up brush set in Amazon and ebay and found these because of the reviews and the price for the quantity. I&#x27;ve VERY happy with my purchase. The cons: the smell it off the package was very strong but it went away after a few hours, so be prepared but don&#x27;t worry. And a couple brushes shredded a little but nothing major.</li>
            <li> I was sooooooo excited to get my brushes in the mail! I was concerned about the real fur thing, but they dont feel like real fur so I was glad for that. I got every brush and the only thing im sad about is that the case and brushes are more of a metallic pink. I really like the soft pink in the picture but what ever. They&#x27;re nice brushes. :3</li>
            <li> For the money you pay, they&#x27;re fine. The brushes are very very soft and i haven&#x27;t noticed them getting thin over time. The only complaint i have is that the tops seem to break off quite easily. I&#x27;ve had 3 or 4 of them break off and i&#x27;ve only had the set for a few months.</li>
            <li> They are the worst.... Threw them out on the first try...... 👎</li>
            <li> I love this kit. It&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushes! I&#x27;ve had them for about a year now and honestly I have never noticed any hair falling out of them. When they arrived they did smell like plastic but it was only from the case and after a good wash they were perfect! I only wish there was a wider variety of brushes but they are very good for anyone who is starting to build up their brush collection. They&#x27;re one of the best buys I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
            <li> She likes.  And when she likes we all when.</li>
            <li> Horribly dissatisfied!</li>
            <li> The brushes arrived on time. They were all soft except one. That one felt like it was burnt a little and I had to trim some of the brushes and some of them came unattached so I had to super glue them. Other than that I absolutely love them. They have no smell and are perfect. Absolutely love them.</li>
            <li> The brushes were cute but that&#x27;s all they were. I sold them because I felt like they didn&#x27;t pick up enough product.</li>
            <li> RECOMMENDED! WORTH THE PRICE</li>
            <li> They do have a strong smell but you should wash them first anyway. I wish it had a stippling brush and a blending brush but overall they are nice brushes.</li>
            <li> These are great. I love them. I was worried when I got them that they wouldn&#x27;t be soft, but they are super soft! I have every type of brush I could need or use! Worth the money!</li>
            <li> The first four brushes from the left including the small fan brush are pretty flimsy and are better suited for dusting excess powder/shadow. The remaining brushes are surprisingly good! The stiffness helps with loading and application. I have used expensive and cheap brushing both for painting and makeup and I am very pleased with this purchase. I was disappointed that there wasn&#x27;t a traditional kabuki brush (I&#x27;ve had my first one for years and it&#x27;s by far the best I&#x27;ve ever had) and that there wasn&#x27;t a liquid liner brush. Based on other reviews, I&#x27;ve seen a lot of complaints about shedding. Shedding comes with every brush--especially if you&#x27;re not familiar with proper care and cleansing; shedding happens either way. I also saw complaints about the smell. The case smells like any brand new product that is packaged in plastic which is nothing to complain about, unless you&#x27;re pregnant. I love the case! It&#x27;s not leather but it does the job which is to hold all of the brushes neatly. I already own brush protectors which help keep the brushes in shape so I wasn&#x27;t so disappointed that only a few brushes had proper plastic protectors; the smaller brushes were just wrapped in disposable plastic. Overall, this is a great set for beginners and experienced artists.</li>
            <li> So cute i love the color on the hair tip &amp; great ariety , perfect for proffesional make up starter.</li>
            <li> They were exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> bought this for my daughter I was worried because she is very selective on her brushes since she is a hair stylist and she just love them.</li>
            <li> i like the softness of the brushes. everything is great. however, the brushes for eyeshadow aren&#x27;t fluffy. i can not achieve a great look with flat brushes.</li>
            <li> its okay some are brushes are really useless because they aren&#x27;t strong enough they bend to easy (the bristles) So i re-purposed the ones that weren&#x27;t to thin as painting brushes. The big fluffy one is nice</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister for her birthday. I thought it would be a good set for someone just getting into makeup, however I bought a more expensive brand for me. This one is definitely comparable quality! Only way more soft. Plus it has every brush you will ever need.</li>
            <li> ii took a while before i received them, but when i did get them i liked them havent tried them yet, but i love the hair is soft and full and they do not fill flimsy i havent used yet because they have a strong odor, and they must be washed im a very busy hair dresser and make up artis i havent had the time but i do have other brushes im using, overall i like the look they are super cute, i think is a great price! i will order again.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> the product was great for its price. the brushes were soft and beautiful. it came with a organizer bag. I would really recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> Not Mac but if you can&#x27;t afford Mac these ate great picks up make up really good also blends well and you get a variety of brushes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fall in love with this set, it&#x27;s amazing!!! looks better in person, it come on time perfectly, very good quality and softness, I would recomend this items, i really love it!!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about this product but when I received them they were amazing! they are pretty and made with good material. you can wash them as many times as u want. they are great!</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re really cheap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are scratchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t realized how spoiled I was with &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; brushes until I got these. The difference is HUGE!&lt;br /&gt;Also, they&#x27;re really bulky when you roll it up. I found use for them as spares in my emergency work kit and travel kit, but other than that save your money and buy the cheap ones at Target (yes - even those ones are a million times better than these.)</li>
            <li> They Broke. Its Like they used hot glue and I was putting on my eyeshadow and it snapped</li>
            <li> Love these brushes . I wish there was more brushes for eye shadow seems like this is more of contouring set but love how they feel.</li>
            <li> When I just saw them in the picture it was love at first sight, for a girl that loves pink just as much as I do it was the perfect brush set. When they arrived I noticed the color is slightly different from what it appears on the photo (more like a bright pink or light purple), and the pink bag smells funny (strong smell plastic) other than that, this is the softest brush set I´ve ever had. Definitely worth for the price :)</li>
            <li> Lovely set, easy to transport</li>
            <li> FUNCTIONAL MAKEUP BRUSH SET. WORK FINE BUT NOT LIKE PROFESIONALS BRUSHES</li>
            <li> To see what I use each of these brushes for read my blog post:&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had high hopes for these but I do realize they are an extremely low cost set so they are not perfect but they are definitely worth the money. The face brushes don&#x27;t pick up product well, the type of fibers they used are too slippery. I was able to get a light application of blush so that&#x27;s nice, especially if you tend to be heavy handed. It wouldn&#x27;t really pick up loose powder at all. I&#x27;m going to try spraying the ends with MAC Fix+ or the similar one by elf and see if I have better luck. I think these would be good for applying a light dusting of shimmer highlight to your cheekbones. None of the brushes are great for applying eyeshadow or blending, they are more the type for applying cream eyeshadow or highlight. You might be able to use the flat eyeshadow brushes for packing on color, if it is a high pigmented shadow. They would work great wet to get a nice defined edge. These type of stiff flat brushes are great for concealer, primer, cream products, lipstick, gel liner, etc. so you will have a whole array of brushes to fill out your brush collection for that stuff but you will probably need to pick up a few better eyeshadow brushes, especially for blending, as there is nothing in here that works for that. The little square brush is for tight lining your lashes, where you pack on gel eyeliner right into your lash line for dark, luscious lashes. All in all, I am glad I bought these, it is a great starter set or to fill out your collection but you will need to supplement a few other brushes to be really happy with your makeup application. I have 6 different brush sets and I recommend first picking up the Real Techniques Core Collection for face brushes and the Starter set for the eyeshadow brushes. The Elf Studio Brushes are amazing and you can often get them for 50% off, making them $1.50 a brush. If you are like me and you want multiples of every brush this is a great set for that but I just wish it had some softer fluffier eye brushes for blending and eyeshadow. Still an amazing deal and so cute with the pink tips!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**EDIT** I decided to try these brushes exclusively as if they were my only brushes and I was able to improvise and get a nice application of makeup. Be open minded and you can use some brushes for other uses than they are intended, for example I packed on a crease color with a small \\&quot;eyeshadow brush\\&quot; and blended it out gently with the fan brush. Be gentle and build up color, yes the small brushes are fairly stiff but if you use a light hand they will work very well. Foundation brushes work great for sweeping away fallout and also perfectly blending out an eyeshadow wing if you do a smoky eye. ;) Also I put a little hair gel on my fan brush while it was wet to make it stiffer and now it is much better for sweeping away fallout. Spraying a little Fix+ works very well with these brushes to make a precise application of color. This set is an excellent value and it may not be my preferred brushes but not everyone wants to spend a lot of $$$ on this kind of stuff. I&#x27;m upping my rating to 5 stars because if you are willing to give these a chance and think a little outside the box I think you will be happy with these. Also if the ferrel comes off the handle big deal, just paint on a little nail polish &amp; push those suckers back on, they will stay on after that.hat but I just wish it had some softer fluffier eye brushes for blending and eyeshadow.

            <li> Don&#x27;t buy them. They&#x27;re really cute . Pink! I love pink! But the small brushes are all FLAT you can&#x27;t use them to blend your eye shadow. Bottom line is it&#x27;s pointless getting these brushes . A lot of repetitive brushes also</li>
            <li> These brushes are very nice, the pink color is very pretty!! The eye shadow brushes could be better they also could have added a blending eye shadow brush but overall work well for me.</li>
            <li> Useless piece of s***</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t ever write reviews about products but these brushes deserve that and so much more! I have bough sets of 5 brushes at Sephora for 30 and here I got 22 brushes for about $10. I can honestly say leaving the price aside that these brushes are the most amazing and lovely I&#x27;ve ever had, better than high end designer or bran brushes. They are SOOOO SOFT and AMAZING!! not to mention the look soooo sooo cute, the handle feels like wood and it has a lovely color, the brushes themselves are white with pink tips just like in the pictures but I was honestly blown away by how soft and gentle they are!! They work amazing! My all time favourite!</li>
            <li> Good enough for the price.</li>
            <li> If you are questioning whether or not to buy this product, I definitely would. For the price the product is great in my opinion. I would have loved this as a gift when in high school! I am in my late twenties, and when I opened it I was as exited as a teenager! But, I also REALLY I love makeup. The little leather case that it came in is absolutely adorable; it looks well constructed. Mine is a baby pink maybe a shade or two darker. Its also slightly shiny. The brushes are super soft. Some of the larger brushes come with a little plastic case over the bristles to keep them in place, and I thought that added to the value of the item in general. I did not notice a smell.There is a ton of different size eyeshadow brushes which is my favorite type of brush.  I like giving depth to my eye look, and I use layers of colors to acheive this when I do my trademark &amp;#34;Cleopatra&amp;#34; eye. (I have long black hair with thick bangs that hang to the pupil level so I can do a heavy eye since they only peak through from under the tips of my bangs) I typically use six or seven colors in the different areas of the eye (bright inner corner, light or bright lid, crease, upper crease, transition color, highlight brow area, and dark outer area that meets the wing of the liner) while overlapping and blending throughly the middle section. There is so many sizes that you can keep one brush for one color so you do not have to keep wiping the brush clean in between color changes. The softness and varying lengths of the brushes allows for seemless blending with the various types of shadow I have used: matte, shimmery, loose pigment, pencil, liquid/wet. I almost always do a cut crease look with a dark color blended out toward outer eye fading to a light color, and these brushes make it seem like I finish faster; with so many sizes it is easy to choose just the right one for the placement of the shadow and that gives me control to get the precise look that I am trying to achieve. You will use it everyday if you treat each look and each eye as an outlet for creativity. By using shadows as paint, your brushes do the dodging and burning, making highlights and shadows, enhancing the beauyy naturallybfound in eyes. To me eyeshadow is like a costume my eyes wear for a day.everyday if you treat each look and each eye as an outlet for creativity.

            <li> The bag it comes in is beautiful the brushes are just stunning! Ilove the feel of the brushes! never need to worry about keeping up with your makeup brushes again! Perfect for travel &amp; to leave on your counter or vanity rolls up very compact.One of my favorite things I own!!!</li>
            <li> Nice set of brushes! My only complaint is that when i opened the box they were in, I was hit with this awful paint thinner smell! Thankfully its the bag that smelled and not the brushes!</li>
            <li> These are the first cosmetic brushes I&#x27;ve used to put on makeup and I think they work well. There are a LOT of brushes and I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use every one yet, but they are soft and beautiful. The bag they come in is a cheapy-feeling material, but it&#x27;s cute! I wish it was easier to close the case and keep the brushes more secure, but it works for what I need.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use most of the brushes that came with this set but for the price, it was worth it! Some name brand brushes cost more than this whole set did for only one brush!</li>
            <li> I PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE OF THE PRICE AND I LOVE PINK. THESE BRUSHES DO THEIR JOB AND SO FAR I HAVENT EXPERIENCED ANY SHEDDING WHICH IS ALWAYS A GOOD THING.</li>
            <li> These brushes SUCK. I hate that I bought them. They do not pick up makeup hardly at all and what they do pick up doesn&#x27;t apply to the face very well....the brushes do not blend (I used my regular &#x27;old&#x27; brushes and tried to use these at least to blend) but they didn&#x27;t even blend. Waste of money. Period. Trying to find a sucker to give them to...I don&#x27;t want to give them to a friend and the friend be disappointed too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these for about 6 months already and they still work like brand new :)</li>
            <li> Brushes stick to the brush roll, and the lining of the brush roll comes OFF onto the brushes. Have the hair of almost ALL the brushes come out EVERYWHERE. Have have the metal separate from the handle. Waste of money</li>
            <li> this was a Christmas gift.  It looked good and seemed to be appreciated.  I have not heard how it worked.</li>
            <li> They fit my every need. I looved at about 500 brush sets on Amazon, and was weary to choose this one, as I am INCREDIBLY picky about everything, especially my brushes. with 22 pieces, i have a brush for everything i need, plus some extras for other eye shadow colors! It came earlier than expected, and was beautifully packaged. I used them immediately. The brushes are so soft, yet really grab the product and blend amazingly.The eyeshadow brushes come in different shapes, sizes, and firmness. Which i really love a firm eyeshadow brush and this is what I am the pickiest with. I think my favorite by far, though was the powder brush. I use the super BB powder by physicians formula and most brushes will apply this powder and make it look cakey. The powder brush in this set was so soft, it gently whisped my powder on and set my makeup beautifully. I could not be any happier with this set. Worth double the price!</li>
            <li> Not a thing to dislike about this product, very affordable. I am a makeup artist and i use these brushes. Good investment and would buy more</li>
            <li> The brushes are nice not as soft as I thought they would be, but still very nice. The only problem would be that it took very long to receive them. However I already expected it since I did not pay extra for it to be delivered faster. So when you consider the price it doesn&#x27;t matter much, unless you want them or need them soon.</li>
            <li> Really cute brushes priced very fair haven&#x27;t used them all but so far so good only three starts because they are a bit softer than I need to blend and etc</li>
            <li> Just received my new brush set today, I can honestly say I love them.  I love the pink color and the bag, I did a whole face, they are extremely soft and I had no problem picking up eye shadow or face powder.  I have 3 toddlers and wanted a complete brush set without spending a lot and this was the perfect choice.  I used to work for Lancome and no, these are not professional quality brushes but again I had no trouble getting the look I wanted with them. Would def. recommend these brushes to anyone needing a new set who dosn&#x27;t want to or can&#x27;t spend the money on a professional set.</li>
            <li> What I did like about these brushes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) They are really soft (much softer than EcoTools, E.L.F, and Real Technique - in my opinion)&lt;br /&gt;2) They pick up powder pretty well (comparable to E.L.F.&#x27;s brushes) - it gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;3) Inexpensive (got mine for $14.16) - will purchase for my niece as these would be perfect for her!&lt;br /&gt;4) Really cute \\&quot;metallic rose-pedal\\&quot; colored handles (I was expecting them to be more of a pink color like shown in the picture but it is actually like a pink/purple-ish color - not a big deal though.  Also, the face brushes have big handles so that was a plus)&lt;br /&gt;5) Bristles doesn&#x27;t shed when washing them (I have washed some of them already three times in just a week and I probably got a few bristle coming out but that is probably because I pull and squeeze them harder than I should)&lt;br /&gt;6) The brush seems pretty secured to the handle - there are some MINOR imperfections such as in three of my brushes there were alittle glue on the handle, but also not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I had to deduct half of a star from this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) My brushes and the pink brush holder bag did have a smell like leather and paint (I did hand washed my pink bag with some detergent and let it air dry - did get rid of the smell a little bit that day but the next day I did spray a little of Febreze on it and let it air dry for about 2 more days and the smell was nearly gone)&lt;br /&gt;2) If you don&#x27;t wash the brushes right away, it does stain the brush (I use baby shampoo to clean my brush normally but did also had to use some Dawn dishsoap which seems to remove the powder and foundation off the brush nicely)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to use one of the large face brush for foundation because I don&#x27;t really like the actually foundation brush since it leaves noticeable lines and doesn&#x27;t blend well (but I have this probably with all my foundation brushes).  I think OVERALL, this product is good and comparable (if not slightly better) to E.L.F&#x27;s standard brushes.  I got mine with Amazon Prime so I didn&#x27;t have to pay shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to know more about this product please comment below and I&#x27;ll try to answer back as soon as possible.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time.Good quality but they are very soft. Some brushes come with covers. Not a bad purchase for the price. I was satisfied.</li>
            <li> i love these brushes! no complains... i use em everytime and they are great except some cause my dog ate them! i was so mad but anyways they are really cheap for all these brushes i totally recommend them!</li>
            <li> I like the big brushes in this set but somehow disappointed with the eye brushes because they are all the stiff ones and there are NO fluffy eye brushes at all in the whole set. I am not saying the stiff ones are bad or unuseful, but they all do the similar thing then why they offer so many of them? while I need the fluffy ones but not offered any? So if you are looking for fluffy eye brushes, look somewhere else &amp; skip this set.</li>
            <li> I love these makeup brushes, good quality. I like the color soft pink, 22 brushes to choose from. I&#x27;m a beginner in the makeup department and these brushes works perfectly. I&#x27;ve used them a lot and I&#x27;ve had no problems with shedding. A great product for the price. They arrived on time, packaged with care. The seller was great, I will recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Small brushes were unnecessary but overall very pleased! Would purchase again!</li>
            <li> Have not used all but the ones I have used are perfect. they don&#x27;s clump, they are soft and I love using these brushes when I do my makeup.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Use it everyday.</li>
            <li> They break easily wouldn&#x27;t recommend it at all!!</li>
            <li> there is a lot of brushes, most I don&#x27;t even know what to do with! I do not like the color of the brushes my make up is very visible and you can clearly tell which ones I&#x27;ve used and which ones I haven&#x27;t. the foundation brush is a little too small for my taste. HOWEVER the brushes are great quality and a bristle hasn&#x27;t fallen off on my face so I&#x27;m very pleased with that!</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft, and lovely. Some of the larger brushes have a lot of bristles coming out, which kind of stinks. However over all a great price for so many brushes, and the case is very convenient.</li>
            <li> Love this brush set, I&#x27;m already using it and they all work great. Very soft, and good coverage. I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This was a pretty packaging! I loved the brushes on them. They were really soft and great for applying makeup. Little disappointed cause I wish that few brushes for your eyes could of been fluffy, instead of all pointed and flat brushes. I like to blend my eye shadow make up for a natural look to smokey eyes. But I still enjoy it and use it everyday.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft and not rough or harsh on mmy sensitive skin. Love love love love them!</li>
            <li> Looked a bit different then the picture,but they are still cute &amp; work pretty well. But..they did have an odd odor. &amp; also it seems like they sent a lot of the same brush.. Still great for the price.</li>
            <li> came in perfect condition. so soft and sturdy and very pretty. i really like the case. nothing fancy but its a pretty color and does its job protecting the brushes and makes them easy to travel with. overall great product, worth the price.</li>
            <li> Okay so I was really excited to get these because they&#x27;re pink and very cute, but I was somewhat disappointed. Yes, the brushes are very soft, but almost too soft to where they don&#x27;t pick up much color and are hard to blend with. They give a very light application. My main complaint would be about the eyeshadow brushes. They&#x27;re synthetic (made of the same type of smooth stiff material foundation brushes are made of) so it&#x27;s very hard to pick up color with them. There is no blending brush, and a lot of the angled brushes are a bit too big to use on normal eyes for your crease. I tried using these while my normal makeup brushes were drying after washing them and it took a lot longer to do my makeup with not as good of color payoff. I&#x27;d say these are okay for beginners or as a backup set. Not a total waste of money and I can&#x27;t complain too much for the price but won&#x27;t be reaching for these as much as I&#x27;d hoped after reading the rave review on here    Edit:  I now use the \\&quot;eyeshadow\\&quot; brushes as concealer brushes and for contouring and highlighting with creams and they work great!!</li>
            <li> I love these. I have been using them for quite awhile now. They are a sturdy set for beginners.</li>
            <li> thumbs up. great set to purchase. has so many brushes to choose from. Good quality great price.&lt;br /&gt;would buy again. But from another site!</li>
            <li> These bushes are really pretty so I ignored the bad comments and bought them. They got here early and well packaged but they don&#x27;t exactly work well. They are really soft, but very stiff and don&#x27;t pick up eyeshadow or any powder very well at all. Just about the only thing they are good for is the eyeliner brushes which you can buy just as good elf one&#x27;s for $1. So I wouldn&#x27;t suggest these.</li>
            <li> The set comes with a lot brushes. The bigger brushes are soft, but the smaller eye shadow brushes are more stiff. I do like the variety of angles and sizes so I will have use for them.</li>
            <li> the are ok too soft didnt really workout for me  it was a few things i liked in the kit tho but overall it was ok</li>
            <li> Such a great deal and you get so many brushes!!! And the brushes hold up very well after you washed them! Would definitely recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> Brushes are supper soft... The only reason why I didnt give 5 stars is becuase I wish it had more variety... Instead of multiple eyshadow brushes I wish it had a blending brush and thin eye brow brush... Overall I would highly recommend..</li>
            <li> The first thing that happened was all of the bristles fell out of one of the brushes. Nice. Pick a different set.</li>
            <li> What can you spect when you bye cheap stuff.&lt;br /&gt; Well i think they are worth the price..&lt;br /&gt; Not the best thing.  But good</li>
            <li> I bought this item for myself but gave it to my daughter as a gift. She says she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> Great quality brushes, they don&#x27;t shed like most. They look exactly like the picture!! I definitely feel confident using these brushes on my clients!! :)</li>
            <li> I could not stop putting these on my face, there sooooo soft! Just an FYI though, there are few of the same type of brushes within the set.</li>
            <li> These brushes are beautiful! I love them! C:</li>
            <li> These brushes are complete crap. Do not waste your money on them! The quality is absolutely horrible and they are not satisfactory for applying any kind of make up. I am a make up artist so I love playing with different eyeshadows and techniques -- these brushes are not great. They would be fine for a child who likes to play with her mommy&#x27;s old make up. The brushes end up staining, no matter how much you wash them and look terrible after three uses. Save your money. I ended up buying the ecotools brushes and they are much better quality!</li>
            <li> Love the brushes but 1 or 2 of the heads have fallen off before</li>
            <li> I love my brushes they are so soft and there is so many of them! They don&#x27;t shed but since this was my first makeup brush set I have learned not to wash them with the soaps I used they messed them up. I&#x27;ll be buying a backup case soon!</li>
            <li> What a waste of money. I purchased this based on the reviews but find this set of brushes 3/4 useless. It comes with many tiny brushes that have no use, and the ones that have a descent size don&#x27;t pick the powder and shadows at all. I use a shadow primer all the time and still couldn&#x27;t get the product to stick to my eyelid because the brush is not good enough at holding the powder. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one. Like I said I threw more that half to trash can. Do yourself a favor and get something from a popular bland. I ended up buying a more expensive 5 piece set of brushes but it is worth it because I use them all. You get what you pay for.. :-(</li>
            <li> I just received my item and I love it. Not only it&#x27;s ine of my favorite colors, the brushes amazingly soft. I love the case and how it wraps up do neatly. I would definitely try more items from this company...</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. They are my first brush set and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. They have changed the relationship I have with makeup, making it easier to put on and making it look flawless. The hairs are incredibly soft. The color is too cute and I always get asked where I got them from.</li>
            <li> The brushes are really soft and stiff which makes applying makeup so much better. It does smell of chemicals: it reminds me of the gooey plastic you squeeze out of a tube, stick onto the end of a straw and blow into a bubble lol. But the smell doesn&#x27;t prevent the set from serving its purpose so I can deal with it. The color is cute, too.</li>
            <li> These are great quality brushes ! So worth the money. Very happy with them</li>
            <li> glue didn&#x27;t hold the brushes together well but other than that it&#x27;s a great product !!</li>
            <li> I LOVE these brushes. They are so soft and the assortment is impressive, makes me feel like a real pro artist. On top of that they are so pretty they look nice just sitting in my bathroom Lol The metallic pink metal has a nice finish and the pink tips on the white brissels really make them pop. So cute!!! Love the pearl pink case too. Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> i love it. i bought three of the makeup brushes set. one for my self, and other two for my sisters. it was good</li>
            <li> not good for eye shadow get real hair brushes for that and not synthetic, but good for blending esp. love the fanned one</li>
            <li> Not the best brushes , they barely pick up any product. Although they are super soft.</li>
            <li> These brushes are absolutely amazing! I had high hopes for these, and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. As a self taught makeup artist, and someone who applies makeup every day, these are perfect for me. The brushes are insanely soft, and good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downfall I can think of is that the case that comes with it has a very strong paint smell, but that dissipates after a few hours or so.</li>
            <li> Pretty decent products compare to what you pay. The brushes are soft, but not firm. Colors are pretty. I bought for my mom, she likes it!</li>
            <li> I expected a set of medium/small brushes but received nice big brushes.  These a soft and amazing.  My best friend saw them before they had been used the first time and almost stole them!</li>
            <li> It did have a smell that I read in the other reviews, but I opened it up and the smell is gone now. The brushes are super soft,&lt;br /&gt;and for the price I&#x27;m satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;Warning though, the hairs on the brush kind of shed, so you have to use them delicately, but not complaining because they are a cheap price compared to other expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> they brushes are soooooo soft! i would order another pair or a third. they do have a strong odor of paint but go away after washing them</li>
            <li> great brushes. does a great job on packing on the eye shadow</li>
            <li> I bought two one for me and my nice and there so soft the smell of the packaging only lasted like for a day I can no longer smell it and I love the color there grate just let them air out..</li>
            <li> Very cute &amp; inexpensive. Brushes are nice &amp; soft, but why does the product stink so so bad?!?! Guessing it&#x27;s the roll up bag it comes in. 😣</li>
            <li> Over all I am satisfied with this product. Came in the mail in less than 4 days. Although I have not yet used this product, a few bristles have came out of the big brushes already. The smaller brushes are fine though! It&#x27;s good quality for the price I paid for them so I would recommend to a friend!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter. She absolutely loves it. I can&#x27;t believe how many brushes there are. And the case is strong and thick with a shiny pink fabric - very girly. Excellent buy. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Got these a few days ago they smell like spray paint and plastic. Aside from the smell the brush bristles are soft but not even, some are longer than others. The handles are cheap, made of wood and painted over, they just don&#x27;t look or feel nice.</li>
            <li> i did not  like these brushes at all. they feel rough and kind of sting against your face. Also the hairs on the brushes keep falling out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a couple months now and have used 3 pieces out of the whole thing.  Each piece has been used maybe a handful of times, I&#x27;m not someone who wears makeup much.  One of the powder brushes have already separated from the wooden handle.  The quality is what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Amazing bought these thinking they would be good for travel and for other people makeup but I love and use them all the time</li>
            <li> I Love these brushes they took awhile to come but when they did love them their soft pretty haven&#x27;t used them yet but I&#x27;m sure the work great</li>
            <li> I have had these brushes for a few months now and Im very happy with them. They are easy to clean and they are soft. When they first came they smelled like plastic but I just left them out of the case for about 2 days and the smell went away. the only thing that i have to bad about these brushes is one of the brushes came loose and i had to re-glue it. Over all i recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li> This product is great, you can tell the difference when you use brushes for makeup. I really love this item</li>
            <li> These are really cute, and work well enough. Definitely not professional, though. I only give it three stars because it is advertised as professional. The brushes are nice enough, and I&#x27;m happy with them as they are.</li>
            <li> I got the brushes about a week after I bought them they came packeged very well each brush was in plastic nothing missing or broken I love the pink and the way the brushes look and feel they are very soft but not the best quality the powder and concealer brushes I won&#x27;t be using but other than that they are great I bought another set of brushes just in case these ones were not great with both of the sets together i have the perfect set</li>
            <li> It gives me exactly what I needed to do my makeup. Thank you!</li>
            <li> overall it is a pretty good product comes with whats shown and comes in a timely manner, i barely use any of these brushes but it was worth the 14 bucks</li>
            <li> Pure garbage. I used once and regretted I bought it.</li>
            <li> These are an ok into brush set but the smaller brushes have had some shedding. I still get a lot of use from them.</li>
            <li> Extremely soft i love it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell is so bad</li>
            <li> Good price cute but kind of cheap cause the brush separated from wood handle.</li>
            <li> the Quality of the hair on the brush its self is cheap but it came very fast and i love the clolor</li>
            <li> Very pretty brushes but I didn&#x27;t think it picked up enough product on the brushes. I sold them and is just going to get another set. some people said that there was a &#x27;smell&#x27; honestly I didn&#x27;t think there was a smell.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t I think I can go a day without using more then one...</li>
            <li> Not very good brushes, I only use like 3 of them, the rest are craps. they are so flimsy</li>
            <li> It is cute and the pink looks nice. But it has too little brushes and the top is too small as well. But it will fit in your makeup box perfectly.</li>
            <li> I have had it for a long time now, hairs have not fallen. Did not stink when it came it, Good packaging, I really liked the color. Except some brushes are too stick to be considered as a blending brush. Great for beginners, and no problems with applying makeup, I love them. Super soft!!!</li>
            <li> Lots of good choices for makeup application.</li>
            <li> Arrived pretty fast, but on of my brushes was completely broken highly disappointed. .</li>
            <li> This brushes are to flimsy. Not condensed enough to get a good use out of them. They had a certain weird smell to them and took forever to be delivered.</li>
            <li> what an amazing set...I just love it</li>
            <li> If you are a beginner or just need some brushes for light makeup application these will suffice. They are not very high quality and not dense at all. I only use about 5-6 on a regular basis but do like the case when I travel.</li>
            <li> They are pretty &amp; all BUT don&#x27;t feel soft ennought on face! But overall do the job.</li>
            <li> The face brushes don&#x27;t pick up that much product.</li>
            <li> The pink bag had a very strong smell when it first arrived. The smell is gone now. The big brushes are ok, but the smaller eyeshadow brushes are not soft enough to make pretty gradient mixes. I know now how to deal with them though, took some practice! in a few of the brushes the aluminium fitting was set wobbly on the wooden handle, so I had to glue them. If I had to it do it again i would have chosen an other. Nevertheless I have them so I use them they are ok.</li>
            <li> I threw these away, does not pick up the make up at all!</li>
            <li> Pretty to look at and I like the pouch but I don&#x27;t like the quality of the brushes. They are smooth for a brush and couldn&#x27;t hold much make up and bad at doing the job.</li>
            <li> Product is exactly like pictured and described. Packaging was great for shipping, each individual brush had plastic wrap. I would recommend this product to anyone looking to try to apply studio makeup style. A great price for a starter brush kit. Has every kind you may need.</li>
            <li> bad quality, i don&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li> My daughter really likes the makeup brushes and uses them every day</li>
            <li> el pelo de los pinceles se sale &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> Softer then I wanted and doesn&#x27;t hold make up well.</li>
            <li> The brushes are great for this price. It&#x27;s super soft and lasted me for a long time too... So far, nothing came off yet. (after 3 months)</li>
            <li> Three of the brushes broke right away.  It is a cheap product and cannot recommend it.  Bummer!</li>
            <li> Good brushes just don&#x27;t seem to pick up powders as well as other brushes</li>
            <li> These are really good brushes and they don&#x27;t flake of on my face witch is good. I love them they are so soft and cute.</li>
            <li> Nice product and great price!</li>
            <li> its nice, bought it for my friend, she thinks its ok!</li>
            <li> Nice wish their were more shadow brushes</li>
            <li> I bought these over a year ago and they still have held up! Granted i&#x27;ve had to glue some of the heads back on, but that&#x27;s not really a big deal! The bristles are as good as new! I would definitely recommend these!</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for! I&#x27;ve bought a set almost exact to this one from amazon before and those were a lot better and had more of a  variety of brushes. Was not to pleased with these but they weren&#x27;t very pricey either so I guess I can&#x27;t really say I expected too much out of this set.</li>
            <li> SOFT SOFT SOFT you will not belive how soft they are . fells like expensive ones.</li>
            <li> girlfriend loves those brushes</li>
            <li> I was so surprised at how cheap this was and I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but boy was I wrong! I got this in pink and it&#x27;s just amazing! The roll out bag is really cute! It&#x27;s a nice pearly pink and it really smooth, almost like leather. If there was one criticism I had to say about the bag that other people might observe as well, it&#x27;s that you have to physically tie the bag to keep it together. The ties are really long, so you have to wrap it around a couple times and then tie it which can be time time consuming, but something that doesn&#x27;t really bother me. It&#x27;s really convenient to take it on the go with you if you&#x27;re traveling. It rolls up slim, so it&#x27;s easy to store in your bag without it taking up a lot of room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are amazing as well! The bristles are nice and smooth and the pink colored tips make it stylish. The handles feel sturdy and no signs of any paint or anything chipping away. I&#x27;m not even sure it&#x27;s painted because the finish is really well done and has a nice matte finish to it. It has all kinds of brushes from eye shadow brushes, powder brush, eye liner smudger, and whatever else you can think of. I use this set all the time and I get a lot of compliments on it! Another thing I discovered is that the brushes stain easily. For instance, if I&#x27;m using a black eye shadow, you can no longer see the pink ends of the bristles. However, I just use some dish washing soap and a little bit of water and it gets off most of the eye shadow, but sometimes there is still a little bit of stains let. I guess that&#x27;s to be expected from a white brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m really glad I got this set. It&#x27;s good for both professional and personal use and really easy to travel with. Getting this set actually motivated me to put on my makeup in the morning since I&#x27;m not a morning person. It&#x27;s really chic, stylish, and above all, actually works!</li>
            <li> Perfect collection of brushes exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> The brushes are super soft and gentle to the touch! I have sensitive skin and the brushes work great with liquid and powdered makeup.  Shipping was surprisingly fast! Came in a safe package.</li>
            <li> Nothing really professional about it, to be honest. The brushes aren&#x27;t dense at all, so I do think a lot of my makeup goes to waste. I ended up only keeping about 5 of the brushes, and threw the rest away.&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;d be better to invest in better brushes from the start. I just purchased a set of brushes from ecotools-- not as expensive as Sephora brands but still great quality!</li>
            <li> when I apply the eye shadow slowly through out my application the hairs in the brush fall out . :(</li>
            <li> These are awesome and such a great price! The only bad brush was the big fan one. It completely fell apart. But that aside, I like these!</li>
            <li> The large fan brush was damaged when they arrived, a lot of repeat brushes and not really what I was hoping for...</li>
