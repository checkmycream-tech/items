            <li>and we both loved it.  </li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>but the best thing is how quickly it soaks into your skin leaving it moisturized but not greasy.  </li>
            <li>Got this as a sample at a hotel/spa and fell in love with the smell!</li>
            <li>So glad I found it on Amazon!  </li>
            <li>We have used this product for years ans still love it!</li>
            <li>she says it&#x27;s really nice.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is so nice</li>
            <li>1st used it at a casino and just had to have some for my own,</li>
            <li>I have used this lotion before and really liked it.</li>
            <li>She says it has a great smell (blood orange), goes on &amp;#34;like silk&amp;#34; over her skin and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>maybe this was an old bottle, but it doesn&#x27;t have the wonderful citrusy smell the sample size had.  </li>
            <li>I first discovered this brand while staying at a beautiful boutique hotel.  </li>
            <li>and he said it&#x27;s always best to purchase directly from them (which I did).</li>
            <li>Love, love, love it!</li>
            <li>It smells awesome, and goes on light yet moisturizes really well.  </li>
            <li>stumbled upon this lotion at a resort in vegas and loved it so much i searched it out and bought it, light not greay and smells great too.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing, great citrus smell and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite moisturizing lotion.  </li>
            <li>It is refreshing in scent, doesn&#x27;t leave me oily, and truly hydrates my skin.  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I am sure we will be purchaseing this product again and again.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion</li>
            <li>I fell in love with this product after receiving it as a sample from a hotel.</li>
            <li>I love the scent and consistency.</li>
            <li>Amazon was great about the whole thing, they refunded my purchase price.</li>
            <li>My friend used one of the samples I had in my guest bathroom and absolutely loved it, so I ordered a large bottle of this lotion for her.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way too strong for me.</li>
            <li>It has a strong perfume smell and does not smell like the orange citrus that I thought it would.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is by far the best lotion for sensitive skin and the best smelling lotion i have had in a long time!</li>
            <li>I have purchased before and the fragrance was fine</li>
            <li>Enjoy the fragrance and moisturizing effects.  </li>
            <li>Great Stuff.....would definitely buy again........</li>
            <li>The orange senting I light and pleases the senses.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>Hand and body lotion must have two important characteristics in my view.</li>
            <li>you have-use sparingly enjoy  </li>
            <li>good moisturizor, makes your skin feel so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I really like the consistency of this lotion - it has a nice fresh scent and provides good, soft skin without a greasy residue.  </li>
            <li>It is worth the price!</li>
            <li>this was a counterfeit product .....was not even close to the  original.  </li>
            <li>No residue, just clean to the touch.</li>
            <li>I have been a fan of calli orange tarocco lotion for years because of the special orange fragrance.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much then that I actually purchased more samples from the hotel!      </li>
            <li>The lotion is not thick and luxurious and the orange scent which I adored is very light with a metallic after scent.  </li>
            <li>Works great especially on dry skin.</li>
            <li>Wonderful subtle smell....</li>
            <li>My son also likes it because it absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>Super Fast Shipping!!</li>
            <li>I agree with the other reviewer about the scent being different from the original formula which was very pleasant</li>
            <li>but the newer one is very lemony and feels cheap.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>Worth the $</li>
            <li>It makes me smile, and it makes my hands and face feel soothed.</li>
            <li>I love it, smells like oranges and makes my skin feel so soft.  </li>
            <li>If the review isn&#x27;t useful, blame her</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to many lotions, so tried it not expecting much.  </li>
            <li>Instead of sweet orange scent like sample bottle, this is very astringent.</li>
            <li>packaging and labeling is nice as well - it looks simple and elegant enough to leave on a bathroom counter without it looking cluttered.  </li>
            <li>It must feel good on the skin, not sticky or heavy, but easily absorbed, while doing the job of moisturizing.</li>
            <li>The positive effects of this cream last longer than most other lotions--even ones considered superior to it.</li>
            <li>I have gone through many brands to finally find something which works!</li>
            <li>I first received a sample of this at a hotel.</li>
            <li>I was first given this lotion in a bed and breakfast where I stayed.  </li>
            <li>What I noticed the most after a couple uses was that some of the white spots (millia) under my eyes, seemed to be reduced or gone.  </li>
            <li>so did not read the reviews first.</li>
            <li>First came across this product as a sample in a hotel room.</li>
            <li>I use this entire line of products, and I love them all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering this item for the third time, drawn back to its good vibes despite having a preservative in it.</li>
            <li>Not only did I not react to the lotion poorly, I loved the way my skin looked an hour later.  </li>
            <li>I got it in large part for the fragrance that the hotel sample had, but what I received had no fragrance, though the lotion felt good and thick.</li>
            <li>I did not notice much difference in moisturizing quality.</li>
            <li>really like....  </li>
            <li>Really like the smell and consistency of the mositurizer.</li>
            <li>This is the product I fell in love with and bought the other items in this line.</li>
            <li>I paid such a high price for the beautiful scent the original formula had, but unfortunately they have changed it.</li>
            <li>This really makes my skin feel soft and smooth, totally removes any razor burn, and doesn&#x27;t leave a shiny or oily look to my skin!</li>
            <li>The lotion is light but nourishing to dry skin.</li>
            <li>While the lotion does a decent job of moisturizing the fragrance lasts on your skin for about three minutes.  </li>
            <li>Decent hand lotion.</li>
            <li>The moisturizing quality is comparable to any other over the counter moisturizer available at much cheaper rates.</li>
            <li>I feel bad for them because their products are wonderful</li>
            <li>I plan on adding either some sweet orange or blood orange essential oil in hopes that I can turn it into something a little more lasting.  </li>
            <li>This is the only product that works consistently.</li>
            <li>As some of you have stated, the second bottle I purchased did have a very &amp;#34;rancid&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li>Wow, I think I said it all in the title there, but a little more about this product--I have naturally curly hair, and a few times a day, some sort of product has to be scrunched or squeezed into it to keep it from being frizzy.</li>
            <li>If you have dry and sensitive skin (as I do)</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone with dry skin and or sensitive skin</li>

            <li> Wow, I think I said it all in the title there, but a little more about this product--I have naturally curly hair, and a few times a day, some sort of product has to be scrunched or squeezed into it to keep it from being frizzy.</li>
            <li> If you have dry and sensitive skin (as I do)</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone with dry skin and or sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The scent is very pleasing but not strong enough that it competes with my perfume.</li>
            <li> So it actually lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> And as far as hair goes, it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or make it greasy.</li>
            <li> been using it for a long time.</li>
            <li> It has an orange scent, and works like a charm on dry hands.  </li>
            <li> Tarocco has a lotion that heals my over worked dry hands.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer works well in the dry winter months.  </li>
            <li> It cleared up my dry skin</li>
            <li> I have tried dozens of creams and lotions for my dry skin,  </li>
            <li> It is a bit expensive relative to other lotions that also meet my criteria, but it is an indulgence that I am willing to make.</li>
            <li> The scent is subtle and the lotion works well with my sensitive, dry skin.</li>
            <li> Not over-powering but subtle and natural.</li>
            <li> A bit pricey but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> was not worth the effort to return</li>
            <li> The aroma is so slight that it basically isn&#x27;t noticeable and there is no oily feel after using it.  </li>
            <li> Beats any of the typical men&#x27;s products for after shave balm.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was a little slow.</li>
            <li> And the smell is one I never get tired of smelling.</li>
            <li> A disappointment for the price.</li>
            <li> and then they get a bad rap because someone else is selling their product that is probably way out dated.</li>
            <li> This time, it smelled bad, like it was rancid.</li>
            <li> I received this a couple of days ago and I am disappointed!  </li>

            <li> maybe this was an old bottle, but it doesn&#x27;t have the wonderful citrusy smell the sample size had.  Not orangey enough</li>
            <li> This is my favorite moisturizing lotion.  It is refreshing in scent, doesn&#x27;t leave me oily, and truly hydrates my skin.  Worth the price.</li>
            <li> I used to be a big fan of Biotherm, but they changed their formula.  This is as close as I can find.  It smells and feels wonderful!</li>
            <li> Wow, I think I said it all in the title there, but a little more about this product--I have naturally curly hair, and a few times a day, some sort of product has to be scrunched or squeezed into it to keep it from being frizzy. The scent of this is so nice and refreshing that you&#x27;ll happily use it wherever it&#x27;s needed! And as far as hair goes, it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or make it greasy. The positive effects of this cream last longer than most other lotions--even ones considered superior to it. Truly a great find!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this item, but I don&#x27;t like the smell.  It&#x27;s way too strong for me.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  Got a sample of it in a hotel room in Florida, and came home and googled it. Have been using it every day since. It smells awesome, and goes on light yet moisturizes really well.  Planning to buy some for Christmas for my mom and sister. This stuff is great!!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT. I received this as a sample and just had to purchase a larger size. Works great especially on dry skin.</li>
            <li> I love this!! introduced to it on a trip and had to have some for myself!</li>
            <li> I first discovered this brand while staying at a beautiful boutique hotel.  I liked it so much then that I actually purchased more samples from the hotel!      If you have dry and sensitive skin (as I do) this product is for you!  You don&#x27;t have to slather it on - one or two pumps does the trick.  So it actually lasts a long time. I have gone through many brands to finally find something which works! The scent is very pleasing but not strong enough that it competes with my perfume. I cannot recommend highly enough!</li>
            <li> This Italian lotion is divine to me, especially for the smell and the olive oil nourishment. I&#x27;m ordering this item for the third time, drawn back to its good vibes despite having a preservative in it.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have purchased Baronessa Cali Tarocco Orange Nourishing Moisturizer for my wife.  She says this moisturizer  is the best that she has used.  She&#x27;s very happy with tthe Baronessa Cali Tarocco Orange Nourishing Moisturizer.  I am sure we will be purchaseing this product again and again.</li>
            <li> We got this after staying in a hotel with Tarocco products in the bathroom...she says it&#x27;s really nice.  ...as does my mom who got it as a birthday gift.</li>
            <li> stumbled upon this lotion at a resort in vegas and loved it so much i searched it out and bought it, light not greay and smells great too.</li>
            <li> Great scent and great feeling on.  Not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> This Tarocco Nourishing Moisturizer is the best hand lotion I have ever owned.  It has an orange scent, and works like a charm on dry hands.  The seller was great, too.  I received the item in record time.  Great experience.</li>
            <li> Got this as a sample at a hotel/spa and fell in love with the smell! So glad I found it on Amazon!  Love, love, love it!</li>
            <li> While the lotion does a decent job of moisturizing the fragrance lasts on your skin for about three minutes.  I plan on adding either some sweet orange or blood orange essential oil in hopes that I can turn it into something a little more lasting.  A disappointment for the price.</li>
            <li> My friend used one of the samples I had in my guest bathroom and absolutely loved it, so I ordered a large bottle of this lotion for her. She uses it for her body as well a for her face.&lt;br /&gt;I used it once and it smells very nice and moistens my skin well.</li>
            <li> I first received a sample of this at a hotel. Couldn&#x27;t wait to receive larger bottle. Instead of sweet orange scent like sample bottle, this is very astringent. Smells like public restroom hand soap. I will order from Cali Cosmetics next time.</li>
            <li> This is the product I fell in love with and bought the other items in this line. This is by far the best lotion for sensitive skin and the best smelling lotion i have had in a long time! Worth the $</li>
            <li> good moisturizor, makes your skin feel so soft and smooth.  I would recommend this to anyone with dry skin and or sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I got it in large part for the fragrance that the hotel sample had, but what I received had no fragrance, though the lotion felt good and thick.</li>
            <li> Have loved this product for years.  Enjoy the fragrance and moisturizing effects.  The product does not leave an oily residue.</li>
            <li> This is a nice lotion with a great scent!  My son also likes it because it absorbs quickly.  Shipping was a little slow.</li>
            <li> Feels good and smells good</li>
            <li> Great Stuff.....would definitely buy again........</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. The scent is subtle and the lotion works well with my sensitive, dry skin. The lotion is light but nourishing to dry skin. It is worth the price!</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of calli orange tarocco lotion for years because of the special orange fragrance. Unfortunately the latest batch was a big disappintment. Smells like....... I don&#x27;t know what, but not what i have come to expect.</li>
            <li> We have used this product for years ans still love it! The orange senting I light and pleases the senses.</li>
            <li> this was a counterfeit product .....was not even close to the  original.  was not worth the effort to return so I get stung for the $32bucks.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the way it makes my skin feel. I work in the medical field. I am always waking my hands. Tarocco has a lotion that heals my over worked dry hands.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewer about the scent being different from the original formula which was very pleasant and I just loved it but the newer one is very lemony and feels cheap. I did not notice much difference in moisturizing quality. The moisturizing quality is comparable to any other over the counter moisturizer available at much cheaper rates. I paid such a high price for the beautiful scent the original formula had, but unfortunately they have changed it. I will not buy this product again!</li>
            <li> Hand and body lotion must have two important characteristics in my view. It must feel good on the skin, not sticky or heavy, but easily absorbed, while doing the job of moisturizing. Also, it must have a scent that soothes or awakens, depending on time of day I use it, and never a scent that overpowers, makes me sneeze, or otherwise offends. I have been using this product for over a year, and it meets both my criteria. It is a bit expensive relative to other lotions that also meet my criteria, but it is an indulgence that I am willing to make. It can start my day; it can end my day. It makes me smile, and it makes my hands and face feel soothed.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for several years and like the feel and smell of the cream.</li>
            <li> When I was in Jackson Hole at a hotel we stayed in, they had this lotion.  I love it, smells like oranges and makes my skin feel so soft.  I love this lotion</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife. She says it has a great smell (blood orange), goes on &amp;#34;like silk&amp;#34; over her skin and absorbs quickly. She loves it. She says it&#x27;s a great splurge. If the review isn&#x27;t useful, blame her</li>
            <li> Purchased this product for my wife and she loves it. She told me of all the moisterizers she has tried, this is the best!</li>
            <li> Found this at a boutique hotel in Philadelphia and could not wait to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is so nice and it feels so good.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great.  been using it for a long time.</li>
            <li> It has a strong perfume smell and does not smell like the orange citrus that I thought it would.&lt;br /&gt;I will give it away to someone that the smell doesn&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and still like it.  The moisturizer works well in the dry winter months.  The aroma is so slight that it basically isn&#x27;t noticeable and there is no oily feel after using it.  A bit pricey but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Baronessa has a great line of products.  The Tarocca has a wonderful orange scent that is refreshing and very appealing.  Not over-powering but subtle and natural.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this product after receiving it as a sample from a hotel. It&#x27;s wonderful for my skin and has a light pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> this is a great product. 1st used it at a casino and just had to have some for my own,</li>
            <li> I really like the consistency of this lotion - it has a nice fresh scent and provides good, soft skin without a greasy residue.  The pump works quite well and I look forward to purchasing again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging and labeling is nice as well - it looks simple and elegant enough to leave on a bathroom counter without it looking cluttered.  Good product.</li>
            <li> Best product ever. Been using for over 10 years.</li>
            <li> I was first given this lotion in a bed and breakfast where I stayed.  I&#x27;m very sensitive to many lotions, so tried it not expecting much.  Not only did I not react to the lotion poorly, I loved the way my skin looked an hour later.  What I noticed the most after a couple uses was that some of the white spots (millia) under my eyes, seemed to be reduced or gone.  I&#x27;ve never found anything that has helped these.  So, I&#x27;m a fan!!</li>
            <li> The sample I got from my girlfriend was an awesome orange smell and it was a non greasy lotion&lt;br /&gt;I really like....  But not this stuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s non-greasy formula is perfect! And the smell is one I never get tired of smelling. Definitely would buy again!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, great citrus smell and leaves my skin soft. No residue, just clean to the touch.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BY THIS PRODUCT OR ANY CALI COSMETIC PRODUCT FROM THIS SUPPLIER!!!  I have purchased before and the fragrance was fine so did not read the reviews first. As some of you have stated, the second bottle I purchased did have a very &amp;#34;rancid&amp;#34; smell. I called Cali Cosmetics and he said it&#x27;s always best to purchase directly from them (which I did). You never know who&#x27;s reselling this product and could have been sitting on a shelf for five years, store goes out of business, so they sell on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;It is NOT the Cali Cosmetics fault. I feel bad for them because their products are wonderful and then they get a bad rap because someone else is selling their product that is probably way out dated.</li>
            <li> Really like the smell and consistency of the mositurizer.</li>
            <li> Excellent seller and product! I love the scent and consistency.</li>
            <li> First came across this product as a sample in a hotel room. Have used it since.</li>
            <li> The BEST moisturizer ever made!</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion before and really liked it. This time, it smelled bad, like it was rancid. Amazon was great about the whole thing, they refunded my purchase price. I would give Amazon 5 stars here, but the product itself, 1 star.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift.  The box was taped shut on both sides with scotch tape.  The box was also torn on one corner.  Not the quality I like to send as a gift.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this in a hotel. It cleared up my dry skin and I never leave home without it.  I have tried dozens of creams and lotions for my dry skin,  This is the only product that works consistently.</li>
            <li> Beats any of the typical men&#x27;s products for after shave balm.  This really makes my skin feel soft and smooth, totally removes any razor burn, and doesn&#x27;t leave a shiny or oily look to my skin!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the smell of this lotion!!!</li>
            <li> Super Fast Shipping!! Great product!</li>
            <li> I received this a couple of days ago and I am disappointed!  The lotion is not thick and luxurious and the orange scent which I adored is very light with a metallic after scent.  A year or two ago I ordered a couple of bottles for me and one of my sons and we both loved it.  Now, I suspect they have changed the formula perhaps to save money - theirs not mine!</li>
            <li> Decent hand lotion. Smells great!</li>
            <li> Wonderful subtle smell....but the best thing is how quickly it soaks into your skin leaving it moisturized but not greasy.  Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I use this entire line of products, and I love them all.</li>
            <li> Wonderful item-if you like anything with an orange scent-then this should be an item you have-use sparingly enjoy  I would buy again.</li>
