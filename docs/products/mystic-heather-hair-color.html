            <li>Beautiful purple!</li>
            <li>perfect!</li>
            <li>I experienced no irritation and</li>
            <li>Product as advertised, a great idea for temp hair color.  </li>
            <li>but it still looked good.</li>
            <li>good product over all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Loved the color swatches and the pictures people had.</li>
            <li>very cute</li>
            <li>, I prefer this purple/pink fade much more)!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>The aroma is nice, and my hair feels nice after using this.  </li>
            <li>The color is super awesome and lasts forever, and the fade out is really pretty.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not in love</li>
            <li>I love this lighter purple.</li>
            <li>I have tried a number of different hair colors, but Manic Panic is the best.  </li>
            <li>I imagine that with more care in color maintenance</li>
            <li>I probably could have gotten a lot more out of</li>
            <li>Generally love MP&#x27;s product, but this was a dud.</li>
            <li>/&gt;so make sure to pick up some vol 40 developer and bleach powder too if you get this stuff</li>
            <li>This color lasted about 3 to 5 days at most in my hair.</li>
            <li>(my carpet has purple spots on it alllll over ;) ) good for temporary color.</li>
            <li>I gave it a 2 star because it is easy to use and might do better on bleached hair.</li>
            <li>, It is so easy to use, My Hair color came out Just the way I wanted it.</li>
            <li>this would be fine, except I put it just on the tips of my hair (bottom 4 inches) and it made it feel like straw.</li>
            <li>Judging from the pictures of people&#x27;s hair I had seen the color seemed to be a light fluorescent purple, but it came out closer to magenta in my hair.</li>
            <li>For best results, bleach out hair first with Manic Panic Flash Lightning, dry, and THEN use the color on it.  </li>
            <li>Will probably buy it in Amplified next time just because my hair doesn&#x27;t take color as easily, but I loved the way this looked after I set it with heat from a hair dryer.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pretty satisfied.</li>
            <li>This Mystic heather would be a cool compliment color tho.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely a pinky-purple, but it&#x27;s absolutely gorgeous.</li>
            <li>Used on very light blonde and was a very light purple.  </li>
            <li>The color was super pretty but washed out really fast, I would suggest Cleo Rose Manic Panic, dilute that to your liking with conditioner and apply.</li>
            <li>Light purple has been my favorite shade used so far.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a quick one or two day color, this will work for you.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll get vibrant, brilliant, long-lasting hair color every single time!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful color, but I had a hard time bleaching my hair well enough to make it look good when I put it in</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t worth the time</li>
            <li>Wanted to go for a good pink that had some purple to it.</li>
            <li>the right color before rinsing, then drastically faded after.</li>
            <li>For a more bold look, leave it in as long as you can stand it.</li>
            <li>daughter has very light blonde hair.</li>
            <li>so use towels you don&#x27;t care about too much and watch for floor drips!</li>
            <li>Heather/Amethyst was the first color I used.</li>
            <li>(though it did fade gradually through pretty ombre stages).</li>
            <li>This was my first time using Manic Panic, and I doubt I will try it again.</li>
            <li>Pretty color, lasted about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t seem to dye dark enough, but was much more satisfied with the Mystic Heather on</li>
            <li>This is a great way to try different colors as they shampoo out in less that a week,</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;d looked into many different brands, I quickly jumped into the use of Manic Panic&#x27;s products given my initial obsession with their offered selections of shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mystic</li>
            <li>Even though it is organic and it doesn&#x27;t do much damage to your hair</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really versatile color.</li>
            <li>i have a streak of blonde that i&#x27;ve lightened a few times and for the most part it&#x27;s pretty light.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t dry out my hair, easy to apply.</li>
            <li>(I have bright red hair, which does NOT bleach well since red hair likes to stay red).</li>
            <li>It did work after 30 mins, but very light even in blonde (dishwater blonde) hair.</li>
            <li>Although the color is pretty, I&#x27;ve learned start dark and enjoy it for a while.  </li>
            <li>This also makes a really nice pink when mixed with conditioner, but it&#x27;s staying power is not great.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>This particular shade did not take on my salt and pepper hair.</li>
            <li>you need at least more than 1 â€¦ 3 or more if you have long hair</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t vibrant - lit turned out - light pink -on lifted hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really hip, soft color.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t last long, I figured I&#x27;d be safe since my hair is naturally platinum blonde.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the Manic Panic colors and have no problems in the past, this color was just a miss for us</li>
            <li>First off, my hair dye came with a big sticker that said &amp;#34;sold as set - keep together.&amp;#34; So, I&#x27;m guessing there is something else sold with it to make the color pop more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>without conditioner this one fades very fast, but it fades out to such a pretty pink that I don&#x27;t even mind it.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Though I read several reviews stating color was very light/</li>
            <li>Very pretty, but not for dark hair.  </li>
            <li>Color was not quite what I wanted, and rinsed out partially even after first wash.  </li>
            <li>(I used a hot pink shade, and it faded out as an orange/pink</li>
            <li>Left it in my bleached blonde VERY POROUS hair for over 5 hours and not one bit of color appeared in my hair.</li>
            <li>We ordered this because my daughter wanted a certain shade of pink.  </li>
            <li>This product only dyed my bleach blonde hair in certain sections even though I thoroughly saturated my entire head with the dye.</li>
            <li>I however have light brown hair and figured this would at least dye my blonde highlights.</li>
            <li>This is NOT pink, it&#x27;s deep purple!  </li>
            <li>The first round I mixed it with Virgin Snow</li>
            <li>After a cold water rinse and dry, my tresses were transformed to a lovely pale lavender hue - very true to the package&#x27;s advertising and sample swatches</li>
            <li>only complaint about this product would be towards how quickly it faded -</li>

            <li> only complaint about this product would be towards how quickly it faded -</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going for a soft lavender, you rinse after a half hour.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s likely I didn&#x27;t bleach enough (my hair was still quite yellow, not white, as I have very dark almost black hair naturally).</li>
            <li> dye has a very faint blue undertone to it which makes the faded pink really nice and pastel.</li>
            <li> but even after multiple applications of the stuff, my hair still wouldn&#x27;t take it (while also simultaneously using the cotton candy pink one from manic panic and having it work)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mixed a little conditioner, as I do with all my manic panics.</li>
            <li> the dye doesn&#x27;t have a painfully and overwhelmingly chemical scent.</li>
            <li> Lasted about two weeks, as can be expected.</li>
            <li> Not quite what I expected.  </li>
            <li> so be careful with application, rinses out with each wash</li>
            <li> Color was only very slightly noticeable for 1st 1-2 days, then nothing.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> it is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> After a cold shower the whole dye came off.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> The darker colors will still around a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the color washed out after 3 washes.  </li>
            <li> I was so frustrated, by far the worst Manic Panic product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> She and I are both disappointed.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Judging from the pictures of people&#x27;s hair I had seen the color seemed to be a light fluorescent purple, but it came out closer to magenta in my hair. It&#x27;s likely I didn&#x27;t bleach enough (my hair was still quite yellow, not white, as I have very dark almost black hair naturally). Not what I had intended but it still looked good. Went well with my olive complexion. The first round I mixed it with Virgin Snow and it didn&#x27;t seem to dye dark enough, but was much more satisfied with the Mystic Heather on it&#x27;s own. Lasted about two weeks, as can be expected. Didn&#x27;t dry out my hair, easy to apply. I&#x27;m not in love but I&#x27;m pretty satisfied.</li>
            <li> Though I read several reviews stating color was very light/didn&#x27;t last long, I figured I&#x27;d be safe since my hair is naturally platinum blonde.&lt;br /&gt;WRONG!&lt;br /&gt;Was the right color before rinsing, then drastically faded after. Color was only very slightly noticeable for 1st 1-2 days, then nothing.&lt;br /&gt;All this would be fine, except I put it just on the tips of my hair (bottom 4 inches) and it made it feel like straw.</li>
            <li> Not quite what I expected.  Unfortunately the color washed out after 3 washes.  Only lasted about 5 days.  The color in my daughters naturally blonde and highlighted hair was a red color vs. the purple color in the jar.  I love the Manic Panic colors and have no problems in the past, this color was just a miss for us</li>
            <li> I dye my hair regularly, i ble a bleached my hair and dyed it, left it an hour. After a cold shower the whole dye came off. I was so frustrated, by far the worst Manic Panic product.</li>
            <li> stains everything so be careful with application, rinses out with each wash so use towels you don&#x27;t care about too much and watch for floor drips! (my carpet has purple spots on it alllll over ;) ) good for temporary color.</li>
            <li> you need at least more than 1 â€¦ 3 or more if you have long hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;very good product over all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars if there is size choices</li>
            <li> I love this lighter purple. It&#x27;s a really hip, soft color. Will probably buy it in Amplified next time just because my hair doesn&#x27;t take color as easily, but I loved the way this looked after I set it with heat from a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I have tried a number of different hair colors, but Manic Panic is the best.  I will NEVER again try anything else.  The aroma is nice, and my hair feels nice after using this.  For best results, bleach out hair first with Manic Panic Flash Lightning, dry, and THEN use the color on it.  You&#x27;ll get vibrant, brilliant, long-lasting hair color every single time!</li>
            <li> sucked i thought it would work on my lightened hair. so i followed the directions and it all came out in about 3 washes... so not buying again..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed in this product. I gave it a 2 star because it is easy to use and might do better on bleached hair. I however have light brown hair and figured this would at least dye my blonde highlights. I used as directed and even left on for way longer than needed and even used heat to try and amplify it. I had no luck at all. I was so hoping it would work because I didn&#x27;t want to use a permanent dye.</li>
            <li> Beautiful purple! You do have to let it set longer than 30 mins. It did work after 30 mins, but very light even in blonde (dishwater blonde) hair.</li>
            <li> I began dyeing my hair at the start of twenty-thirteen. While I&#x27;d looked into many different brands, I quickly jumped into the use of Manic Panic&#x27;s products given my initial obsession with their offered selections of shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mystic Heather/Amethyst was the first color I used. I applied it to bleached white hair and it took like a dream. I experienced no irritation and the dye doesn&#x27;t have a painfully and overwhelmingly chemical scent. After a cold water rinse and dry, my tresses were transformed to a lovely pale lavender hue - very true to the package&#x27;s advertising and sample swatches I&#x27;d seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint about this product would be towards how quickly it faded - (though it did fade gradually through pretty ombre stages). I imagine that with more care in color maintenance I probably could have gotten a lot more out of this semi-permanent dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely use this product again. Light purple has been my favorite shade used so far.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money. First off, my hair dye came with a big sticker that said &amp;#34;sold as set - keep together.&amp;#34; So, I&#x27;m guessing there is something else sold with it to make the color pop more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter has very light blonde hair. I have used manic panic before on her without a problem but this color did not show at all. The photo I am attaching is after leaving it in for 40 minutes. She and I are both disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product only dyed my bleach blonde hair in certain sections even though I thoroughly saturated my entire head with the dye. I also followed the instructions to the letter, and even left it on for over an hour. This was my first time using Manic Panic, and I doubt I will try it again. You might have a completely different experience. It seems like this dye is hit or miss.</li>
            <li> Left it in my bleached blonde VERY POROUS hair for over 5 hours and not one bit of color appeared in my hair. I don&#x27;t know if it was a dud or if it was counterfeit. Really disappointed.</li>
            <li> Color was not quite what I wanted, and rinsed out partially even after first wash.  Generally love MP&#x27;s product, but this was a dud.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a quick one or two day color, this will work for you.  It wasn&#x27;t worth the time/effort for me personally.  Although the color is pretty, I&#x27;ve learned start dark and enjoy it for a while.  The darker colors will still around a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t vibrant - lit turned out - light pink -on lifted hair.</li>
            <li> i have a streak of blonde that i&#x27;ve lightened a few times and for the most part it&#x27;s pretty light. but even after multiple applications of the stuff, my hair still wouldn&#x27;t take it (while also simultaneously using the cotton candy pink one from manic panic and having it work)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so make sure to pick up some vol 40 developer and bleach powder too if you get this stuff</li>
            <li> We ordered this because my daughter wanted a certain shade of pink.  This is NOT pink, it&#x27;s deep purple!  It looks way different than the picture!!!!</li>
            <li> Very pretty, but not for dark hair.  Used on very light blonde and was a very light purple.  Pretty color, lasted about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> This also makes a really nice pink when mixed with conditioner, but it&#x27;s staying power is not great.&lt;br /&gt;Even without conditioner this one fades very fast, but it fades out to such a pretty pink that I don&#x27;t even mind it.&lt;br /&gt;This dye has a very faint blue undertone to it which makes the faded pink really nice and pastel. (I used a hot pink shade, and it faded out as an orange/pink, I prefer this purple/pink fade much more)!</li>
            <li> This particular shade did not take on my salt and pepper hair.</li>
            <li> Wanted to go for a good pink that had some purple to it. Loved the color swatches and the pictures people had. I mixed a little conditioner, as I do with all my manic panics. The color was super pretty but washed out really fast, I would suggest Cleo Rose Manic Panic, dilute that to your liking with conditioner and apply. The color is super awesome and lasts forever, and the fade out is really pretty. This Mystic heather would be a cool compliment color tho.</li>
            <li> very cute but the product came open</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful color, but I had a hard time bleaching my hair well enough to make it look good when I put it in (I have bright red hair, which does NOT bleach well since red hair likes to stay red). It&#x27;s definitely a pinky-purple, but it&#x27;s absolutely gorgeous. I would definitely suggest it to friends and family.</li>
            <li> Ive used a lot of hair dye over the years and after reading some of the reviews on this product I thought I would give it a try. I would never recommend using manic panic. Even though it is organic and it doesn&#x27;t do much damage to your hair it is not worth the money. This color lasted about 3 to 5 days at most in my hair. Now that&#x27;s after using bleach on my already blonde hair. If your looking for something that will wash out, this is for you. If your looking for something permanent try something else!!</li>
            <li> Product as advertised, a great idea for temp hair color.  I am no looking for a color that last longer.  This is a great way to try different colors as they shampoo out in less that a week,</li>
            <li> I really like this product, It is so easy to use, My Hair color came out Just the way I wanted it. perfect!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really versatile color. If you&#x27;re going for a soft lavender, you rinse after a half hour. For a more bold look, leave it in as long as you can stand it.</li>
