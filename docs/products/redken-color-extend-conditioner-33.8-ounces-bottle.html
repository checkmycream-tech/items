            <li>All Soft better.  </li>
            <li>but stay away from the shampoo, it will bleach your freshly colored hairâ€¦..</li>
            <li>I smelled the product at a hair salon, and there is a distinct difference.</li>
            <li>conditioner apr&amp;egrave;s-shampooing.&amp;#34;  How about having different color tops or something to make more user friendly?</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for everyone who wants to keep their hair looking healthy through the process of coloring &amp; highlighting.</li>
            <li>salon\\&quot; kind of smell), but, overall, I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love using it occasionally all the way to the scalp to nourish the skin and prevent dryness/flakiness.</li>
            <li>It works well on color treated hair, keeping it smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I am a fan of Redken products and this is the first time I have tried the color protect conditioner.  </li>
            <li>keeps my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>but my whole head of hair felt damaged!</li>
            <li>After one wash (or rather one condition), my hair was soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I bought this when I got my hair colored for the first time ever, &amp; it is gentle on my hair and works well.</li>
            <li>There are certain beauty criteria products that do not have to invest too much money on.</li>
            <li>It has a very thick density and is perfect for a daily conditioner.</li>
            <li>unlike the real Redken color extend product I&#x27;ve been using for 5 years).</li>
            <li>Holds my color very well</li>
            <li>but I really like this stuff</li>
            <li>I have tried many other products in effort to save money</li>
            <li>Luckily I had an extra one lying around</li>
            <li>It does a great job of hydrating my tresses - even when I don&#x27;t shampoo, I wet my hair and put  it on to tame my hair,</li>
            <li>This stuff makes my hair soft, shiny, and very healthy-looking.</li>
            <li>My hair tends to get very \\&quot;hay-like\\&quot; in humid weather, but this stuff keeps it soft and smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really like how it makes my hair feel so soft.  </li>
            <li>As far as the product itself, nothing works better to keep my red hair red longer.</li>
            <li>I do not recommend the new formula at all.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair very soft, unlike the straw like appearance blond hair takes on after coloring.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and shiny and my color lasts!</li>
            <li>I tried several other shampoos/conditioners, all price ranges but mostly brands sold in salons, until I found Redken Color Extend.</li>
            <li>, Redken is lightweight, I have light brown hair and dye it a darker brown, I wash my hair everyday</li>
            <li>Also it leaves my hair shiny, soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>The straw feeling was completely gone--completely.</li>
            <li>I erred far too often then read about Redken Color Extend Shampoo and&lt;br /&gt;Redken</li>
            <li>Although more expensive than those purchaed in one&#x27;s local&lt;br /&gt;pharmacy or supermarket, perhaps well worth the price.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner keeps my color lasting a lot longer than normal.  </li>
            <li>I will be going back to my old conditioner brand.</li>
            <li>Nothing new nothing different feels like the same product just a bit thicker.</li>
            <li>I buy a big old bottle and use it to fill tiny bottles that I keep in my shower.  </li>
            <li>the normal 12oz bottles won&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>I have thick, frizzy, dry hair, and the original formula conditioned it well and made it soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>A bottle of the 32 oz lasts me about 6 months - I also have very long, thick, dark Asian hair and this product keeps it very healthy.</li>
            <li>color unchanged, hair soft and not bogged down,</li>
            <li>Only hassle is that the conditioner doesn&#x27;t break down in the drain very well and can cause clogs.</li>
            <li>wife was instructed by one salon to buy a very expensive brand that they just so happened to carry, the next beautician told my wife that the shampoo isn&#x27;t that critical, but use a good quality conditioner is, and suggested since her hair was colored to try this brand, My wife&#x27;s hair is not only as healthy as with the expensive stuff</li>

            <li> But then they changed it, and I have to use 2-3 times as much for less than half the conditioning effect.</li>
            <li> I mean I don&#x27;t have much else to say.</li>
            <li> My hair is so dry now from this imposter product!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I haven&#x27;t always been so lucky and have received some knock-offs.</li>
            <li> Then, I grudgingly opened the bottle, because I gotta have my smooth tresses.  </li>
            <li> Delivered timely and product was as expected and described</li>
            <li> Came on time, exactly as I expected it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: I am knocking this down to 2 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always a little wary about buying salon products online, but this product is the real deal.</li>
            <li> but it is not super thick/</li>
            <li> I leave it on for at least 15 minutes and let my hair dry overnight.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this conditioner for a long time, and I have a very tough time believing that this product is actually the Redken conditioner it says it is on the bottle.</li>
            <li> but mabe even a little shinier and bouncier...</li>
            <li> Even the bottle was a different shade of red than normal, and whatever conditioner they put in this bottle was horrible!</li>
            <li> I have very thick, long hair, a lot of conditioners are heavy</li>
            <li> I have dry, color-treated hair, and I also have very hard water in my house.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find the larger bottles in stores, that is why I use Amazon if you wash your hair a lot</li>
            <li> However, the bottles for conditioner and shampoo are identical making me have to scrutinize them to see where it has in small print  either, &amp;</li>
            <li> I usually would just get a haircut to cut off the damaged parts</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like trying to condition with thick, stiff water - it does not do the job at all.</li>
            <li> It keeps my color longer without it looking washed out and dull.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not amazing, but it does the job.  </li>
            <li> I hate it when stylists try to upsell you, so I shoved it in my closet until I finally ran out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed, especially since it&#x27;s so difficult to find conditioners that work well on my hair.</li>
            <li> I feel like this product was fake.</li>
            <li> But I was desperate and bought Redken Color Extend.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;Redken&amp;#34; conditioner I received was fake!</li>
            <li> I hate that stylist.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s terrible!</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> The &amp;#34;Redken&amp;#34; conditioner I received was fake! It didn&#x27;t even smell like the Redken color extend product. Even the bottle was a different shade of red than normal, and whatever conditioner they put in this bottle was horrible! It did nothing for my hair (unlike the real Redken color extend product I&#x27;ve been using for 5 years). My hair is so dry now from this imposter product! DO NOT BUY.</li>
            <li> Always use this, only need a tiny bit so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Delivered timely and product was as expected and described</li>
            <li> always a great solid conditioner!</li>
            <li> Great conditioner i rated it a four because it really helps my hair to be more silky but a slight improvement in scent and rate it a five.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product for colored hair, as is the shampoo!!!!!</li>
            <li> I buy a big old bottle and use it to fill tiny bottles that I keep in my shower.  I used to use somethign cheap and then some snooty bitch hairdresser was like, &amp;#34;What do you use?&amp;#34; and I was all, &amp;#34;Brand XYZ&amp;#34; and she was all, &amp;#34;Yeah I can feel the buildup,&amp;#34; and gave me a sample of this Redken conditioner.  I hate it when stylists try to upsell you, so I shoved it in my closet until I finally ran out.  Then, I grudgingly opened the bottle, because I gotta have my smooth tresses.  I kid you not, my hair was so smooth after this.  I hate that stylist.  But I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years. I have very thick, long hair, a lot of conditioners are heavy, Redken is lightweight, I have light brown hair and dye it a darker brown, I wash my hair everyday, Redken definitely helps extend the life of my color. It is difficult to find the larger bottles in stores, that is why I use Amazon if you wash your hair a lot the normal 12oz bottles won&#x27;t last long. I suggest buying this product from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Redken is the best shampoo on the market, which is why so many hair stylists use it. ALL their products are awesome and I have tried many shampoos, conditioners, and deep conditioners.</li>
            <li> I color &amp; highlight my hair every 3 weeks, and it puts a lot of stress and damage on my hair. I have been using this conditioner for over 3 weeks and I love it! It keeps my color longer without it looking washed out and dull. Also it leaves my hair shiny, soft and manageable. I highly recommend this product for everyone who wants to keep their hair looking healthy through the process of coloring &amp; highlighting.</li>
            <li> the best!!! color unchanged, hair soft and not bogged down, should have begun using this years ago!!many many thanks to you all</li>
            <li> There are certain beauty criteria products that do not have to invest too much money on. Haircare is not one of them. I was introduced to this product when I was 16 from my Mom and have been using it ever since, about 4 years. I switch off from this to a cheap conditioner every couple of weeks or so. I leave it on for at least 15 minutes and let my hair dry overnight. A bottle of the 32 oz lasts me about 6 months - I also have very long, thick, dark Asian hair and this product keeps it very healthy.</li>
            <li> I am giving this 4 stars because I don&#x27;t totally love the smell (a very \\&quot;hair salon\\&quot; kind of smell), but, overall, I really like this stuff. I have dry, color-treated hair, and I also have very hard water in my house. This stuff makes my hair soft, shiny, and very healthy-looking. My hair tends to get very \\&quot;hay-like\\&quot; in humid weather, but this stuff keeps it soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I am knocking this down to 2 stars. My hair looked and felt great for the first few days of using this, but now it&#x27;s back to its usual dry state. :(</li>
            <li> I love Redken products.  At my Beauty Supply retailer, the cost is almost double what Amazon sells it for.  The product is great.  The conditioner does the job on my hair but it is not super thick/heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it each time I wash my hair.  I have been using it for many years.</li>
            <li> Redken conditioner leaves my hair with incredible shine. It has a very thick density and is perfect for a daily conditioner. Holds my color very well</li>
            <li> Really like how it makes my hair feel so soft.  This big bottle will last a really long time.  Great deal.</li>
            <li> It does a great job of hydrating my tresses - even when I don&#x27;t shampoo, I wet my hair and put  it on to tame my hair,</li>
            <li> Came on time, exactly as I expected it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conditioner is great for repairing damaged hair or even soothing dry hair. Love using it occasionally all the way to the scalp to nourish the skin and prevent dryness/flakiness. Only hassle is that the conditioner doesn&#x27;t break down in the drain very well and can cause clogs. Make sure to rinse with lots and lots of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely buy this product over and over!</li>
            <li> Works very well in detangling my fine hair. Has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> This conditioner is outstanding! My hair is soft and shiny and my color lasts! I am almost done with the liter and I have had it for 9 months, so it lasts. The smell is not the best, but I can get past it for the results. The shampoo however is nothing to brag about.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is wonderful for my colored/bleached hair.  It keeps my hair very soft, unlike the straw like appearance blond hair takes on after coloring.</li>
            <li> This smells amazing! I mean I don&#x27;t have much else to say. I only wish that it came with a pump since the bottle is so big. Luckily I had an extra one lying around and it fits. Redken is a great brand for color treated hair in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Nothing new nothing different feels like the same product just a bit thicker.</li>
            <li> I switch it up every once in awhile to give my hair a change but I always come back to this conditioner. It works well on color treated hair, keeping it smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I do not like this product for my hair type. When the cooler weather hit I started having issues with static in my hair. I will be going back to my old conditioner brand.</li>
            <li> I bought this when I got my hair colored for the first time ever, &amp; it is gentle on my hair and works well.</li>
            <li> My wife LOVE is product and it works well on her course hair.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is fine.  It&#x27;s not amazing, but it does the job.  It does have a fairly strong chemical scent.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item from the independent seller TMG Products. I&#x27;m always a little wary about buying salon products online, but this product is the real deal. Compared to what I purchased in the salon it is the same color, consistency, scent and works just the same. Unfortunately, I haven&#x27;t always been so lucky and have received some knock-offs. It&#x27;s good to be able to find a good provider. As far as the product itself, nothing works better to keep my red hair red longer. I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner keeps my color lasting a lot longer than normal.  I also like the way the conditioner conditions my hair and leaves it managable.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this conditioner for a long time, and I have a very tough time believing that this product is actually the Redken conditioner it says it is on the bottle.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of Redken products and this is the first time I have tried the color protect conditioner.  It is good but I do like the Redken All Soft better.  I bought this because of the reviews and because I do color my hair.</li>
            <li> Great Deal. Saves you colored hairâ€¦. but stay away from the shampoo, it will bleach your freshly colored hairâ€¦..</li>
            <li> It is the best color extend conditioner I have ever had.  I also use the shampoo and it is wonderful.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff. They say that you should switch up your shampoo &amp; conditioner from time to time but I really like this stuff and I keep to it.</li>
            <li> I was on a mission to find a shampoo and conditioner for color-treated hair that prevented my hair color from fading. I tried several other shampoos/conditioners, all price ranges but mostly brands sold in salons, until I found Redken Color Extend. I get my color done about every 8 weeks and ever since I have been using Color Extend (for over a year now) my color does not fade. I can&#x27;t say whether it&#x27;s the shampoo or the conditioner, or the combination of them (I use Redken Color Extend for both) but I can tell you they have worked so well that I&#x27;m definitely sticking with them. My hair always looks very shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> keeps my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other products in effort to save money but, I always return to Redken Color Extend Shampoo &amp; Conditioner. I really do think that this product makes my color last longer, my hair more manageable and smells great!</li>
            <li> We received this item ahead of schedule and it was shipped in a very safe manner, the product itself is very good.&lt;br /&gt;My wife was instructed by one salon to buy a very expensive brand that they just so happened to carry, the next beautician told my wife that the shampoo isn&#x27;t that critical, but use a good quality conditioner is, and suggested since her hair was colored to try this brand, My wife&#x27;s hair is not only as healthy as with the expensive stuff but mabe even a little shinier and bouncier...</li>
            <li> I loved this product until they changed the formula several months ago. I have thick, frizzy, dry hair, and the original formula conditioned it well and made it soft and manageable. It was the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used, and it even apparently won a number of awards. But then they changed it, and I have to use 2-3 times as much for less than half the conditioning effect. It&#x27;s terrible! It&#x27;s like trying to condition with thick, stiff water - it does not do the job at all. I&#x27;m very disappointed, especially since it&#x27;s so difficult to find conditioners that work well on my hair. Now I have to try to find something else because I will not continue to spend money on a product that doesn&#x27;t work anymore. I do not recommend the new formula at all.</li>
            <li> love this product .. much cheaper than in the store..  came without any problems.</li>
            <li> Redkin is the BEST! Love the smell too</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner. I don&#x27;t color my hair but this was recommended to me and it is the only one I will use now.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! However, the bottles for conditioner and shampoo are identical making me have to scrutinize them to see where it has in small print  either, &amp;#34;shampoo shampooing&amp;#34; or &amp;#34; conditioner apr&amp;egrave;s-shampooing.&amp;#34;  How about having different color tops or something to make more user friendly?</li>
            <li> My hair was straw after coloring it with some mousse hair coloring product that seems to work well for everyone but me...anyway...straw. I usually would just get a haircut to cut off the damaged parts but my whole head of hair felt damaged! I have never bought a conditioner for more than 5 dollars. I&#x27;ve never needed to. But I was desperate and bought Redken Color Extend. After one wash (or rather one condition), my hair was soft and smooth.  The straw feeling was completely gone--completely. I have never had a product work so well, so quickly. I don&#x27;t mind paying 30 dollars with these results. It is fabulous!!!</li>
            <li> I feel like this product was fake. I smelled the product at a hair salon, and there is a distinct difference.</li>
            <li> So very important to find the right products for color treated hair.....sometimes it&#x27;s based&lt;br /&gt;on trial and error. I erred far too often then read about Redken Color Extend Shampoo and&lt;br /&gt;Redken Color Extend Conditioner. Although more expensive than those purchaed in one&#x27;s local&lt;br /&gt;pharmacy or supermarket, perhaps well worth the price. I have found my hair to maintain its&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;color far longer than when having used other products and Redken leaves my hair feeling very&lt;br /&gt;soft and silky.  I purchased 33.8 oz bottles which should last quite a while, however, when&lt;br /&gt;I run out I will reorder again on Amazon!</li>
