    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Excellent customer service.</li>
            <li>this item is perfect for those folks with looser hair, on the shorter side.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It has the best combination of hold and texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Awesome stuff.</li>
            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>Not the best product.</li>
            <li>This is the best product I have found that keeps its hold even after workouts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>This is a great product!</li>
            <li>Perfect for scalping any desired look.</li>
            <li>I must say I am quite impressed.</li>
            <li>Best hair gel</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>like clay, and feel it is the best for my hair.</li>
            <li>Great quality for a great price!</li>
            <li>Good stuff though!</li>
            <li>This is an exceptional hair product!</li>
            <li>This is great hair product.</li>
            <li>it is great.  </li>
            <li>Great service.</li>
            <li>Happy with everything.</li>
            <li>products works great, just like a pomade.</li>
            <li>The product works great and was at a great price.</li>
            <li>This clay is inexpensive, has a great hold, and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Both are great</li>
            <li>My son uses this and he says it works great to control his hair.</li>
            <li>If you have some spots where you can see scalp this is really great for you because it doesn&#x27;t make those look noticeable.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great.</li>
            <li>While it is greasy in essence (waxy), it provides great matte look</li>
            <li>smells great, looks great, tastes...</li>
            <li>However, it does an excellent job helping to style hair, stays in the hair, and can be readjusted throughout the day as needed without requiring more.</li>
            <li>You want something that will hold your hair in a flawless manner even through a Hurricane Andrew and Hurricane Katrina love making session?</li>
            <li>Great hold, smells good too.</li>
            <li>The molding clay has a fairly pleasant citrus smell.</li>
            <li>pleasant smell</li>
            <li>It also has a pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li>perfect hold, non-greasy, easy to wash</li>
            <li>I have bright blond hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work even close to as good as the Molding Cream did</li>
            <li>no smell which is good and don&#x27;t compete with manly cologne.  </li>
            <li>This is a good value at a price around</li>
            <li>Has a good hold and add shine.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as good as fiber.  </li>
            <li>Good hold though.  </li>
            <li>Buy it if you want good hair, money, fame, women, etc.</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved the product until taking a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but if you are looking for a good quality product that is \\&quot;clay-like\\&quot; then try something else.</li>
            <li>This is a good hair styling product.</li>
            <li>good.</li>
            <li>i wear a hat 90% of the time and when i take my hat off to eat or go indoors, my hair is still in good shape.</li>
            <li>This is a good product if you have lots of cowlicks like myself.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do any good either.</li>
            <li>Looks great and very easy to mold my course hair.  </li>
            <li>Very good stuff and washes out easily.</li>
            <li>Great stuff, I was looking for something with better good than fiber.</li>
            <li>It can hide those spots which is what I love about it!</li>
            <li>Better than any gel I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li>On the bright side, this stuff will hold up better in the rain.</li>
            <li>I use it in combination with light hair gel and it works great.</li>
            <li>You can just slide your fingers trough your hair as if you had no product on which is amazing</li>
            <li>Provides a nice matte finish</li>
            <li>Does what it is supposed to do, works nicely with my hairstyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smells nice.</li>
            <li>I have kind of a blond faux hawk (this makes it look oily).  </li>
            <li>If you apply to simi-dry hair you can get a nice matte look.</li>
            <li>This may be a good thing for many as you don&#x27;t have to keep reapplying.</li>
            <li>If you want a trendy look with a quiff or volume</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smell: Isn&#x27;t the greatest but whatever, can&#x27;t really smell it once it&#x27;s applied anyway.  </li>
            <li>However it is really good product, I am really satisfied.</li>
            <li>would recommend this product if your going for a greaser kind of hair style.</li>
            <li>did end up finding and buying something that was perfect for a great NON-greasy hold, and that is&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Gatsby technical clay\\&quot;  good stuff, but DONT use too much (which also is great because it lasts forever!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent is very mild, yet pleasant smelling.</li>
            <li>It smells great, kind of citrus fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>I have had great success with Aveda&#x27;s hair clay fror men, and even stronger TIGIs remolding wax.</li>
            <li>It seems that now I have found a suitable, if not replacement, companion.  </li>
            <li>Great stuff, best available for short hair.</li>
            <li>If you look at your hands in bright light after applying the product, it&#x27;s almost as if they are covered in a very, very fine glitter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After trying most of the different products (Fiber, Defining Paste, Forming Cream, Pomade) I decided that the one I liked best was the Molding Clay.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t want to do the classic palmade that stays greasy &amp; shiny in the hair, but allows you to re-comb after taking off your hat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clay &amp; wax consistency hold better than anything and dries to an incredible hold.  </li>
            <li>Most of my styling is already done with mousse and a blow dryer.</li>
            <li>Bought for beard but Fiber works better.</li>
            <li>I was, however, looking to get something with slightly more hold.</li>
            <li>product i have ever used remember more is less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is better to shampoo your hair to take out the clay.</li>
            <li>It has a slightly more greasy hand to it (before application).</li>
            <li>also make my hair look healthy shiny.</li>
            <li>I tried this as a cheaper alternative to much more pricey products.</li>
            <li>It sure does its job though.  </li>
            <li>No stains in the hat band &amp; hair that stays in place when tipping a well fitting fedora.  </li>
            <li>I thought I would give this a try after reading reviews, and I like the performance much better than the Fiber.  </li>
            <li>This is because it is petroleum-based and not water-based like many pomades.  </li>
            <li>sadly it is more like a shiny greasy look.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many hair products to help compensate for my lack of volume.</li>
            <li>Thought the product was more hold medium shine</li>
            <li>This product is so potent, however, that it took 4-5 separate washings to get this out of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product because it was compared to Brumble and Brumble Sumotech, which is my favored product, but costs about 3 times as much by volume.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worth the price to be better than Axe stuff, but not as good as Brumble and Brumble.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more oily then Crew Fiber.  </li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t mind some shine and a greasier look--it&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>It needs more clay( Bentonite) in the molding clay.</li>
            <li>Either way, this stuff is top notch and belongs in your hair if you&#x27;re looking to woo ladies off their feet and into your arms.</li>
            <li>Feels more akin to a medium hold, but even the Forming Cream (medium hold/medium shine) seems to hold stronger than this.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>This stuff holds better but has more shine than I wanted.</li>
            <li>The one I had gotten did not smell good like most American Crew products and despite having a great hold it took me almost 5 showers over 3 days to wash it out of my hair.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll ever find an oil based product that is more matte than &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; water based products.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>it has more holding power than fiber.</li>
            <li>thing I like most is that it isn&#x27;t over the top.</li>
            <li>but I really love this molding clay.  </li>
            <li>It is one of my favorite products.</li>
            <li>My hair devours whatever styling product I throw at it, but this stuff is magic.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I guess it would work better for shorter hair</li>
            <li>So I washed 1 more time with my H&amp;S (note:</li>
            <li>I want to be a Greaser for Halloween, because I couldn&#x27;t take the chance that I won&#x27;t be able to wash it out again.</li>
            <li>The product smells okay, holds okay and sculpts hair</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>I find AC forming cream mush more easier to apply and wash out.</li>
            <li>Like it, don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>Need I say more?</li>
            <li>Works great for styling my boys hair, with little spikes in front, smells good too!</li>
            <li>Smells good, right amount of hold, and it&#x27;s too shiny.</li>
            <li>True to its description, the product leaves your hair looking and feeling completely natural, but with magnificent shaping and styling ability.  </li>
            <li>Aveda&#x27;s washes off cleanly with warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>High quality product with great hold that lasts all day.&lt;br</li>
            <li>All in all pretty good.</li>
            <li>I buy because it makes sexy easy flexible no greasy hair style.</li>
            <li>Make sure you have a strong shampoo to wash this out.</li>
            <li>Really depends on how much you put in your hair, but I find the shine a perfect level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For best results, apply when your hair is slightly wet.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is ideal if you have very short hair.</li>
            <li>And it doesn&#x27;t require much molding clay to get a good hold.</li>
            <li>The product is easily removed and glides effortlessly throughout my hair.</li>
            <li>Thank you, Amazon, for easily refunding me.</li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t greasy and washed out of my hair easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>also recommend Mitch Reformer if you are looking for a strong hold that washes out extremely easy.</li>
            <li>The clay holds hair well and comes out easily when washing.</li>
            <li>great hold and love the low shine.</li>
            <li>The smell is the only thing I&#x27;m not crazy about, it smells alright, but it&#x27;s not the best.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t expecting the citrus smell to be so strong, but it gives a strong hold.</li>
            <li>I like a strong, workable, matte product.</li>
            <li>This product worked well to provide a strong hold for my hair.  </li>
            <li>The hold is not as strong as I thought but it still gets the job done.</li>
            <li>I have wiry, curly, wavy hair and the hold of this molding clay is perfect to hold down the frizz without looking or feeling like I&#x27;ve plastered my hair to my head.  </li>
            <li>(my hair is about 1\\&quot; long on top and 1/2\\&quot; on the sides) and style in a fairly messy/textured way on top.  </li>
            <li>Calling the product \\&quot;clay\\&quot; is a huge stretch.  </li>
            <li>The gal that cuts my hair loaded me up with a free sample and it took three or four shampoos to get my comb to glide through like</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: This actually works great.</li>
            <li>Be advised: this product&#x27;s primary ingredients are: Petrolatum and beeswax.  </li>
            <li>you are looking for a cheap styling product without regards to quality</li>
            <li>but I am expecting it to be great for short hair</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair really smooth</li>
            <li>I was hoping this would be a cheap alternative to Aveda grooming clay ([[ASIN:</li>
            <li>This was until I discovered that if you vigorously rub the product between your hands before you apply it, it spreads more evenly, and has an overall effect that makes the greasy-but-not-slicked-back-look, look good.</li>
            <li>I love using it....washing it out not so much :-)</li>
            <li>Pomade is too shiny and limp, gel is too crusty and shiny, but this stuff has the perfect amount of low shine and good hold.</li>
            <li>He kept it safe throughout his life and eventually figured out a way to replicate it and passed it on to his first born son.</li>
            <li>I opted for the Grooming Cream and had better results for my hair, this product was able to hold my hair well, but still left a greasy shine to my hair that lasted for an hour or two until it looked more</li>
            <li>A jar lasts a long time and it works great.</li>
            <li>Not disappointed.</li>
            <li>It does not rinse clean.</li>
            <li>About a year ago I decided that I would try out the different products to see which one I liked most.</li>
            <li>Probably the best hold American Crew offers, though I haven&#x27;t tried Pomade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shine</li>
            <li>I tried the full product line from American Crew as well as Redkin, but molding clay was the best by far.</li>
            <li>Excellent control of fine hiar with a little more shine than fiber product by American Crew, which makes it more suitable for more formal dress and not as shiny as the pomade which can soemtimes make hair look flat and greasy</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right!</li>
            <li>Because the hold is so strong with the Molding Clay, I can apply it to much drier hair while still getting a strong hold.  </li>
            <li>However, the product isn&#x27;t good enough by itself.</li>
            <li>your hand or maybe someone&#x27;s hand want to touch your hair to feel sexiness of full head hair.  </li>
            <li>Could be good for really short hair.</li>
            <li>wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product for longer hair, but with short hair it performs fairly well.</li>
            <li>If you do like shiny and want a more greasy texture then this product does very well in that regard, but it just was not for me.</li>
            <li>To be fair, I&#x27;ve only used this twice now</li>
            <li>Overall, a good purchase.</li>
            <li>even though the Aveda version costs more than twice as much, I&#x27;ll continue using it.</li>
            <li>Instead, it just catches the light when struck at the right angles.</li>
            <li>Came quickly and makes my hair magical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>This molding clay should be labeled a &amp;#34;wax.&amp;#34; Main ingredients include beeswax and many oils.</li>
            <li>super greasy shine.</li>
            <li>and your hair gets super greasy.</li>
            <li>quick shipping.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t consider myself a hair product specialist, especially because I only do my hair once a week when I can&#x27;t wear a hat to church, but this product is the best I have used.</li>
            <li>Once my hair fully dries I have a completely matte look with a very strong hold that I can remold throughout the day if I like.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is a huge deal, but it is something to be aware of.  </li>
            <li>American crew fiber is much better!</li>
            <li>It has a little more of a shine than I would have liked, but it still works well.</li>
            <li>not dirty oily scalp grease shiny.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hold as well as American Hair Fiber, but it is still a nice product.  </li>
            <li>The Molding Clay is not capable of holding my hair any better than the Pomade, while it is labeled as having more hold.</li>
            <li>Pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>Once my hair gets longer I switch to Fiber, but for that freshly cut hair, this will do the trick.</li>
            <li>but it works well and supposedly has more natural ingredients than not.</li>
            <li>Sometimes, I just run my fingers through my hair and leave it, for a smoother more natural look.</li>
            <li>you want a medium to strong hold, try the AC Forming Cream (my favorite) or AC Defining Paste (a little dry for my taste but offers excellent hold).  </li>
            <li>It was delivered quickly and it was the exact product I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>The only product I&#x27;ve found that gives as strong of a hold as Molding Clay while also being easy to wash out is Sumotech, which costs over $20 for 1.5 oz.  </li>
            <li>This product has so far been pretty good about keeping the cowlicks in check and keeping my hair soft.</li>
            <li>The hold is pretty good, but any &amp;#34;twist and pull spikes&amp;#34; I make will not maintain the whole day, I&#x27;ve found only hairspray or gel will hold that sort of style.  </li>
            <li>and when it gets long, it doesnt do much styling wise for it.  </li>
            <li>Thankfully, Amazon makes it so hassle-free to return a product, and I quickly ordered another tub of the Grooming Cream because I was much more satisfied with that product, even if there is a greasy shine for a few hours after applying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It worked great for my super think and hard to control hair</li>
            <li>As for now, great hold for 4-5&amp;#34; hair and has a dry no mess appearance.</li>
            <li>It seemed to me the pomade quality went down over the years, but the molding clay is definitely a good replacement.  </li>
            <li>For right now, Head and Shoulders washes it out pretty well, though.</li>
            <li>But, the right hair cut and product covers things pretty well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not totally unhappy with the purchase, it does have an okay hold that I can use for more casual styles, but if I need a good looking coiffed head for more than fifteen minutes I&#x27;ll be using one of my other</li>
            <li>I did not know that this product would be oil based, and so I did not like the product very much.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t think the hold was strong enough; I would have to use it in pretty wet hair to get a strong hold, which would result in more sheen than I</li>
            <li>Not only does this product not offer more hold</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been able to acquire it online.</li>
            <li>I prefer the American crew fiber better</li>
            <li>Despite its billing as \\&quot;medium\\&quot; shine to Fiber&#x27;s \\&quot;low\\&quot; shine, I&#x27;ve found that this product actually gives a more matte look than Fiber along with a stronger hold.  </li>
            <li>Smells funny.</li>
            <li>I recommend using this in tandem with a lighter product such as the American Crew Light Hold Texture Lotion or some kind of mousse.</li>
            <li>After applying the product, AC&#x27;s leaves a waxy/sticky film on your hands that takes hot water and soap to remove.  </li>
            <li>First time I bought clay</li>
            <li>That is the only plausible explanation, that or witchcraft.</li>
            <li>After the first week or so of using this, I started to break out on my forehead.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my favorite product in the entire line of Crew hair products.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t want this, you&#x27;re better sticking with the American Crew Fiber or another dryer product.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll need soap and hot water</li>
            <li>and it lasts for the whole day!  </li>
            <li>but it really hasn&#x27;t bothered me at all!</li>
            <li>if i want more shine i simply apply to damp/wet hair.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t emulsify and spread, I could see it adding a lot of weight to your hair and not properly holding shape as well as being concentrated and &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; looking in whatever part receives the most product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>Great for thick, straight hair if you want a moldable product that holds well all day.</li>
            <li>It left my hair very greasy and shiny which is not the look I was going for as I like a more matte finish.</li>
            <li>If you have thick hair and keep your hair short then this stuff is perfect.</li>
            <li>My only advice would be to not use too much of the product and to make sure to evenly distribute thoughout your hair.</li>
            <li>This product is best if you have a short hairstyle, It doesn&#x27;t have as good of a hold as Fiber and not enough volume for me as I have medium length thicker dark hair which I like to style the front up,It also separates your hair into strands which exposes the scalp in places which I did not like and seemed to just weigh the hair down.</li>
            <li>Easily reworkable and doesn&#x27;t leave a dandruff-like-flakes when it gets old like most other products.</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also pretty much oder-less (to my knowledge)</li>
            <li>As long as you can wait a week for delivery, the price is better with Amazon anyway.  </li>
            <li>think this molding clay would be good for the Preppy slick look like that guy Scott from the kardashians</li>
            <li>But seriously, use like a dime size and if you need more you can get more out.</li>
            <li>It says high hold when a medium hold American Crew Forming Cream holds better</li>
            <li>When I bought this product, I definitely expected something more matte, and higher hold.</li>
            <li>It is enough hold, sufficient amount of shine, easy to use and long-lasting.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works fine for short styles that don&#x27;t require any lift or parting.</li>
            <li>Like all American Crew products, it can be pricey, which is fine if you give a damn about</li>
            <li>The ingredients are more or less natural too, which is important to me.</li>
            <li>(Oh, and it contains fine glitter, which you don&#x27;t notice in your hair, but definitely on your hands)</li>
            <li>Instead of high hold and medium shine, I personally find it has more of a medium hold and high shine, depending on the application.</li>
            <li>other commenters have mentioned, this product is great for holding your hair in place with a dry look.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got enough hold to keep your hair looking nice all day, and if you don&#x27;t use too much, it won&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy, it adds some shine which is great, adds a little texture, and a lot of separation.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of American Crew hair products, but this stuff is just not for me.  </li>
            <li>However, that doesn&#x27;t really say much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wetness mostly depends on how wet your hair is when you apply it.</li>
            <li>really think it twice before buying it from them.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.  </li>
            <li>You should know that it doesnt have as much shine as pomade.  </li>
            <li>really makes this product stand out, though, is the type and amount of shine.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>This stuff is straight from the gods.</li>
            <li>then AC&#x27;s Molding Clay will likely fit the bill</li>
            <li>It takes some effort to get off the hands, and by the end of the day my hair feels very oily...</li>
            <li>fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>This stuff in not for straight medium hair.</li>
            <li>I really like the Molding Clay.</li>
            <li>have to wash my hair twice to really get this stuff out.</li>
            <li>much I put this on</li>
            <li>And besides, even if I had used the whole container, it should have washed out in fewer than 6 shampooings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t enjoy the greasy, overdone finishes that marked the 80s, but my hair doesn&#x27;t suit a completely matte finish, either.</li>
            <li>my favorite american crew product by far, (i&#x27;ve tried the forming cream and fiber).</li>
            <li>Maybe it is because I bathe regularly, or because I am particularly good at shampooing my own hair, but I did not find this product at all difficult to wash out of my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for my hair especially when it&#x27;s short because it is great for my hair to slick down and frontwards.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten older and the styles have changed, I switched to American Crew Fiber for a more natural look.  </li>
            <li>Works well, smells nice but not a strong scent.</li>
            <li>I read in a review that it is hard to wash out of your hair, which is kind of true, but as far as I know there is nothing in it that would be damaging to your hair.</li>
            <li>Most other products give up when mussed by a hat</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t behave like any other hair clay I&#x27;ve used, but instead more like hair wax.</li>
            <li>When my hair is freshly cut I think the American Crew Molding Clay works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is OK (if a little waxy), but I don&#x27;t find that it has as much hold as the forming cream.  </li>
            <li>The 1 star is not for the product, I think its a great molding clay, in fact Ill buy more but not from here, way cheaper on ebay or other stores.</li>
            <li>Sometimes less is more with this stuff.</li>
            <li>I use American Crew firm hold gel, but I wanted something to good stronger.</li>
            <li>I have used the American Crew Fiber product for years and this has the same hold strength with a bit more shine.  </li>
            <li>The product smells amazing, and because only the smallest amount is needed it is sure to last a long, long time.  </li>
            <li>I am an Asian male with hair about 3-4 inches on top and faded on the sides.  </li>
            <li>Idk how it works, I&#x27;m assuming that the molding clay is full of nanobots that multiply upon contact with your hair and holds it in place with their advanced robotic technology.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>i would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>And, I&#x27;m thinning a little on top.  </li>
            <li>Lots of salons carry American Crew but it seems like this particular product is rarely stocked.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something with high hold, I&#x27;d recommend going with AC&#x27;s Fiber or Boogie&#x27;s Hair Clay, which both also have the advantage of washing out with normal shampoo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many, many products in the past but I always found myself coming back to American Crew&#x27;s Fiber.  </li>
            <li>My hair is long up top with short sides.</li>
            <li>Instantly his life was transformed with success, passion, excitement.</li>
            <li>If you have wavy hair or hair that&#x27;s not totally smooth, then the Fiber is a better ones to use.</li>
            <li>You just have to adjust by giving the argan oil a few more minutes to absorb before applying the Molding Clay.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After applying, my hair felt like I had just worked a thick kind of vaseline into it.</li>
            <li>I mentioned, this product has a slightly citric smell that is pleasant, but may clash with other cologne.</li>
            <li>Other than that it works fine.</li>
            <li>It is strong enough to last days, but it is also pliable.</li>
            <li>However, the hold is definitely strong enough to hold back my hair.</li>
            <li>: I think this is pretty much as strong of a hold that American Crew offers (from my limited experience).  </li>
            <li>so you can shape it the way you want and live the life you know you should be living.&amp;#34; The man took the clay jar and put it on.</li>
            <li>Works great but the wax gets really soft after a month or two making it a less firm hold.</li>
            <li>Right now, the top of my hair is getting long enough that applying product usually makes it look comically high in volume, but Molding Clay seems to get it just right, and makes my hair look like it wouldn&#x27;t be out of place in a magazine.</li>
            <li>I found out American Crew has a peppermint shampoo in a black bottle that&#x27;s supposed to be pretty strong.</li>
            <li>but I still prefer Fiber a little better, but this is a very close second.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Do not get fooled by the first look as the surface can be dry but it gets ready to style when you rub in your hands</li>
            <li>For the dudes out there, like me, who are into the whole \\&quot;Classic With A Modern Twist\\&quot; hairstyle which has been very trendy for the past few years, which is basically a very short on the sides, long on top, pompadour thing,(see:[...]) this is a great product for you.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>First, I should say that I like American Crew products.</li>
            <li>go with the fiber its better and not as greasy as the clay plus this has a funky smell i am not glad about this purchase</li>
            <li>I got it at a physical store the first time</li>
            <li>My current product is Bed Head Separation Wax, a water soluble product akin to American Crew Fiber, but definitely the most matte and highest holding of al products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>one swoop with my hand and my hair is back to how it looked in the morning when i first used the product.</li>
            <li>After using American Crew Fiber, Pomade, and Forming Cream, I was interested to try this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad product just not what I expected.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After nearly finishing the Grooming Cream, I decided that I wanted to try something with high hold and medium shine, so naturally I went for the Molding Clay as it offers just that.</li>
            <li>Leave&#x27;s greasy residue in your hair that doesn&#x27;t wash out easily with plain water.  </li>
            <li>: At first I disliked it because I thought it was too greasy without enough hold, but I slightly wet my hair and used a dime-size amount (more than I was using initially), and it creates a decent hold, good shine, and plasticity that works for my difficult hair.slightly wet my hair and used a dime-size amount (more than I was using initially), and it creates a decent hold, good shine, and plasticity that works for my difficult hair.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t call it high hold, but I would say it keeps hair moved in the general direction</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ll probably try the Fiber next for when my hair grows out a little more.  </li>
            <li>and it keeps your hair soft unlike the gel.</li>
            <li>The only knock on it is that this stuff really sticks to your hands.  </li>
            <li>this product is all natural.  </li>
            <li>it is almost all natural.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just like the old \\&quot;Molding</li>
            <li>After shampooing twelve (12) times (once with baking soda and shampoo, another with straight dish soap), the product finally came out of my hair (e.g., lathering yourself in Petroleum Jelly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the Fiber for volume and the clay for natural control without the crunch.</li>
            <li>more for a freestyle hair style that loses hold</li>
            <li>The American Crew Molding Clay has a much stronger hold than the Fiber.</li>
            <li>It gives hair a natural shine and is still touchable, not \\&quot;greasy\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>It is sticky, and gonna take time to remove completely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s darn good but not perfect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been bouncing around different American Crew products for a while, always trying to find the right one, and this one didn&#x27;t seem to foot the bill.  </li>
            <li>I find that it has the most lasting hold than other products I&#x27;ve used, such as D:fi, etc.  </li>
            <li>The hold of this product is about 2 hours strong, and a little slacking of the hair for the next 2-3 hours.</li>
            <li>It was just what the doctor ordered for my high personal demands.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my first canister of this for over 2 years and the product has not degraded in any way it&#x27;s just about empty</li>
            <li>After washing a second time with my normal shampoo (Head &amp; Shoulders), it still felt as greasy as before, so I tried my girlfriend&#x27;s shampoo (Pantine), then her minty Aveda shampoo, and my hair still felt like a greaseball.</li>
            <li>Looking for a new hair product that actually holds like is says it does??</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair looking dry or moist like gel depending on how much you use.  </li>
            <li>As expected, it is more difficult to clean off hands.</li>
            <li>You do not need to use much to style your hair, and using too much will make your hair feel heavy.</li>
            <li>Make sure you only use a very small amount.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with it, I have really thick hair that curls up a little bit in the front</li>
            <li>but apparently they discontinued it or changed the formula.</li>
            <li>and i BARELY use</li>
            <li>It holds all day, you barely need any of it</li>
            <li>I have 1.5-2.5 inch hair depending on the season and cowlicks in the front that make a clean hairstyle a little more difficult.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as wet and sticky as other hair clays/gels, the hair looks more natural and it holds the shape even for slightly longer hair.</li>
            <li>Extreme hold, very good.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>Molding Clay is around $10 for 3 oz, so the reduced expense is worth a little extra shampooing time every day (for me).sh out is Sumotech, which costs over $20 for 1.5 oz.  </li>
            <li>Molding Clay is around $10 for 3 oz, so the reduced expense is worth a little extra shampooing time every day (for me).</li>
            <li>I find that I have to do a double-shampoo with American Crew Daily Shampoo every day to completely rinse this out.  </li>
            <li>lasts a long time and works well, plus the contents are all natural</li>
            <li>so I use Forming Cream for the first few weeks then switch over to the Molding Clay.</li>
            <li>First I put a little gel then a little clay on the front and sides and my hair stays held and shined (not alot) the whole day.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it&#x27;s not a product that I would recommend if the user wants to have something that holds hair well, as from my experience the labeling of this product is false.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also important that the hair be slightly damp, but mostly dried, when you apply this product.</li>
            <li>And I am meaning the shine is too much and leaves hair not greasy but a little oily.</li>
            <li>Not as much as before, but definitely still not clean.</li>
            <li>I bought it expecting a high hold similar to the Fiber product, but this kind of disappointed.  </li>
            <li>This characteristic is totally different from other two products, so if you really care about this</li>

            <li> While it is greasy in essence (waxy), it provides great matte look</li>
            <li> smells great, looks great, tastes...</li>
            <li> However, it does an excellent job helping to style hair, stays in the hair, and can be readjusted throughout the day as needed without requiring more.</li>
            <li> You want something that will hold your hair in a flawless manner even through a Hurricane Andrew and Hurricane Katrina love making session?</li>
            <li> Great hold, smells good too.</li>
            <li> The molding clay has a fairly pleasant citrus smell.</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work even close to as good as the Molding Cream did</li>
            <li> no smell which is good and don&#x27;t compete with manly cologne.  </li>
            <li> This is a good value at a price around</li>
            <li> Has a good hold and add shine.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as good as fiber.  </li>
            <li> Good hold though.  </li>
            <li> Buy it if you want good hair, money, fame, women, etc.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved the product until taking a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but if you are looking for a good quality product that is \\&quot;clay-like\\&quot; then try something else.</li>
            <li> This is a good hair styling product.</li>
            <li> good.</li>
            <li> i wear a hat 90% of the time and when i take my hat off to eat or go indoors, my hair is still in good shape.</li>
            <li> This is a good product if you have lots of cowlicks like myself.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do any good either.</li>
            <li> Looks great and very easy to mold my course hair.  </li>
            <li> Very good stuff and washes out easily.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, I was looking for something with better good than fiber.</li>
            <li> It can hide those spots which is what I love about it!</li>
            <li> Better than any gel I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li> On the bright side, this stuff will hold up better in the rain.</li>
            <li> I use it in combination with light hair gel and it works great.</li>
            <li> You can just slide your fingers trough your hair as if you had no product on which is amazing</li>
            <li> Provides a nice matte finish</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to do, works nicely with my hairstyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smells nice.</li>
            <li> I have kind of a blond faux hawk (this makes it look oily).  </li>
            <li> If you apply to simi-dry hair you can get a nice matte look.</li>
            <li> This may be a good thing for many as you don&#x27;t have to keep reapplying.</li>
            <li> If you want a trendy look with a quiff or volume</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smell: Isn&#x27;t the greatest but whatever, can&#x27;t really smell it once it&#x27;s applied anyway.  </li>
            <li> However it is really good product, I am really satisfied.</li>
            <li> would recommend this product if your going for a greaser kind of hair style.</li>
            <li> did end up finding and buying something that was perfect for a great NON-greasy hold, and that is&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Gatsby technical clay\\&quot;  good stuff, but DONT use too much (which also is great because it lasts forever!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scent is very mild, yet pleasant smelling.</li>
            <li> It smells great, kind of citrus fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> I have had great success with Aveda&#x27;s hair clay fror men, and even stronger TIGIs remolding wax.</li>
            <li> It seems that now I have found a suitable, if not replacement, companion.  </li>
            <li> Great stuff, best available for short hair.</li>
            <li> If you look at your hands in bright light after applying the product, it&#x27;s almost as if they are covered in a very, very fine glitter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After trying most of the different products (Fiber, Defining Paste, Forming Cream, Pomade) I decided that the one I liked best was the Molding Clay.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t want to do the classic palmade that stays greasy &amp; shiny in the hair, but allows you to re-comb after taking off your hat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clay &amp; wax consistency hold better than anything and dries to an incredible hold.  </li>
            <li> Most of my styling is already done with mousse and a blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Bought for beard but Fiber works better.</li>
            <li> I was, however, looking to get something with slightly more hold.</li>
            <li> product i have ever used remember more is less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is better to shampoo your hair to take out the clay.</li>
            <li> It has a slightly more greasy hand to it (before application).</li>
            <li> also make my hair look healthy shiny.</li>
            <li> I tried this as a cheaper alternative to much more pricey products.</li>
            <li> It sure does its job though.  </li>
            <li> No stains in the hat band &amp; hair that stays in place when tipping a well fitting fedora.  </li>
            <li> I thought I would give this a try after reading reviews, and I like the performance much better than the Fiber.  </li>
            <li> This is because it is petroleum-based and not water-based like many pomades.  </li>
            <li> sadly it is more like a shiny greasy look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many hair products to help compensate for my lack of volume.</li>
            <li> Thought the product was more hold medium shine</li>
            <li> This product is so potent, however, that it took 4-5 separate washings to get this out of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product because it was compared to Brumble and Brumble Sumotech, which is my favored product, but costs about 3 times as much by volume.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s worth the price to be better than Axe stuff, but not as good as Brumble and Brumble.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more oily then Crew Fiber.  </li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t mind some shine and a greasier look--it&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li> It needs more clay( Bentonite) in the molding clay.</li>
            <li> Either way, this stuff is top notch and belongs in your hair if you&#x27;re looking to woo ladies off their feet and into your arms.</li>
            <li> Feels more akin to a medium hold, but even the Forming Cream (medium hold/medium shine) seems to hold stronger than this.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> This stuff holds better but has more shine than I wanted.</li>
            <li> The one I had gotten did not smell good like most American Crew products and despite having a great hold it took me almost 5 showers over 3 days to wash it out of my hair.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll ever find an oil based product that is more matte than &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; water based products.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> it has more holding power than fiber.</li>
            <li> thing I like most is that it isn&#x27;t over the top.</li>
            <li> but I really love this molding clay.  </li>
            <li> It is one of my favorite products.</li>
            <li> My hair devours whatever styling product I throw at it, but this stuff is magic.  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I guess it would work better for shorter hair</li>
            <li> So I washed 1 more time with my H&amp;S (note:</li>
            <li> I want to be a Greaser for Halloween, because I couldn&#x27;t take the chance that I won&#x27;t be able to wash it out again.</li>
            <li> The product smells okay, holds okay and sculpts hair</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> I find AC forming cream mush more easier to apply and wash out.</li>
            <li> Like it, don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> Need I say more?</li>
            <li> Works great for styling my boys hair, with little spikes in front, smells good too!</li>
            <li> Smells good, right amount of hold, and it&#x27;s too shiny.</li>
            <li> True to its description, the product leaves your hair looking and feeling completely natural, but with magnificent shaping and styling ability.  </li>
            <li> Aveda&#x27;s washes off cleanly with warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> High quality product with great hold that lasts all day.&lt;br</li>
            <li> All in all pretty good.</li>
            <li> I buy because it makes sexy easy flexible no greasy hair style.</li>
            <li> Make sure you have a strong shampoo to wash this out.</li>
            <li> Really depends on how much you put in your hair, but I find the shine a perfect level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For best results, apply when your hair is slightly wet.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is ideal if you have very short hair.</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t require much molding clay to get a good hold.</li>
            <li> The product is easily removed and glides effortlessly throughout my hair.</li>
            <li> Thank you, Amazon, for easily refunding me.</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t greasy and washed out of my hair easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> also recommend Mitch Reformer if you are looking for a strong hold that washes out extremely easy.</li>
            <li> The clay holds hair well and comes out easily when washing.</li>
            <li> great hold and love the low shine.</li>
            <li> The smell is the only thing I&#x27;m not crazy about, it smells alright, but it&#x27;s not the best.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t expecting the citrus smell to be so strong, but it gives a strong hold.</li>
            <li> I like a strong, workable, matte product.</li>
            <li> This product worked well to provide a strong hold for my hair.  </li>
            <li> The hold is not as strong as I thought but it still gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I have wiry, curly, wavy hair and the hold of this molding clay is perfect to hold down the frizz without looking or feeling like I&#x27;ve plastered my hair to my head.  </li>
            <li> (my hair is about 1\\&quot; long on top and 1/2\\&quot; on the sides) and style in a fairly messy/textured way on top.  </li>
            <li> Calling the product \\&quot;clay\\&quot; is a huge stretch.  </li>
            <li> The gal that cuts my hair loaded me up with a free sample and it took three or four shampoos to get my comb to glide through like</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: This actually works great.</li>
            <li> Be advised: this product&#x27;s primary ingredients are: Petrolatum and beeswax.  </li>
            <li> you are looking for a cheap styling product without regards to quality</li>
            <li> but I am expecting it to be great for short hair</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair really smooth</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would be a cheap alternative to Aveda grooming clay ([[ASIN:</li>
            <li> This was until I discovered that if you vigorously rub the product between your hands before you apply it, it spreads more evenly, and has an overall effect that makes the greasy-but-not-slicked-back-look, look good.</li>
            <li> I love using it....washing it out not so much :-)</li>
            <li> Pomade is too shiny and limp, gel is too crusty and shiny, but this stuff has the perfect amount of low shine and good hold.</li>
            <li> He kept it safe throughout his life and eventually figured out a way to replicate it and passed it on to his first born son.</li>
            <li> I opted for the Grooming Cream and had better results for my hair, this product was able to hold my hair well, but still left a greasy shine to my hair that lasted for an hour or two until it looked more</li>
            <li> A jar lasts a long time and it works great.</li>
            <li> Not disappointed.</li>
            <li> It does not rinse clean.</li>
            <li> About a year ago I decided that I would try out the different products to see which one I liked most.</li>
            <li> Probably the best hold American Crew offers, though I haven&#x27;t tried Pomade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shine</li>
            <li> I tried the full product line from American Crew as well as Redkin, but molding clay was the best by far.</li>
            <li> Excellent control of fine hiar with a little more shine than fiber product by American Crew, which makes it more suitable for more formal dress and not as shiny as the pomade which can soemtimes make hair look flat and greasy</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right!</li>
            <li> Because the hold is so strong with the Molding Clay, I can apply it to much drier hair while still getting a strong hold.  </li>
            <li> However, the product isn&#x27;t good enough by itself.</li>
            <li> your hand or maybe someone&#x27;s hand want to touch your hair to feel sexiness of full head hair.  </li>
            <li> Could be good for really short hair.</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product for longer hair, but with short hair it performs fairly well.</li>
            <li> If you do like shiny and want a more greasy texture then this product does very well in that regard, but it just was not for me.</li>
            <li> To be fair, I&#x27;ve only used this twice now</li>
            <li> Overall, a good purchase.</li>
            <li> even though the Aveda version costs more than twice as much, I&#x27;ll continue using it.</li>
            <li> Instead, it just catches the light when struck at the right angles.</li>
            <li> Came quickly and makes my hair magical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> This molding clay should be labeled a &amp;#34;wax.&amp;#34; Main ingredients include beeswax and many oils.</li>
            <li> super greasy shine.</li>
            <li> and your hair gets super greasy.</li>
            <li> quick shipping.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t consider myself a hair product specialist, especially because I only do my hair once a week when I can&#x27;t wear a hat to church, but this product is the best I have used.</li>
            <li> Once my hair fully dries I have a completely matte look with a very strong hold that I can remold throughout the day if I like.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is a huge deal, but it is something to be aware of.  </li>
            <li> American crew fiber is much better!</li>
            <li> It has a little more of a shine than I would have liked, but it still works well.</li>
            <li> not dirty oily scalp grease shiny.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold as well as American Hair Fiber, but it is still a nice product.  </li>
            <li> The Molding Clay is not capable of holding my hair any better than the Pomade, while it is labeled as having more hold.</li>
            <li> Pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> Once my hair gets longer I switch to Fiber, but for that freshly cut hair, this will do the trick.</li>
            <li> but it works well and supposedly has more natural ingredients than not.</li>
            <li> Sometimes, I just run my fingers through my hair and leave it, for a smoother more natural look.</li>
            <li> you want a medium to strong hold, try the AC Forming Cream (my favorite) or AC Defining Paste (a little dry for my taste but offers excellent hold).  </li>
            <li> It was delivered quickly and it was the exact product I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> The only product I&#x27;ve found that gives as strong of a hold as Molding Clay while also being easy to wash out is Sumotech, which costs over $20 for 1.5 oz.  </li>
            <li> This product has so far been pretty good about keeping the cowlicks in check and keeping my hair soft.</li>
            <li> The hold is pretty good, but any &amp;#34;twist and pull spikes&amp;#34; I make will not maintain the whole day, I&#x27;ve found only hairspray or gel will hold that sort of style.  </li>
            <li> and when it gets long, it doesnt do much styling wise for it.  </li>
            <li> Thankfully, Amazon makes it so hassle-free to return a product, and I quickly ordered another tub of the Grooming Cream because I was much more satisfied with that product, even if there is a greasy shine for a few hours after applying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It worked great for my super think and hard to control hair</li>
            <li> As for now, great hold for 4-5&amp;#34; hair and has a dry no mess appearance.</li>
            <li> It seemed to me the pomade quality went down over the years, but the molding clay is definitely a good replacement.  </li>
            <li> For right now, Head and Shoulders washes it out pretty well, though.</li>
            <li> But, the right hair cut and product covers things pretty well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not totally unhappy with the purchase, it does have an okay hold that I can use for more casual styles, but if I need a good looking coiffed head for more than fifteen minutes I&#x27;ll be using one of my other</li>
            <li> I did not know that this product would be oil based, and so I did not like the product very much.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t think the hold was strong enough; I would have to use it in pretty wet hair to get a strong hold, which would result in more sheen than I</li>
            <li> Not only does this product not offer more hold</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been able to acquire it online.</li>
            <li> I prefer the American crew fiber better</li>
            <li> Despite its billing as \\&quot;medium\\&quot; shine to Fiber&#x27;s \\&quot;low\\&quot; shine, I&#x27;ve found that this product actually gives a more matte look than Fiber along with a stronger hold.  </li>
            <li> Smells funny.</li>
            <li> I recommend using this in tandem with a lighter product such as the American Crew Light Hold Texture Lotion or some kind of mousse.</li>
            <li> After applying the product, AC&#x27;s leaves a waxy/sticky film on your hands that takes hot water and soap to remove.  </li>
            <li> First time I bought clay</li>
            <li> That is the only plausible explanation, that or witchcraft.</li>
            <li> After the first week or so of using this, I started to break out on my forehead.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my favorite product in the entire line of Crew hair products.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want this, you&#x27;re better sticking with the American Crew Fiber or another dryer product.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll need soap and hot water</li>
            <li> and it lasts for the whole day!  </li>
            <li> but it really hasn&#x27;t bothered me at all!</li>
            <li> if i want more shine i simply apply to damp/wet hair.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t emulsify and spread, I could see it adding a lot of weight to your hair and not properly holding shape as well as being concentrated and &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; looking in whatever part receives the most product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> Great for thick, straight hair if you want a moldable product that holds well all day.</li>
            <li> It left my hair very greasy and shiny which is not the look I was going for as I like a more matte finish.</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair and keep your hair short then this stuff is perfect.</li>
            <li> My only advice would be to not use too much of the product and to make sure to evenly distribute thoughout your hair.</li>
            <li> This product is best if you have a short hairstyle, It doesn&#x27;t have as good of a hold as Fiber and not enough volume for me as I have medium length thicker dark hair which I like to style the front up,It also separates your hair into strands which exposes the scalp in places which I did not like and seemed to just weigh the hair down.</li>
            <li> Easily reworkable and doesn&#x27;t leave a dandruff-like-flakes when it gets old like most other products.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also pretty much oder-less (to my knowledge)</li>
            <li> As long as you can wait a week for delivery, the price is better with Amazon anyway.  </li>
            <li> think this molding clay would be good for the Preppy slick look like that guy Scott from the kardashians</li>
            <li> But seriously, use like a dime size and if you need more you can get more out.</li>
            <li> It says high hold when a medium hold American Crew Forming Cream holds better</li>
            <li> When I bought this product, I definitely expected something more matte, and higher hold.</li>
            <li> It is enough hold, sufficient amount of shine, easy to use and long-lasting.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works fine for short styles that don&#x27;t require any lift or parting.</li>
            <li> Like all American Crew products, it can be pricey, which is fine if you give a damn about</li>
            <li> The ingredients are more or less natural too, which is important to me.</li>
            <li> (Oh, and it contains fine glitter, which you don&#x27;t notice in your hair, but definitely on your hands)</li>
            <li> Instead of high hold and medium shine, I personally find it has more of a medium hold and high shine, depending on the application.</li>
            <li> other commenters have mentioned, this product is great for holding your hair in place with a dry look.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got enough hold to keep your hair looking nice all day, and if you don&#x27;t use too much, it won&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy, it adds some shine which is great, adds a little texture, and a lot of separation.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of American Crew hair products, but this stuff is just not for me.  </li>
            <li> However, that doesn&#x27;t really say much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wetness mostly depends on how wet your hair is when you apply it.</li>
            <li> really think it twice before buying it from them.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.  </li>
            <li> You should know that it doesnt have as much shine as pomade.  </li>
            <li> really makes this product stand out, though, is the type and amount of shine.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is straight from the gods.</li>
            <li> then AC&#x27;s Molding Clay will likely fit the bill</li>
            <li> It takes some effort to get off the hands, and by the end of the day my hair feels very oily...</li>
            <li> fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> This stuff in not for straight medium hair.</li>
            <li> I really like the Molding Clay.</li>
            <li> have to wash my hair twice to really get this stuff out.</li>
            <li> much I put this on</li>
            <li> And besides, even if I had used the whole container, it should have washed out in fewer than 6 shampooings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t enjoy the greasy, overdone finishes that marked the 80s, but my hair doesn&#x27;t suit a completely matte finish, either.</li>
            <li> my favorite american crew product by far, (i&#x27;ve tried the forming cream and fiber).</li>
            <li> Maybe it is because I bathe regularly, or because I am particularly good at shampooing my own hair, but I did not find this product at all difficult to wash out of my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for my hair especially when it&#x27;s short because it is great for my hair to slick down and frontwards.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older and the styles have changed, I switched to American Crew Fiber for a more natural look.  </li>
            <li> Works well, smells nice but not a strong scent.</li>
            <li> I read in a review that it is hard to wash out of your hair, which is kind of true, but as far as I know there is nothing in it that would be damaging to your hair.</li>
            <li> Most other products give up when mussed by a hat</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t behave like any other hair clay I&#x27;ve used, but instead more like hair wax.</li>
            <li> When my hair is freshly cut I think the American Crew Molding Clay works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is OK (if a little waxy), but I don&#x27;t find that it has as much hold as the forming cream.  </li>
            <li> The 1 star is not for the product, I think its a great molding clay, in fact Ill buy more but not from here, way cheaper on ebay or other stores.</li>
            <li> Sometimes less is more with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I use American Crew firm hold gel, but I wanted something to good stronger.</li>
            <li> I have used the American Crew Fiber product for years and this has the same hold strength with a bit more shine.  </li>
            <li> The product smells amazing, and because only the smallest amount is needed it is sure to last a long, long time.  </li>
            <li> I am an Asian male with hair about 3-4 inches on top and faded on the sides.  </li>
            <li> Idk how it works, I&#x27;m assuming that the molding clay is full of nanobots that multiply upon contact with your hair and holds it in place with their advanced robotic technology.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> i would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> And, I&#x27;m thinning a little on top.  </li>
            <li> Lots of salons carry American Crew but it seems like this particular product is rarely stocked.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something with high hold, I&#x27;d recommend going with AC&#x27;s Fiber or Boogie&#x27;s Hair Clay, which both also have the advantage of washing out with normal shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many, many products in the past but I always found myself coming back to American Crew&#x27;s Fiber.  </li>
            <li> My hair is long up top with short sides.</li>
            <li> Instantly his life was transformed with success, passion, excitement.</li>
            <li> If you have wavy hair or hair that&#x27;s not totally smooth, then the Fiber is a better ones to use.</li>
            <li> You just have to adjust by giving the argan oil a few more minutes to absorb before applying the Molding Clay.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After applying, my hair felt like I had just worked a thick kind of vaseline into it.</li>
            <li> I mentioned, this product has a slightly citric smell that is pleasant, but may clash with other cologne.</li>
            <li> Other than that it works fine.</li>
            <li> It is strong enough to last days, but it is also pliable.</li>
            <li> However, the hold is definitely strong enough to hold back my hair.</li>
            <li> : I think this is pretty much as strong of a hold that American Crew offers (from my limited experience).  </li>
            <li> so you can shape it the way you want and live the life you know you should be living.&amp;#34; The man took the clay jar and put it on.</li>
            <li> Works great but the wax gets really soft after a month or two making it a less firm hold.</li>
            <li> Right now, the top of my hair is getting long enough that applying product usually makes it look comically high in volume, but Molding Clay seems to get it just right, and makes my hair look like it wouldn&#x27;t be out of place in a magazine.</li>
            <li> I found out American Crew has a peppermint shampoo in a black bottle that&#x27;s supposed to be pretty strong.</li>
            <li> but I still prefer Fiber a little better, but this is a very close second.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do not get fooled by the first look as the surface can be dry but it gets ready to style when you rub in your hands</li>
            <li> For the dudes out there, like me, who are into the whole \\&quot;Classic With A Modern Twist\\&quot; hairstyle which has been very trendy for the past few years, which is basically a very short on the sides, long on top, pompadour thing,(see:[...]) this is a great product for you.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> First, I should say that I like American Crew products.</li>
            <li> go with the fiber its better and not as greasy as the clay plus this has a funky smell i am not glad about this purchase</li>
            <li> I got it at a physical store the first time</li>
            <li> My current product is Bed Head Separation Wax, a water soluble product akin to American Crew Fiber, but definitely the most matte and highest holding of al products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> one swoop with my hand and my hair is back to how it looked in the morning when i first used the product.</li>
            <li> After using American Crew Fiber, Pomade, and Forming Cream, I was interested to try this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad product just not what I expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After nearly finishing the Grooming Cream, I decided that I wanted to try something with high hold and medium shine, so naturally I went for the Molding Clay as it offers just that.</li>
            <li> Leave&#x27;s greasy residue in your hair that doesn&#x27;t wash out easily with plain water.  </li>
            <li> : At first I disliked it because I thought it was too greasy without enough hold, but I slightly wet my hair and used a dime-size amount (more than I was using initially), and it creates a decent hold, good shine, and plasticity that works for my difficult hair.slightly wet my hair and used a dime-size amount (more than I was using initially), and it creates a decent hold, good shine, and plasticity that works for my difficult hair.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call it high hold, but I would say it keeps hair moved in the general direction</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ll probably try the Fiber next for when my hair grows out a little more.  </li>
            <li> and it keeps your hair soft unlike the gel.</li>
            <li> The only knock on it is that this stuff really sticks to your hands.  </li>
            <li> this product is all natural.  </li>
            <li> it is almost all natural.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just like the old \\&quot;Molding</li>
            <li> After shampooing twelve (12) times (once with baking soda and shampoo, another with straight dish soap), the product finally came out of my hair (e.g., lathering yourself in Petroleum Jelly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the Fiber for volume and the clay for natural control without the crunch.</li>
            <li> more for a freestyle hair style that loses hold</li>
            <li> The American Crew Molding Clay has a much stronger hold than the Fiber.</li>
            <li> It gives hair a natural shine and is still touchable, not \\&quot;greasy\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It is sticky, and gonna take time to remove completely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s darn good but not perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been bouncing around different American Crew products for a while, always trying to find the right one, and this one didn&#x27;t seem to foot the bill.  </li>
            <li> I find that it has the most lasting hold than other products I&#x27;ve used, such as D:fi, etc.  </li>
            <li> The hold of this product is about 2 hours strong, and a little slacking of the hair for the next 2-3 hours.</li>
            <li> It was just what the doctor ordered for my high personal demands.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my first canister of this for over 2 years and the product has not degraded in any way it&#x27;s just about empty</li>
            <li> After washing a second time with my normal shampoo (Head &amp; Shoulders), it still felt as greasy as before, so I tried my girlfriend&#x27;s shampoo (Pantine), then her minty Aveda shampoo, and my hair still felt like a greaseball.</li>
            <li> Looking for a new hair product that actually holds like is says it does??</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair looking dry or moist like gel depending on how much you use.  </li>
            <li> As expected, it is more difficult to clean off hands.</li>
            <li> You do not need to use much to style your hair, and using too much will make your hair feel heavy.</li>
            <li> Make sure you only use a very small amount.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with it, I have really thick hair that curls up a little bit in the front</li>
            <li> but apparently they discontinued it or changed the formula.</li>
            <li> and i BARELY use</li>
            <li> It holds all day, you barely need any of it</li>
            <li> I have 1.5-2.5 inch hair depending on the season and cowlicks in the front that make a clean hairstyle a little more difficult.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as wet and sticky as other hair clays/gels, the hair looks more natural and it holds the shape even for slightly longer hair.</li>
            <li> Extreme hold, very good.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> Molding Clay is around $10 for 3 oz, so the reduced expense is worth a little extra shampooing time every day (for me).sh out is Sumotech, which costs over $20 for 1.5 oz.  </li>
            <li> Molding Clay is around $10 for 3 oz, so the reduced expense is worth a little extra shampooing time every day (for me).</li>
            <li> I find that I have to do a double-shampoo with American Crew Daily Shampoo every day to completely rinse this out.  </li>
            <li> lasts a long time and works well, plus the contents are all natural</li>
            <li> so I use Forming Cream for the first few weeks then switch over to the Molding Clay.</li>
            <li> First I put a little gel then a little clay on the front and sides and my hair stays held and shined (not alot) the whole day.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it&#x27;s not a product that I would recommend if the user wants to have something that holds hair well, as from my experience the labeling of this product is false.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also important that the hair be slightly damp, but mostly dried, when you apply this product.</li>
            <li> And I am meaning the shine is too much and leaves hair not greasy but a little oily.</li>
            <li> Not as much as before, but definitely still not clean.</li>
            <li> I bought it expecting a high hold similar to the Fiber product, but this kind of disappointed.  </li>
            <li> This characteristic is totally different from other two products, so if you really care about this</li>
            <li> I have about two weeks with this product and my hair is medium thick, black, and is about 2 inches long on the top and short on the sides.</li>
            <li> worse, the next morning when I took a shower, the first shampooing didn&#x27;t seem to do anything, even though it&#x27;s usually all I need for my hair to feel clean.</li>
            <li> A little bit REALLY goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I recommend this for slightly long and messy straight</li>
            <li> The smell weakens after 30-60 minutes, so it isn&#x27;t too large of a problem( although i&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t like the slick hair look.  </li>
            <li> I initially thought that my hair was just too long for the product.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t make my hair look too shiny or too flat.  </li>
            <li> One unit will last a long time&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> I bought this product looking for a tough alternative to super hold gel.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very greasy, doesn&#x27;t hold as well as American Crew Defining Paste or Fiber, and its hard to wash out.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve had trouble finding it where I live now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used about half of the tub so far.</li>
            <li> Once upon a time, the greek god Narcissus was walking through a village and saw a man whos hair was dry and frizzy and flying all over the place.</li>
            <li> it is listed as medium shine, however if you apply to dry hair, the shine is rather low.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a natural smell, maybe slightly citrusy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> : It&#x27;s a bit weird in consistency, doesnt plop out of the container as easily as Fiber.  </li>
            <li> I bought Fiber on a recommendation but found its hold to be weak (esp for my hair) and the super matte finish was cool, but since my hair is poofy I needed to keep it with a slight shine in order to kill some of the ridiculous volume.  </li>
            <li> (it is just very greasy), but it DOES NOT WASH OUT OF YOUR (or at least my) HAIR.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give this 4 stars since dirty Trix was better in my opinion.</li>
            <li> i assume it is use for men but excuse me if woman read this and want to buy.  </li>
            <li> fairly long hold(not</li>
            <li> : There is a medium shine, definitely not as much as hairspray, and moreso than American Crew Fiber.  </li>
            <li> Nothing really helped until I tried to use a relatively thick consistency.</li>
            <li> but I live in mid America where iit is hard to find...</li>
            <li> but I have recently changed hair styles and now I need something with a little extra hold for my longer hair.  </li>
            <li> As a result I find this product a lot easier to apply to dry hair.</li>
            <li> : I am South Asian by ethnicity and thus have thick, very hard to manage/hold hair, my hair is approx 3-4inch on top and slightly less on sides and back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> jar is lasting long time because little go long way.  </li>
            <li> And this wasn&#x27;t just a case of using too much - I used less of the CREW clay than I usually use of the Aveda clay.</li>
            <li> and I felt that the Pomade was not strong enough to hold my hair, and due to the high shine, it looked quite greasy even with little of the Pomade being applied.</li>
            <li> It is thick, but not like you would normally associate with clay.</li>
            <li> It also makes my hair very soft to the touch, and doesn&#x27;t get remotely hard or</li>
            <li> 3 oz package seems small but it will last 6 - 8 weeks with daily use and even longer if you have shorter hair.  </li>
            <li> Desperate to get the grease out of my hair, I even tried hand soap hoping that would do a better job of breaking down the grease.</li>
            <li> I noticed that later on in the day my hair looks a little dryer</li>
            <li> If for some reason I move around a lot and my hair gets out of whack, I just rinse my hand through water, just enough to keep my hand a little moist, and run it through my hair and its just as I had it in the morning.</li>
            <li> My only complaint, and the reason for the 4 stars, is that my hair isn&#x27;t as reshapable with this molding clay as it is with some others, such as Aveda&#x27;s grooming clay.</li>
            <li> However, i still had trouble using it on even my short hairstyle.</li>
            <li> &quot; look was in, I would use American Crew Firm Hold Gel.  </li>
            <li> This is not what i expected for something called \\&quot;molding clay\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you like waxes or a wet look, this may be for you.</li>
            <li> It works well, but it still leaves that wet look.</li>
            <li> I was under the impression that it did not leave a wet look, but it does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of American Crew for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> Not really.</li>
            <li> My main gripe is that this product is extremely poor for sculpting.</li>
            <li> lasts forever as a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> other reviewers have said, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I would recommend having another less heavy product to use daily.</li>
            <li> I have used AC Fiber in the past and tride this for something different.</li>
            <li> No more hat hair when observing proper hat etiquette or when removing your hat when going indoors!</li>
            <li> This product creates, and I&#x27;m not sure how else to phrase this, an almost sparkly look in your hair -- it&#x27;s well distributed, but doesn&#x27;t coat the entire strand.</li>
            <li> This is like any other hair product but just know that going into this purchase.</li>
            <li> Not a problem with some other products.</li>
            <li> Looked around and found this and after reading other reviews I went ahead and bought it.  </li>
            <li> I usually use this when I go running or need it to last through activities.</li>
            <li> I guess it is because the wax isn&#x27;t water-based like some other products I have been using.</li>
            <li> Apparently I am being forced to.</li>
            <li> but it is certainly not the typical matte clay it is advertised as.</li>
            <li> FOREVER, is TSA travel approved, handles heat and cold (during traveling) very well, doesn&#x27;t make a total mess, and keeps the hair where you want it without that greasy</li>
            <li> only negative about this product (</li>
            <li> It can be difficult to wash off your hands, and the product is very oily.  </li>
            <li> This was way too greasy and weighed my hair down.</li>
            <li> only a little will do you if you have really thick hair.</li>
            <li> I typically start with just over a pea sized amount for my medium-short hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a sticky wax consistency and lasts about half the day for me at work.</li>
            <li> I have medium length blonde hair and when I applied it it made my hair look extremely grease and unappealing.</li>
            <li> It takes a little bit of rubbing to get it off your hands.  </li>
            <li> It is a little easier to get out of the container, and spread evenly on your hair.</li>
            <li> But the molding clay is a little to pliable for me.</li>
            <li> I find just using a little still makes my hair feel greasy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, buy this product if you need a lot of hold, a little bit of shine, and some texture/</li>
            <li> No super stiff feel.</li>
            <li> I need something that is firm to control my little boy hair.  </li>
            <li> I can see customers are not important to them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Strangely, this is generally not available in stores.</li>
            <li> Product ends up feeling greasy after a few hours in hair.</li>
            <li> Some review were complaining about having trouble washing it out</li>
            <li> This one has a much less intrusive smell though!</li>
            <li> This will keep your hair style throughout the day giving it a malleable feel without being stiff like you used a gel.</li>
            <li> smells like mint, not a strong hold.</li>
            <li> This will tame your hair to a controlable and manageable state</li>
            <li> /&gt;I bought Fiber and Molding Clay in my quest to tame that which is my flaming stallion of a mane.&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> A lot of people review this product as too \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; and not easily washed out of hair.</li>
            <li> I have relatively thin black hair with not much volume.</li>
            <li> helped a little but hair was greasy all day!</li>
            <li> I have incredibly thick hair that can be a little unruly in the wave department.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t go overboard.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they discontinued it, of course, so I can&#x27;t buy it locally anymore.</li>
            <li> only thing ill put on my head</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with American Crew.</li>
            <li> I usually use about a &amp;#34;dime-size&amp;#34; dab on my finger, emulsify, and brush through my hair.  </li>
            <li> But usually, I &#x27;smash&#x27; my hair, rubbing it around like I am washing it.</li>
            <li> Also, the packaging is simple and won&#x27;t make you look silly if anyone snoops in your medicine</li>
            <li> The Molding Clay does not leave a greasy shine in my hair, which is definitely a positive point, though I am still disappointed that there is almost no hold in the product.</li>
            <li> This product is hard to use.  </li>
            <li> up to you.&lt;br /&gt;this don&#x27;t make hard clump.  </li>
            <li> The clay also has glitter that is hard to get off your hands and will rub on to whatever else you touch.</li>
            <li> Stays in your hair well but doesn&#x27;t get rock hard.  </li>
            <li> It will keep your hair in place without being rock hard.</li>
            <li> Way too greasy and hard to wash out.</li>
            <li> Too hard to get any on your fingers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to remove the product from your hair&lt;</li>
            <li> drawback is that is rather thick in your hair (a dab will do ya, otherwise it will be too thick) and it is hard to wash off your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Takes two washes..at least.</li>
            <li> Just one thing you need to care about this product is that you need to wash at least two time when you are rinsing and remove this clay.</li>
            <li> If you have thick, wavy, shorter hair and don&#x27;t want a ton of shine, this stuff is what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> and this held it up for a while, all I could ask for is stronger hols cause of my thick stubborn hair</li>
            <li> you have thick hair like me, this will work wonders on your hair.</li>
            <li> and I find it extremely greasy and difficult to wash out of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When they say molding clay they mean it.  </li>
            <li> The negative is that it&#x27;s very hard to wash out.  </li>
            <li> and the reason it is getting 4 stars instead of 5) is that it is a little difficult to wash out.  </li>
            <li> so its not a good deal at all.</li>
            <li> sticky is no good to touch with hand.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is greasy, and the hold is weak.</li>
            <li> However, when I received it last night and tried it this morning, I was bitterly disappointed.</li>
            <li> With that is a reference point, Molding Clay is weak and greasy.</li>
            <li> At first, I was very disappointed with the hold and the look, which was thin, and formed aggregates of hair that exposed your scalp.</li>
            <li> However, if you don&#x27;t wash your hair twice in a row it is tough to get it all out and can get a shine build up.</li>
            <li> And it felt greasy and unhealthy, to boot.  </li>
            <li> I have found that the finish of the product itself provides a bit of parting(clumping of hair strands), but you can thin out the strand clumps with a comb if need be.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why folks seem to hate on this product because of it being &amp;#34;hard to wash out&amp;#34; - I personally didn&#x27;t have a problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping I just got a bad batch but definitely be wary in case you also have trouble washing it out.</li>
            <li> Besides that, it is really difficult to wash it out.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> Obsessed.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t put anything in my hair my hair is flat and boring.</li>
            <li> This is what I&#x27;m using now since Martix Dirty Trix was discontinued.  </li>
            <li> The shine isn&#x27;t too crazy and either is the hold.</li>
            <li> But it was an expensive lesson to learn!</li>
            <li> reviewers noted that this product was very difficult to washout.</li>
            <li> However it is impossible to wash out with one shampoo rinse.</li>
            <li> My husband is obsessed!!</li>
            <li> It does not behave like petroleum jelly, anyone who says it does is an idiot.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I tried this product \\&quot;Molding Clay\\&quot; and I hate it.</li>
            <li> But I am still very frustrated by how oily this is.  </li>
            <li> but I am still very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff tastes TERRIBLE!</li>
            <li> Terrible!</li>
            <li> The worst hair product it kills ur hair</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used about half of the tub so far. I&#x27;ve used this on both quiff-length and short hair. The molding clay has a fairly pleasant citrus smell. The product inside the tub appears silver and glittery. The product is easily removed and glides effortlessly throughout my hair. Rubbing it through your hands makes it feel a bit greasy. My main gripe is that this product is extremely poor for sculpting. I initially thought that my hair was just too long for the product. However, i still had trouble using it on even my short hairstyle. I couldn&#x27;t make the styles that I wanted. I needed to use hairsprays or a wax to actually create my styles. Most of my styling is already done with mousse and a blow dryer. Adding this product makes my hair look seperated and unappealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works fine for short styles that don&#x27;t require any lift or parting. However, that doesn&#x27;t really say much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: It does deliver on the medium shine. However, the product isn&#x27;t good enough by itself. I&#x27;ll just keep it as another cocktail piece...</li>
            <li> Bought for beard but Fiber works better. Chemical smell with this one that Fiber doesn&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li> If you like a wetter look and don&#x27;t mind your hair smelling like... clay? Buy this.</li>
            <li> First, I should say that I like American Crew products. I have used their \\&quot;fiber\\&quot; for quite some time and like it a lot. I was, however, looking to get something with slightly more hold. Not only does this product not offer more hold (it is just very greasy), but it DOES NOT WASH OUT OF YOUR (or at least my) HAIR. I have washed my hair 6 (!!!) times and I cannot get it out. Thank you, Amazon, for easily refunding me. Excellent customer service. With that said, I do recommend the American Crew Fiber. It&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
            <li> perfect hold, non-greasy, easy to wash out.&lt;br /&gt;Best product i have ever used remember more is less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would reccomend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great for thick, straight hair if you want a moldable product that holds well all day. Wetness mostly depends on how wet your hair is when you apply it. And it doesn&#x27;t require much molding clay to get a good hold. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It was delivered quickly and it was the exact product I was looking for.  One thing I noticed was the product seemed to have a different texture, I wonder if it was at one time heated up and then cooled and that is what changed the consistency.  Other than that it works fine.</li>
            <li> I use American Crew firm hold gel, but I wanted something to good stronger. The molding clay holds well and it keeps your hair soft unlike the gel. I noticed that later on in the day my hair looks a little dryer so I started using them both at the same time. First I put a little gel then a little clay on the front and sides and my hair stays held and shined (not alot) the whole day. It is better to shampoo your hair to take out the clay.</li>
            <li> The 1 star is not for the product, I think its a great molding clay, in fact Ill buy more but not from here, way cheaper on ebay or other stores. The picture said it was a 2 Pack for almost $14 but they sent me 1 so its not a good deal at all. I claimed this and I didnt recieved any answer they simply removed the picture saying it was a 2 pack.&lt;br /&gt;So really think it twice before buying it from them. I can see customers are not important to them.</li>
            <li> Works great but the wax gets really soft after a month or two making it a less firm hold.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.  I find that it has the most lasting hold than other products I&#x27;ve used, such as D:fi, etc.  It also doesn&#x27;t make my hair look too shiny or too flat.  The only knock on it is that this stuff really sticks to your hands.  It takes a little bit of rubbing to get it off your hands.  You have to use soap because water just isn&#x27;t enough to get it off.  On the bright side, this stuff will hold up better in the rain.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t expecting the citrus smell to be so strong, but it gives a strong hold.</li>
            <li> This is great hair product. I have used AC Fiber in the past and tride this for something different. I like it a lot. It is a little easier to get out of the container, and spread evenly on your hair. It has a slightly more greasy hand to it (before application). As a result I find this product a lot easier to apply to dry hair. And ultimately that is what I use this for. If my hair has some moisture in it still from showering, Fiber is my go to, but when I apply mid day, or later on after showering, this is my go to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers noted that this product was very difficult to washout. Maybe it is because I bathe regularly, or because I am particularly good at shampooing my own hair, but I did not find this product at all difficult to wash out of my hair. It does not behave like petroleum jelly, anyone who says it does is an idiot.</li>
            <li> this product is all natural.  it is great.  You should know that it doesnt have as much shine as pomade.  i have thicker hair that is wavy and when it gets long, it doesnt do much styling wise for it.  this item is perfect for those folks with looser hair, on the shorter side.  you can do sports or sweat in it.  it is almost all natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used various hair styling products; this is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has the best combination of hold and texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strangely, this is generally not available in stores. I&#x27;ve only been able to acquire it online.</li>
            <li> I have 1.5-2.5 inch hair depending on the season and cowlicks in the front that make a clean hairstyle a little more difficult. This product has so far been pretty good about keeping the cowlicks in check and keeping my hair soft. Pomade is too shiny and limp, gel is too crusty and shiny, but this stuff has the perfect amount of low shine and good hold. I wouldn&#x27;t call it high hold, but I would say it keeps hair moved in the general direction you point it.</li>
            <li> Great service. But the molding clay is a little to pliable for me. I prefer the American crew fiber better</li>
            <li> This stuff is greasy, and the hold is weak. It might as well be called \\&quot;pomade.\\&quot; Won&#x27;t use this, let alone purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I used the the \\&quot;Molding Cream\\&quot; product for years but apparently they discontinued it or changed the formula. It worked great for my super think and hard to control hair and it wasn&#x27;t greasy and washed out of my hair easily. Anyway, I tried this product \\&quot;Molding Clay\\&quot; and I hate it. It doesn&#x27;t work even close to as good as the Molding Cream did and I find it extremely greasy and difficult to wash out of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 4/29/2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found out American Crew makes a product called \\&quot;Defining Paste\\&quot;. It&#x27;s just like the old \\&quot;Molding Cream\\&quot; I was using before. Very good stuff and washes out easily.</li>
            <li> This stuff tastes TERRIBLE!</li>
            <li> This product is hard to use.  I find just using a little still makes my hair feel greasy. This doesn&#x27;t look,feel or smell like clay.  It seems like it has beeswax in it.  American crew fiber is much better!</li>
            <li> i have hair is short.  jar is lasting long time because little go long way.  i can wear hat. when take off hat I zhudz and hair have life.  also make my hair look healthy shiny. not dirty oily scalp grease shiny.  no smell which is good and don&#x27;t compete with manly cologne.  i assume it is use for men but excuse me if woman read this and want to buy.  then i say it don&#x27;t clash with lady perfume spray.  then maybe you dab. up to you.&lt;br /&gt;this don&#x27;t make hard clump.  i say use one word to describe is tacky. different from sticky like glue.  sticky is no good to touch with hand.  your hand or maybe someone&#x27;s hand want to touch your hair to feel sexiness of full head hair.  I buy because it makes sexy easy flexible no greasy hair style.</li>
            <li> I tried this as a cheaper alternative to much more pricey products. I like a strong, workable, matte product. I have had great success with Aveda&#x27;s hair clay fror men, and even stronger TIGIs remolding wax. Both are around $30...so Im just going to have to pay the price. This was way too greasy and weighed my hair down. Could be good for really short hair. Now I just use it a touch of it for shine.</li>
            <li> I need something that is firm to control my little boy hair.  This is what I&#x27;m using now since Martix Dirty Trix was discontinued.  I&#x27;ll give this 4 stars since dirty Trix was better in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I bought this product looking for a tough alternative to super hold gel.  I needed a product that would hold my heavy, straight hair in place &amp; stand up to the pressure of wearing felt &amp; straw hats.  Most other products give up when mussed by a hat and I didn&#x27;t want to do the classic palmade that stays greasy &amp; shiny in the hair, but allows you to re-comb after taking off your hat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clay &amp; wax consistency hold better than anything and dries to an incredible hold.  It was just what the doctor ordered for my high personal demands.  It leaves my hair looking dry or moist like gel depending on how much you use.  Don&#x27;t over do it though.  The gal that cuts my hair loaded me up with a free sample and it took three or four shampoos to get my comb to glide through like \\&quot;clean\\&quot; hair should feel.  It sure does its job though.  No stains in the hat band &amp; hair that stays in place when tipping a well fitting fedora.  No more hat hair when observing proper hat etiquette or when removing your hat when going indoors!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold as well as American Hair Fiber, but it is still a nice product.  Also, there is a LOT of shine in it.</li>
            <li> I am a long-time user of American Crew products.  When I was in college and the \\&quot;wet\\&quot; look was in, I would use American Crew Firm Hold Gel.  As I&#x27;ve gotten older and the styles have changed, I switched to American Crew Fiber for a more natural look.  I used Fiber for several years but I didn&#x27;t think the hold was strong enough; I would have to use it in pretty wet hair to get a strong hold, which would result in more sheen than I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter American Crew Molding Clay.  I thought I would give this a try after reading reviews, and I like the performance much better than the Fiber.  Despite its billing as \\&quot;medium\\&quot; shine to Fiber&#x27;s \\&quot;low\\&quot; shine, I&#x27;ve found that this product actually gives a more matte look than Fiber along with a stronger hold.  Because the hold is so strong with the Molding Clay, I can apply it to much drier hair while still getting a strong hold.  I&#x27;ve found with any hair product the amount of shine you get is directly proportional to how wet your hair is when you put the product in, regardless of what level of \\&quot;shininess\\&quot; the product bills itself as having.  I apply about a dime-sized amount of this to towel-dried hair (my hair is about 1\\&quot; long on top and 1/2\\&quot; on the sides) and style in a fairly messy/textured way on top.  Once my hair fully dries I have a completely matte look with a very strong hold that I can remold throughout the day if I like.  It also makes my hair very soft to the touch, and doesn&#x27;t get remotely hard or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative about this product (and the reason it is getting 4 stars instead of 5) is that it is a little difficult to wash out.  This is because it is petroleum-based and not water-based like many pomades.  I find that I have to do a double-shampoo with American Crew Daily Shampoo every day to completely rinse this out.  I don&#x27;t think this is a huge deal, but it is something to be aware of.  The only product I&#x27;ve found that gives as strong of a hold as Molding Clay while also being easy to wash out is Sumotech, which costs over $20 for 1.5 oz.  Molding Clay is around $10 for 3 oz, so the reduced expense is worth a little extra shampooing time every day (for me).sh out is Sumotech, which costs over $20 for 1.5 oz.  Molding Clay is around $10 for 3 oz, so the reduced expense is worth a little extra shampooing time every day (for me).</li>
            <li> I have used the American Crew Fiber product for years and this has the same hold strength with a bit more shine.  This is a good value at a price around $12.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 3 oz package seems small but it will last 6 - 8 weeks with daily use and even longer if you have shorter hair.  For best results, apply when your hair is slightly wet.  The wetter your hair is when you apply it will make the hold stronger.  This will keep your hair style throughout the day giving it a malleable feel without being stiff like you used a gel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many, many products in the past but I always found myself coming back to American Crew&#x27;s Fiber.  It seems that now I have found a suitable, if not replacement, companion.  True to its description, the product leaves your hair looking and feeling completely natural, but with magnificent shaping and styling ability.  The product smells amazing, and because only the smallest amount is needed it is sure to last a long, long time.  A+</li>
            <li> This product has enough hold for short and some medium length styles. It texturizes well and complements a razor cut nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What really makes this product stand out, though, is the type and amount of shine. I don&#x27;t enjoy the greasy, overdone finishes that marked the 80s, but my hair doesn&#x27;t suit a completely matte finish, either. This product creates, and I&#x27;m not sure how else to phrase this, an almost sparkly look in your hair -- it&#x27;s well distributed, but doesn&#x27;t coat the entire strand. Instead, it just catches the light when struck at the right angles. If you look at your hands in bright light after applying the product, it&#x27;s almost as if they are covered in a very, very fine glitter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewers have said, a little goes a long way. I typically start with just over a pea sized amount for my medium-short hair. It&#x27;s also important that the hair be slightly damp, but mostly dried, when you apply this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he absolutely loves it. It&#x27;s not as wet and sticky as other hair clays/gels, the hair looks more natural and it holds the shape even for slightly longer hair.</li>
            <li> Got it and i BARELY use it.&lt;br /&gt; Why?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well sadly it is more like a shiny greasy look. This is not what i expected for something called \\&quot;molding clay\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the holding power it well almost non existent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did end up finding and buying something that was perfect for a great NON-greasy hold, and that is&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Gatsby technical clay\\&quot;  good stuff, but DONT use too much (which also is great because it lasts forever!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this molding clay would be good for the Preppy slick look like that guy Scott from the kardashians he probably uses this stuff</li>
            <li> I switched to this after using the Crew pomade for some time.  It seemed to me the pomade quality went down over the years, but the molding clay is definitely a good replacement.  Provides a nice matte finish so you don&#x27;t look like you just took a shower.  Easily reworkable and doesn&#x27;t leave a dandruff-like-flakes when it gets old like most other products.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff. Works great!</li>
            <li> Happy with everything. Came quickly and makes my hair magical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again. Especially because it makes my hair majestic.</li>
            <li> Not the best product. Smells funny.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have found that keeps its hold even after workouts. I tried the full product line from American Crew as well as Redkin, but molding clay was the best by far.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly thick hair that can be a little unruly in the wave department. This doesn&#x27;t have the hold I&#x27;d like and it makes my hair look greasy. I prefer American Crew&#x27;s Defining Paste.</li>
            <li> This molding clay should be labeled a &amp;#34;wax.&amp;#34; Main ingredients include beeswax and many oils. It leaves your hair greasy looking with separated strands that expose the scalp. It does not rinse clean. If you like waxes or a wet look, this may be for you. But it was an expensive lesson to learn!</li>
            <li> I have relatively thin black hair with not much volume. My hair is long up top with short sides. If I don&#x27;t put anything in my hair my hair is flat and boring. I&#x27;ve used many hair products to help compensate for my lack of volume. From gel to pomade and even just conditioner. Nothing really helped until I tried to use a relatively thick consistency. I like the matte look from this clay and helped keep my hair up throughout the day. If for some reason I move around a lot and my hair gets out of whack, I just rinse my hand through water, just enough to keep my hand a little moist, and run it through my hair and its just as I had it in the morning.</li>
            <li> Leave&#x27;s greasy residue in your hair that doesn&#x27;t wash out easily with plain water.  However, it does an excellent job helping to style hair, stays in the hair, and can be readjusted throughout the day as needed without requiring more.</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to do, works nicely with my hairstyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only drawback is that is rather thick in your hair (a dab will do ya, otherwise it will be too thick) and it is hard to wash off your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells nice.</li>
            <li> This product is best if you have a short hairstyle, It doesn&#x27;t have as good of a hold as Fiber and not enough volume for me as I have medium length thicker dark hair which I like to style the front up,It also separates your hair into strands which exposes the scalp in places which I did not like and seemed to just weigh the hair down. It&#x27;s not a bad product just not what I expected. I&#x27;ll definitely be sticking with AC Fiber from now on.</li>
            <li> Thought the product was more hold medium shine but it was too shiney descent product overall though thats why i gave it 3 stars.</li>
            <li> super greasy shine. I looked like I hadn&#x27;t taken a shower in three days. I do not recommend it at all.</li>
            <li> Works great for styling my boys hair, with little spikes in front, smells good too!</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of American Crew hair products, but this stuff is just not for me.  I&#x27;m used to a pomade or cream with solid hold that will wash out of my hair with one or two washings.  This product is so potent, however, that it took 4-5 separate washings to get this out of my hair.  And it felt greasy and unhealthy, to boot.  Like all American Crew products, it can be pricey, which is fine if you give a damn about how your hair looks - in this industry, you get what you pay for.  But now I&#x27;ve got a $13.00 tub of Molding Clay that I&#x27;ll never use again.  So, buyer beware.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff on a daily basis. only a little will do you if you have really thick hair. I go between this and American Crews Pomade.</li>
            <li> Terrible! It doenst hold that well and your hair gets super greasy. Besides that, it is really difficult to wash it out.</li>
            <li> Make sure you only use a very small amount. A little bit REALLY goes a long way.This stuff works alright but how do I wash it out of my hair?????!!!! I&#x27;m currently trying to find the answer to that question.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: This actually works great. But seriously, use like a dime size and if you need more you can get more out. Don&#x27;t go overboard. Make sure you have a strong shampoo to wash this out. I found out American Crew has a peppermint shampoo in a black bottle that&#x27;s supposed to be pretty strong. For right now, Head and Shoulders washes it out pretty well, though.</li>
            <li> . I am an Asian male with hair about 3-4 inches on top and faded on the sides.  And, I&#x27;m thinning a little on top.  But, the right hair cut and product covers things pretty well. I bought this product because it was compared to Brumble and Brumble Sumotech, which is my favored product, but costs about 3 times as much by volume. When my hair is freshly cut I think the American Crew Molding Clay works pretty well.  However, I&#x27;ll probably try the Fiber next for when my hair grows out a little more.  I think it&#x27;s worth the price to be better than Axe stuff, but not as good as Brumble and Brumble. It smells great, kind of citrus fresh scent.  It&#x27;s a sticky wax consistency and lasts about half the day for me at work.</li>
            <li> I feel like this product is not described correctly on the label. Instead of high hold and medium shine, I personally find it has more of a medium hold and high shine, depending on the application. It doesn&#x27;t behave like any other hair clay I&#x27;ve used, but instead more like hair wax. If you&#x27;re looking for something with high hold, I&#x27;d recommend going with AC&#x27;s Fiber or Boogie&#x27;s Hair Clay, which both also have the advantage of washing out with normal shampoo.</li>
            <li> products works great, just like a pomade.</li>
            <li> ordered this as replacement for the tub I had gotten at my Hair salon. Cost was 50% cheaper than what they were offering at the sports hair cut place and 33% cheaper than Walmart.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this molding clay for probably 6 years now... it rocks... period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;lasts FOREVER, is TSA travel approved, handles heat and cold (during traveling) very well, doesn&#x27;t make a total mess, and keeps the hair where you want it without that greasy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d ever have a reason to switch to another product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also pretty much oder-less (to my knowledge)</li>
            <li> This is an exceptional hair product! Great quality for a great price! It has a soothing smell and doesn&#x27;t give your hair a shine after application, which is the reason I bought it.</li>
            <li> Pro:1. Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;2. One unit will last a long time&lt;br /&gt;3. pleasant smell&lt;br /&gt;4. fairly long hold(not necessarily strong)&lt;br /&gt;5. low gloss finish/matte finish&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: 1. Smell may collide with cologne&lt;br /&gt;2. Hold weakens after 1-2 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product for longer hair, but with short hair it performs fairly well. You do not need to use much to style your hair, and using too much will make your hair feel heavy. The hold of this product is about 2 hours strong, and a little slacking of the hair for the next 2-3 hours. I have found that the finish of the product itself provides a bit of parting(clumping of hair strands), but you can thin out the strand clumps with a comb if need be. The finish is a low gloss- almost matte finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned, this product has a slightly citric smell that is pleasant, but may clash with other cologne. The smell weakens after 30-60 minutes, so it isn&#x27;t too large of a problem( although i&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just me getting used to the smell during that time).</li>
            <li> The product works great and was at a great price. It has a little more of a shine than I would have liked, but it still works well. I think that I will give the Crew Fiber a try next.</li>
            <li> My husband is obsessed!! He loves it!!! It&#x27;s the only styling paste he&#x27;ll use</li>
            <li> This stuff should be called Molding Cement. It will stay in your hair for days, even after washing. The clay also has glitter that is hard to get off your hands and will rub on to whatever else you touch.</li>
            <li> Has a good hold and add shine.  When they say molding clay they mean it.  This smells and feels like actual clay.  You need to work it in your hands before applying.  This is like any other hair product but just know that going into this purchase.</li>
            <li> This clay is inexpensive, has a great hold, and lasts all day. I wear this stuff every day now, and don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll go back to another product. It lets you form your hair any way you like it. I use it in combination with light hair gel and it works great. Give it a try.</li>
            <li> I did not know that this product would be oil based, and so I did not like the product very much. It left my hair very greasy and shiny which is not the look I was going for as I like a more matte finish. If you do like shiny and want a more greasy texture then this product does very well in that regard, but it just was not for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as good as fiber.  I have kind of a blond faux hawk (this makes it look oily).  It&#x27;s more oily then Crew Fiber.  It you don&#x27;t mind some shine and a greasier look--it&#x27;s ok.  Good hold though.  It needs more clay( Bentonite) in the molding clay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product. The scent is very mild, yet pleasant smelling. The ingredients are more or less natural too, which is important to me. My only complaint, and the reason for the 4 stars, is that my hair isn&#x27;t as reshapable with this molding clay as it is with some others, such as Aveda&#x27;s grooming clay. This one has a much less intrusive smell though!</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I would advise anyone to try it out!</li>
            <li> Once upon a time, the greek god Narcissus was walking through a village and saw a man whos hair was dry and frizzy and flying all over the place. He approached the man and, with pity for the simpleton, gave him a small clay container that was full of a white paste. The man asked, &amp;#34;what is this?&amp;#34;. Narcissus then replied, &amp;#34;The answer to all your problems. This will tame your hair to a controlable and manageable state so you can shape it the way you want and live the life you know you should be living.&amp;#34; The man took the clay jar and put it on. Instantly his life was transformed with success, passion, excitement. He kept it safe throughout his life and eventually figured out a way to replicate it and passed it on to his first born son. The Raccuglia family continued to produce it privately until David Raccuglia went public with it and allowed the rest of us to be transformed the way his ancestor was that faitful day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR - This stuff is straight from the gods. Buy it if you want good hair, money, fame, women, etc.</li>
            <li> It works well, but it still leaves that wet look. I was under the impression that it did not leave a wet look, but it does.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Extreme all-day hold, can manipulate hair in any direction.  I absolutely loved the product until taking a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Product does not wash out of hair \\&quot;easily\\&quot; being a petroleum-based, non water-based product.  After shampooing twelve (12) times (once with baking soda and shampoo, another with straight dish soap), the product finally came out of my hair (e.g., lathering yourself in Petroleum Jelly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a medium to strong hold, try the AC Forming Cream (my favorite) or AC Defining Paste (a little dry for my taste but offers excellent hold).  Both are great products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also recommend Mitch Reformer if you are looking for a strong hold that washes out extremely easy.</li>
            <li> I recommend using this in tandem with a lighter product such as the American Crew Light Hold Texture Lotion or some kind of mousse. Perfect for scalping any desired look. Not too matte nor too shiny either, with medium-strong hold!</li>
            <li> My son uses this and he says it works great to control his hair.</li>
            <li> I have used the American Crew Pomade(Medium Hold/High Shine) and their Grooming Cream(High Hold/High Shine), and I felt that the Pomade was not strong enough to hold my hair, and due to the high shine, it looked quite greasy even with little of the Pomade being applied. I opted for the Grooming Cream and had better results for my hair, this product was able to hold my hair well, but still left a greasy shine to my hair that lasted for an hour or two until it looked more natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After nearly finishing the Grooming Cream, I decided that I wanted to try something with high hold and medium shine, so naturally I went for the Molding Clay as it offers just that. However, when I received it last night and tried it this morning, I was bitterly disappointed. The Molding Clay is not capable of holding my hair any better than the Pomade, while it is labeled as having more hold. The Molding Clay does not leave a greasy shine in my hair, which is definitely a positive point, though I am still disappointed that there is almost no hold in the product. Thankfully, Amazon makes it so hassle-free to return a product, and I quickly ordered another tub of the Grooming Cream because I was much more satisfied with that product, even if there is a greasy shine for a few hours after applying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, hair is always different, so this product may vary from person to person. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s not a product that I would recommend if the user wants to have something that holds hair well, as from my experience the labeling of this product is false.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, best available for short hair. lasts a long time and works well, plus the contents are all natural</li>
            <li> I have tried crew before but never the molding clay until I was getting my hair cut and the stylist put it on after she cut it. It&#x27;s great for my hair especially when it&#x27;s short because it is great for my hair to slick down and frontwards. If you have some spots where you can see scalp this is really great for you because it doesn&#x27;t make those look noticeable. It can hide those spots which is what I love about it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is ideal if you have very short hair. If you apply to simi-dry hair you can get a nice matte look. However, if you don&#x27;t wash your hair twice in a row it is tough to get it all out and can get a shine build up. I would recommend having another less heavy product to use daily.</li>
            <li> Be advised: this product&#x27;s primary ingredients are: Petrolatum and beeswax.  Calling the product \\&quot;clay\\&quot; is a huge stretch.  I use Aveda&#x27;s Grooming Clay and I thought I would try American Crew out as a cheaper alternative.  It does not compare.  American Crew&#x27;s Molding Clay is waxy whereas Aveda&#x27;s is silky.  After applying the product, AC&#x27;s leaves a waxy/sticky film on your hands that takes hot water and soap to remove.  Aveda&#x27;s washes off cleanly with warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a cheap styling product without regards to quality then AC&#x27;s Molding Clay will likely fit the bill but if you are looking for a good quality product that is \\&quot;clay-like\\&quot; then try something else.</li>
            <li> I like the Fiber for volume and the clay for natural control without the crunch. Can only get this in salons but I live in mid America where iit is hard to find...so I order it! Get it cheaper and delivered to my door!</li>
            <li> This is the only hair product that controls my poofy hair! Unfortunately, they discontinued it, of course, so I can&#x27;t buy it locally anymore.</li>
            <li> If you have wavy hair or hair that&#x27;s not totally smooth, then the Fiber is a better ones to use.</li>
            <li> This is a good hair styling product. The only Crew products i have used before is Fiber but gave this a shot. They are very similar in how they feel and look in your hair but I still prefer Fiber a little better, but this is a very close second.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years. A jar lasts a long time and it works great. No super stiff feel. Pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. Just has a bit of a funky smell</li>
            <li> First time I bought clay I must say I am quite impressed. Will keep buying once I&#x27;m done with it.</li>
            <li> Looking for a new hair product that actually holds like is says it does?? Then look out party people because you need to look no further! You want something that will hold your hair in a flawless manner even through a Hurricane Andrew and Hurricane Katrina love making session? Then you have found your product! This stuff could&#x27;ve stopped Chernobyl from exploding, could have sealed Vesuvius and could&#x27;ve patched up the titanic. It will not wash out, but if you&#x27;re like me, that means you only have to style your hair once a week. This stuff is unreal! Did I mention that you only have to use like a peanut sized amount? That&#x27;s right! Idk how it works, I&#x27;m assuming that the molding clay is full of nanobots that multiply upon contact with your hair and holds it in place with their advanced robotic technology. That is the only plausible explanation, that or witchcraft. Either way, this stuff is top notch and belongs in your hair if you&#x27;re looking to woo ladies off their feet and into your arms.</li>
            <li> Excellent control of fine hiar with a little more shine than fiber product by American Crew, which makes it more suitable for more formal dress and not as shiny as the pomade which can soemtimes make hair look flat and greasy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been bouncing around different American Crew products for a while, always trying to find the right one, and this one didn&#x27;t seem to foot the bill.  I bought it expecting a high hold similar to the Fiber product, but this kind of disappointed.  Feels more akin to a medium hold, but even the Forming Cream (medium hold/medium shine) seems to hold stronger than this.  It can be difficult to wash off your hands, and the product is very oily.  After the first week or so of using this, I started to break out on my forehead.  I&#x27;m not totally unhappy with the purchase, it does have an okay hold that I can use for more casual styles, but if I need a good looking coiffed head for more than fifteen minutes I&#x27;ll be using one of my other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FUTURE EDIT:  A couple months later, I&#x27;ve gotten used to the hold, and I&#x27;ll say that it&#x27;s definitely usable.  But I am still very frustrated by how oily this is.  It takes some effort to get off the hands, and by the end of the day my hair feels very oily...Not a problem with some other products.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Stays in your hair well but doesn&#x27;t get rock hard.  It will keep your hair in place without being rock hard.</li>
            <li> It did not make my hair turn out the way I wanted</li>
            <li> quick shipping. item as described.</li>
            <li> go with the fiber its better and not as greasy as the clay plus this has a funky smell i am not glad about this purchase</li>
            <li> Great stuff, I was looking for something with better good than fiber. This stuff holds better but has more shine than I wanted. Also leaves an oily feel in your hair after showering. Good stuff though!</li>
            <li> This stuff is OK (if a little waxy), but I don&#x27;t find that it has as much hold as the forming cream.  I have gone back to and will likely keep using forming cream.</li>
            <li> High quality product with great hold that lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;This is my favorite product in the entire line of Crew hair products.</li>
            <li> I think my title describes everything you need to know about this product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried multiple kinds of shampoos to rinse the residue out of my hair, but always had to resort to bar soap to get everything off.</li>
            <li> I tried this product after trying the fiber and regular pomade. The one I had gotten did not smell good like most American Crew products and despite having a great hold it took me almost 5 showers over 3 days to wash it out of my hair. I&#x27;m hoping I just got a bad batch but definitely be wary in case you also have trouble washing it out.</li>
            <li> This is my second time purchasing this product.  I got it at a physical store the first time but I&#x27;ve had trouble finding it where I live now so I simply bought it off of Amazon.  Lots of salons carry American Crew but it seems like this particular product is rarely stocked.  As long as you can wait a week for delivery, the price is better with Amazon anyway.  It arrived without any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other commenters have mentioned, this product is great for holding your hair in place with a dry look.  I have bright blond hair and I really don&#x27;t like the slick hair look.  I&#x27;ve had my first canister of this for over 2 years and the product has not degraded in any way it&#x27;s just about empty though so I&#x27;m getting another.</li>
            <li> When I bought this product, I definitely expected something more matte, and higher hold. My current product is Bed Head Separation Wax, a water soluble product akin to American Crew Fiber, but definitely the most matte and highest holding of al products I&#x27;ve tried. With that is a reference point, Molding Clay is weak and greasy. Don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll ever find an oil based product that is more matte than &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; water based products. When you press it out of the canister, the product feels oily. (Oh, and it contains fine glitter, which you don&#x27;t notice in your hair, but definitely on your hands) At first, I was very disappointed with the hold and the look, which was thin, and formed aggregates of hair that exposed your scalp. This was until I discovered that if you vigorously rub the product between your hands before you apply it, it spreads more evenly, and has an overall effect that makes the greasy-but-not-slicked-back-look, look good. Right now, the top of my hair is getting long enough that applying product usually makes it look comically high in volume, but Molding Clay seems to get it just right, and makes my hair look like it wouldn&#x27;t be out of place in a magazine.</li>
            <li> This product worked well to provide a strong hold for my hair.  the only problem is that it doesn&#x27;t come off of your hands well with soap.  This may be a good thing for many as you don&#x27;t have to keep reapplying.</li>
            <li> Looks great and very easy to mold my course hair.  The negative is that it&#x27;s very hard to wash out.  Takes two washes..at least.</li>
            <li> Best hair gel I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s actually a putty.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s contains glitter and it&#x27;s difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> smells like mint, not a strong hold. more for a freestyle hair style that loses hold</li>
            <li> If you have thick, wavy, shorter hair and don&#x27;t want a ton of shine, this stuff is what you&#x27;re looking for. Smells good, right amount of hold, and it&#x27;s too shiny. Once my hair gets longer I switch to Fiber, but for that freshly cut hair, this will do the trick.</li>
            <li> Product ends up feeling greasy after a few hours in hair. If you don&#x27;t want this, you&#x27;re better sticking with the American Crew Fiber or another dryer product.</li>
            <li> only thing ill put on my head</li>
            <li> The American Crew Molding Clay has a much stronger hold than the Fiber. As expected, it is more difficult to clean off hands. You&#x27;ll need soap and hot water but I am expecting it to be great for short hair should I decide to have it cut. As for now, great hold for 4-5&amp;#34; hair and has a dry no mess appearance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of American Crew for a few years now.  I started off with the American Crew Pomade but I have recently changed hair styles and now I need something with a little extra hold for my longer hair.  Looked around and found this and after reading other reviews I went ahead and bought it.  I am going for that slicked back &amp;#34;Justin Timberlake&amp;#34; hair style and this totally does the trick.  It holds my hair where i want it to be and it lasts for the whole day!  Great product! You can&#x27;t go wrong with American Crew.</li>
            <li> fast delivery.  good.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It holds all day, you barely need any of it so it lasts forever, and it won&#x27;t wash off with sweat.  Some review were complaining about having trouble washing it out but it really hasn&#x27;t bothered me at all!</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair and keep your hair short then this stuff is perfect. It is strong enough to last days, but it is also pliable. I read in a review that it is hard to wash out of your hair, which is kind of true, but as far as I know there is nothing in it that would be damaging to your hair.</li>
            <li> amercian crew molding clay is everything i thought american crew would be. it has more holding power than fiber. i wear a hat 90% of the time and when i take my hat off to eat or go indoors, my hair is still in good shape. one swoop with my hand and my hair is back to how it looked in the morning when i first used the product. it is listed as medium shine, however if you apply to dry hair, the shine is rather low. i like this because it gives me versatility. if i want more shine i simply apply to damp/wet hair. i would highly recommend this product. my favorite american crew product by far, (i&#x27;ve tried the forming cream and fiber).</li>
            <li> Ever since I can remember I have used American Crew products for my hair. About a year ago I decided that I would try out the different products to see which one I liked most. After trying most of the different products (Fiber, Defining Paste, Forming Cream, Pomade) I decided that the one I liked best was the Molding Clay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing I like most is that it isn&#x27;t over the top. The shine isn&#x27;t too crazy and either is the hold. However, the hold is definitely strong enough to hold back my hair. I wouldn&#x27;t consider myself a hair product specialist, especially because I only do my hair once a week when I can&#x27;t wear a hat to church, but this product is the best I have used.</li>
            <li> Works well, smells nice but not a strong scent. I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> This stuff in not for straight medium hair. If you want a trendy look with a quiff or volume this is not the your product. It is heavy, so it falls away and also it is really visible... And I am meaning the shine is too much and leaves hair not greasy but a little oily.</li>
            <li> Too grippy for what I was looking for..</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of different products but I really love this molding clay.  I have used it for almost 2 years now.</li>
            <li> If you are going for the &amp;#34;messy&amp;#34; look, this is where it is at. I have been using this for years. It is thick, but not like you would normally associate with clay. It also has a pleasant fragrance. The clay holds hair well and comes out easily when washing. It is one of my favorite products.</li>
            <li> I love using it....washing it out not so much :-) It holds all day and does not leave any flaky pieces laying around.</li>
            <li> Great hold, smells good too. This is a good product if you have lots of cowlicks like myself. Holds firm and doesnt cause too much sheen coming off your hair.</li>
            <li> Way too greasy and hard to wash out. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> The worst hair product it kills ur hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the first brand I use, I usually use Layrite but it works well and supposedly has more natural ingredients than not. It is also within the TSA container sizes for flights so it is prefect for traveling. I usually use this when I go running or need it to last through activities.</li>
            <li> My hair devours whatever styling product I throw at it, but this stuff is magic.  It holds and doesn&#x27;t make my hair look extra oily or crunchy.  Obsessed.</li>
            <li> I really like the Molding Clay. While it is greasy in essence (waxy), it provides great matte look&lt;br /&gt;Do not get fooled by the first look as the surface can be dry but it gets ready to style when you rub in your hands</li>
            <li> great hold and love the low shine. The only problem is the oily residue it leaves in the hair. have to wash my hair twice to really get this stuff out.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why folks seem to hate on this product because of it being &amp;#34;hard to wash out&amp;#34; - I personally didn&#x27;t have a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought Fiber and Molding Clay in my quest to tame that which is my flaming stallion of a mane.&lt;br /&gt;Note: I am South Asian by ethnicity and thus have thick, very hard to manage/hold hair, my hair is approx 3-4inch on top and slightly less on sides and back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell: Isn&#x27;t the greatest but whatever, can&#x27;t really smell it once it&#x27;s applied anyway.  It&#x27;s a natural smell, maybe slightly citrusy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hold: I think this is pretty much as strong of a hold that American Crew offers (from my limited experience).  I bought Fiber on a recommendation but found its hold to be weak (esp for my hair) and the super matte finish was cool, but since my hair is poofy I needed to keep it with a slight shine in order to kill some of the ridiculous volume.  The hold is pretty good, but any &amp;#34;twist and pull spikes&amp;#34; I make will not maintain the whole day, I&#x27;ve found only hairspray or gel will hold that sort of style.  Probably the best hold American Crew offers, though I haven&#x27;t tried Pomade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shine: There is a medium shine, definitely not as much as hairspray, and moreso than American Crew Fiber.  Really depends on how much you put in your hair, but I find the shine a perfect level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consistency: It&#x27;s a bit weird in consistency, doesnt plop out of the container as easily as Fiber.  I usually use about a &amp;#34;dime-size&amp;#34; dab on my finger, emulsify, and brush through my hair.  If you don&#x27;t emulsify and spread, I could see it adding a lot of weight to your hair and not properly holding shape as well as being concentrated and &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; looking in whatever part receives the most product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to Wash Out?  Yes, didn&#x27;t have problems.  Need to use soap to get off your hands though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: At first I disliked it because I thought it was too greasy without enough hold, but I slightly wet my hair and used a dime-size amount (more than I was using initially), and it creates a decent hold, good shine, and plasticity that works for my difficult hair.slightly wet my hair and used a dime-size amount (more than I was using initially), and it creates a decent hold, good shine, and plasticity that works for my difficult hair.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with it, I have really thick hair that curls up a little bit in the front and this held it up for a while, all I could ask for is stronger hols cause of my thick stubborn hair</li>
            <li> I have short hair, modeled after Miley Cyrus. I been using ACMC for years now. Sometimes, I just run my fingers through my hair and leave it, for a smoother more natural look. But usually, I &#x27;smash&#x27; my hair, rubbing it around like I am washing it. This creates an almost teased effect, which I then accentuate by pulling up individual spikes. I always get compliments.</li>
            <li> Holds well and is workable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very greasy, doesn&#x27;t hold as well as American Crew Defining Paste or Fiber, and its hard to wash out.</li>
            <li> After using American Crew Fiber, Pomade, and Forming Cream, I was interested to try this product. A lot of people review this product as too \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; and not easily washed out of hair. To be fair, I&#x27;ve only used this twice now and it&#x27;s a good product. It gives hair a natural shine and is still touchable, not \\&quot;greasy\\&quot;. I also had no problem washing it out of my hair. The hold is not as strong as I thought but it still gets the job done. I think people with thinner hair should use American Crew Forming Cream. My hair is a bit thicker as it gets longer so I use Forming Cream for the first few weeks then switch over to the Molding Clay. My only advice would be to not use too much of the product and to make sure to evenly distribute thoughout your hair. Overall, a good purchase. Not disappointed. Gets the job done.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the Crew palmade-type styling product for me.  I have wiry, curly, wavy hair and the hold of this molding clay is perfect to hold down the frizz without looking or feeling like I&#x27;ve plastered my hair to my head.  Negligible downside is that the clay in the Molding Clay absorbs a bit of the argan oil I put on before the Molding Clay.  You just have to adjust by giving the argan oil a few more minutes to absorb before applying the Molding Clay.</li>
            <li> Sometimes less is more with this stuff. All in all pretty good.</li>
            <li> Not a fan. Too hard to get any on your fingers.</li>
            <li> I love it I use it a lot when I don&#x27;t feel like doing my hair much I put this on</li>
            <li> Made me look like a grease ball used it once. should have tested it before a work morning. didn&#x27;t have time to wash my hair again so i tried to rub it out with paper towels. helped a little but hair was greasy all day!</li>
            <li> I recommend this for slightly long and messy straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought three American Crew products : Molding clay, Foaming cream and Fiber. All three reviews are following,&lt;br /&gt;Smell : (foaming)cream&amp;#62;(molding)clay&amp;#62;fiber&lt;br /&gt;Hold : fiber&amp;#62;clay&amp;#62;cream&lt;br /&gt;Shine : clay&amp;#62;cream&amp;#62;fiber&lt;br /&gt;creaminess : cream&amp;#62;clay&amp;#62;fiber&lt;br /&gt;lasting : clay&amp;#62;fiber&amp;#62;cream&lt;br /&gt;I like clay, and feel it is the best for my hair. It is enough hold, sufficient amount of shine, easy to use and long-lasting. Just one thing you need to care about this product is that you need to wash at least two time when you are rinsing and remove this clay. It is sticky, and gonna take time to remove completely. This characteristic is totally different from other two products, so if you really care about this and you do not want to takes time to wash your hair, I don&#x27;t recommend this to buy. However it is really good product, I am really satisfied.</li>
            <li> For the dudes out there, like me, who are into the whole \\&quot;Classic With A Modern Twist\\&quot; hairstyle which has been very trendy for the past few years, which is basically a very short on the sides, long on top, pompadour thing,(see:[...]) this is a great product for you.&lt;br /&gt;If you have thick hair like me, this will work wonders on your hair. It&#x27;s got enough hold to keep your hair looking nice all day, and if you don&#x27;t use too much, it won&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy, it adds some shine which is great, adds a little texture, and a lot of separation. The smell is the only thing I&#x27;m not crazy about, it smells alright, but it&#x27;s not the best. But the smell won&#x27;t matter after the product settles in your hair. Also, the packaging is simple and won&#x27;t make you look silly if anyone snoops in your medicine cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;Another tip is to apply this product on damp hair BEFORE blow-drying, if you blow-dry it into your hair, it will give your hair a healthier sheen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, buy this product if you need a lot of hold, a little bit of shine, and some texture/separation.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a life-saver.</li>
            <li> I have about two weeks with this product and my hair is medium thick, black, and is about 2 inches long on the top and short on the sides. Here are the pros and cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- You can just slide your fingers trough your hair as if you had no product on which is amazing&lt;br /&gt;- It leaves your hair really smooth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- It says high hold when a medium hold American Crew Forming Cream holds better&lt;br /&gt;- It makes your hair appear greasy&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s hard to remove the product from your hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product if your going for a greaser kind of hair style.</li>
            <li> I suppose that the hold is there but I am still very disappointed with this product. I have medium length blonde hair and when I applied it it made my hair look extremely grease and unappealing. I guess it would work better for shorter hair but it is certainly not the typical matte clay it is advertised as.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would be a cheap alternative to Aveda grooming clay ([[ASIN:B002CMLS0A Aveda Mens Pure-Formance Grooming Clay, 2.6-Ounce Jar]]).&lt;br /&gt;I was beyond disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After applying, my hair felt like I had just worked a thick kind of vaseline into it. By the end of the day, it felt like I hadn&#x27;t washed my hair in a month. All day at work I didn&#x27;t want people looking at me, because I felt like I looked like a greaseball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even worse, the next morning when I took a shower, the first shampooing didn&#x27;t seem to do anything, even though it&#x27;s usually all I need for my hair to feel clean. After washing a second time with my normal shampoo (Head &amp; Shoulders), it still felt as greasy as before, so I tried my girlfriend&#x27;s shampoo (Pantine), then her minty Aveda shampoo, and my hair still felt like a greaseball. Desperate to get the grease out of my hair, I even tried hand soap hoping that would do a better job of breaking down the grease. It didn&#x27;t do any good either. So I washed 1 more time with my H&amp;S (note: that&#x27;s the 6th shampooing) hoping the remaining greasy feeling was just a side-effect of washing my hair 5 times and using shampoo (and soap) I&#x27;m not used to. It wasn&#x27;t - my hair was still greasy. After drying it, it still felt like I had just put some styling clay in it. Not as much as before, but definitely still not clean. And this wasn&#x27;t just a case of using too much - I used less of the CREW clay than I usually use of the Aveda clay. And besides, even if I had used the whole container, it should have washed out in fewer than 6 shampooings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So even though the Aveda version costs more than twice as much, I&#x27;ll continue using it. This stuff is just going in the garbage. I can&#x27;t even keep it around in case I want to be a Greaser for Halloween, because I couldn&#x27;t take the chance that I won&#x27;t be able to wash it out again. All I can do is hope the rest of it washes out tomorrow, and then never use it again!</li>
            <li> The product smells okay, holds okay and sculpts hair okay. However it is impossible to wash out with one shampoo rinse. I guess it is because the wax isn&#x27;t water-based like some other products I have been using. I find AC forming cream mush more easier to apply and wash out.</li>
            <li> Better than any gel I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li> Extreme hold, very good.&lt;br /&gt;Not greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps all in place.&lt;br /&gt;Great effects! I will buy more.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!&lt;br /&gt;Congratulations on the formula!!</li>
            <li> well here we have it folks. smells great, looks great, tastes...i havent tried yet. lasts forever as a little goes a long way. and you look like a man</li>
            <li> Like it, don&#x27;t love it. It&#x27;s darn good but not perfect.</li>
            <li> Still just what I wanted. Nothing has changed. Need I say more? Apparently I am being forced to. Not really.</li>
