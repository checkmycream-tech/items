            <li>this machine is better</li>
            <li>then salon threading it takes more than 2weeks for hair to grow...</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I really satisfied with their customer service.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, but you do need experience with shaping eyebrows to do it yourself.</li>
            <li>, I got 3 HUGE ingrown chin hairs, (Never had any on face before) -</li>
            <li>/&gt;And if after all this, you still want to buy one - I&#x27;ll send you mine for free.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use but the hair grow up again quickly.</li>

            <li>But works great on other area.</li>
            <li>Pulled some hairs out of the root but cut many more, which means they grew back sharper and thicker.  </li>
            <li>i found this produxt very usefule, and easy to use, and it dose what it advertises.</li>
            <li>If I could send you a pic of what my chin looks like right now, with a</li>
            <li>I spent the $90 for it and it is worth the convenience and privacy of my own home</li>
            <li>Buying  this machine will more than pay for itself with no trips to salon to have eyebrows shaped&lt;br /&gt;Better than plucking which you have to do too regularly and can be sore</li>
            <li>and I really like their customer service.</li>
            <li>It shapes up the eyebrows really well..</li>
            <li>and it was working great on my thick facial hair</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend buying this product..</li>
            <li>can clear my face and never need to visit a salon for that .</li>
            <li>However I will not recommend this brand to anyone, I had this machine for a year and 3 months now and it began to act up before I could even complete a year with it.</li>
            <li>Other problem is that the machine has only one speed and it&#x27;s pretty fast.</li>
            <li>My skin is usually pretty tough, so to be sure I wasn&#x27;t just breaking out for some other reason, I tried it on my arm and the same thing happened - bunch of ingrowns (on my arm!).  </li>
            <li>It does what it says and is well worth the small investment.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Since i bought this machine i have recommend to few of my co-works, they are going to order theirs soon.</li>
            <li> Very expensive product that does very limited things, no warranty enclosed, made in china and the design limits areas where it could be used.&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li> Avoid the price scams, too - it&#x27;s a poor product</li>

            <li> This is a convenient product because it saves you money and trips to the threading salon every 2 weeks. However I will not recommend this brand to anyone, I had this machine for a year and 3 months now and it began to act up before I could even complete a year with it. Also I did not over use this item I would only use it for my upper lip and chin. Another down fall to this item is that it is not wireless you have to keep it connected to the wire in order for it to work. As of a few weeks no this item will not even turn on for me, I tried to get an exchange but the company denied my request. I suggest you try and look for another brand because this one was not worth it at all.</li>
            <li> It worked great for me. It removed the hair cleanly from the roots with no problem - no ingrown hair or anything like that. My eyebrows look great and it was a lot cheaper than going to a salon. It&#x27;s easy to use, but you do need experience with shaping eyebrows to do it yourself. If you have that, then it&#x27;s a breeze to use!</li>
            <li> I love this threading machine,&lt;br /&gt;Since i bought this machine i haven&#x27;t been to salon to do my face...  this machine is better then salon threading it takes more than 2weeks for hair to grow...&lt;br /&gt;Since i bought this machine i have recommend to few of my co-works, they are going to order theirs soon.</li>
            <li> This product works. I have used it 2x and I love it. The reason for 4 star is that they certified mail the package and I had to go to post office to pick it up. Other problem is that the machine has only one speed and it&#x27;s pretty fast. Don&#x27;t do your eyebrow if you don&#x27;t know what you are doing. I went through mine. But works great on other area.</li>
            <li> This machine is the best I was spending $33 every 2weeks when I found this online I spent the $90 for it and it is worth the convenience and privacy of my own home I would buy it again no questions.The only reason it&#x27;s not 5 stars it&#x27;s because it doesn&#x27;t automatically take care of everything.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use but the hair grow up again quickly. It doesn&#x27;t seem to remove the hair from its roots.</li>
            <li> I bought this threading machine in December and it was working great on my thick facial hair, I loved this product and recommend to use and I really like their customer service. I really satisfied with their customer service.</li>
            <li> Great product! It does a good job of threading - very impressed.</li>
            <li> Buying  this machine will more than pay for itself with no trips to salon to have eyebrows shaped&lt;br /&gt;Better than plucking which you have to do too regularly and can be sore&lt;br /&gt;Takes longer to grow back using this method&lt;br /&gt;Recommended purchase</li>
            <li> Pulled some hairs out of the root but cut many more, which means they grew back sharper and thicker.  The pull was so rough, I had red bumps/pimples that lasted WEEKS and scarred for a few months afterwards.  My skin is usually pretty tough, so to be sure I wasn&#x27;t just breaking out for some other reason, I tried it on my arm and the same thing happened - bunch of ingrowns (on my arm!).  The worst part - I used it ONCE on my face, I got 3 HUGE ingrown chin hairs, (Never had any on face before) - Now it&#x27;s over a year later and I am still figuring out how to get rid of them.  If I could send you a pic of what my chin looks like right now, with a it&#x27;s grossly infected year-old ingrown, you would never think twice about this machine.  Definitely not for use on eyebrows, it will pull out your lashes, there&#x27;s warnings all over the web about this.  Avoid the price scams, too - it&#x27;s a poor product whether you find it at $15 or $80.  Be careful with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if after all this, you still want to buy one - I&#x27;ll send you mine for free.  Hey, it&#x27;s only been used once!</li>
            <li> it is perfect machine,it works easily. everything is in the karton .i can clear my face and never need to visit a salon for that .</li>
            <li> Perfect for at home threading when you cannot afford or want to wait at a salon.  I&#x27;ve saved so much money and am completely satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> its very good I like it and I will use it always&lt;br /&gt;thanks a lot but maybe I will need strings?</li>
            <li> wonderful product, love it</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she loves it. It does what it says and is well worth the small investment.</li>
            <li> i found this produxt very usefule, and easy to use, and it dose what it advertises. I recomend it to any one</li>
            <li> Very expensive product that does very limited things, no warranty enclosed, made in china and the design limits areas where it could be used.&lt;br /&gt;Wish I never bought it.</li>
            <li> The product is amazing.. From the time I bought it I have not Ben to the salon for threading my eyebrows.. It shapes up the eyebrows really well.. I would highly recommend buying this product..</li>
            <li> Works great every happy!!!</li>
