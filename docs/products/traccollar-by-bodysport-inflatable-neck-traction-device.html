    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>And after using this neck support, that dizziness is gone, awesome!</li>
            <li>this helps a great deal and no surgery!!!</li>
            <li>Excellent device.  </li>
            <li>The best use case is to combine rest and use of this traction collar</li>
            <li>Best neck traction you can by for home use that is a pump up.</li>
            <li>The collar itself is very good, the problem is the pump.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy I can watch TV and play games on my computer again though.</li>
            <li>Definitely a great purchase.</li>
            <li>collar works as described and provided great temporary relief from neck starin at the computer.</li>
            <li>This is a great cervical collar.  </li>
            <li>I am happy I bought it.</li>
            <li>Slept great that night.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it is great.  </li>
            <li>It was great while it worked.  </li>
            <li>This works great, I like to use it while walking on the treadmill.</li>
            <li>(S/M Great fit!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just as pictured and described seems to do very nice job</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not latex allergic, it would be fine, its a great concept, but if your latex sensitive/allergic, DO NOT use this product!</li>
            <li>good choice.</li>
            <li>Felt so good.</li>
            <li>This traction device sounded like a good idea but didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li>- you have made my quality of life thousands of times better!</li>
            <li>/&gt;While the Collar works, it&#x27;s not 100% effective, so that&#x27;s the 4 stars.  </li>
            <li>It operates efficiently and effectively as described.</li>
            <li>The relief is immediate and it&#x27;s very comfortable.</li>
            <li>My neck feels much better now.</li>
            <li>It was recommended by my Feldenkrais worker, and I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>After the steroid shot she&#x27;s been able to stay on her feet for a couple of hours, and the TracCollar has been helping a lot to shorten the rest/recovery times she needs to spend in an incline bench or laying down.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Something that puts more of the load on the hips and waist instead of just your shoulder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love to wear it when I&amp;#34;m driving.  </li>
            <li>I have a herniated disc in my C-spine, which hurts most when I am seated.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to sleep so much better.</li>
            <li>I love this product and it&#x27;s working well for me.</li>
            <li>Without going into too many details, I suffer from a myriad of chronic ailments and have an inoperable condition.</li>
            <li>so I took the plunge and bought it off my favorite sight</li>
            <li>I was motivated to explore it more</li>
            <li>So much more.</li>
            <li>I was and am, in love.</li>
            <li>I may create a series because of it&#x27;s many uses.</li>
            <li>However I am able to overlap the rear ends for a better fit.</li>
            <li>I purchased this collar looking for an alternative to the over-the-door (OTD) traction system I had been using in hopes of finding something more comfortable and convenient.  </li>
            <li>I purchased it on my own right here from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the neck traction device is easy to use if you can reach around your neck to put in on...which I have difficulty with...</li>
            <li>they slip into the slots easily and to unclasp all you do</li>
            <li>then easily release the air.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But then again, you can take it with you easily, and it provides a measure of relief.</li>
            <li>Delivery etc was fine.</li>
            <li>the lowest price since there was free shipping.</li>
            <li>It works, it&#x27;s a great product, I got instant relief after I took it off.</li>
            <li>has relieved my pain and is comfortable to wear while reading or watching television.</li>
            <li>Collar works well for light traction.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t feeling up to the visit after the appointment, so after getting motivated once I returned home I began browsing the internet to look for something to fit my needs.</li>
            <li>Immobilizers were cheap, foam collars were cheap, but this kept calling to me.</li>
            <li>I hope you enjoy my video.</li>
            <li>just want to take a moment to thank the manufacturers OMPU from Stockholm Sweden and Body Sport for creating, designing, developing, manufacturing and making this available to folks like us.</li>
            <li>free to hit me up with questions if you need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For an inexpensive quick fix it is a great product especially for the price!    </li>
            <li>Very comfortable, very well made.</li>
            <li>- that&#x27;s right - AMAZON!</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far have been using it for a week, and I think it is proving to be moderately effective,</li>
            <li>It more than made up for it by providing me much needed relief when I needed it as well as a means to feel confidant I can ride along in a vehicle without being up all not in excruciating pain.</li>
            <li>Again, I just cannot say enough good things about this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it also works as a quick fix.</li>
            <li>so very much!</li>
            <li>It works so great that my chiropractor has decided to carry the line in his inventory for his other patients!</li>
            <li>High quality construction and the carry/storage case is a great extra.</li>
            <li>My neck is pretty standard for a woman and the S/M didn&#x27;t leave me feeling choked - the pressure felt good.  </li>
            <li>It could also help stabilize the c-spine with a more \\&quot;customized\\&quot; fit than a regular foam c-collar.  </li>
            <li>this is a really useful product.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny I pay and when this one wears out I will buy another one.</li>
            <li>However, it is only remotely effective compared to the OTD system.  </li>
            <li>The doc said I was on my own (meaning out of pocket) but recommended I visit a local health care store.</li>
            <li>I may have felt better if a spare set of bags came with the item so that I&#x27;m not down the road</li>
            <li>I thought I found the right one</li>
            <li>and it keeps me in the right position if I am on the computer.</li>
            <li>this may be right for others</li>
            <li>I SO wanted it to be the right fix</li>
            <li>, I took the the forums, I had to get this right.</li>
            <li>I anticipate being able to sleep on the long flight because it will prop my head up while giving light traction!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The collar is more comfortable but not a much lengthening of the neck as the water weight.</li>
            <li>I was looking for portability, minor decompression, a device to help with resistance exercises and most importantly, something that would help give my neck a much needed break.</li>
            <li>I went to the doctor and they tried to sell me this exact collar for $150.</li>
            <li>A better solution would be something similar to a backpacking backpack.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty durable.  </li>
            <li>The collar has worked out greater then going to physical therapy.</li>
            <li>enough so that I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>It was, for a brief moment, like a mountain had been lifted from the top of my head.</li>
            <li>SIMPLY CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS MORE if you suffer from any cervical spinal pain, be it from disc degeneration disease, arthritis, trauma from herniation or ruptures.</li>
            <li>I pumped it up gingerly after I got the fit I wanted, and then got just a little more aggressive, stretching it to the limit.</li>
            <li>for me laying down on my back, instead of sitting up in a chair, allowed for more effective upward movement.</li>
            <li>It provides a kind of \\&quot;light traction\\&quot; at least in how I experience it.  </li>
            <li>The pain was pretty much unbearable.</li>
            <li>easy to put on, 2 closures on the back.</li>
            <li>/&gt;A couple of cons, this unit does not provide strong decompression and in no way duplicated the hydrauic therapy tables, it&#x27;d s a different animal all together as noted in the video.</li>
            <li>is press a large tab on the bottom of each clasp and they spring apart.</li>
            <li>I even took the collar to the chiropractor who recommended the device and she agreed the collar was too large for me.</li>
            <li>I had to use the smaller size to fit correctly around my neck</li>
            <li>However,the retailer was very prompt and</li>
            <li>The vendor is very accommodating.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s been a real pain and stress reliever for me.</li>
            <li>I have severe arthritis in my neck, which gives me much pain</li>
            <li>So I bought this for my mom, shipping was darned fast.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be tempted to use TOO much air pressure.  </li>
            <li>I wear this at my desk and it really helps take the weight off my neck.  </li>
            <li>It keeps me from jerking my head around and reminds me to move my whole body.  </li>
            <li>The suggested max pressure does not offer much stretch on the neck.  </li>
            <li>But as a traction device...not so much.</li>
            <li>Purchased this for my husband who has a dissentigrating disc in his shoulder, this really gives him relief and comfort.</li>
            <li>This traction collar really relieves the pain</li>
            <li>I learned so much about it every day.</li>
            <li>1st, it arrived quickly and properly packaged.  </li>
            <li>It is a clever idea and it works.</li>
            <li>If too high, you will be sore after use.  </li>
            <li>As one might expect, it does not have the force of expertly done manual traction or a high quality machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It definitely provides a nice, straight traction to the cervical spine which helps to provide a slight bit of decompression and releif of pain.</li>
            <li>She has a herniated disc in her neck and it&#x27;s causing numbness in her hand as well as a strong radiating pain from her shoulder down her arm.  </li>
            <li>This tool provides important relief to my neck and shoulder due to my injury.</li>
            <li>its substancsial, really stabilizes the shoulders while giving just enough of a gentle stretch upward to the neck.</li>
            <li>I had used this at my physical therapists, and thought it worked pretty well for my neck and issues.  </li>
            <li>I gave it four stars instead of five because other devices do provide more traction, like the Saunders traction device at my physical therapist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>And going beyond the suggested pressure by even a small amount seems to cause the air baffles to swell outward more than upward.  </li>
            <li>The TracCollar appears to be well made, however I am a petite woman and the red (small/med) collar was too large.</li>
            <li>Having gone through just about every physical therapy available over the past 14 years, endured several neck injections, incalculable doctor visits, tests, alternative therapy devices such as the good old bag of water and face diaper over the door rig, I finally had to find something that would work for me.</li>
            <li>If you do use a towel make sure you have equal thickness on the sides and none in the front otherwise it puts too much pressure on your chin and makes it hard to breath.</li>
            <li>be clear, this is a traction device, not a &amp;#34;comfort&amp;#34; collar.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So much to try and cram in ten minutes</li>
            <li>It is a good home solution for traction since going to the doc is quite expensive.</li>
            <li>I can see that if someone had a short neck, it would probably be fine, requiring few pumps, but if someone had a very long neck, it might not be adequate.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t pump too high; start low.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to people who have neck pain, shoulder pain, or back pain.  </li>
            <li>True to the other reviews, in about 2 weeks the left bladder wouldn&#x27;t hold air.  </li>
            <li>There is no other way to contact their Customer Service as no telephone number is given on the website.  </li>
            <li>Bad design of buckles and good design having left &amp; right sides independently adjustable.</li>
            <li>It might be useful for some one without a small neck, I would relable the s/m size as just medium.</li>

            <li> It was, for a brief moment, like a mountain had been lifted from the top of my head.</li>
            <li> SIMPLY CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS MORE if you suffer from any cervical spinal pain, be it from disc degeneration disease, arthritis, trauma from herniation or ruptures.</li>
            <li> I pumped it up gingerly after I got the fit I wanted, and then got just a little more aggressive, stretching it to the limit.</li>
            <li> for me laying down on my back, instead of sitting up in a chair, allowed for more effective upward movement.</li>
            <li> It provides a kind of \\&quot;light traction\\&quot; at least in how I experience it.  </li>
            <li> The pain was pretty much unbearable.</li>
            <li> easy to put on, 2 closures on the back.</li>
            <li> /&gt;A couple of cons, this unit does not provide strong decompression and in no way duplicated the hydrauic therapy tables, it&#x27;d s a different animal all together as noted in the video.</li>
            <li> is press a large tab on the bottom of each clasp and they spring apart.</li>
            <li> I even took the collar to the chiropractor who recommended the device and she agreed the collar was too large for me.</li>
            <li> I had to use the smaller size to fit correctly around my neck</li>
            <li> However,the retailer was very prompt and</li>
            <li> The vendor is very accommodating.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s been a real pain and stress reliever for me.</li>
            <li> I have severe arthritis in my neck, which gives me much pain</li>
            <li> So I bought this for my mom, shipping was darned fast.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be tempted to use TOO much air pressure.  </li>
            <li> I wear this at my desk and it really helps take the weight off my neck.  </li>
            <li> It keeps me from jerking my head around and reminds me to move my whole body.  </li>
            <li> The suggested max pressure does not offer much stretch on the neck.  </li>
            <li> But as a traction device...not so much.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my husband who has a dissentigrating disc in his shoulder, this really gives him relief and comfort.</li>
            <li> This traction collar really relieves the pain</li>
            <li> I learned so much about it every day.</li>
            <li> 1st, it arrived quickly and properly packaged.  </li>
            <li> It is a clever idea and it works.</li>
            <li> If too high, you will be sore after use.  </li>
            <li> As one might expect, it does not have the force of expertly done manual traction or a high quality machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It definitely provides a nice, straight traction to the cervical spine which helps to provide a slight bit of decompression and releif of pain.</li>
            <li> She has a herniated disc in her neck and it&#x27;s causing numbness in her hand as well as a strong radiating pain from her shoulder down her arm.  </li>
            <li> This tool provides important relief to my neck and shoulder due to my injury.</li>
            <li> its substancsial, really stabilizes the shoulders while giving just enough of a gentle stretch upward to the neck.</li>
            <li> I had used this at my physical therapists, and thought it worked pretty well for my neck and issues.  </li>
            <li> I gave it four stars instead of five because other devices do provide more traction, like the Saunders traction device at my physical therapist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> And going beyond the suggested pressure by even a small amount seems to cause the air baffles to swell outward more than upward.  </li>
            <li> The TracCollar appears to be well made, however I am a petite woman and the red (small/med) collar was too large.</li>
            <li> Having gone through just about every physical therapy available over the past 14 years, endured several neck injections, incalculable doctor visits, tests, alternative therapy devices such as the good old bag of water and face diaper over the door rig, I finally had to find something that would work for me.</li>
            <li> If you do use a towel make sure you have equal thickness on the sides and none in the front otherwise it puts too much pressure on your chin and makes it hard to breath.</li>
            <li> be clear, this is a traction device, not a &amp;#34;comfort&amp;#34; collar.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So much to try and cram in ten minutes</li>
            <li> It is a good home solution for traction since going to the doc is quite expensive.</li>
            <li> I can see that if someone had a short neck, it would probably be fine, requiring few pumps, but if someone had a very long neck, it might not be adequate.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t pump too high; start low.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to people who have neck pain, shoulder pain, or back pain.  </li>
            <li> True to the other reviews, in about 2 weeks the left bladder wouldn&#x27;t hold air.  </li>
            <li> There is no other way to contact their Customer Service as no telephone number is given on the website.  </li>
            <li> Bad design of buckles and good design having left &amp; right sides independently adjustable.</li>
            <li> It might be useful for some one without a small neck, I would relable the s/m size as just medium.</li>
            <li> After trying tape and a few other things, it wasn&#x27;t worth fighting with</li>
            <li> The only problem I have with the product is I must have a long, skinny neck or the collar is just too short for me</li>
            <li> For long lasting results it probably needs to be worn twice daily</li>
            <li> The second con would be that I am uncertain how long the compression bags inside would last.</li>
            <li> I purchased a small medium and still find it to be a bit large.</li>
            <li> Before her steroid shot, she couldn&#x27;t go 30 minutes without having to lay back down, driving 5 miles to work was about as far as she could go.  </li>
            <li> A couple of months ago, I started to feel dizzy every time I worked on my laptop for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Definitely not as good as the full lying down traction, but for the price and space and size compromise, I decided to go ahead and get it.  </li>
            <li> She also has other severe spine issues and is starting to experience severe nerve pain.</li>
            <li> Read reviews of other similar devices and understand why this is preferred.</li>
            <li> It goes without saying that I am on a very tight fixed budged, so I was assuming quite a bit of risk with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I said no thanks and</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, in the interim between the present and the surgery scheduled a few months from now, this traction collar in conjunction with an inversion/incline bench has helped her regain some of her day to day lifestyle.</li>
            <li> but I am rough on it.  </li>
            <li> I have had it for a few years and used only on an as needed basis, which was only a few times.  </li>
            <li> mo1DVD8SB9GGRLA]]I am 100% Disabled Veteran.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does push upwards up the base of my skull when it inflates, which gives the nice pull.</li>
            <li> I wear a size 7/8 with a slightly longer than average neck so that when inflated to the maximum  stretch, it just slid up the back of my head rather than truly provide vertical traction.</li>
            <li> I utilize the collar by laying down, as I find that takes less tension off of my entire spinal column.</li>
            <li> While this product appears well made the small is still too big for my neck (12 1/2\\&quot;).  </li>
            <li> I was unaware of this until I was using the product and started having a reaction to it, which is pretty bad for a product you put around your neck.</li>
            <li> I could lie down with it, ride in a car with it, socialize with it without feeling embarrassed.</li>
            <li> Have a problem with a few vertebrae in my neck...</li>
            <li> Without this unit I would have trouble getting through the day.  </li>
            <li> On days when I have a stiff neck and or headaches I will use the TracCollar for approximately 20-30 minutes while I am doing my devotions or just reading and will actually see immediate results the headache and stiffness will usually go away.    </li>
            <li> But when I am at work laying on the floor for 15 minutes a couple times a day is not easy to do.  </li>
            <li> When I received it, I was in some pretty bad shape</li>
            <li> Tears flowed down my face - seriously.</li>
            <li> I am NOT a satisfied customer.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use it every night, but at least 3-4 times a week.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This really sucks.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a negative effect by trying to prop up a person&#x27;s head using their shoulders.  </li>
            <li> Now I never feel that dizziness when I use my laptop, even after hours of surfing (I know this is not a good habit though).</li>
            <li> Too much weight on the shoulders can cause other issues and a really annoying gnawing pain at the base of your neck.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it for my wife (age 65), who had her broken neck fused 12 years ago.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel so exhausted.</li>
            <li> I was quite torn between the two and made the wrong decision, now I cant return it....</li>
            <li> I received a TracCollar with defective pumps that don&#x27;t maintain the inflation of the device so this product is absolutely USELESS.  </li>
            <li> Sorry, I cannot recommend it.</li>
            <li> It is a bit difficult to buckle, hence the 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li> It would get 4 or 5 stars if it didn&#x27;t fail</li>
            <li> Desperately looking for a PORTABLE neck traction device.</li>
            <li> This product turned out to be a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> It is very uncomfortable and provided almost no traction.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have two herniated discs. The pain was pretty much unbearable. I went to the doctor and they tried to sell me this exact collar for $150. I said no thanks and when I got home I bought this immediately. The relief is immediate and it&#x27;s very comfortable. The only downside is when I sneeze while wearing it my pain comes back for about a minute then fades away. I&#x27;m really happy I can watch TV and play games on my computer again though. Definitely a great purchase.</li>
            <li> collar works as described and provided great temporary relief from neck starin at the computer.</li>
            <li> This is a great cervical collar.  It works so great that my chiropractor has decided to carry the line in his inventory for his other patients!</li>
            <li> This product actually works when you have time to use it. I have disk narrowing in my neck from a bicycle accident when I was younger, gravity and age finally caught up to me. On days when I have a stiff neck and or headaches I will use the TracCollar for approximately 20-30 minutes while I am doing my devotions or just reading and will actually see immediate results the headache and stiffness will usually go away.    The only problem I have with the product is I must have a long, skinny neck or the collar is just too short for me I had to use the smaller size to fit correctly around my neck but when inflated it doesn&#x27;t even touch the back of my head, so I have to use a folded bath towel under it before inflating to make contact with my head. If you do use a towel make sure you have equal thickness on the sides and none in the front otherwise it puts too much pressure on your chin and makes it hard to breath. For an inexpensive quick fix it is a great product especially for the price!    For long lasting results it probably needs to be worn twice daily but it also works as a quick fix.</li>
            <li> A couple of months ago, I started to feel dizzy every time I worked on my laptop for a long time.  And after using this neck support, that dizziness is gone, awesome! Now I never feel that dizziness when I use my laptop, even after hours of surfing (I know this is not a good habit though).</li>
            <li> This product just ended up being a glorified cervical collar for me. I wear a size 7/8 with a slightly longer than average neck so that when inflated to the maximum  stretch, it just slid up the back of my head rather than truly provide vertical traction. It might be useful for some one without a small neck, I would relable the s/m size as just medium. It could also help stabilize the c-spine with a more \\&quot;customized\\&quot; fit than a regular foam c-collar.  However,the retailer was very prompt and the lowest price since there was free shipping.</li>
            <li> the neck traction device is easy to use if you can reach around your neck to put in on...which I have difficulty with...I have used it once and noticed a small defect in the material on the inside of the collar after the first use. I will say the product arrived within three days of order.</li>
            <li> Arrived next day. Have a problem with a few vertebrae in my neck...this helps a great deal and no surgery!!!</li>
            <li> The collar itself is very good, the problem is the pump. It looses air and I had to change the pumps three times. The vendor is very accommodating.</li>
            <li> It works, it&#x27;s a great product, I got instant relief after I took it off. I am happy I bought it.</li>
            <li> Desperately looking for a PORTABLE neck traction device. I thought this was the answer after trying several others. Bad design of buckles and good design having left &amp; right sides independently adjustable. BUT cant work or adjust buckles easily, actually impossible for me. AND it CHOKES off my neck!!! Too bad ! I thought I found the right one</li>
            <li> This tool provides important relief to my neck and shoulder due to my injury.</li>
            <li> ordered the red, my neck is slim. if doubled-chinned go for the larger. it&#x27;s been a real pain and stress reliever for me. no need to go over the 15 pump-ups on either side. its substancsial, really stabilizes the shoulders while giving just enough of a gentle stretch upward to the neck. doesn&#x27;t cut of blood or air supply. easy to put on, 2 closures on the back. they slip into the slots easily and to unclasp all you do is press a large tab on the bottom of each clasp and they spring apart. for me laying down on my back, instead of sitting up in a chair, allowed for more effective upward movement. then i relax for a couple of minutes. then easily release the air. relax. then pump it up again. i do this 3 times. this is a really useful product. i read all the reviews on the others and my intuition pointed to this one. good choice. the reviews said they stand by the product in case of loss of air pressure.</li>
            <li> This inflates and squeezes your neck it; isn&#x27;t tall enough to actually LIFT and elongate to stretch like you want it to. There is another brand and style I wish I would have tried. I was quite torn between the two and made the wrong decision, now I cant return it....</li>
            <li> While this product appears well made the small is still too big for my neck (12 1/2\\&quot;).  It has not helped with chronic issues I suffer following a whiplash injury three years ago. Delivery etc was fine.</li>
            <li> My chiropractor recomended I get one because I have problems with the left side of my neck. I find it helps with the pain and it keeps me in the right position if I am on the computer. It is a good home solution for traction since going to the doc is quite expensive.</li>
            <li> I received a TracCollar with defective pumps that don&#x27;t maintain the inflation of the device so this product is absolutely USELESS.  I sent an email through their website on Jan 4, 2010 and it is now four days later and I have not as yet received a response.  There is no other way to contact their Customer Service as no telephone number is given on the website.  I am NOT a satisfied customer.  The TracCollar should be tested for quality before it is shipped to customers.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product!!!</li>
            <li> I have severe arthritis in my neck, which gives me much pain sleeping.&lt;br /&gt;A friend showed me her TracCollar and I tried it out. Felt so good. Slept great that night.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use it every night, but at least 3-4 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;It has relieved my pain and is comfortable to wear while reading or watching television.</li>
            <li> Excellent device.  My neck feels much better now.</li>
            <li> I had used this at my physical therapists, and thought it worked pretty well for my neck and issues.  Definitely not as good as the full lying down traction, but for the price and space and size compromise, I decided to go ahead and get it.  True to the other reviews, in about 2 weeks the left bladder wouldn&#x27;t hold air.  After trying tape and a few other things, it wasn&#x27;t worth fighting with so back it went. My neck is pretty standard for a woman and the S/M didn&#x27;t leave me feeling choked - the pressure felt good.  Off to buy something else.</li>
            <li> 1st, it arrived quickly and properly packaged.  Sizing information provided was perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Just be clear, this is a traction device, not a &amp;#34;comfort&amp;#34; collar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it for my wife (age 65), who had her broken neck fused 12 years ago. She also has other severe spine issues and is starting to experience severe nerve pain. She will likely end up having additional surgery. Her surgeon suggested that this type of collar might help to provide some pain relief. She uses this collar as part of an ongoing physical therapy, stretching, &amp; workout regimen. It definitely provides a nice, straight traction to the cervical spine which helps to provide a slight bit of decompression and releif of pain.</li>
            <li> Collar works well for light traction. It was recommended by my Feldenkrais worker, and I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> So I bought this for my mom, shipping was darned fast.  She has a herniated disc in her neck and it&#x27;s causing numbness in her hand as well as a strong radiating pain from her shoulder down her arm.  This really sucks.  Before her steroid shot, she couldn&#x27;t go 30 minutes without having to lay back down, driving 5 miles to work was about as far as she could go.  Wearing this a bit she could extend her time about maybe another 30-45 minutes.  After the steroid shot she&#x27;s been able to stay on her feet for a couple of hours, and the TracCollar has been helping a lot to shorten the rest/recovery times she needs to spend in an incline bench or laying down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;re some notes that people should pay attention to when using.  Don&#x27;t be tempted to use TOO much air pressure.  There&#x27;s a negative effect by trying to prop up a person&#x27;s head using their shoulders.  Too much weight on the shoulders can cause other issues and a really annoying gnawing pain at the base of your neck.  The best use case is to combine rest and use of this traction collar together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the Collar works, it&#x27;s not 100% effective, so that&#x27;s the 4 stars.  A better solution would be something similar to a backpacking backpack.  Something that puts more of the load on the hips and waist instead of just your shoulder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, in the interim between the present and the surgery scheduled a few months from now, this traction collar in conjunction with an inversion/incline bench has helped her regain some of her day to day lifestyle.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable, very well made. Several &amp;#34;levels&amp;#34; to choose from.  Don&#x27;t pump too high; start low.  If too high, you will be sore after use.  My chiropractor recommended this model.  Read reviews of other similar devices and understand why this is preferred.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Helped relieve pain from arthritis. High quality construction and the carry/storage case is a great extra.</li>
            <li> My chiropractor recommended this device.  The TracCollar appears to be well made, however I am a petite woman and the red (small/med) collar was too large. I even took the collar to the chiropractor who recommended the device and she agreed the collar was too large for me.</li>
            <li> I tried the TracCollar at my physical therapist&#x27;s office, and it worked so I bought one for my home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the price, the fact that one person can use it by themselves, and that it does provide enough traction to give your neck some relief when needed.  I gave it four stars instead of five because other devices do provide more traction, like the Saunders traction device at my physical therapist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> I have a neck traction from my physical therapist.  You lay on the floor and it stretches your neck.  it is great.  But when I am at work laying on the floor for 15 minutes a couple times a day is not easy to do.  I wear this at my desk and it really helps take the weight off my neck.  The unit does inflate and provide some traction.  I highly recommend this to people who have neck pain, shoulder pain, or back pain.  Without this unit I would have trouble getting through the day.  I love to wear it when I&amp;#34;m driving.  It keeps me from jerking my head around and reminds me to move my whole body.  It is pretty durable.  Mine last about 6-9 months but I am rough on it.  It is worth every penny I pay and when this one wears out I will buy another one.</li>
            <li> I purchased this collar looking for an alternative to the over-the-door (OTD) traction system I had been using in hopes of finding something more comfortable and convenient.  This product is both these things.  However, it is only remotely effective compared to the OTD system.  The suggested max pressure does not offer much stretch on the neck.  And going beyond the suggested pressure by even a small amount seems to cause the air baffles to swell outward more than upward.  It would probably work well as a cervical collar for stabilization.  But as a traction device...not so much.</li>
            <li> This traction device sounded like a good idea but didn&#x27;t help. It is very uncomfortable and provided almost no traction.</li>
            <li> This product turned out to be a disappointment.  It was great while it worked.  I have had it for a few years and used only on an as needed basis, which was only a few times.  So it was not overused by any means.  Now the left side is leaking air and I have to keep inflating it. This product is going to go into garbage.  Sorry, I cannot recommend it.</li>
            <li> The collar has worked out greater then going to physical therapy.</li>
            <li> WARNING: This product contains latex. I was unaware of this until I was using the product and started having a reaction to it, which is pretty bad for a product you put around your neck. If you&#x27;re not latex allergic, it would be fine, its a great concept, but if your latex sensitive/allergic, DO NOT use this product!</li>
            <li> help relieve neck pain</li>
            <li> I have a herniated disc in my C-spine, which hurts most when I am seated. I bought this unit because of pain at my desk at work as well as dread of an upcoming transatlantic flight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far have been using it for a week, and I think it is proving to be moderately effective, enough so that I&#x27;m glad I bought it. It provides a kind of \\&quot;light traction\\&quot; at least in how I experience it.  As one might expect, it does not have the force of expertly done manual traction or a high quality machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then again, you can take it with you easily, and it provides a measure of relief. I anticipate being able to sleep on the long flight because it will prop my head up while giving light traction!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does push upwards up the base of my skull when it inflates, which gives the nice pull. I can see that if someone had a short neck, it would probably be fine, requiring few pumps, but if someone had a very long neck, it might not be adequate.</li>
            <li> I use the water weight traction and the collar. (NOT at the same time!) The collar is more comfortable but not a much lengthening of the neck as the water weight. It is a bit difficult to buckle, hence the 4 stars instead of 5. It is a clever idea and it works.Pain not gone, but improved.</li>
            <li> Best neck traction you can by for home use that is a pump up.</li>
            <li> I purchased a small medium and still find it to be a bit large. However I am able to overlap the rear ends for a better fit. It works well.</li>
            <li> the machine did the trick but it broke after several months. One of the inflatable bladders would not hold air so it became worthless. I even tried to patch it but could not find the leak. It did help with my back. It would get 4 or 5 stars if it didn&#x27;t fail</li>
            <li> this may be right for others but it didn&#x27;t do what I needed. It actually made my numbness in my  hand increase when I removed it. I SO wanted it to be the right fix but it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my husband who has a dissentigrating disc in his shoulder, this really gives him relief and comfort.</li>
            <li> I have cervical spondylosis. This traction collar really relieves the pain&lt;br /&gt;and discomfort. At the end of the day I just put it on for about 1/2 hour&lt;br /&gt;while watching tv. Then when I go to bed I&#x27;m able to sleep so much better.</li>
            <li> My order arrived promptly this week. It operates efficiently and effectively as described. I utilize the collar by laying down, as I find that takes less tension off of my entire spinal column. I love this product and it&#x27;s working well for me. 20 minutes on 20 minutes off when you need it does the trick</li>
            <li> Just as pictured and described seems to do very nice job</li>
            <li> This works great, I like to use it while walking on the treadmill. You might need to add a towel though to get enough stretch.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1DVD8SB9GGRLA]]I am 100% Disabled Veteran. Without going into too many details, I suffer from a myriad of chronic ailments and have an inoperable condition. One of the worst ailments is severe degeneration of my cervical spine. Having gone through just about every physical therapy available over the past 14 years, endured several neck injections, incalculable doctor visits, tests, alternative therapy devices such as the good old bag of water and face diaper over the door rig, I finally had to find something that would work for me. During one of my recent visits to my neurologist, I asked for a cervical immobilizer. The doc said I was on my own (meaning out of pocket) but recommended I visit a local health care store. I wasn&#x27;t feeling up to the visit after the appointment, so after getting motivated once I returned home I began browsing the internet to look for something to fit my needs. I was looking for portability, minor decompression, a device to help with resistance exercises and most importantly, something that would help give my neck a much needed break. I came across the TracCollar by BodySport and became enthralled. I searched for every video I could find, I read every review like they were written by Hemingway himself, I took the the forums, I had to get this right. Everything pointed to the TracCollar so I took the plunge and bought it off my favorite sight - that&#x27;s right - AMAZON! It goes without saying that I am on a very tight fixed budged, so I was assuming quite a bit of risk with this purchase. Immobilizers were cheap, foam collars were cheap, but this kept calling to me. When I received it, I was in some pretty bad shape so the wife unboxed it for me and hooked me up. I pumped it up gingerly after I got the fit I wanted, and then got just a little more aggressive, stretching it to the limit. That&#x27;s when it happened. The relief, there are no words to describe it. Tears flowed down my face - seriously. It was, for a brief moment, like a mountain had been lifted from the top of my head. I was motivated to explore it more and soon it became my traveling partner. I learned so much about it every day. Trips to the doctor in the car were no longer a dreaded experience, fearing the elusive and bone jarring pot hole that would soon bring on the migraine. I could sit for longer periods upright, but still adjust as needed to care for my lumbar issues. I could move the short distances I could with my canes. I rode my mobility scooter without care or concern over it jerking to a sudden stop when a child ran put in front of it at a brick and motor store. I didn&#x27;t feel so exhausted. My vertigo was manageable. So much more. I could lie down with it, ride in a car with it, socialize with it without feeling embarrassed. With the dual air bag system I could adjust as my needed warranted. I was and am, in love. Mu quality of life has improved a thousand times. I hope you enjoy my video. So much to try and cram in ten minutes I may create a series to help folks take advantage of it to it&#x27;s fullest capabilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I SIMPLY CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS MORE if you suffer from any cervical spinal pain, be it from disc degeneration disease, arthritis, trauma from herniation or ruptures. Syringomyelia (which I have) and anything causing you chronic distress with your neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please consult your doctor before using any type of cervical collar or spinal immobilizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just want to take a moment to thank the manufacturers OMPU from Stockholm Sweden and Body Sport for creating, designing, developing, manufacturing and making this available to folks like us. My gratitude is beyond words. I wish I could have 1 for each room, multiple ones for travel to keep in each car and one to permanently attach to my mobility scooter. I know I&#x27;m rambling, but they hit the nail out of the park with this and it has become a part of my life not unlike my wallet. I never leave home without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of cons, this unit does not provide strong decompression and in no way duplicated the hydrauic therapy tables, it&#x27;d s a different animal all together as noted in the video. It more than made up for it by providing me much needed relief when I needed it as well as a means to feel confidant I can ride along in a vehicle without being up all not in excruciating pain. The second con would be that I am uncertain how long the compression bags inside would last. I may have felt better if a spare set of bags came with the item so that I&#x27;m not down the road and it gives out on me and bursts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enough rambling for now, please watch the video for a hands on approach to it. I may create a series because of it&#x27;s many uses. Again, I just cannot say enough good things about this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;God bless your company guys - you have made my quality of life thousands of times better! Thank-you so very much! WINNER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer:  Was NOT provided a unit for review. I purchased it on my own right here from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to hit me up with questions if you need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchased Red &#x3D; (S/M Great fit!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, thank-you</li>
