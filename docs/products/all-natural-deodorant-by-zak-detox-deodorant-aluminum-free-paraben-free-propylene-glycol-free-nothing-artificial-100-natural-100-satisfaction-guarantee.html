            <li>This is the best aluminum-free deodorant I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>From someone that went from Degree motion sense to this product, I can say I am very impressed.</li>
            <li>I so needed to find this wonderful product.  </li>
            <li>Works great!</li>

            <li>&#x3D;D</li>
            <li>I was so happy I could end my search!</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>Very effective!</li>
            <li>But for now - I&#x27;m a happy, happy customer!</li>
            <li>and it works great.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>This deodorant works great.</li>
            <li>Best of all ODOR FREE.  </li>
            <li>I am very glad to know that there are no harmful chemicals that are being exposed to my body.</li>
            <li>Love it, smells great and goes on nice.</li>
            <li>If you warm on your skin for a moment, this helps application.</li>
            <li>now I can honestly say that this is my favorite deodorant that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Zak Detox Deodorant is the best 100% natural deodorant I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Zak Detox Deodorant is superior because it goes on easy, has a lovely scent, it&#x27;s free of chemicals, aluminum and parabens.</li>
            <li>stuff really is magical.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ll try unscented, and if it doesn&#x27;t work as well as Elevate, I&#x27;ll gladly stick with that.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s vegan and cruelty free!  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>This definitely works, i have put it under the best test, walking around Athens in 90 degree weather</li>
            <li>Most deodorants cause me to have an allergic reaction and I do not like putting aluminum in my body</li>
            <li>I love the smell</li>
            <li>It is just ok.  </li>
            <li>Great fragrance and it really works.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found it works best immediately following a shower</li>
            <li>Safe, clean, natural and great protection!</li>
            <li>Crystal, Tom&#x27;s, Naturally Fresh and even made my own.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in the protection I get with it from my old aluminum deodorant, very glad to make a change to something I can feel more safe using and that works well.</li>
            <li>This one is still going strong.</li>
            <li>NO natural deodorant will have a perfect glide on feel like the ones full of chemicals.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with it at first with the scent, but it my boyfriend didn&#x27;t even notice the change, and I now quite like the smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had people ask me what kind of scent I&#x27;m wearing because they really like it!</li>
            <li>First of all this scent is one of the best I have ever smelled, especially for deodorant.</li>
            <li>It goes on a little easier with dampness, so just out of the shower is a perfect time.</li>
            <li>Also- you need to scrub your armpits with a scrubbie and a little soap in between applications for the best coverage.</li>
            <li>The Elevate smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>It really works!!!</li>
            <li>It works all day, I don&#x27;t sweat and it keeps my underarms fresh!</li>
            <li>I love the fresh scent so much that I find myself using Zak as a perfume stick!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had some success with magnesium deodorants, but I was never 100% confident using them on, say, a hot day, or on a day I was hitting the gym.</li>
            <li>I love that it is aluminum free and has all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>But if you put it on right after the shower, you will be golden for 24 hrs!</li>
            <li>Hands down best ALL natural deodorant that we&#x27;ve ever tried!</li>
            <li>This is the first one I&#x27;ve found that works all day!</li>
            <li>I have tried many natural deodorants...</li>
            <li>For just a deodorant, Zak keeps me much drier than I expected and the elevate is a great fragrance (I&#x27;m a girl).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through many all natural deodorants</li>
            <li>This is the first review I have ever left on Amazon after ordering hundreds of things from here because this product is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>I feel better having an all natural good for you product that goes on my body everyday!</li>
            <li>If you apply it directly after a hot shower it goes on relatively easily.</li>
            <li>Zak deodorant goes on smoothly with no white residue, has a clean scent that isn&#x27;t overly herbal smelling</li>
            <li>I want to sincerely thank the creators of this product for introducing Zak to the public.  </li>
            <li>Your formula is so gentle!</li>
            <li>I feel (and smell) good putting this on my body everyday.</li>
            <li>product seems promising, I&#x27;ll be sure to update this review in the future to let yall know how it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li>So I have no idea if Zak will work for you, but I can say, as a person who&#x27;s tried dozens and dozens of natural deodorants over the years, Zak is the real deal - for me - and it&#x27;s worth a shot for you!</li>
            <li>With the magnesium deodorants I&#x27;ve used, they sometimes work up until the point where I get really sweaty, but then they are overpowered.</li>
            <li>I also really like the scent Of Elevate</li>
            <li>Zak&#x27;s deodorant is the only deodorant product I will ever use and they smell fantastic.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t possibly tell you how many natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried over the years.</li>
            <li>I will take my chances and go back to using the good old aluminum anti-persperant/deodorant which actually works and doesn&#x27;t hurt or give you a rash.  </li>
            <li>I love that I do not have to feel guilty putting this deodorant on because I know that it is only doing good things for my body.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>feel like natural deodorants work well with certain body chemistries, which is why some deodorants work for some people and not others.</li>
            <li>Finally, just a quick tip, it can sometimes be a bit hard to spread evenly without clumping, so make sure you warm it on your skin for a few seconds before spreading it around.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, so many of the other natural deodorants I can&#x27;t use because the baking soda kills my skin.</li>
            <li>I reccommend Zak Detox Deodorant to anyone who wants to use an all natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>I think I have tried every all natural deodorant that has been made, and when I tried this one and it really worked</li>
            <li>This product is worth spending the few extra dollars for the better results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The other day it was nice out and I took a long walk.</li>
            <li>I live in So FL</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve become allergic to nearly all deodorants as I&#x27;ve gotten older.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with the aroma and all day protection!</li>
            <li>It can leave a little oil mark but this easily washes out without pretreating.</li>
            <li>for sensitive skin: 5/5&lt;br /&gt;No stains?</li>
            <li>but it really does last for 24 hours with one application.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any skin issues with this deodorant thus far.</li>
            <li>The only thing that I&#x27;ve found this deodorant can&#x27;t do that the mainstream ones can&#x27;t do very well is cover pre existing BO smell.</li>
            <li>and it actually works very well at inhibiting both sweat and body odor.</li>
            <li>Anyhow, it not 100% proved that aluminum is directly the cause of breast cancer.</li>
            <li>I stopped using &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; deodorant/antiperspirants years ago because I didn&#x27;t want to put harmful chemicals into my body, so I tried all natural products, but these actually made me sweat and caused an odor.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it does not go on smoothly.</li>
            <li>I have never used an all natural deodorant, so I was excited to try this product, however I didn&#x27;t have anything to compare it to, since I had only used deodorants from the store (Dove, Secret, etc.).</li>

            <li> Applying it tends to be a little more difficult than a regular toxic deodorant</li>
            <li> The solid is very rough when applying</li>
            <li> But it does keep the armpits dry</li>
            <li> Plus it does not keep you dry</li>
            <li> When I first heard about all natural deodorant I was a little skeptical about the duration.</li>
            <li> Been wearing it for 2 weeks now after multiple other aluminum free deodorants had begun to fail after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it was the sage in the product or just one of the other natural ingredients, but I could not tolerate the scent.</li>
            <li> No funny stuff here, no potentially cancer causing agents, or ingredients that might mess up your endocrinological system.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple other natural deodorants, one of which worked for a couple months then just made my BO worse, the other worked well, but was the same price as ZAK for half the product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The smell is like cloves and sandalwood, and some other things that I can&#x27;t quite</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that traditional anti-perspirants (which are horrible for you anyways) only make me sweat more.</li>
            <li> I have never used an all-natural deodorant before now, so I was a little skeptical about using Zak because I didn&#x27;t think it would keep me smelling and feeling fresh all day.  </li>
            <li> (And sorry if this is too much information.)</li>
            <li> Did not list scent or ingredients, not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never experienced that with a natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it can be hard to apply.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m experiencing the company&#x27;s claim of over a period of a few weeks</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to apply.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I dreaded having to apply retail deodorant,  you can hardly be inconspicuous when your underarms itch</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually really disappointed with the all-natural deodorants since they only work for what seems like an hour.</li>
            <li> Shaving isn&#x27;t as irritating as it was</li>
            <li> ; deodorants make me smell worse.</li>
            <li> None of those are bad, but it&#x27;s not exactly my favorite smell either.</li>
            <li> is what I am discovering with these without aluminum unfortunately.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dealt with horrible BO for the last year or so.</li>
            <li> And I sweat - and it stinks!</li>
            <li> Very unhappy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> The smell was horrible, it reminded me of weed killer or bug spray.</li>

            <li> Smell: 4/5&lt;br /&gt;Does it work: 5/5&lt;br /&gt;24 hours: 5/5&lt;br /&gt;Good for sensitive skin: 5/5&lt;br /&gt;No stains?: 4/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend this to everyone?: 5/5!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff really is magical. Been wearing it for 2 weeks now after multiple other aluminum free deodorants had begun to fail after a few uses. This one is still going strong. Not only that, but it really does last for 24 hours with one application. It doesn&#x27;t leave horrendous stains on my shirts! It can leave a little oil mark but this easily washes out without pretreating. The smell is like cloves and sandalwood, and some other things that I can&#x27;t quite but my finger on. I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with it at first with the scent, but it my boyfriend didn&#x27;t even notice the change, and I now quite like the smell. Also! I have very sensitive skin, so many of the other natural deodorants I can&#x27;t use because the baking soda kills my skin. I haven&#x27;t had any skin issues with this deodorant thus far. Finally, just a quick tip, it can sometimes be a bit hard to spread evenly without clumping, so make sure you warm it on your skin for a few seconds before spreading it around. The only thing that I&#x27;ve found this deodorant can&#x27;t do that the mainstream ones can&#x27;t do very well is cover pre existing BO smell. But if you put it on right after the shower, you will be golden for 24 hrs!</li>
            <li> I have never used an all-natural deodorant before now, so I was a little skeptical about using Zak because I didn&#x27;t think it would keep me smelling and feeling fresh all day.  Well, I&#x27;m hooked!  It definitely works all day and night.  I love the fresh scent so much that I find myself using Zak as a perfume stick!  I&#x27;ve had people ask me what kind of scent I&#x27;m wearing because they really like it!</li>
            <li> Welp, ladies and gentlemen, I&#x27;ve hit the jackpot! Finally! I couldn&#x27;t possibly tell you how many natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried over the years. I&#x27;ve had some success with magnesium deodorants, but I was never 100% confident using them on, say, a hot day, or on a day I was hitting the gym. I can&#x27;t believe it - but I no longer have to stress about sweating! And I sweat - and it stinks! But not with Zak! I still sweat, but now with no smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other day it was nice out and I took a long walk. (And sorry if this is too much information.) By the time I got back home my pits were totally soaked and the armpits of my shirt were damp.  But did I smell? Nope, nope, nope! Total miracle! I&#x27;ve never experienced that with a natural deodorant. With the magnesium deodorants I&#x27;ve used, they sometimes work up until the point where I get really sweaty, but then they are overpowered. Not Zak! Zak is totally up to the challenge! I&#x27;ll be buying the unscented stick next. I feel like the Elevate scent, while it is their feminine scent, smells a bit woodsy or pine-y. And sometimes after awhile it seems to smell a bit grapefruit-y. None of those are bad, but it&#x27;s not exactly my favorite smell either. So I&#x27;ll try unscented, and if it doesn&#x27;t work as well as Elevate, I&#x27;ll gladly stick with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like natural deodorants work well with certain body chemistries, which is why some deodorants work for some people and not others. So I have no idea if Zak will work for you, but I can say, as a person who&#x27;s tried dozens and dozens of natural deodorants over the years, Zak is the real deal - for me - and it&#x27;s worth a shot for you!</li>
            <li> Love it, smells great and goes on nice.</li>
            <li> No funny stuff here, no potentially cancer causing agents, or ingredients that might mess up your endocrinological system. This does not suppress sweat (something you don&#x27;t want to do anyway because suppressing sweat inhibits the body&#x27;s ability to release toxins), but it absorbs it, and masks odor. This is the best aluminum-free deodorant I&#x27;ve tried. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have tried many natural deodorants... Crystal, Tom&#x27;s, Naturally Fresh and even made my own. None works as well as Zak. I have worked out using this product and it has held up to sweat. If you warm on your skin for a moment, this helps application. It is a thicker product, but you get used to it and it works great. NO natural deodorant will have a perfect glide on feel like the ones full of chemicals. The Elevate smells fantastic. I am going to order this again.</li>
            <li> I have never used an all natural deodorant, so I was excited to try this product, however I didn&#x27;t have anything to compare it to, since I had only used deodorants from the store (Dove, Secret, etc.). I can say that this deodorant did work well, but I was not a fan of the scent. I am not sure if it was the sage in the product or just one of the other natural ingredients, but I could not tolerate the scent. My husband said that it smelled like paint. If you are not picky on scent, or if you like the sage scent, then this product is for you.</li>
            <li> When I first heard about all natural deodorant I was a little skeptical about the duration. However, after using this product for over a week now I can honestly say that this is my favorite deodorant that I have ever used. I am very glad to know that there are no harmful chemicals that are being exposed to my body. This product is worth spending the few extra dollars for the better results. I would personally recommend the Energize scent.</li>
            <li> Did not list scent or ingredients, not worth the money. I did not like the scent at all.</li>
            <li> Zak Detox Deodorant is the best 100% natural deodorant I have ever used. I stopped using &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; deodorant/antiperspirants years ago because I didn&#x27;t want to put harmful chemicals into my body, so I tried all natural products, but these actually made me sweat and caused an odor. Zak Detox Deodorant is superior because it goes on easy, has a lovely scent, it&#x27;s free of chemicals, aluminum and parabens. It&#x27;s vegan and cruelty free!  It works all day, I don&#x27;t sweat and it keeps my underarms fresh! I reccommend Zak Detox Deodorant to anyone who wants to use an all natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I spent a while looking for a natural deodorant because I decided I was done with the ingredients in antiperspirant/deodorants. From someone that went from Degree motion sense to this product, I can say I am very impressed. For just a deodorant, Zak keeps me much drier than I expected and the elevate is a great fragrance (I&#x27;m a girl). It goes on a little easier with dampness, so just out of the shower is a perfect time. I&#x27;d definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Smell is ehhhh for elevate.  But it does keep the armpits dry</li>
            <li> Whew!  I so needed to find this wonderful product.  I&#x27;ve become allergic to nearly all deodorants as I&#x27;ve gotten older.  I live in So FL so sweating is what happens here.  Zak deodorant goes on smoothly with no white residue, has a clean scent that isn&#x27;t overly herbal smelling so it&#x27;s not competing with your chosen fragrances.  Best of all ODOR FREE.  this isn&#x27;t an antiperspirant so yes you&#x27;ll get a bit moist but, our pores need to detox daily and I&#x27;m experiencing the company&#x27;s claim of over a period of a few weeks underarm sweat glands are indeed detox.  Seriously, I dreaded having to apply retail deodorant,  you can hardly be inconspicuous when your underarms itch ALL THE TIME especially while perspiring.  Shaving isn&#x27;t as irritating as it was and I am not breaking out using Zak!  I want to sincerely thank the creators of this product for introducing Zak to the public.  Your formula is so gentle! And once I was through the detox phase I find even here in the humid SW, I can skip a day between applications.  To the consumer, I hope my forthrightness about my experiences are of help to you as you decide whether or not this product is for you.  Yes, it&#x27;s a bit pricey...but, you do get what you pay for and the generously sized stick will last you awhile.</li>
            <li> Works great! I&#x27;ve gone through many all natural deodorants and this is the only one that&#x27;s held up well with no irritation and literally even when I work out I never smell.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t last 24 hours and it&#x27;s hard to apply. Very unhappy with this purchase. Waist of money.</li>
            <li> This definitely works, i have put it under the best test, walking around Athens in 90 degree weather and it has definitely held up. The only thing i noticed is that i have seen my skin become a bit red not alwsys but i dont feel any discomfort. I just put a bit of cortisone at night. I also really like the scent Of Elevate</li>
            <li> Hands down best ALL natural deodorant that we&#x27;ve ever tried! It really works!!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all... The smell was horrible, it reminded me of weed killer or bug spray.</li>
            <li> Zak&#x27;s deodorant is the best deodorant I have ever used. Most deodorants cause me to have an allergic reaction and I do not like putting aluminum in my body and I have noticed that &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; deodorants make me smell worse. Zak&#x27;s deodorant is the only deodorant product I will ever use and they smell fantastic. Great job Zak!</li>
            <li> This is the first review I have ever left on Amazon after ordering hundreds of things from here because this product is AMAZING. I love the smell and it actually works very well at inhibiting both sweat and body odor. Applying it tends to be a little more difficult than a regular toxic deodorant but you figure that out eventually.</li>
            <li> Product works well. My only complaint is that it can be hard to apply.</li>
            <li> Very effective! Literally no body odor for 24 hr.&lt;br /&gt; My only complaint is that it does not go on smoothly. The solid is very rough when applying</li>
            <li> It is just ok.  I like the fragrance of this, however it hurts to put on which is what I am discovering with these without aluminum unfortunately.  Plus it does not keep you dry and I noticed I have a stinky smell coming from under my pits without a workout.  I will take my chances and go back to using the good old aluminum anti-persperant/deodorant which actually works and doesn&#x27;t hurt or give you a rash.  During my last mammogram I asked the radiologist and she said she tried everything and is also taking her chances.  Anyhow, it not 100% proved that aluminum is directly the cause of breast cancer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants-- and this is one of my favorites. If you apply it directly after a hot shower it goes on relatively easily. Also- you need to scrub your armpits with a scrubbie and a little soap in between applications for the best coverage. I&#x27;ll be ordering this again and again for me and my husband. &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> This deodorant works great. I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in the protection I get with it from my old aluminum deodorant, very glad to make a change to something I can feel more safe using and that works well.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance and it really works. I feel better having an all natural good for you product that goes on my body everyday!</li>
            <li> First of all this scent is one of the best I have ever smelled, especially for deodorant. I think I have tried every all natural deodorant that has been made, and when I tried this one and it really worked I was so happy I could end my search! I am a nurse working 12 hour shifts and I put it on once in the morning and it lasts until I get in the shower that night. I love that I do not have to feel guilty putting this deodorant on because I know that it is only doing good things for my body. After using Zak Detox Deodorant I will never go back to using generic deodorants.</li>
            <li> Great product! I&#x27;m usually really disappointed with the all-natural deodorants since they only work for what seems like an hour. This is the first one I&#x27;ve found that works all day! I&#x27;ve found it works best immediately following a shower so give it a shot.</li>
            <li> Safe, clean, natural and great protection! I feel (and smell) good putting this on my body everyday.</li>
            <li> I ordered the &amp;#34;energize&amp;#34; Zak detox deoderant. I love that it is aluminum free and has all natural ingredients.  I was pleasantly surprised with the aroma and all day protection!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dealt with horrible BO for the last year or so. I&#x27;ve always been a sweater since middle school, but recently my BO has been out of hand. Like, to where people will say &amp;#34;what&#x27;s that smell?&amp;#34; out of hand...&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that traditional anti-perspirants (which are horrible for you anyways) only make me sweat more. So I&#x27;m August of 2014 I stopped using them altogether. I&#x27;ve tried a couple other natural deodorants, one of which worked for a couple months then just made my BO worse, the other worked well, but was the same price as ZAK for half the product.&lt;br /&gt;I saw ZAK on Amazon and figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used it for a day... but even after over 24 hours since I applied AND after working out, I have virtually no BO.&lt;br /&gt;This product seems promising, I&#x27;ll be sure to update this review in the future to let yall know how it&#x27;s working. But for now - I&#x27;m a happy, happy customer!</li>
