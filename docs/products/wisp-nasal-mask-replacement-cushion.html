    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Fits, works perfectly with my husband&#x27;s cpap machine.</li>
            <li>perfect size.  </li>
            <li>Very happy with this replacement cushion.  </li>
            <li>Perfect, new, fits and works perfectly.</li>
            <li>So nice to know I can purchase this wisp via amazon for a great price since our insurance was giving me a hassle.</li>
            <li>I love it works great</li>
            <li>Very comfortable.</li>
            <li>The airflow is so distracting that I have to make sure I don&#x27;t face my partner, don&#x27;t have it blow against the pillow, etch.</li>
            <li>or else it will sound like a wind tunnel and freezes out my partner!</li>
            <li>Love these however my cat loves them</li>
            <li>more so he tends to get a hold of it and uses it as a chew toy.</li>
            <li>I love the concept of the Wisp plus love the headgear, but..</li>
            <li>Was exactly what I ordered and a fair price.</li>
            <li>I have to stick with the original mask, for now, in hopes that the Wisp or something better comes along.</li>
            <li>Easily dislodged in sleep.  </li>
            <li>They are origanal replacement and work fine.</li>
            <li>This mask covers what it needs to cover and leave the rest of my face free.</li>
            <li>comfortable...</li>
            <li>This is not in original packaging, but seems fine.</li>
            <li>Looks just like the original that I got from doctor.</li>
            <li>Luckily I found these here</li>
            <li>after my new mask my machine worked so much better.  </li>
            <li>Came real fast.</li>
            <li>exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>The mask is comfortable however the extra lining obstructs the nasal cavity during the night and the air flow it more like a constant wind than a gentle leak.  </li>
            <li>I love a mask and head gear that has a minimal &amp;#34;foot print&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than even going through our insurance.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It has too much cushion material.</li>
            <li>I purchased this larger size to see if it worked better than the smaller.</li>
            <li>Compared to a sm/med cushion, it was a little large for me to use, but will work fine as a backup.</li>
            <li>I have used CPap for 10 years and hoped that this new mask could work for me.</li>
            <li>Exactly the same product as I use for my CPAP equipment.</li>
            <li>The only mask I can consistently wear and sleep well.</li>
            <li>and I can easily replace them now if our little prowler gets to it again.</li>
            <li>The only way it could be better is if it was black, so I could pretend to be Darth Vader.</li>
            <li>Only thing I regret is that I wish I would have not purchased the large.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> after my new mask my machine worked so much better.  fits as advertised and is OEM product.</li>
            <li> Just what was ordered</li>
            <li> I ordered wrong size.</li>
            <li> This is not what I needed. I need to return it and order something else.</li>
            <li> Product as advertised.</li>
            <li> The mask is comfortable however the extra lining obstructs the nasal cavity during the night and the air flow it more like a constant wind than a gentle leak.  The airflow is so distracting that I have to make sure I don&#x27;t face my partner, don&#x27;t have it blow against the pillow, etch. or else it will sound like a wind tunnel and freezes out my partner! I wake up all night with the noise!</li>
            <li> Exactly the same product as I use for my CPAP equipment.</li>
            <li> just like Respironics!  I love it works great</li>
            <li> I love a mask and head gear that has a minimal &amp;#34;foot print&amp;#34;. This mask covers what it needs to cover and leave the rest of my face free. Stays in place too.</li>
            <li> Perfect, new, fits and works perfectly. OEM. Much cheaper than even going through our insurance. Just order a bunch and use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I replace my cushions every month as it keeps things fresher. I replace headgear for Wisp once a quarter and tubing once every six months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very comfortable... The only mask I can consistently wear and sleep well.</li>
            <li> So nice to know I can purchase this wisp via amazon for a great price since our insurance was giving me a hassle. Fits, works perfectly with my husband&#x27;s cpap machine. Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Came real fast. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Looks just like the original that I got from doctor. Only thing I regret is that I wish I would have not purchased the large. It has too much cushion material. I actually ended up trimming off some material. But that was my fault not the sellers.</li>
            <li> Works as described.  The only way it could be better is if it was black, so I could pretend to be Darth Vader.</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I ordered and a fair price.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected.  This is not in original packaging, but seems fine.</li>
            <li> Everything it says it is. I know ordering medical equipment online is scary. Is it the brand it claims to be? Will it work? It does, and it is.</li>
            <li> Love these however my cat loves them more so he tends to get a hold of it and uses it as a chew toy. Luckily I found these here and I can easily replace them now if our little prowler gets to it again.</li>
            <li> Did not seal well. Easily dislodged in sleep.  Uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> exactly what I needed.  perfect size.  Wish they were a little less expensive or came in two packs.  will purchase thru this vendor again.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I got this item because I was not sure what size to use. Compared to a sm/med cushion, it was a little large for me to use, but will work fine as a backup. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Item was requested by an employee - met their needs.</li>
            <li> They are origanal replacement and work fine.</li>
            <li> I had several issues. It is advertised as a Respironics Wisp replacement. Well, not the regular Respironics package, just a little plastic bag. I do not think this is OEM. Also, I ordered 3 masks, and I was charged shipping on all 3, at a cost of &amp;#62;$15, but it came in one small envelope with a shipping cost of $1.76.</li>
            <li> I purchased this larger size to see if it worked better than the smaller. No, it still seems to close off my nose during sleep.  I have used CPap for 10 years and hoped that this new mask could work for me. I have to stick with the original mask, for now, in hopes that the Wisp or something better comes along. I love the concept of the Wisp plus love the headgear, but..</li>
            <li> Very happy with this replacement cushion.  Very comfortable.</li>
            <li> This is the inly mask that has worked long term for me</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    </ol>
