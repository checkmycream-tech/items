            <li>this incase we need to use it again, because it&#x27;s still in good shape.</li>

            <li>Everyone who saw it liked it.</li>
            <li>I think the wig is nice</li>
            <li>Especially fun when her dad put it on and sang songs from Frozen to her</li>
            <li>It was however a nice quality is the description stated.</li>
            <li>It is not braided or pieced nicely like the picture.</li>
            <li>I gave this 4 stars, because the wig itself is rather nice.</li>
            <li>The quality was excellent and with the hair cap  as an added bonus we didn&#x27;t have to worry about keeping her real hair falling out from under it.  </li>
            <li>The quality of this wig is really nice.  </li>
            <li>Not as nice as I was expecting.</li>
            <li>The color and feel of the wig is nice, for the price.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a handy hair person, try re-braiding the wig.</li>
            <li>Nice braid.</li>
            <li>Over all a nice wig.</li>
            <li>Well, it&#x27;s a nice fiber for a wig.</li>
            <li>Nice quality.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t cut nicely either so the bangs and layers flair all over the place.</li>
            <li>Nice size and well made.  </li>
            <li>The size is perfect for older girls and adults.</li>
            <li>I used my Elsa crown to help secure the wig and it looked amazing!</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this wig and it is much better than any of the dress-up ones I&#x27;ve seen for children.  </li>
            <li>in all, a great wig at a great price for the young ones.  </li>
            <li>Definitely was impressed on how good the hair was.</li>
            <li>It was such a good price, and great quality!!!!</li>
            <li>Good quality wig, and the cap that comes with is great for keeping my daughter&#x27;s real hair out of the way.</li>
            <li>and I am sure she will love it!</li>
            <li>This was perfect for my 3 year old daughter&#x27;s Halloween costume!</li>
            <li>Got here super quick with two day Prime shipping and was PERFECT.</li>
            <li>Fits my 5 yr old Queen Elsa beautifully!</li>
            <li>My 6 year old wore it for Halloween and stayed on perfectly.</li>
            <li>but I am an adult wearing this for Halloween and it fits perfectly and looks just like Elsa from Disney World.</li>
            <li>This was perfect for my 6 yr old Elsa.  </li>
            <li>It fits my almost 5 year old perfectly without having to be adjusted.</li>
            <li>Loved the wig it fit</li>
            <li>The wig was very good quality &amp; I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>very fast shipment and great product thank you.</li>
            <li>Gave 4/5 stars because like I said it was great quality and looked pretty</li>
            <li>20-Nov 3rd(which was fine because its for her birthday party..not halloween) and it came in the mail today!</li>
            <li>Gorgeous wig for the money very pleased looks real</li>
            <li>, I just thought it was ok.</li>
            <li>but i wish it would have stayed in place better than it did.</li>
            <li>I love halloween</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>Im sure.</li>
            <li>i feel the wig could have had about an inch more of cap and hair coverage.</li>
            <li>but the space that covers the head as to better cover darker haired people.</li>
            <li>This wig was a perfect fit for my 5 year old niece..good quality.</li>
            <li>It DID NOT even come CLOSE to fitting either of two adults with smallish-to-average-sized heads.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve got to now sell mine, and try to find an appropriate one.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the thickness of the wig.</li>
            <li>You would love it!&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>The wig was OK.</li>
            <li>Much much better than the toys r us Elsa wig.</li>
            <li>but I love how the wig is secured to a netting type cap</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t 100 percent pleased.</li>
            <li>Love this, it fits her head well,</li>
            <li>•As described •Color is perfect for Elsa •Good quality for low price Cons</li>
            <li>OK, here I go.</li>
            <li>Over all, the color was perfect, it is pre-styled and needs adjustments for individual persons.</li>
            <li>This worked much better for my daughter who is 6 compared to the one sold in stores.  </li>
            <li>It worked:)</li>
            <li>its okay-</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll get just that...a cheap wig!  </li>
            <li>Looks cute on my daughter</li>
            <li>WAYYYYY better than any strip mall Halloween store for sure.</li>
            <li>Maybe it would&#x27;ve worked better for a toddler instead of youth.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>My daughter is going to love this.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t perfect but did the job overall.  </li>
            <li>We pinned snowflakes into the braid for a better Elsa effect.</li>
            <li>I wish they charged more and offered expedited shipping.</li>
            <li>Looks even better in person than in the item photo on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Sure, it costs more</li>
            <li>Still a better alternative to the ones sold at Halloween stores</li>
            <li>so glad I did.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made from something much softer, great quality, and fits me, but my daughter as well.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do much better on mine.  </li>
            <li>Better quality than the ones you find in the US Disney brand..</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll be able to use it also.  </li>
            <li>Of course it&#x27;s a wig, but still could have been sewed on better.</li>
            <li>I think it looks ok</li>
            <li>Make sure to order weeks in advance because it does take some time to arrive.</li>
            <li>Much better than most of the wigs I have seen in the stores.</li>
            <li>Styled more like Elsa as well.</li>
            <li>This wig is even better</li>
            <li>This wig is way better then the Disney Brand wig that they have out for the halloween costume</li>
            <li>It will work better with the cap, but I have to wait to use that</li>
            <li>Grand daughter will love it.</li>
            <li>Love that it is adjustable.</li>
            <li>Better than anticipated.</li>
            <li>My 5 year old student wore it and it fit her perfectly.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many compliments we got on this wig.</li>
            <li>This wig looked better then the ones they had on.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Honestly it&#x27;s better them most at the store.</li>
            <li>plus it gives her more time to play as she grows.</li>
            <li>This wig was okay.</li>
            <li>wig is phenomenal.</li>
            <li>love them</li>
            <li>Looks pretty good, fits fine, and my 7-year-old loves it!</li>
            <li>Just perfect for my 5 yr old, it fit fine.  </li>
            <li>very realistic and my grand daughter loved it for her costume</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s gonna be so excited to wear it for Halloween though!</li>
            <li>six year old daughter have s lots of fun with it, fits her perfect!</li>
            <li>it came really fast no problem and the quality was excellent felt like real hair.</li>
            <li>This is wonderful my 3 year old niece loves it and it fits her head just right for a child, she always have it on.</li>
            <li>wig is very good quality, but it definitely is a child size wig.  </li>
            <li>I read so many reviews about wigs that didnt fit well.</li>
            <li>It fit much better on my niece than it did me.</li>
            <li>so I know it will fit my granddaughter who will love it.</li>
            <li>The moment my 5 year old daughter opened the package, she was so exited to wear and made self of this great product.</li>
            <li>my 5 year old great.</li>
            <li>so I was able to stick the bobby pins through the holds for a more precise, snug fit.</li>
            <li>Does not look this good on a real person.</li>
            <li>Good quality wig, but VERY poofy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super impressed, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>It was an adult size, but it was very nice quality as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s full and poofy!</li>
            <li>It needed just a bit of styling, but other than that it was perfect!</li>
            <li>I bought it for my 9 year old daughter and it fit great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick and a great great quality for a child and beats others out there.  </li>
            <li>Wig came very quickly, in almost two weeks shipping from China.</li>
            <li>Only thing that is good is the color honestly.</li>
            <li>It was so lifelike and very easy to style.  </li>
            <li>I was extremely surprised when I saw how nice the wig turned out!</li>
            <li>But it looks beautiful, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>They are more like full toupees.</li>
            <li>Not bad, better than the target versions.</li>
            <li>I found this one to be well made and holds the shape just fine.</li>
            <li>A fine purchase because it will serve it&#x27;s purpose for Halloween.</li>
            <li>it is fine for a child .  </li>
            <li>it also tried it on my head and it fit just fine...</li>
            <li>Because it is adjustable, it fit her just fine.</li>
            <li>It is high quality, unlike the first wig we ordered, and I would recommend it and this seller to anyone who needs satisfy the wannabe Elsa in their life with a great wig.</li>
            <li>Luckily I had bought another wig that was meant for Snow White and the Huntsman, and it looked gorgeous!</li>
            <li>The color is really accurate though.</li>
            <li>It fit my head</li>
            <li>For the price I paid the wig was fantastic.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect it to fit well.  </li>
            <li>Great quality, it has definite weight and length.</li>
            <li>We ordered the wig for an event and it doesn&#x27;t fit any of our 5 Disney Princess models.</li>
            <li>This would be great for someone with a smaller head.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast and the wig was better than expected and fit perfectly.  </li>
            <li>and I can adjust it to fit her head or my head.</li>
            <li>Some styling is needed, but it did fit well.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a great buy</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t fit.  </li>
            <li>A lol on the yellow side</li>
            <li>I used a few bobby pins and it stayed on her head perfectly.</li>
            <li>This may have free shipping, but it comes from China &amp; may take over 1 month - DON&amp;#34;t order if need for Halloween.</li>
            <li>The color was a light blond and was well made.</li>
            <li>It looks like Elsa&#x27;s hair, and does not feel like a cheap plastic hair wig does.</li>
            <li>It is nicely made and seems quite real.</li>
            <li>fits adult and my 8 year old niece great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no wig expert, but this seems to be a nice quality and fits my 6 year old way better than than the Disney branded wig.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gorgeous, and thick, it does a great job covering the brown hair underneath.  </li>
            <li>It looks and feels like real hair!!!</li>
            <li>It was able to fit my 4 year old because you are able to adjust the fit.</li>
            <li>The wig is okay , not high quality hair but for my 3 and 8 year old to dress up with their Elsa costume , it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t want to bother trying to return it to China or find a new one, so I used some hair goo to try to style the top better.</li>
            <li>Fits my 4 year old nicely and easy to put on.</li>
            <li>and I was quite excited to get the wig.</li>
            <li>The top of the wig in the front is pretty sparse</li>
            <li>My daughter is beyond excited and can&#x27;t wait to wear it.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the wait!</li>
            <li>I have a bunch of cosplay wigs, and this is by far the nicest, and most convincing.</li>
            <li>Soft and cute!</li>
            <li>It will go great with my Elsa costume once I tame the top to stop looking like a Bach or Chopin wig.</li>
            <li>Great wig but most likely won&#x27;t fit an adult.</li>
            <li>I took a chance by purchasing this wig, it looks cheap in the picture and that&#x27;s exactly what I got; a cheap wig.</li>
            <li>The wig is amazing and really soft.</li>
            <li>My 6 year old got amazing compliments on this wig for her Elsa &amp;#34;Frozen&amp;#34; costume.  </li>
            <li>love it also fast shipping</li>
            <li>Personally, I&#x27;m going to trim the bangs a bit, but they&#x27;re at a good length.  </li>
            <li>I would suggest to get a real wig cap because they hold better so 4 stars😊</li>
            <li>The quality is good enough that it will last quite some time and be a good addition to any child&#x27;s &amp;#34;dress up&amp;#34; collection.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much : )</li>
            <li>My four-and-a-half year old granddaughter loves Elsa and was thrilled to get this wig.</li>
            <li>It does have that capabilities but didn&#x27;t fit right on her.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t fit right, and was never given the cap that is suppose to come with it.</li>
            <li>The braid doesn&#x27;t lay right, and the free wig cap has two holes in</li>
            <li>she puts it on with her gloves and dress and makes her best serious face...</li>
            <li>When i ordered this, it said it would come with a free hair net to put your own hair in before the wig</li>
            <li>Otherwise, for the price it&#x27;s definitely worthy, once again, keep in mind, if you intend it for a child.</li>
            <li>But the hair is soooo soft and nice that it is worth fixing.</li>
            <li>I started the braid high up and made it looser and thicker, more &amp;#34;Elsa&amp;#34; like</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really fit my head, but fit my 5 year old daughter just fine.</li>
            <li>The wig came in a net and the braid starts from the very top.</li>
            <li>very pretty.</li>
            <li>When all the other little girls Elsa wigs didn&#x27;t fit because they bought the crappy Disney one from Target, my daughter was so excited because hers looks amazing and everyone LOVED it!</li>
            <li>and it is AMAZING how much it looks like ELSA.. highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly how it looks in picture!</li>
            <li>It definitely looks better in the picture though!</li>
            <li>Very pretty wig that is worth the price.</li>
            <li>You will have to fit it to yourself to look right, wig flops funny when it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li>Great wig for a little girl to be Elisa from Frozen.</li>
            <li>And even when grabbed at by little hands it still looks great for play.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft and pretty, looks exactly like the pictures and mostly importantly, my 4-year-old daughter loves it!!  </li>
            <li>My little sister is 6 years old and it fits perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I give it two stars only because I assume that it would be great for a child&#x27;s costume; it&#x27;s a nice little wig for the price.</li>
            <li>The description always says that it&#x27;s adjustable thanks to a band inside of it, and will therefore fit adults as well as children.</li>
            <li>AND IT FIT MY NIECE&#x27;S HEAD VERY</li>
            <li>This wig fit very well.</li>
            <li>and I was filled with self-loathing for even contemplating this whole endeavor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The adjustable straps on the underside were great and with a few bobby pins it held in place nicely the entire time we went trick-or-treating.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s kind of big on my 6 yr olds head and the strap to adjust it doesn&#x27;t make sense.</li>
            <li>worth the price i paid.</li>
            <li>but after that worth the money.</li>
            <li>Im sure an adult could wear it too.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s definitely worth the price difference.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely worth th the money just give yourself plenty of time for shipping?</li>
            <li>I am an adult and was so worried it would not fit, but it fits on my head great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably have to pull it back some and thread my own hair over it.</li>
            <li>This product arrived earlier than delivery date schedue, packed nice and neat.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>perfect for halloween next week, came way sooner than expected</li>
            <li>She still had fun.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure of sizing for a large adult head, but it fit perfectly on her.</li>
            <li>Was exactly as described and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Too big and slipped off my daughters head easily, and it is adjustable, but doesn&#x27;t stay on easy.</li>
            <li>This wig is very pretty at first.</li>
            <li>but good for Halloween better then the disneys wigs....arrived fast but small packaged and smelled aweful.</li>
            <li>The hair comes out of the braid almost right after putting on.  </li>
            <li>and they said they couldn&#x27;t guarantee delivery before Halloween, but they would send out the wig right away.  </li>
            <li>wasn;t any thing on their part offered to try and make it right.. she did get to wear it to school for dress up day.</li>
            <li>The childrens costume wig went right into the trash when this arrived.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re going to have to do a lot of work and styling to get the wig right.</li>
            <li>But you&#x27;ll have to play with the hair to get it to look right.</li>
            <li>Great Elsa wig for little girl!  </li>
            <li>Perfect Elsa wig but wish it came with a nude color hair net instead of a black one.  </li>
            <li>If it was bigger and could fit an adult it would be nice.</li>
            <li>reason I ordered this was because,for some reason,the wigs available in stores are tiny,even for normal 4 or 5 year olds</li>
            <li>great quality, but did not fit at all!  </li>
            <li>The reason I&#x27;m giving it a 3 is because it looks a little razor chopped on top instead of wavy on top</li>
            <li>The only redeeming feature is that the hair is really quite long, so you can sweep it over your shoulder for a good Elsa effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Also, the shipping is awesome and the wig arrived a few hours earlier than the estimated time of arrival. ^^</li>
            <li>Quality construction and tons of real looking hair make this a pretty and full wig.  </li>
            <li>The only good thing was that I received it on the early end of the window that they specified.</li>
            <li>Part of the braid was caught on one of the hooks (that makes it adjustable), but I was able to unhook it &amp; the pulled hairs went right back into the braid.</li>
            <li>Fits my 7 year old fine.</li>
            <li>so if you have a young daughter I would say the one in the store is fine.  </li>
            <li>Real nice looking like real, very thick hair.</li>
            <li>This fit my 8 year old niece&#x27;s head and hair well.  </li>
            <li>Really wasnt worth it.</li>
            <li>My 3 year old has a lot of hair to fit under a wig, but this one fits her &amp; all of her hair.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!  </li>
            <li>This wig worked really well!  </li>
            <li>So it fit my 7 year old well, and I could wear it</li>
            <li>so I admit I don&#x27;t know the first thing about wigs</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t fit an adult</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very well made!</li>
            <li>Says it will fit an adult -</li>
            <li>so we were especially grateful to them for the quicker delivery. :)&lt;</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t even fit for my 5 year old daughter .It</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine it would fit an adult head even though it is adjustable.  </li>
            <li>They sent a wig the size that would fit a 5 year old.</li>
            <li>Looks so much better than others we saw (and others said the same).</li>
            <li>If they could correct this problem it would be a really pretty wig.</li>
            <li>It looks exactly like Elsa&#x27;s hair...</li>
            <li>Much better quality than anything in our local stores.</li>
            <li>It took exactly 3 weeks to arrive.</li>
            <li>This feels like real hair !</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t fit my four year old granddaughter or anyone else.</li>
            <li>As far as the quality of the wig, it is fabulous for the price.</li>
            <li>My only gripe is that it wasn&#x27;t able to work for my child because it didn&#x27;t arrive until almost a month after Halloween.</li>
            <li>It barely fit my eight year old daughter.</li>
            <li>My three-year-old was the happiest girl on the block and will be able to wear this for several years before it wears out.</li>
            <li>Very nice&lt;br /&gt;Many compliments!</li>
            <li>Elsa wig fit my 5 year old daughter pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Wig looks exactly like it does on the mannequin in the picture.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s exactly forma muy Dougther.</li>
            <li>Fit my 9 year old well.</li>
            <li>The short hair around her face would have looked way better if it was curled.</li>
            <li>THANKS!</li>
            <li>But it can really stretch out if you pull it apart the right way.</li>
            <li>The hair cap was nice but hard to secure on child&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li>It is heavy, so be sure to secure it.</li>
            <li>She has long, thinnish hair, but is able to get it all up in the cap.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much for your help!</li>
            <li>The color is more on light yellow than beige, not the same as in tge picture.</li>
            <li>The wig has a stretchy section in the back, so it would fit many different head sizes.</li>
            <li>The front &amp;#34;bangs&amp;#34; part kind of stuck out at an odd angle</li>
            <li>well, low and behold, it came two weeks before expected, and my daughter is THRILLED!</li>
            <li>Certainly doesnt look like the picture.</li>
            <li>Definitely seems a bit small for an adult but for a child its perfect!</li>
            <li>I bought a different one at first, one that was for kids, but the thing didn&#x27;t even come close to fitting my 5 year old&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re lucky enough to plan months in advance for whatever use you plan on putting it to, order it right then and there.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a pretty significant &amp;#34;widows peak&amp;#34; that I wasn&#x27;t really in the pictures, not a deal breaker by any means, I just didn&#x27;t expect it or think it was necessary.  </li>
            <li>the braid does look like real hair</li>
            <li>It was cut very funky and even with some gel and finesse I refused to wear it as it just didnt look like elsa.</li>
            <li>Looks real and just like the movie</li>
            <li>This way, that part of your real hair won&#x27;t show through.</li>
            <li>I ended up having to pay just about as much to return it as I did to purchase it.</li>
            <li>Very Elsa.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>so it is really my fault.</li>
            <li>Warning: this one is for girls or very petite women.</li>
            <li>The person fromDfunlife was very apologetic</li>
            <li>I have an average-to-small sized head and this was not even remotely close to fitting.</li>
            <li>High quality!</li>
            <li>Looks real like.</li>
            <li>It is to be adjustable but a challenge to get it to fit properly.</li>
            <li>My daughter is very petite and I bought this off of their review that it was adjustable.  </li>
            <li>Very high-quality and looks just like the product photo.</li>
            <li>This one fit her head, and had a elastic band in the back that you could pull to make the wig tighter.</li>
            <li>Much cooler looking than the crappy Disney kids brands ones.</li>
            <li>Also came with cap to hold real hair in place under wig.  </li>
            <li>This wig was spot on and looked very Elsa-like.</li>
            <li>The package did arrive early and come neatly along with a wig cap, BUT the wig doesn&#x27;t fit an adult head.</li>
            <li>Wow!!!  </li>
            <li>And...I emailed this company because it said I wouldn&#x27;t get the wig until November or early December to see if they could ship it right away</li>
            <li>Bought this for an Elsa costume and it was better quality than I expected!</li>
            <li>but I really wanted a realistic look.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not awesome: pretty ugly.</li>
            <li>This meant that the back of her hair showed a bit, but that was ok because it was barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>Much blonder than antipated, but my 4 year old thinks it&#x27;s great if just a little to big still.  </li>
            <li>This wig will last for many years of play and it won&#x27;t turn into a ratty mess like those cheap wigs.</li>
            <li>The top is super afro-y, but it fits my small adult head.  </li>
            <li>Is a really good product, problem is they run a little smaller than promised.</li>
            <li>There are some bare spots that show if the hair is not arranged just right or the wind blows.</li>
            <li>It was about $6 less than the Disney store Elsa wig and much better quality.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this wig as it looks like it&#x27;d be a decent halloween wig for Elsa.</li>
            <li>This fits a older child well.  </li>
            <li>Everything about this wig is decent...</li>
            <li>Decent wig for the price.</li>
            <li>but the thing wouldn&#x27;t stay on and didn&#x27;t look realistic because all the hair underneath was showing.</li>
            <li>This is for kids Doesnt fit adult heads properly..</li>
            <li>We also bought the same wig in the white color and she looks more like George Washington than Elsa.</li>
            <li>Was nicely combed out and hair felt thick and real.  </li>
            <li>I also plan on hair spraying the top hair down more because it get&#x27;s a little crazy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Large enough to fit a big head and very well made plus you cannot beat a $13 price.</li>
            <li>It kind of makes it look a little awkward, but overall it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d call it more like a 3/4 fall though, and not a full head wig.</li>
            <li>Also I did not like the way it came packaged, just in a zip lock bag &amp; then in a package wrap, they may have something to do with why the top was a mess.</li>
            <li>After reading many posts on this product I was expecting it to not fit at all.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on the in store cheap costume wigs!</li>
            <li>This wig is is 100 times better in quality than the ones at the Halloween stores and costs much less!</li>
            <li>This was one of my 3 year old little girl&#x27;s favorite Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li>(though I can&#x27;t tell you how tempted I am to just chuck it and get a new one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would actually buy more because if my daughter gets too rough with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In all fairness, she does have a lot of long, thick hair but still, it would be a stretch for an older child to wear it and look good.  </li>
            <li>But, the wig itself is actually quite pretty and very soft.....</li>
            <li>The wig will  make our event of Elsa visiting our office to take pictures near the tree!  </li>
            <li>On halloween a toddler followed my 7 year old around the neighborhood so she could trick-or- treat with Elsa!  </li>
            <li>The wig is lovely, although a bit on the small side.</li>
            <li>Other than that it looks okay and is only going to be used for Halloween, then in the dress up box it goes.</li>
            <li>Arrived early!</li>
            <li>I ordered it the first week in October, and it came last week!</li>
            <li>Overall, decent product at a reasonable price, but I wouldn&#x27;t order again.  </li>
            <li>This wig can fit a 6 year old or 60 year old due to its adjustable clips.</li>
            <li>so since I have long hair it all slid to the back so there was a huge bumb there  </li>
            <li>and it wouldnt fit over half of my head.</li>
            <li>you have to contend with 3 ft long strips of hair once it&#x27;s all undone, and some of the hair is 2 ft in length, so really, there is hair absolutely everywhere</li>
            <li>However, there is something odd about the fit.  </li>
            <li>They wrote back the same day saying they would try, and if I didn&#x27;t receive it in time, they&#x27;d issue a full refund.</li>
            <li>Fits my 8 year old, but too small for most adults.</li>
            <li>It can be adjusted up and down, so it would fit an adult, too.</li>
            <li>For my little shin dig it was just fine.</li>
            <li>The hair is a bit thick, but it was pretty easy to clean up with a little hair spray.</li>
            <li>seemed like the wig was too small, other than that, the wig was good quality</li>
            <li>--it was as large as it could possibly be.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are no directions how to secure or adjust it,for those of us not familiar with wig protocol.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I reccomend setting it on a foam head after you get it and back combing the top as it gets a little flattened in shipping.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little big for my 6-year-old, but that&#x27;s ok, we can tighten it, and</li>
            <li>Having a hard time getting it on my grand daughter&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li>But DO NOT get it for an adult.</li>
            <li>Christmas gift for young girl</li>
            <li>My daughter is 3.5 years old and wore it for Halloween.  </li>
            <li>the only reason for four stars and not five is that the front hair of the wig is big/tall, haha.</li>
            <li>This is not an adult sized wig.</li>
            <li>Gets completely disheveled and looks like Liberace rather than Elsa.</li>
            <li>and I ordered for an adult</li>
            <li>My four year old loves using this wig to be Elsa, the snow queen...</li>
            <li>This wig was purchased for my 5 year old and she loves it.</li>
            <li>Definitely needs styled, you can absolutely see the mesh.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the hair and the adjustability of the wig.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on the cheap wigs sold at retail stores...</li>
            <li>but I have no trouble putting this wig on.</li>
            <li>Get this if you are looking to be an adult Elsa.</li>
            <li>My daughter is 8 years old and this worked.  </li>
            <li>It fits my 5 year old.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to go with my 6 year old&#x27;s Elsa Halloween costume.</li>
            <li>Fits my 4 year old..</li>
            <li>It fits my 8 year old whom this was purchased for.</li>
            <li>Fits my 5yr old daughter (who has lots of hair).</li>
            <li>I got it for my 4 year old to complete her costume.</li>
            <li>Looks basically like the picture but wouldn&#x27;t stay on my five year old&#x27;s head and kept loosing hair strands.</li>
            <li>My 10 year old loves it.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this for my 7 yr old daughter to wear for Halloween.  </li>
            <li>Will work for an adult or a child.</li>
            <li>If you are thinking of buying it for an adult, you can probably make it work with lots of pins.  </li>
            <li>However, I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do not recommend this product for an adult.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my six year old granddaughter and she did not want to wear it after trying to put it on her to see how it looks.</li>
            <li>Was bought to complete Frozen Elsa&#x27;s outfit.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my 8 year old daughter to be Elsa.</li>
            <li>Not itchy, and the hair is so soft.</li>
            <li>This wig doesn&#x27;t even for a 3 yrs old kid.</li>
            <li>Holding up for a 6 year old using it.  </li>
            <li>My child is seven years old and we couldn&#x27;t get it on her head.  </li>
            <li>Got the blond wigg an the brown for my 9 year old that loves the movie thought they would look cheep because of the price</li>
            <li>The braid is thick and soft, it is much better than the temp one we bought.</li>
            <li>Also, unless you pull the front hairline down, don&#x27;t expect full coverage over the front of your ears.</li>
            <li>I like the long braid that can come around to lay on shoulder but the top of the wig is a mess, like a birds nest.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not good looking enough for an adult although you can manipulate it good enough for a child</li>
            <li>My granddaughter is large for her age, so it should fit most little kids five or under if they have small to average sized heads.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it would fit an adult.</li>
            <li>Ordered another Elsa tiara and braid wig for my 5yr old daughter and it was WAY too small to fit even a childs head.  </li>
            <li>While it says it is sized for adult, my almost 5 year old could barely wear it.</li>
            <li>There is way too much of the short &amp;#34;bangs&amp;#34; and they go too far back on the crown.</li>
            <li>We purchased a backup long, white-blonde &amp;#34;pop-star&amp;#34; wig at Wmart just in case this Elsa wig didn&#x27;t arrive on time, but this one is much, much nicer.</li>
            <li>(My seller was nice enough to give me a couple bucks back, at least, just because I was so displeased.)</li>
            <li>(mine is hugely voluminous, but I could still tell that this wig would not fit properly even if I were bald.)</li>
            <li>The big problem is the wig lacks any real style, especially Elsa&#x27;s hairstyle.</li>
            <li>I purchased two different wigs from different sellers and they were exactly the same.</li>
            <li>The shipping was exactly as advertised, I bought it on Sept 21st and it arrived today, exactly 15 business days from the date of purchase and in time for my daughter&#x27;s Halloween parade, school party and Halloween, of course.  </li>
            <li>The wig itself is very pretty; however, it was too small for my four year old niece&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li>My wife is a District Manager for a large nation wide retailer.</li>
            <li>While the quality is very nice, the weight of the ponytail makes it almost impossible for my child to wear.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The hairline on this wig goes really far back-</li>
            <li>I asked for a refund, and thankfully the people I ordered from (Kamo Direct) gave it back to me, but they did not include a return label or any information whatsoever.</li>
            <li>Definitely fits an adult head if anyone is wondering.</li>
            <li>(U can barely tell)</li>
            <li>So far, she was only wear it 2 times.</li>
            <li>The item came much quicker than expected.  </li>
            <li>Order came much quicker than expected.</li>
            <li>It had no depth to it and barely covered the hairline.</li>
            <li>Hairline is not very natural and the widow&#x27;s peak will need taping to stay down, but the braid is thick and overall the wig is good.</li>
            <li>Our five year old wore this for Halloween &amp; little girls were coming up to her &amp; telling her she looked like the real Elsa.</li>
            <li>The wig is a good quality, but is very difficult to put on and keep on a child.</li>
            <li>It seems heavy, maybe a little too heavy for a child, but does seem to be of good quality, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>A little large for kid heads, even with straps adjusted.</li>
            <li>Like other reviews I have read, the cap of this wig is very small and flat, not round to fit someone&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li>Made for a good picture, but a bad costume addition.</li>
            <li>I would imagine it could fit up to a small pre-teens head, but too small for my adult head.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> My daughter loved wearing it with her elsa costume.</li>

            <li> Good quality.</li>
            <li> My niece totally loved it.</li>
            <li> Good quality, looks like Elsa.  </li>
            <li> It is good price but takes forever to get ( close to 2 month) if you want this for Halloween have to order before September</li>
            <li> Made my niece&#x27;s delighted on her bday</li>
            <li> this incase we need to use it again, because it&#x27;s still in good shape.</li>
            <li> Also, although the quality is good, the hair is sparse on the sides and you can see the underside material of the wig when it is on.</li>
            <li> loved it excellent material real pretty.</li>
            <li> I was impressed at how quickly it got here.</li>
            <li> This wig went to Disney on time and has made many appearances as part of my daughter&#x27;s dress-up play for months and still looks great.  </li>
            <li> and she was very pleased</li>
            <li> it was a gift for my great grand daughter, but it didn&#x27;t get here by holloween.</li>

            <li> looks better than the ones at the wal place!</li>
            <li> very happy w quality of product, it is still a bit large on my daughter</li>
            <li> LOOKED GREAT AND FIT</li>
            <li> It was really nice and came with the cap that was promised.</li>
            <li> Everyone who saw it liked it.</li>
            <li> I think the wig is nice</li>
            <li> Especially fun when her dad put it on and sang songs from Frozen to her</li>
            <li> It was however a nice quality is the description stated.</li>
            <li> It is not braided or pieced nicely like the picture.</li>
            <li> I gave this 4 stars, because the wig itself is rather nice.</li>
            <li> The quality was excellent and with the hair cap  as an added bonus we didn&#x27;t have to worry about keeping her real hair falling out from under it.  </li>
            <li> The quality of this wig is really nice.  </li>
            <li> Not as nice as I was expecting.</li>
            <li> The color and feel of the wig is nice, for the price.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a handy hair person, try re-braiding the wig.</li>
            <li> Nice braid.</li>
            <li> Over all a nice wig.</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s a nice fiber for a wig.</li>
            <li> Nice quality.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t cut nicely either so the bangs and layers flair all over the place.</li>
            <li> Nice size and well made.  </li>
            <li> The size is perfect for older girls and adults.</li>
            <li> I used my Elsa crown to help secure the wig and it looked amazing!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this wig and it is much better than any of the dress-up ones I&#x27;ve seen for children.  </li>
            <li> in all, a great wig at a great price for the young ones.  </li>
            <li> Definitely was impressed on how good the hair was.</li>
            <li> It was such a good price, and great quality!!!!</li>
            <li> Good quality wig, and the cap that comes with is great for keeping my daughter&#x27;s real hair out of the way.</li>
            <li> and I am sure she will love it!</li>
            <li> This was perfect for my 3 year old daughter&#x27;s Halloween costume!</li>
            <li> Got here super quick with two day Prime shipping and was PERFECT.</li>
            <li> Fits my 5 yr old Queen Elsa beautifully!</li>
            <li> My 6 year old wore it for Halloween and stayed on perfectly.</li>
            <li> but I am an adult wearing this for Halloween and it fits perfectly and looks just like Elsa from Disney World.</li>
            <li> This was perfect for my 6 yr old Elsa.  </li>
            <li> It fits my almost 5 year old perfectly without having to be adjusted.</li>
            <li> Loved the wig it fit</li>
            <li> The wig was very good quality &amp; I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> very fast shipment and great product thank you.</li>
            <li> Gave 4/5 stars because like I said it was great quality and looked pretty</li>
            <li> 20-Nov 3rd(which was fine because its for her birthday party..not halloween) and it came in the mail today!</li>
            <li> Gorgeous wig for the money very pleased looks real</li>
            <li> , I just thought it was ok.</li>
            <li> but i wish it would have stayed in place better than it did.</li>
            <li> I love halloween</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> Im sure.</li>
            <li> i feel the wig could have had about an inch more of cap and hair coverage.</li>
            <li> but the space that covers the head as to better cover darker haired people.</li>
            <li> This wig was a perfect fit for my 5 year old niece..good quality.</li>
            <li> It DID NOT even come CLOSE to fitting either of two adults with smallish-to-average-sized heads.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve got to now sell mine, and try to find an appropriate one.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the thickness of the wig.</li>
            <li> You would love it!&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> The wig was OK.</li>
            <li> Much much better than the toys r us Elsa wig.</li>
            <li> but I love how the wig is secured to a netting type cap</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t 100 percent pleased.</li>
            <li> Love this, it fits her head well,</li>
            <li> •As described •Color is perfect for Elsa •Good quality for low price Cons</li>
            <li> OK, here I go.</li>
            <li> Over all, the color was perfect, it is pre-styled and needs adjustments for individual persons.</li>
            <li> This worked much better for my daughter who is 6 compared to the one sold in stores.  </li>
            <li> It worked:)</li>
            <li> its okay-</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll get just that...a cheap wig!  </li>
            <li> Looks cute on my daughter</li>
            <li> WAYYYYY better than any strip mall Halloween store for sure.</li>
            <li> Maybe it would&#x27;ve worked better for a toddler instead of youth.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> My daughter is going to love this.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t perfect but did the job overall.  </li>
            <li> We pinned snowflakes into the braid for a better Elsa effect.</li>
            <li> I wish they charged more and offered expedited shipping.</li>
            <li> Looks even better in person than in the item photo on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Sure, it costs more</li>
            <li> Still a better alternative to the ones sold at Halloween stores</li>
            <li> so glad I did.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made from something much softer, great quality, and fits me, but my daughter as well.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do much better on mine.  </li>
            <li> Better quality than the ones you find in the US Disney brand..</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll be able to use it also.  </li>
            <li> Of course it&#x27;s a wig, but still could have been sewed on better.</li>
            <li> I think it looks ok</li>
            <li> Make sure to order weeks in advance because it does take some time to arrive.</li>
            <li> Much better than most of the wigs I have seen in the stores.</li>
            <li> Styled more like Elsa as well.</li>
            <li> This wig is even better</li>
            <li> This wig is way better then the Disney Brand wig that they have out for the halloween costume</li>
            <li> It will work better with the cap, but I have to wait to use that</li>
            <li> Grand daughter will love it.</li>
            <li> Love that it is adjustable.</li>
            <li> Better than anticipated.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old student wore it and it fit her perfectly.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how many compliments we got on this wig.</li>
            <li> This wig looked better then the ones they had on.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Honestly it&#x27;s better them most at the store.</li>
            <li> plus it gives her more time to play as she grows.</li>
            <li> This wig was okay.</li>
            <li> wig is phenomenal.</li>
            <li> love them</li>

            <li> Just perfect for my 5 yr old, it fit fine.  </li>
            <li> very realistic and my grand daughter loved it for her costume</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s gonna be so excited to wear it for Halloween though!</li>
            <li> six year old daughter have s lots of fun with it, fits her perfect!</li>
            <li> it came really fast no problem and the quality was excellent felt like real hair.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful my 3 year old niece loves it and it fits her head just right for a child, she always have it on.</li>
            <li> wig is very good quality, but it definitely is a child size wig.  </li>
            <li> I read so many reviews about wigs that didnt fit well.</li>
            <li> It fit much better on my niece than it did me.</li>
            <li> so I know it will fit my granddaughter who will love it.</li>
            <li> The moment my 5 year old daughter opened the package, she was so exited to wear and made self of this great product.</li>
            <li> my 5 year old great.</li>
            <li> so I was able to stick the bobby pins through the holds for a more precise, snug fit.</li>
            <li> Does not look this good on a real person.</li>
            <li> Good quality wig, but VERY poofy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super impressed, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> It was an adult size, but it was very nice quality as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s full and poofy!</li>
            <li> It needed just a bit of styling, but other than that it was perfect!</li>
            <li> I bought it for my 9 year old daughter and it fit great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and a great great quality for a child and beats others out there.  </li>
            <li> Wig came very quickly, in almost two weeks shipping from China.</li>
            <li> Only thing that is good is the color honestly.</li>
            <li> It was so lifelike and very easy to style.  </li>
            <li> I was extremely surprised when I saw how nice the wig turned out!</li>
            <li> But it looks beautiful, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> They are more like full toupees.</li>
            <li> Not bad, better than the target versions.</li>
            <li> I found this one to be well made and holds the shape just fine.</li>
            <li> A fine purchase because it will serve it&#x27;s purpose for Halloween.</li>
            <li> it is fine for a child .  </li>
            <li> it also tried it on my head and it fit just fine...</li>
            <li> Because it is adjustable, it fit her just fine.</li>
            <li> It is high quality, unlike the first wig we ordered, and I would recommend it and this seller to anyone who needs satisfy the wannabe Elsa in their life with a great wig.</li>
            <li> Luckily I had bought another wig that was meant for Snow White and the Huntsman, and it looked gorgeous!</li>
            <li> The color is really accurate though.</li>
            <li> It fit my head</li>
            <li> For the price I paid the wig was fantastic.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect it to fit well.  </li>
            <li> Great quality, it has definite weight and length.</li>
            <li> We ordered the wig for an event and it doesn&#x27;t fit any of our 5 Disney Princess models.</li>
            <li> This would be great for someone with a smaller head.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast and the wig was better than expected and fit perfectly.  </li>
            <li> and I can adjust it to fit her head or my head.</li>
            <li> Some styling is needed, but it did fit well.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a great buy</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t fit.  </li>
            <li> A lol on the yellow side</li>
            <li> I used a few bobby pins and it stayed on her head perfectly.</li>
            <li> This may have free shipping, but it comes from China &amp; may take over 1 month - DON&amp;#34;t order if need for Halloween.</li>
            <li> The color was a light blond and was well made.</li>
            <li> It looks like Elsa&#x27;s hair, and does not feel like a cheap plastic hair wig does.</li>
            <li> It is nicely made and seems quite real.</li>
            <li> fits adult and my 8 year old niece great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no wig expert, but this seems to be a nice quality and fits my 6 year old way better than than the Disney branded wig.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gorgeous, and thick, it does a great job covering the brown hair underneath.  </li>
            <li> It looks and feels like real hair!!!</li>
            <li> It was able to fit my 4 year old because you are able to adjust the fit.</li>
            <li> The wig is okay , not high quality hair but for my 3 and 8 year old to dress up with their Elsa costume , it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t want to bother trying to return it to China or find a new one, so I used some hair goo to try to style the top better.</li>
            <li> Fits my 4 year old nicely and easy to put on.</li>
            <li> and I was quite excited to get the wig.</li>
            <li> The top of the wig in the front is pretty sparse</li>
            <li> My daughter is beyond excited and can&#x27;t wait to wear it.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the wait!</li>
            <li> I have a bunch of cosplay wigs, and this is by far the nicest, and most convincing.</li>
            <li> Soft and cute!</li>
            <li> It will go great with my Elsa costume once I tame the top to stop looking like a Bach or Chopin wig.</li>
            <li> Great wig but most likely won&#x27;t fit an adult.</li>
            <li> I took a chance by purchasing this wig, it looks cheap in the picture and that&#x27;s exactly what I got; a cheap wig.</li>
            <li> The wig is amazing and really soft.</li>
            <li> My 6 year old got amazing compliments on this wig for her Elsa &amp;#34;Frozen&amp;#34; costume.  </li>
            <li> love it also fast shipping</li>
            <li> Personally, I&#x27;m going to trim the bangs a bit, but they&#x27;re at a good length.  </li>
            <li> I would suggest to get a real wig cap because they hold better so 4 stars😊</li>
            <li> The quality is good enough that it will last quite some time and be a good addition to any child&#x27;s &amp;#34;dress up&amp;#34; collection.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much : )</li>
            <li> My four-and-a-half year old granddaughter loves Elsa and was thrilled to get this wig.</li>
            <li> It does have that capabilities but didn&#x27;t fit right on her.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit right, and was never given the cap that is suppose to come with it.</li>
            <li> The braid doesn&#x27;t lay right, and the free wig cap has two holes in</li>
            <li> she puts it on with her gloves and dress and makes her best serious face...</li>
            <li> When i ordered this, it said it would come with a free hair net to put your own hair in before the wig</li>
            <li> Otherwise, for the price it&#x27;s definitely worthy, once again, keep in mind, if you intend it for a child.</li>
            <li> But the hair is soooo soft and nice that it is worth fixing.</li>
            <li> I started the braid high up and made it looser and thicker, more &amp;#34;Elsa&amp;#34; like</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really fit my head, but fit my 5 year old daughter just fine.</li>
            <li> The wig came in a net and the braid starts from the very top.</li>
            <li> very pretty.</li>
            <li> When all the other little girls Elsa wigs didn&#x27;t fit because they bought the crappy Disney one from Target, my daughter was so excited because hers looks amazing and everyone LOVED it!</li>
            <li> and it is AMAZING how much it looks like ELSA.. highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly how it looks in picture!</li>
            <li> It definitely looks better in the picture though!</li>
            <li> Very pretty wig that is worth the price.</li>
            <li> You will have to fit it to yourself to look right, wig flops funny when it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li> Great wig for a little girl to be Elisa from Frozen.</li>
            <li> And even when grabbed at by little hands it still looks great for play.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft and pretty, looks exactly like the pictures and mostly importantly, my 4-year-old daughter loves it!!  </li>
            <li> My little sister is 6 years old and it fits perfectly.  </li>
            <li> I give it two stars only because I assume that it would be great for a child&#x27;s costume; it&#x27;s a nice little wig for the price.</li>
            <li> The description always says that it&#x27;s adjustable thanks to a band inside of it, and will therefore fit adults as well as children.</li>
            <li> AND IT FIT MY NIECE&#x27;S HEAD VERY</li>
            <li> This wig fit very well.</li>
            <li> and I was filled with self-loathing for even contemplating this whole endeavor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The adjustable straps on the underside were great and with a few bobby pins it held in place nicely the entire time we went trick-or-treating.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s kind of big on my 6 yr olds head and the strap to adjust it doesn&#x27;t make sense.</li>
            <li> worth the price i paid.</li>
            <li> but after that worth the money.</li>
            <li> Im sure an adult could wear it too.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s definitely worth the price difference.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely worth th the money just give yourself plenty of time for shipping?</li>
            <li> I am an adult and was so worried it would not fit, but it fits on my head great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably have to pull it back some and thread my own hair over it.</li>
            <li> This product arrived earlier than delivery date schedue, packed nice and neat.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> perfect for halloween next week, came way sooner than expected</li>
            <li> She still had fun.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure of sizing for a large adult head, but it fit perfectly on her.</li>
            <li> Was exactly as described and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Too big and slipped off my daughters head easily, and it is adjustable, but doesn&#x27;t stay on easy.</li>
            <li> This wig is very pretty at first.</li>
            <li> but good for Halloween better then the disneys wigs....arrived fast but small packaged and smelled aweful.</li>
            <li> The hair comes out of the braid almost right after putting on.  </li>
            <li> and they said they couldn&#x27;t guarantee delivery before Halloween, but they would send out the wig right away.  </li>
            <li> wasn;t any thing on their part offered to try and make it right.. she did get to wear it to school for dress up day.</li>
            <li> The childrens costume wig went right into the trash when this arrived.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re going to have to do a lot of work and styling to get the wig right.</li>
            <li> But you&#x27;ll have to play with the hair to get it to look right.</li>
            <li> Great Elsa wig for little girl!  </li>
            <li> Perfect Elsa wig but wish it came with a nude color hair net instead of a black one.  </li>
            <li> If it was bigger and could fit an adult it would be nice.</li>
            <li> reason I ordered this was because,for some reason,the wigs available in stores are tiny,even for normal 4 or 5 year olds</li>
            <li> great quality, but did not fit at all!  </li>
            <li> The reason I&#x27;m giving it a 3 is because it looks a little razor chopped on top instead of wavy on top</li>
            <li> The only redeeming feature is that the hair is really quite long, so you can sweep it over your shoulder for a good Elsa effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Also, the shipping is awesome and the wig arrived a few hours earlier than the estimated time of arrival. ^^</li>
            <li> Quality construction and tons of real looking hair make this a pretty and full wig.  </li>
            <li> The only good thing was that I received it on the early end of the window that they specified.</li>
            <li> Part of the braid was caught on one of the hooks (that makes it adjustable), but I was able to unhook it &amp; the pulled hairs went right back into the braid.</li>
            <li> Fits my 7 year old fine.</li>
            <li> so if you have a young daughter I would say the one in the store is fine.  </li>
            <li> Real nice looking like real, very thick hair.</li>
            <li> This fit my 8 year old niece&#x27;s head and hair well.  </li>
            <li> Really wasnt worth it.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old has a lot of hair to fit under a wig, but this one fits her &amp; all of her hair.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!  </li>
            <li> This wig worked really well!  </li>
            <li> So it fit my 7 year old well, and I could wear it</li>
            <li> so I admit I don&#x27;t know the first thing about wigs</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t fit an adult</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very well made!</li>
            <li> Says it will fit an adult -</li>
            <li> so we were especially grateful to them for the quicker delivery. :)&lt;</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even fit for my 5 year old daughter .It</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine it would fit an adult head even though it is adjustable.  </li>
            <li> They sent a wig the size that would fit a 5 year old.</li>
            <li> Looks so much better than others we saw (and others said the same).</li>
            <li> If they could correct this problem it would be a really pretty wig.</li>
            <li> It looks exactly like Elsa&#x27;s hair...</li>
            <li> Much better quality than anything in our local stores.</li>
            <li> It took exactly 3 weeks to arrive.</li>
            <li> This feels like real hair !</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t fit my four year old granddaughter or anyone else.</li>
            <li> As far as the quality of the wig, it is fabulous for the price.</li>
            <li> My only gripe is that it wasn&#x27;t able to work for my child because it didn&#x27;t arrive until almost a month after Halloween.</li>
            <li> It barely fit my eight year old daughter.</li>
            <li> My three-year-old was the happiest girl on the block and will be able to wear this for several years before it wears out.</li>
            <li> Very nice&lt;br /&gt;Many compliments!</li>
            <li> Elsa wig fit my 5 year old daughter pretty well.  </li>
            <li> Wig looks exactly like it does on the mannequin in the picture.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s exactly forma muy Dougther.</li>
            <li> Fit my 9 year old well.</li>
            <li> The short hair around her face would have looked way better if it was curled.</li>
            <li> THANKS!</li>
            <li> But it can really stretch out if you pull it apart the right way.</li>
            <li> The hair cap was nice but hard to secure on child&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> It is heavy, so be sure to secure it.</li>
            <li> She has long, thinnish hair, but is able to get it all up in the cap.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for your help!</li>
            <li> The color is more on light yellow than beige, not the same as in tge picture.</li>
            <li> The wig has a stretchy section in the back, so it would fit many different head sizes.</li>
            <li> The front &amp;#34;bangs&amp;#34; part kind of stuck out at an odd angle</li>
            <li> well, low and behold, it came two weeks before expected, and my daughter is THRILLED!</li>
            <li> Certainly doesnt look like the picture.</li>
            <li> Definitely seems a bit small for an adult but for a child its perfect!</li>
            <li> I bought a different one at first, one that was for kids, but the thing didn&#x27;t even come close to fitting my 5 year old&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re lucky enough to plan months in advance for whatever use you plan on putting it to, order it right then and there.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a pretty significant &amp;#34;widows peak&amp;#34; that I wasn&#x27;t really in the pictures, not a deal breaker by any means, I just didn&#x27;t expect it or think it was necessary.  </li>
            <li> the braid does look like real hair</li>
            <li> It was cut very funky and even with some gel and finesse I refused to wear it as it just didnt look like elsa.</li>
            <li> Looks real and just like the movie</li>
            <li> This way, that part of your real hair won&#x27;t show through.</li>
            <li> I ended up having to pay just about as much to return it as I did to purchase it.</li>
            <li> Very Elsa.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> so it is really my fault.</li>
            <li> Warning: this one is for girls or very petite women.</li>
            <li> The person fromDfunlife was very apologetic</li>
            <li> I have an average-to-small sized head and this was not even remotely close to fitting.</li>
            <li> High quality!</li>
            <li> Looks real like.</li>
            <li> It is to be adjustable but a challenge to get it to fit properly.</li>
            <li> My daughter is very petite and I bought this off of their review that it was adjustable.  </li>
            <li> Very high-quality and looks just like the product photo.</li>
            <li> This one fit her head, and had a elastic band in the back that you could pull to make the wig tighter.</li>
            <li> Much cooler looking than the crappy Disney kids brands ones.</li>
            <li> Also came with cap to hold real hair in place under wig.  </li>
            <li> This wig was spot on and looked very Elsa-like.</li>
            <li> The package did arrive early and come neatly along with a wig cap, BUT the wig doesn&#x27;t fit an adult head.</li>
            <li> Wow!!!  </li>
            <li> And...I emailed this company because it said I wouldn&#x27;t get the wig until November or early December to see if they could ship it right away</li>
            <li> Bought this for an Elsa costume and it was better quality than I expected!</li>
            <li> but I really wanted a realistic look.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not awesome: pretty ugly.</li>
            <li> This meant that the back of her hair showed a bit, but that was ok because it was barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> Much blonder than antipated, but my 4 year old thinks it&#x27;s great if just a little to big still.  </li>
            <li> This wig will last for many years of play and it won&#x27;t turn into a ratty mess like those cheap wigs.</li>
            <li> The top is super afro-y, but it fits my small adult head.  </li>
            <li> Is a really good product, problem is they run a little smaller than promised.</li>
            <li> There are some bare spots that show if the hair is not arranged just right or the wind blows.</li>
            <li> It was about $6 less than the Disney store Elsa wig and much better quality.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this wig as it looks like it&#x27;d be a decent halloween wig for Elsa.</li>
            <li> This fits a older child well.  </li>
            <li> Everything about this wig is decent...</li>
            <li> Decent wig for the price.</li>
            <li> but the thing wouldn&#x27;t stay on and didn&#x27;t look realistic because all the hair underneath was showing.</li>
            <li> This is for kids Doesnt fit adult heads properly..</li>
            <li> We also bought the same wig in the white color and she looks more like George Washington than Elsa.</li>
            <li> Was nicely combed out and hair felt thick and real.  </li>
            <li> I also plan on hair spraying the top hair down more because it get&#x27;s a little crazy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Large enough to fit a big head and very well made plus you cannot beat a $13 price.</li>
            <li> It kind of makes it look a little awkward, but overall it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d call it more like a 3/4 fall though, and not a full head wig.</li>
            <li> Also I did not like the way it came packaged, just in a zip lock bag &amp; then in a package wrap, they may have something to do with why the top was a mess.</li>
            <li> After reading many posts on this product I was expecting it to not fit at all.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the in store cheap costume wigs!</li>
            <li> This wig is is 100 times better in quality than the ones at the Halloween stores and costs much less!</li>
            <li> This was one of my 3 year old little girl&#x27;s favorite Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> (though I can&#x27;t tell you how tempted I am to just chuck it and get a new one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would actually buy more because if my daughter gets too rough with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In all fairness, she does have a lot of long, thick hair but still, it would be a stretch for an older child to wear it and look good.  </li>
            <li> But, the wig itself is actually quite pretty and very soft.....</li>
            <li> The wig will  make our event of Elsa visiting our office to take pictures near the tree!  </li>
            <li> On halloween a toddler followed my 7 year old around the neighborhood so she could trick-or- treat with Elsa!  </li>
            <li> The wig is lovely, although a bit on the small side.</li>
            <li> Other than that it looks okay and is only going to be used for Halloween, then in the dress up box it goes.</li>
            <li> Arrived early!</li>
            <li> I ordered it the first week in October, and it came last week!</li>
            <li> Overall, decent product at a reasonable price, but I wouldn&#x27;t order again.  </li>
            <li> This wig can fit a 6 year old or 60 year old due to its adjustable clips.</li>
            <li> so since I have long hair it all slid to the back so there was a huge bumb there  </li>
            <li> and it wouldnt fit over half of my head.</li>
            <li> you have to contend with 3 ft long strips of hair once it&#x27;s all undone, and some of the hair is 2 ft in length, so really, there is hair absolutely everywhere</li>
            <li> However, there is something odd about the fit.  </li>
            <li> They wrote back the same day saying they would try, and if I didn&#x27;t receive it in time, they&#x27;d issue a full refund.</li>
            <li> Fits my 8 year old, but too small for most adults.</li>
            <li> It can be adjusted up and down, so it would fit an adult, too.</li>
            <li> For my little shin dig it was just fine.</li>
            <li> The hair is a bit thick, but it was pretty easy to clean up with a little hair spray.</li>
            <li> seemed like the wig was too small, other than that, the wig was good quality</li>
            <li> --it was as large as it could possibly be.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are no directions how to secure or adjust it,for those of us not familiar with wig protocol.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I reccomend setting it on a foam head after you get it and back combing the top as it gets a little flattened in shipping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little big for my 6-year-old, but that&#x27;s ok, we can tighten it, and</li>
            <li> Having a hard time getting it on my grand daughter&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> But DO NOT get it for an adult.</li>
            <li> Christmas gift for young girl</li>
            <li> My daughter is 3.5 years old and wore it for Halloween.  </li>
            <li> the only reason for four stars and not five is that the front hair of the wig is big/tall, haha.</li>
            <li> This is not an adult sized wig.</li>
            <li> Gets completely disheveled and looks like Liberace rather than Elsa.</li>
            <li> and I ordered for an adult</li>
            <li> My four year old loves using this wig to be Elsa, the snow queen...</li>
            <li> This wig was purchased for my 5 year old and she loves it.</li>
            <li> Definitely needs styled, you can absolutely see the mesh.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the hair and the adjustability of the wig.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the cheap wigs sold at retail stores...</li>
            <li> but I have no trouble putting this wig on.</li>
            <li> Get this if you are looking to be an adult Elsa.</li>
            <li> My daughter is 8 years old and this worked.  </li>
            <li> It fits my 5 year old.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to go with my 6 year old&#x27;s Elsa Halloween costume.</li>
            <li> Fits my 4 year old..</li>
            <li> It fits my 8 year old whom this was purchased for.</li>
            <li> Fits my 5yr old daughter (who has lots of hair).</li>
            <li> I got it for my 4 year old to complete her costume.</li>
            <li> Looks basically like the picture but wouldn&#x27;t stay on my five year old&#x27;s head and kept loosing hair strands.</li>
            <li> My 10 year old loves it.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 7 yr old daughter to wear for Halloween.  </li>
            <li> Will work for an adult or a child.</li>
            <li> If you are thinking of buying it for an adult, you can probably make it work with lots of pins.  </li>
            <li> However, I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this product for an adult.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my six year old granddaughter and she did not want to wear it after trying to put it on her to see how it looks.</li>
            <li> Was bought to complete Frozen Elsa&#x27;s outfit.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my 8 year old daughter to be Elsa.</li>
            <li> Not itchy, and the hair is so soft.</li>
            <li> This wig doesn&#x27;t even for a 3 yrs old kid.</li>
            <li> Holding up for a 6 year old using it.  </li>
            <li> My child is seven years old and we couldn&#x27;t get it on her head.  </li>
            <li> Got the blond wigg an the brown for my 9 year old that loves the movie thought they would look cheep because of the price</li>
            <li> The braid is thick and soft, it is much better than the temp one we bought.</li>
            <li> Also, unless you pull the front hairline down, don&#x27;t expect full coverage over the front of your ears.</li>
            <li> I like the long braid that can come around to lay on shoulder but the top of the wig is a mess, like a birds nest.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not good looking enough for an adult although you can manipulate it good enough for a child</li>
            <li> My granddaughter is large for her age, so it should fit most little kids five or under if they have small to average sized heads.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it would fit an adult.</li>
            <li> Ordered another Elsa tiara and braid wig for my 5yr old daughter and it was WAY too small to fit even a childs head.  </li>
            <li> While it says it is sized for adult, my almost 5 year old could barely wear it.</li>
            <li> There is way too much of the short &amp;#34;bangs&amp;#34; and they go too far back on the crown.</li>
            <li> We purchased a backup long, white-blonde &amp;#34;pop-star&amp;#34; wig at Wmart just in case this Elsa wig didn&#x27;t arrive on time, but this one is much, much nicer.</li>
            <li> (My seller was nice enough to give me a couple bucks back, at least, just because I was so displeased.)</li>
            <li> (mine is hugely voluminous, but I could still tell that this wig would not fit properly even if I were bald.)</li>
            <li> The big problem is the wig lacks any real style, especially Elsa&#x27;s hairstyle.</li>
            <li> I purchased two different wigs from different sellers and they were exactly the same.</li>
            <li> The shipping was exactly as advertised, I bought it on Sept 21st and it arrived today, exactly 15 business days from the date of purchase and in time for my daughter&#x27;s Halloween parade, school party and Halloween, of course.  </li>
            <li> The wig itself is very pretty; however, it was too small for my four year old niece&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> My wife is a District Manager for a large nation wide retailer.</li>
            <li> While the quality is very nice, the weight of the ponytail makes it almost impossible for my child to wear.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The hairline on this wig goes really far back-</li>
            <li> I asked for a refund, and thankfully the people I ordered from (Kamo Direct) gave it back to me, but they did not include a return label or any information whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Definitely fits an adult head if anyone is wondering.</li>
            <li> (U can barely tell)</li>
            <li> So far, she was only wear it 2 times.</li>
            <li> The item came much quicker than expected.  </li>
            <li> Order came much quicker than expected.</li>
            <li> It had no depth to it and barely covered the hairline.</li>
            <li> Hairline is not very natural and the widow&#x27;s peak will need taping to stay down, but the braid is thick and overall the wig is good.</li>
            <li> Our five year old wore this for Halloween &amp; little girls were coming up to her &amp; telling her she looked like the real Elsa.</li>
            <li> The wig is a good quality, but is very difficult to put on and keep on a child.</li>
            <li> It seems heavy, maybe a little too heavy for a child, but does seem to be of good quality, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> A little large for kid heads, even with straps adjusted.</li>
            <li> Like other reviews I have read, the cap of this wig is very small and flat, not round to fit someone&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> Made for a good picture, but a bad costume addition.</li>
            <li> I would imagine it could fit up to a small pre-teens head, but too small for my adult head.  </li>
            <li> Hard to keep the hair in the front in the right place.</li>
            <li> I fixed the problem by pulling the wig down in front so her real hair and/or black net she was wearing wouldn&#x27;t show.</li>
            <li> The texture was very soft but it was cut small for the adult head.</li>
            <li> At least 90% of the Elsa wigs for sale are this exact same one--tons of different listings and sellers for some reason, but all the same photos and the same wig.</li>
            <li> like birds nest in the front and flat on the back.</li>
            <li> The product came quickly, but it is very hard to get the wig to actually stay on a head.</li>
            <li> The reality is, I probably could have left it exactly how it was and nobody, least of all the kid wearing it, would even notice or care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It took a little over a month to get to me from China which is normal, I am told.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t hardly take it off the first day she had it.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m hard to please ;)</li>
            <li> so they laid flat and could take the wig off the head.</li>
            <li> so of course it&#x27;s  going to be flat</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s completely flat on the inside no room for a head.</li>
            <li> it worked for a Frozen party  - just fits an adult and a little big for a child</li>
            <li> it was a little too big for my daughter, so we gave it to our friend that is a professional princess</li>
            <li> I really disliked this wig and really wished I hadnt spent the 15 dollars plus shipping</li>
            <li> Then only to find it did not fit my 4 yr old daughters head.</li>
            <li> I must have a slightly larger than average head, because it barely covered my hairline in the front.</li>
            <li> This does not fit an adult and should not be advertised for adults!</li>
            <li> But it shipped on time and arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> and it takes a long time to arrive.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It also takes a long time to arrive,as it shipped from China,but did arrive in time for Halloween.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> SAVE YOURSELF THE TROUBLE AND DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY.</li>
            <li> Took a long time to ship though, as it came from China.</li>
            <li> They were upfront about long shipping</li>
            <li> A++ for delivery as it arrived a week earlier than expected date.</li>
            <li> This item takes as long as it says.</li>
            <li> Also, this will not fit an adult.</li>
            <li> It also took a really long time to arrive.</li>
            <li> Darker shade of blonde than expected.</li>
            <li> However, the wig did not fit well on my 4 year old daughters head.</li>
            <li> Shipping was long long long!</li>
            <li> My granddaughter is a very small 4 year old and this barely covered her head.  </li>
            <li> Would definitely purchase from this vendor again for other costume needs.</li>
            <li> It was actually for my daughter and was a little big.</li>
            <li> Was happy with delivery in time for Halloween but sorry to say my granddaughter was unable to wear this wig.</li>
            <li> and it only means she can wear it for a few extra years as play dress up</li>
            <li> 4 years old only complaint is that the wig was itching his head.</li>
            <li> It is too small for an adult with long hair.</li>
            <li> Would be small for an adult.</li>
            <li> Small for adult head.</li>
            <li> It is rather small, even for my seven year old</li>
            <li> Then it was to small for a 6 year old head.</li>
            <li> and she has an average size head..actually smaller..</li>
            <li> Also, the front sticks out/pops up strangely no matter how tight you make it</li>
            <li> My 5 year old had some serious Elsa hair and was commented by several people.</li>
            <li> The wig sold at Spirit Halloween is nearly $20, for half the amount of hair, therefore half the quality.</li>
            <li> It has a small adjustment in the back, but with that it is still too big.  </li>
            <li> You can see the black net through the wig.</li>
            <li> The hair is very soft and thick.  </li>
            <li> The wig was very stiff and my eight year old daughter refused to wear it.  </li>
            <li> Evidently it&#x27;s only \\&quot;adjustable\\&quot; from &#x27;kid,&#x27; to &#x27;really little kid.&#x27;</li>
            <li> so was just s little bit big</li>
            <li> I like that it has the little elastic clip under the back to help it hold on to your head.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time putting it on my 6 yr old tall girl.</li>
            <li> - I got it for my 5 year old and it is hard to adjust.  </li>
            <li> looks terrible on lol</li>
            <li> Bought this for my six year old based on the negative reviews of the Disney version.</li>
            <li> only complaint (and the only reason I gave 4 stars)</li>
            <li> I spent on it.</li>
            <li> It sits on an adult woman&#x27;s head like a tiny hat, the braid sticking out of the back and hanging like some sort of weird</li>
            <li> I personally myself have a few tricks to making this work</li>
            <li> You can even pull a few extra pieces around your face to soften the edge.</li>
            <li> This wig arrived faster than expected.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t expensive, but wasn&#x27;t worth my money.</li>
            <li> Received it in Maryland on 10/27, well before the expected date and in time for Halloween.</li>
            <li> It kept slipping off her forhead.</li>
            <li> I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t arrive on time, but thank goodness we received it way before the expected delivery date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe there should be a few different sizes.</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t stay on my 7 year old sisters head because it seemed too small which is odd considering it is an adults wig.</li>
            <li> This wig looks nothing like the picture, the hair is very hard to work with, with some thin spots on the top where you can see the black cap under it.</li>
            <li> Upon purchasing this for my very small 5 year old, the order confirmation page said I wouldn&#x27;t receive the item until well after my daughter&#x27;s birthday.</li>
            <li> A little bit of my dark hair does show, but only beside the ears.</li>
            <li> The wig was very small, even on my eight year old.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t fit, for starters, the hair quality was terrible and when I had first opened the box, the wig had been flattened to the point that I couldn&#x27;t fix it.</li>
            <li> It looks grey though, just needs a little hair spray to keep the bangs in place.</li>
            <li> Nicer than expected!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely disappointed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the photo featuring the wig is extremely deceptive.</li>
            <li> I knew this going into the purchase (from other reviews), but bought it anyway because it was for my daughter.  </li>
            <li> When her company has store openings and other events</li>
            <li> Even my baby was disappointed and was ok with me to discard it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem like it will tangle like other wigs.</li>
            <li> Thank you for making such a quality product at an unbelievable price.</li>
            <li> There is only a small amount of hair line showing using a wig cap.  </li>
            <li> Bought it for my 8 year old and we had a little bit of a hard time keeping it on her head.</li>
            <li> Very rough job</li>
            <li> This product is the same cheap crap as all the others, definitely not worth a penny.  </li>
            <li> When I tried it on it was slightly too small and I have a smaller head.</li>
            <li> She does not have a big head, but it hardly covers her hair when I put it on.  </li>
            <li> Too bad the advertised wig cap (which was a primary draw for me buying from Setony) was not included.</li>
            <li> That seemed to be the only complaint about the wig--the size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Average wig.</li>
            <li> We will have to style the wig to try to cover her dark hair up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish I had read them before ordering...  Not worth it.</li>
            <li> and the wig netting is very irritable and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> kids did not appreciate being forced to wear it while I tried to pin everything on, and I had already attempted to use a ball, a big vase, a stuffed animal, and even a balloon to keep the wig somewhat rounded, but nothing worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The black net that my little Elsa wore under the wig kept showing because the wig was a bit small for her head.</li>
            <li> Highly do not recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Quite small, took very long to arrive.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not super picky</li>
            <li> Could not get hair underneath hidden.</li>
            <li> , so I decided to try it on someone with less hair</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically write reviews</li>
            <li> After waiting exactly 1 month to get it from China, sadly, it does NOT fit my 7 y/o daughters head at all!</li>
            <li> The worst part, though, is that it&#x27;s totally a mullet on top.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t your typical, mainstream wig.</li>
            <li> Just a little &amp;#34;poofy&amp;#34; and must be styled down to look like Elsa.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint i have is the wig I received has a very odd hairline almost like a vampire &amp;#34;V&amp;#34; hairline.</li>
            <li> but this one is a mess.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as full as the photo.</li>
            <li> These are definitely not full sized wigs.</li>
            <li> hair is thick and long.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if other people have this issue.</li>
            <li> need to comb and style front a little bit, it&#x27;s shipped in a bag</li>
            <li> just a little work and hairspray</li>
            <li> so my little one didn&#x27;t get to wear it.</li>
            <li> All the other wigs I looked at were so small.</li>
            <li> It also is a little small for my head, which I have an average size head.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheap looking at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was so stressful that I had to put some space between me and the hair for a few weeks, but its partly done, and halloween is upon us, so</li>
            <li> It did not fit my head.</li>
            <li> but this did not fit</li>
            <li> It does not fit well.  </li>
            <li> It is not comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Because the wig is on the heavy side though, it does slip a bit, but again.  </li>
            <li> A waste of my time and money.</li>
            <li> A few tweaks here and there and</li>
            <li> This wig is a little small.</li>
            <li> Did not fit my 5year led head, too small</li>
            <li> Combined with a less dense concentration of the long strands in the back, the thing is atrocious.</li>
            <li> I ordered in September and it came in a little over a week-- from China!</li>
            <li> I bought it for my 4.5 yr old for her Elsa costume and it was way too big for her for one, for two its insanely itching and for three it looks like a mullet with a long braided tail.</li>
            <li> Looks good,but my little Elsa could not keep it on her head,and complained it itched.&lt;br</li>
            <li> total fail</li>
            <li> but I have a small head, so i am not sure about adults wearing it.  </li>
            <li> : •It&#x27;s a bit small •Did not come with</li>
            <li> but i am not sure if it will.</li>
            <li> It just covers the back of the head, which is useless.</li>
            <li> that is runs EXTREMELY SMALL.</li>
            <li> There is no more wigs like this</li>
            <li> The wig is too small.</li>
            <li> Does not fit my head and would defiantly not wear myself!</li>
            <li> I will say it is small.</li>
            <li> I have a small head and wear childrens hat often</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;d like any portion, even a small strand to lay forward, you can see the netting.</li>
            <li> This wig is way too small.</li>
            <li> Not for adults-.vety small</li>
            <li> I was not able to curl it though.</li>
            <li> is it&#x27;s small.</li>
            <li> Not spectacular, it&#x27;s really heavy, hair is a little weird in front, and doesn&#x27;t stay on my daughters head without being pinned in due to the weight.</li>
            <li> Very small dissapointed a waste of my money</li>
            <li> retrospect, I would have to say this was a poor purchasing decision, which unfortunately led to numerous other poor decisions on my part.</li>
            <li> Item ordered late September and recvd 2 weeks after needed</li>
            <li> Not thrilled at all.</li>
            <li> but the description is not exactly honest.</li>
            <li> it was too late to get something else.</li>
            <li> I emailed a complaint but received no response.</li>
            <li> It is thick all over</li>
            <li> Its for a very small head</li>
            <li> It was very very small.</li>
            <li> Believe these reviews... very very very small..  </li>
            <li> However, be warned that it is for a very small head size and</li>
            <li> Poorly made, terrible fit</li>
            <li> Mine needed a lot of work with hairspray so it didn&#x27;t look ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Not a good quality wig.</li>
            <li> It does look fake so not ideal if you are trying to buy it for any other reason than a costume look...</li>
            <li> It arrived way earlier than the estimated delivery date, but still missed Halloween by 1 day :-(.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has a lot of hair and it&#x27;s very thick.</li>
            <li> If you think that&#x27;s hard, you&#x27;re wrong,</li>
            <li> all* of my hair, and that includes the hair that gets tucked behind the ears</li>
            <li> cause it&#x27;s way, way worse than you&#x27;re even imagining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not happy at all with the quality.</li>
            <li> Poor quality item.</li>
            <li> Not a great wig... save your money</li>
            <li> I was NOT happy.  </li>
            <li> sorry for lack of solution, but can at least keep you from making my mistakes .)</li>
            <li> This wig is very, very, very small!  </li>
            <li> Like I stated in the beginning, my daughter is very small for her age, and it still works!</li>
            <li> This product wasn&#x27;t bad but it was way too small for my six-year-old&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> Did not fit!!!!</li>
            <li> but I think Ill end up giving it to my niece who will find something to do with it</li>
            <li> Again, fail.</li>
            <li> My daughter was unable to wear it:-</li>
            <li> Soo frustrating!</li>
            <li> It was difficult to put on though.</li>
            <li> It would have to be well secured by Bobby pins, and I wasn&#x27;t wanting something that complicated.</li>
            <li> The wisps in the front looked cheesy and u couldn&#x27;t get it on.</li>
            <li> Not perfect</li>
            <li> If you want to push the bangs back, they lay awfully.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for something that looks awful, or perhaps you simply don&#x27;t care how your costume looks, then go for it.</li>
            <li> It was very poorly made.</li>
            <li> A wig is really awkwardly three dimensional, and when it is not on a head</li>
            <li> The blatant lie in the product information is disgusting, but I know it won&#x27;t be removed from the myriad listings for this item.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s adjustability worthless to me.  </li>
            <li> but I figured hooking the 2 straps together at the base of the neck kept them on.</li>
            <li> Horrible!!!</li>
            <li> Awful.  </li>
            <li> Horrible!!</li>
            <li> I would rather do without than deal with this crap!!</li>
            <li> It looked like a terrible toupee.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>
            <li> Absolutely horrible.</li>
            <li> Also, the Disney Elsa wig is terrible, - won&#x27;t stay on at all</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This fit my 8 year old niece&#x27;s head and hair well.  She has long, thinnish hair, but is able to get it all up in the cap.</li>
            <li> It was really nice and came with the cap that was promised. It was able to fit my 4 year old because you are able to adjust the fit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly how it looks in picture! It&#x27;s full and poofy! I haven&#x27;t tried it on my daughter yet cause she&#x27;s still at school. She&#x27;s gonna be so excited to wear it for Halloween though! And...I emailed this company because it said I wouldn&#x27;t get the wig until November or early December to see if they could ship it right away and they shipped that same day! It arrived 2 weeks before it said it was going to arrive! Thanks so much for your help! I would recommend this. It also did come with a wig cap thing.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s kind of big on my 6 yr olds head and the strap to adjust it doesn&#x27;t make sense. There are also some bald spots in the back but I&#x27;m not super picky, I just thought it was ok. It definitely looks better in the picture though!</li>
            <li> The wig arrived on time. it is a good costume quality item -durable. worth the price i paid.</li>
            <li> Bought this for an Elsa costume and it was better quality than I expected! It needed just a bit of styling, but other than that it was perfect! I bought it for my 9 year old daughter and it fit great. It is adjustable, that was handy!</li>
            <li> My daughter is so pleased with this wig! We bought it to go with her Halloween costume and it looks just like Elsa&#x27;s hair! It is great quality and I would recommend this wig to anyone! My daughter is 8 and it fits her perfectly!</li>
            <li> When i ordered this, it said it would come with a free hair net to put your own hair in before the wig and i did not get that.  The wig kept sliding all over my daughter&#x27;s head and wouldn&#x27;t stay in place even with bobby pins. the braid does look like real hair but i wish it would have stayed in place better than it did.</li>
            <li> I ordered this wig as it looks like it&#x27;d be a decent halloween wig for Elsa. I love halloween so I gave it a shot considering the price. I really disliked this wig and really wished I hadnt spent the 15 dollars plus shipping I spent on it. It was cut very funky and even with some gel and finesse I refused to wear it as it just didnt look like elsa. Certainly doesnt look like the picture. It fit my head okay but I think Ill end up giving it to my niece who will find something to do with it Im sure. Lol. Really wasnt worth it. But it shipped on time and arrived earlier than expected. Just dont feel like going through the hassle of returning it.</li>
            <li> i feel the wig could have had about an inch more of cap and hair coverage. not length. but the space that covers the head as to better cover darker haired people.</li>
            <li> The top is super afro-y, but it fits my small adult head.  It will go great with my Elsa costume once I tame the top to stop looking like a Bach or Chopin wig.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my daughter&#x27;s Halloween costume. I ordered this on October the 4th &amp; was so worried it wouldn&#x27;t be here in time. To my surprise this was delivered on October 20th (weeks before my estimated delivery date). The wig is beautiful! Part of the braid was caught on one of the hooks (that makes it adjustable), but I was able to unhook it &amp; the pulled hairs went right back into the braid. My 3 year old has a lot of hair to fit under a wig, but this one fits her &amp; all of her hair. I&#x27;m super impressed, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Horrible!!! When it arrived it had such an smell to it, I left it outside for 3 days to air. Then only to find it did not fit my 4 yr old daughters head. I ran to Disney store and just bought the crown and had a beautiful &amp;#34;Elsa&amp;#34; anyway.</li>
            <li> Could not get hair underneath hidden. seemed like the wig was too small, other than that, the wig was good quality</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and a great great quality for a child and beats others out there.  The reason I&#x27;m giving it a 3 is because it looks a little razor chopped on top instead of wavy on top and it takes a long time to arrive.  No where did it state that it&#x27;s coming from China.  Had I know I would have considered that prior to ordering since I needed it for halloween. Otherwise, for the price it&#x27;s definitely worthy, once again, keep in mind, if you intend it for a child. It&#x27;s not good looking enough for an adult although you can manipulate it good enough for a child plus you&#x27;d have to have a pretty small head for this wig.</li>
            <li> This wig was a perfect fit for my 5 year old niece..good quality.</li>
            <li> The wig is good quality. I would not give it a 5 star raging tho.</li>
            <li> For the price I paid the wig was fantastic. Everyone who saw it liked it. I had to style it a bit but after that worth the money.</li>
            <li> At least 90% of the Elsa wigs for sale are this exact same one--tons of different listings and sellers for some reason, but all the same photos and the same wig. The description always says that it&#x27;s adjustable thanks to a band inside of it, and will therefore fit adults as well as children. Well, the wig arrived with the bands open, unclipped--it was as large as it could possibly be. It DID NOT even come CLOSE to fitting either of two adults with smallish-to-average-sized heads. I put on my wig cap and tried it--total fail, so I decided to try it on someone with less hair (mine is hugely voluminous, but I could still tell that this wig would not fit properly even if I were bald.) Again, fail. It sits on an adult woman&#x27;s head like a tiny hat, the braid sticking out of the back and hanging like some sort of weird handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve got to now sell mine, and try to find an appropriate one. (My seller was nice enough to give me a couple bucks back, at least, just because I was so displeased.) I give it two stars only because I assume that it would be great for a child&#x27;s costume; it&#x27;s a nice little wig for the price. But DO NOT get it for an adult. The blatant lie in the product information is disgusting, but I know it won&#x27;t be removed from the myriad listings for this item. So be warned. Evidently it&#x27;s only \\&quot;adjustable\\&quot; from &#x27;kid,&#x27; to &#x27;really little kid.&#x27;</li>
            <li> Item ordered late September and recvd 2 weeks after needed</li>
            <li> Great dollar value!  I was pleased with the thickness of the wig.</li>
            <li> very fast shipment and great product thank you.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter is a very small 4 year old and this barely covered her head.  In all fairness, she does have a lot of long, thick hair but still, it would be a stretch for an older child to wear it and look good.  However, for the price it was nice - perfect for one night of trick or treating.</li>
            <li> Fits my 5 yr old Queen Elsa beautifully!</li>
            <li> Nice wig, but took 2 months to get to NC!</li>
            <li> So cute, was perfect for Halloween</li>
            <li> Nicer than expected!  Christmas gift for young girl and I am sure she will love it!</li>
            <li> good quality wig. love it also fast shipping</li>
            <li> Awful.  Dont buy it. Too big.</li>
            <li> The hair comes out of the braid almost right after putting on.  This fits a older child well.  Not sure if it would fit an adult.</li>
            <li> Looks real and just like the movie</li>
            <li> Everything about this wig is decent... The only complaint i have is the wig I received has a very odd hairline almost like a vampire &amp;#34;V&amp;#34; hairline. I&#x27;m not sure if other people have this issue. I am going to try to fix it up to make it work but I might end up returning it.</li>
            <li> Daughter loved her wig for Halloween. Fits my 7 year old fine. Would be small for an adult.</li>
            <li> Definitely was impressed on how good the hair was.</li>
            <li> 5++ great quality! You would love it!&lt;br /&gt;My six year old daughter have s lots of fun with it, fits her perfect! It&#x27;s really great wig!</li>
            <li> The wig will  make our event of Elsa visiting our office to take pictures near the tree!  Thank you so much!  Gorgeous wig.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for price! I would deff buy another wig from the seller. It was a big hit at the frozen princess meet Elsa party.</li>
            <li> I purchased two different wigs from different sellers and they were exactly the same. The wig was OK. Worked great for my daughter&#x27;s Hallowen costume and to play with</li>
            <li> This is a wig for a child.  My daughter is 3.5 years old and wore it for Halloween.  It works best with the hair sock that comes with it. Don&#x27;t expect it to fit well.  I purchased diamond bobby pins to help adhere it to her head.  She was 3.5 and thought it was great.  A lot of work for Mommy.  She did have the best Elsa hair in town tho.</li>
            <li> Much much better than the toys r us Elsa wig. The size is perfect for older girls and adults. My 6 year old wore it for Halloween and stayed on perfectly. I did have to pin it but I love how the wig is secured to a netting type cap so I was able to stick the bobby pins through the holds for a more precise, snug fit.</li>
            <li> After reading many posts on this product I was expecting it to not fit at all. But it can really stretch out if you pull it apart the right way. For my little shin dig it was just fine.</li>
            <li> looks great, fits great, my girlfriend loves wearing it and singing let it go to me while wearing it</li>
            <li> This was one of my 3 year old little girl&#x27;s favorite Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> When all the other little girls Elsa wigs didn&#x27;t fit because they bought the crappy Disney one from Target, my daughter was so excited because hers looks amazing and everyone LOVED it!</li>
            <li> This wig worked really well!  On halloween a toddler followed my 7 year old around the neighborhood so she could trick-or- treat with Elsa!  So it fit my 7 year old well, and I could wear it but I have a small head, so i am not sure about adults wearing it.  It does stretch.</li>
            <li> I think the wig is nice but you can tell its a wig. I wasn&#x27;t 100 percent pleased. I know it&#x27;s a wig but I really wanted a realistic look.</li>
            <li> Great quality, it has definite weight and length. My daughter really loved it</li>
            <li> Bought this for my six year old based on the negative reviews of the Disney version. Love this, it fits her head well, the only reason for four stars and not five is that the front hair of the wig is big/tall, haha. It kind of makes it look a little awkward, but overall it&#x27;s great! My daughter loves that she looks &#x27;just like Elsa&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Perfect Elsa wig. Fits very well!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is not an adult sized wig. We ordered the wig for an event and it doesn&#x27;t fit any of our 5 Disney Princess models. I&#x27;m extremely disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;The hairline on this wig goes really far back- the photo featuring the wig is extremely deceptive.</li>
            <li> The wig is lovely, although a bit on the small side. It fits me, however. Personally, I&#x27;m going to trim the bangs a bit, but they&#x27;re at a good length.  Pros: •As described •Color is perfect for Elsa •Good quality for low price Cons: •It&#x27;s a bit small •Did not come with wig cap •Requires extra effort to conceal all hair (explained below)  TIP: I&#x27;m having to pull back *all* of my hair, and that includes the hair that gets tucked behind the ears, so I suggest clipping up those hairs as well. This way, that part of your real hair won&#x27;t show through. Also I&#x27;d suggest investing in a wig cap, or making one with pantyhose.

            <li> My little sister is 6 years old and it fits perfectly.  She loves it!!</li>
            <li> OK, here I go. I ordered the wig and recited it almost within the same week of ordering! I was very impressed however, it is a smaller wig. It is very possible that this wig is meant to be for a child. I personally myself have a few tricks to making this work but i am not sure if it will.( stretching the wig) Over all, the color was perfect, it is pre-styled and needs adjustments for individual persons.</li>
            <li> Gets completely disheveled and looks like Liberace rather than Elsa.</li>
            <li> This worked much better for my daughter who is 6 compared to the one sold in stores.  The one is stores is for smaller girls so if you have a young daughter I would say the one in the store is fine.  I found this one to be well made and holds the shape just fine.</li>
            <li> The color is more on light yellow than beige, not the same as in tge picture.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t come with directions on how to attach the wig.  My daughter was unable to wear it:-(</li>
            <li> IT WAS AWESOME! AND IT FIT MY NIECE&#x27;S HEAD VERY WELL. I read so many reviews about wigs that didnt fit well. This wig fit very well. It was an adult size, but it was very nice quality as well.</li>
            <li> The product came quickly, but it is very hard to get the wig to actually stay on a head.</li>
            <li> Item had some issues with hair being all tangled, but patient and an hour&#x27;s work cleared it up.</li>
            <li> This wig is very, very, very small!  It doesn&#x27;t look like the photo. It just covers the back of the head, which is useless. If it was bigger and could fit an adult it would be nice. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Mirror of one from movie.</li>
            <li> It worked:) I added some snowflakes to the braid to make it fancier!</li>
            <li> Great quality. But doesn&#x27;t cover my 5 year olds head. And this is for adults!!</li>
            <li> Wig is great if its for a child. Im 19 and it wouldnt fit over half of my head. Should be advertised that is runs EXTREMELY SMALL.</li>
            <li> The 5 stars are from my grand-daughter, she loves it!  Didn&#x27;t hardly take it off the first day she had it.  Especially fun when her dad put it on and sang songs from Frozen to her (he&#x27;s a such a goof).</li>
            <li> Looks good,but my little Elsa could not keep it on her head,and complained it itched.&lt;br /&gt;There are no directions how to secure or adjust it,for those of us not familiar with wig protocol.&lt;br /&gt;It also takes a long time to arrive,as it shipped from China,but did arrive in time for Halloween.&lt;br /&gt;One reason I ordered this was because,for some reason,the wigs available in stores are tiny,even for normal 4 or 5 year olds</li>
            <li> Ugh! I was looking for an Elsa wig my 4-year-old could wear with the rest of her outfit. I&#x27;m a dad so I admit I don&#x27;t know the first thing about wigs but this one is a mess. I have yet to try to adjust it so hopefully once I do it will stop falling off her head. The big problem is the wig lacks any real style, especially Elsa&#x27;s hairstyle. It obviously requires some work &amp; product to turn it into the wig as pictured. Not thrilled at all.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t fit an adult it was for a child and I ordered for an adult</li>
            <li> My four year old loves using this wig to be Elsa, the snow queen... she puts it on with her gloves and dress and makes her best serious face... it has inspired quite a lot of comedy in my house.</li>
            <li> This wig went to Disney on time and has made many appearances as part of my daughter&#x27;s dress-up play for months and still looks great.  I took heed to the advice about sizing.  This purchase was an Excellent value.</li>
            <li> Soft and cute! Just perfect for my 5 yr old, it fit fine.  It does look fake so not ideal if you are trying to buy it for any other reason than a costume look... it also tried it on my head and it fit just fine...</li>
            <li> I have been planning an Elsa cosplay for some time now and I was quite excited to get the wig. I took a chance by purchasing this wig, it looks cheap in the picture and that&#x27;s exactly what I got; a cheap wig. It didn&#x27;t fit, for starters, the hair quality was terrible and when I had first opened the box, the wig had been flattened to the point that I couldn&#x27;t fix it. I asked for a refund, and thankfully the people I ordered from (Kamo Direct) gave it back to me, but they did not include a return label or any information whatsoever. I ended up having to pay just about as much to return it as I did to purchase it. I suggest you save up the extra money to buy a quality wig. SAVE YOURSELF THE TROUBLE AND DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY.</li>
            <li> This wig was purchased for my 5 year old and she loves it. It can be adjusted up and down, so it would fit an adult, too. It&#x27;s very well made! It comes with a hair cover to tuck hair into, which was an added plus!</li>
            <li> This is wonderful my 3 year old niece loves it and it fits her head just right for a child, she always have it on.</li>
            <li> Says it will fit an adult - I had a hard time putting it on my 6 yr old tall girl. Its for a very small head</li>
            <li> Its not a preety wig. But if you need to dress like Elsa. You have to buy it. There is no more wigs like this</li>
            <li> Decent wig for the price. Definitely needs styled, you can absolutely see the mesh. Also, the front sticks out/pops up strangely no matter how tight you make it so hopefully it can be reshaped. Fits like a hat and NOT like a wig. The color is really accurate though. Definitely fits an adult head if anyone is wondering.</li>
            <li> Great. I just got my order.</li>
            <li> it came really fast no problem and the quality was excellent felt like real hair.</li>
            <li> its okay- it worked for a Frozen party  - just fits an adult and a little big for a child</li>
            <li> loved it excellent material real pretty.</li>
            <li> I ordered both the Anna and Elsa wigs for my 6-year-old.  I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the hair and the adjustability of the wig.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on the cheap wigs sold at retail stores...you&#x27;ll get just that...a cheap wig!  This wig will last for many years of play and it won&#x27;t turn into a ratty mess like those cheap wigs. Thank you Anangel for a great product!  I will use this manufacturer in the future.</li>
            <li> fits adult and my 8 year old niece great!</li>
            <li> Looks cute on my daughter</li>
            <li> This wig is awesome! It is just as pictured and just needs some styling before you become the Ice Queen. Also careful while combing it because the top is a bit thin. Practice putting on the wig. I have a big face tbh but I have no trouble putting this wig on. Also, the shipping is awesome and the wig arrived a few hours earlier than the estimated time of arrival. ^^</li>
            <li> Small for adult head.</li>
            <li> it was a little too big for my daughter, so we gave it to our friend that is a professional princess</li>
            <li> The wig is amazing and really soft. It can adjust to your head.but my only problem was that the wig cap is a hair net so since I have long hair it all slid to the back so there was a huge bumb there  I would suggest to get a real wig cap because they hold better so 4 stars😊</li>
            <li> Great Elsa wig for little girl!  WAYYYYY better than any strip mall Halloween store for sure. It is heavy, so be sure to secure it. Im sure an adult could wear it too.</li>
            <li> I purchased this wig for my daughter to wear on Halloween.  After purchasing it, I realized the delivery date would be in November.  I contacted the seller and they said they couldn&#x27;t guarantee delivery before Halloween, but they would send out the wig right away.  It got here two days before Halloween so we were especially grateful to them for the quicker delivery. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wig is very good quality, but it definitely is a child size wig.  I knew this going into the purchase (from other reviews), but bought it anyway because it was for my daughter.  That seemed to be the only complaint about the wig--the size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, this is a well-made child&#x27;s wig.  I would definitely recommend it and I would definitely purchase from this  Vendor again.</li>
            <li> This product wasn&#x27;t bad but it was way too small for my six-year-old&#x27;s head. I had to try to pin it on and even then it kept &amp;#34;squeezing&amp;#34; off.  It didn&#x27;t last the entire night on Halloween. It was however a nice quality is the description stated. Maybe it would&#x27;ve worked better for a toddler instead of youth.</li>
            <li> The wig was very stiff and my eight year old daughter refused to wear it.  The front &amp;#34;bangs&amp;#34; part kind of stuck out at an odd angle and I tried to fix it with no luck.</li>
            <li> My wife is a District Manager for a large nation wide retailer. When her company has store openings and other events she has 10 to 15 employees dress in various costumes she has purchased to entertain the children with. I ordered this for her for one of the store openings and she was very pleased, it went along with the Elsa costume I also purchased.</li>
            <li> The wig is too small. It is not braided or pieced nicely like the picture. Only thing that is good is the color honestly. I would not recommend this wig at all...</li>
            <li> Average wig. You will have to fit it to yourself to look right, wig flops funny when it&#x27;s on. You get what you pay for. It also is a little small for my head, which I have an average size head.</li>
            <li> This wig is PERFECT! I don&#x27;t typically write reviews but I am an adult wearing this for Halloween and it fits perfectly and looks just like Elsa from Disney World. It&#x27;s not cheap looking at all. Get this if you are looking to be an adult Elsa.</li>
            <li> it was a gift for my great grand daughter, but it didn&#x27;t get here by holloween. the co. was very good about the problem and even thought it wasn;t any thing on their part offered to try and make it right.. she did get to wear it to school for dress up day.</li>
            <li> Did not fit well, very itchy, would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Loved this product!! &#x3D;) Worked great for Elsa cosplay.</li>
            <li> Granddaughter loved it and she wears it all the time.</li>
            <li> I gave this 4 stars, because the wig itself is rather nice. My problem was the size. I must have a slightly larger than average head, because it barely covered my hairline in the front. To the point that I had to keep adjusting it the entire time I wore it. This would be great for someone with a smaller head. It fit much better on my niece than it did me. But, the wig itself is actually quite pretty and very soft.....</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even fit for my 5 year old daughter .It keeps falling from the front to the back,there is no way it can cover the front of your hair . Very rough job .Doesn&#x27;t look like wig ,it&#x27;s just look like birds nest in the front and flat on the back. Horrible!!! I had to  throw it out.Even my baby was disappointed and was ok with me to discard it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the in store cheap costume wigs! The childrens costume wig went right into the trash when this arrived. Everyone keeps asking where we got it. Good quality.</li>
            <li> After waiting exactly 1 month to get it from China, sadly, it does NOT fit my 7 y/o daughters head at all! Soo frustrating!</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time and as described.</li>
            <li> Ordered another Elsa tiara and braid wig for my 5yr old daughter and it was WAY too small to fit even a childs head.  Amazon accepted the return and I immediately ordered this wig for my daughter to have for Halloween.  Delivery was fast and the wig was better than expected and fit perfectly.  My daughter was the Elsa envy of all her friends!  The quality was excellent and with the hair cap  as an added bonus we didn&#x27;t have to worry about keeping her real hair falling out from under it.  The quality is good enough that it will last quite some time and be a good addition to any child&#x27;s &amp;#34;dress up&amp;#34; collection.  The chin strap for it was another added bonus that allows it to stay in place on smaller heads.  It is high quality, unlike the first wig we ordered, and I would recommend it and this seller to anyone who needs satisfy the wannabe Elsa in their life with a great wig.</li>
            <li> Ok so for the price this wig is amazing quality! It is thick all over so your actual hair doesn&#x27;t show through and it is already pre styled to look like Elsa. I was extremely surprised when I saw how nice the wig turned out!</li>
            <li> This is a great Elsa wig! I cannot rave enough about it. Quality construction and tons of real looking hair make this a pretty and full wig.  I reccomend setting it on a foam head after you get it and back combing the top as it gets a little flattened in shipping. You can even pull a few extra pieces around your face to soften the edge. FYI- I used my Elsa crown to help secure the wig and it looked amazing!</li>
            <li> Very Elsa.  My 5 year old had some serious Elsa hair and was commented by several people.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. My daughter is going to love this.</li>
            <li> This wig was good for a one time costume.  My daughter is 8 years old and this worked.  It wasn&#x27;t perfect but did the job overall.  Good quality.  Just a little &amp;#34;poofy&amp;#34; and must be styled down to look like Elsa.  We pinned snowflakes into the braid for a better Elsa effect.</li>
            <li> The quality of this wig is really nice.  The hair is very soft and thick.  I can&#x27;t imagine it would fit an adult head even though it is adjustable.  It fits my 5 year old.  It was about $6 less than the Disney store Elsa wig and much better quality.  It arrived way earlier than the estimated delivery date, but still missed Halloween by 1 day :-(.  I&#x27;m not going to return it because it is inexpensive enough for dress up play.  I wish they charged more and offered expedited shipping.</li>
            <li> Much blonder than antipated, but my 4 year old thinks it&#x27;s great if just a little to big still.  Does not fit my head and would defiantly not wear myself!</li>
            <li> They sent a wig the size that would fit a 5 year old.</li>
            <li> Really good quality wig.</li>
            <li> Good quality, I wear a lot of wigs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no wig expert, but this seems to be a nice quality and fits my 6 year old way better than than the Disney branded wig.  Looks even better in person than in the item photo on Amazon.  Took a long time to ship though, as it came from China.</li>
            <li> I ordered in September and it came in a little over a week-- from China! That was awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not awesome: pretty ugly. Color is good, but texture is meh. The worst part, though, is that it&#x27;s totally a mullet on top. There is way too much of the short &amp;#34;bangs&amp;#34; and they go too far back on the crown. Combined with a less dense concentration of the long strands in the back, the thing is atrocious. The only redeeming feature is that the hair is really quite long, so you can sweep it over your shoulder for a good Elsa effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t want to bother trying to return it to China or find a new one, so I used some hair goo to try to style the top better. It helped a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, because I deluded myself into thinking I had a lot of time and manic ambition, I took it all apart, reconfigured everything, and have been sewing it back together. I do not recommend this approach. A wig is really awkwardly three dimensional, and when it is not on a head it&#x27;s all floppy and contorted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then you have to contend with 3 ft long strips of hair once it&#x27;s all undone, and some of the hair is 2 ft in length, so really, there is hair absolutely everywhere and now you have to figure out how to get it back on the elastic lace strips that constitute the cap! If you think that&#x27;s hard, you&#x27;re wrong, cause it&#x27;s way, way worse than you&#x27;re even imagining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My kids did not appreciate being forced to wear it while I tried to pin everything on, and I had already attempted to use a ball, a big vase, a stuffed animal, and even a balloon to keep the wig somewhat rounded, but nothing worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I finally got one of those foam mannequin heads, which helped a ton, because I could jab the pins through the hair and the cap and keep things from sliding around, but that only lasted until I had to start sewing and needed access to the underside. So then I had to repin all the pins so they laid flat and could take the wig off the head. But then it wasback to wrangling all the hair in my lap and it was getting all ratty and tangled and I was filled with self-loathing for even contemplating this whole endeavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was so stressful that I had to put some space between me and the hair for a few weeks, but its partly done, and halloween is upon us, so I&#x27;m going to have to reinstate a working relationship with this wig in order to get it done (though I can&#x27;t tell you how tempted I am to just chuck it and get a new one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In retrospect, I would have to say this was a poor purchasing decision, which unfortunately led to numerous other poor decisions on my part. The reality is, I probably could have left it exactly how it was and nobody, least of all the kid wearing it, would even notice or care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s your call.</li>
            <li> It will do. Not spectacular, it&#x27;s really heavy, hair is a little weird in front, and doesn&#x27;t stay on my daughters head without being pinned in due to the weight. Other than that it looks okay and is only going to be used for Halloween, then in the dress up box it goes.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before I bought this product, but they were probably all written by the seller.  This product is the same cheap crap as all the others, definitely not worth a penny.  It starts falling apart as soon as you touch it.  I should have gone with my gut instincts and remembered, if it&#x27;s made in China, they can keep it in China.  If you want quality, find something made in USA.  Sure, it costs more but it&#x27;s definitely worth the price difference.  I would definitely not recommend this product.  I would rather do without than deal with this crap!!</li>
            <li> It took forever to ship so I had to buy another wig. I ordered three different wigs and the others came in a couple weeks. They were upfront about long shipping so it is really my fault. But I think it took a month to get here. The top of the wig in the front is pretty sparse so we will have to use some pins. But the hair is soooo soft and nice that it is worth fixing. The braid is thick and soft, it is much better than the temp one we bought. It is for our drama team so we will get a lot of use out of it. Doesn&#x27;t seem like it will tangle like other wigs. It is definitely worth th the money just give yourself plenty of time for shipping?</li>
            <li> Very pretty wig that is worth the price. The wig sold at Spirit Halloween is nearly $20, for half the amount of hair, therefore half the quality. It was difficult to put on though. It wouldn&#x27;t stay on my 7 year old sisters head because it seemed too small which is odd considering it is an adults wig. Hopefully with some practice I can figure it out by Halloween. Still wouldn&#x27;t recommend for an adull though. Gave 4/5 stars because like I said it was great quality and looked pretty but the thing wouldn&#x27;t stay on and didn&#x27;t look realistic because all the hair underneath was showing. Could be my fault though so I&#x27;m only deducting one star. Still a better alternative to the ones sold at Halloween stores so I still recommend</li>
            <li> Not bad, better than the target versions. Overall, decent product at a reasonable price, but I wouldn&#x27;t order again.  Not as nice as I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Best elsa wig! Looks so much better than others we saw (and others said the same). Photographs great! This wig can fit a 6 year old or 60 year old due to its adjustable clips.</li>
            <li> This wig was perfect. A+ for look and quality. A++ for delivery as it arrived a week earlier than expected date. My daughter loved wearing it with her elsa costume. Very satisfied. Warning: this one is for girls or very petite women.</li>
            <li> Was happy with delivery in time for Halloween but sorry to say my granddaughter was unable to wear this wig. Like other reviews I have read, the cap of this wig is very small and flat, not round to fit someone&#x27;s head. If they could correct this problem it would be a really pretty wig. It&#x27;s a great color and has a beautiful braid. The person fromDfunlife was very apologetic and I was refunded and told to keep the item.</li>
            <li> loos like picture. need to comb and style front a little bit, it&#x27;s shipped in a bag so of course it&#x27;s  going to be flat just a little work and hairspray it&#x27;s perfect, stocking cap comes with it and my granddaughter is 3 so was just s little bit big but that&#x27;s what the make bobby pins for and it only means she can wear it for a few extra years as play dress up</li>
            <li> This wig says for adults, but it is definitely not for adults. I have an average-to-small sized head and this was not even remotely close to fitting. It looked like a terrible toupee. Made for a good picture, but a bad costume addition.</li>
            <li> beautiful wig! It looks exactly like Elsa&#x27;s hair...I bought this to go with my 6 year old&#x27;s Elsa Halloween costume. I read the reviews and bought it. Im so glad I did. The quality is beautiful! Definitely seems a bit small for an adult but for a child its perfect!</li>
            <li> Shipping was long long long! Was waiting for it what seems like eternity. I did it was shipped from China. The wig is okay , not high quality hair but for my 3 and 8 year old to dress up with their Elsa costume , it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Was exactly as described and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Very nice wig! High quality! My daughter is 7 and I can adjust it to fit her head or my head.</li>
            <li> My daughter she is very happy and the product is very good I am very happy</li>
            <li> Upon purchasing this for my very small 5 year old, the order confirmation page said I wouldn&#x27;t receive the item until well after my daughter&#x27;s birthday. I wrote to ask if it were possible for them to send it sooner. They wrote back the same day saying they would try, and if I didn&#x27;t receive it in time, they&#x27;d issue a full refund. well, low and behold, it came two weeks before expected, and my daughter is THRILLED! This isn&#x27;t your typical, mainstream wig. It&#x27;s made from something much softer, great quality, and fits me, but my daughter as well. Like I stated in the beginning, my daughter is very small for her age, and it still works! I would totally buy from this seller again.&lt;br /&gt;GREAT QUALITY and WONDERFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!</li>
            <li> While the quality is very nice, the weight of the ponytail makes it almost impossible for my child to wear.  It just falls off of her head.  It doesn&#x27;t do much better on mine.  It would have to be well secured by Bobby pins, and I wasn&#x27;t wanting something that complicated. This makes it and it&#x27;s adjustability worthless to me.  Bummer.</li>
            <li> Great wig but most likely won&#x27;t fit an adult.</li>
            <li> The color and feel of the wig is nice, for the price. It is rather small, even for my seven year old but we made it work. If you&#x27;re a handy hair person, try re-braiding the wig. I started the braid high up and made it looser and thicker, more &amp;#34;Elsa&amp;#34; like</li>
            <li> The texture was very soft but it was cut small for the adult head.</li>
            <li> Very nice wig, my niece loves it, it&#x27;s big and its identical to Elsa&#x27;s hair style.</li>
            <li> Fits my 4 year old.. Nice braid. This is for kids Doesnt fit adult heads properly.. Better quality than the ones you find in the US Disney brand..</li>
            <li> Arrived early! Fits my 8 year old, but too small for most adults. Much better quality than anything in our local stores. Very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> This wig looks nothing like the picture, the hair is very hard to work with, with some thin spots on the top where you can see the black cap under it. Not happy at all with the quality. Next time I think I will buy one locally.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gorgeous, and thick, it does a great job covering the brown hair underneath.  It&#x27;s a little big for my 6-year-old, but that&#x27;s ok, we can tighten it, and I think I&#x27;ll be able to use it also.  I have a bunch of cosplay wigs, and this is by far the nicest, and most convincing.</li>
            <li> Pre-ordered on Friday since it was out of stock til Sunday but shipped Monday. Since I am a prime member received it on Wednesday. I didn&#x27;t receive the wig cap. The wig came in a net and the braid starts from the very top. It fits my 8 year old whom this was purchased for. I don&#x27;t like how the front of the wig seems unattached from the rest so you can actually notice it&#x27;s a wig. Of course it&#x27;s a wig, but still could have been sewed on better. A fine purchase because it will serve it&#x27;s purpose for Halloween.</li>
            <li> I was so worried I would not have this wig in time for Halloween, but it came!!!! I ordered it the first week in October, and it came last week! It is beautiful! I am an adult and was so worried it would not fit, but it fits on my head great! A little bit of my dark hair does show, but only beside the ears. (U can barely tell) It was such a good price, and great quality!!!! I LOVE IT :D</li>
            <li> Not a good quality wig. The wisps in the front looked cheesy and u couldn&#x27;t get it on. Luckily I had bought another wig that was meant for Snow White and the Huntsman, and it looked gorgeous!</li>
            <li> This wig is a little small. Bought it for my 8 year old and we had a little bit of a hard time keeping it on her head. It looks grey though, just needs a little hair spray to keep the bangs in place.</li>
            <li> Amazing! This was perfect for my 3 year old daughter&#x27;s Halloween costume! I will say it is small. It did not fit my head. But it looks beautiful, especially for the price. It took exactly 3 weeks to arrive.</li>
            <li> Please read the shipping. This item takes as long as it says. Fits my 5yr old daughter (who has lots of hair). I think it looks ok but it is just for dress up. We also bought the same wig in the white color and she looks more like George Washington than Elsa. But she loves it!</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for with this product. Make sure to order weeks in advance because it does take some time to arrive. Some styling is needed, but it did fit well. The color was as shown as well. Over all a nice wig.</li>
            <li> This feels like real hair ! I couldn&#x27;t believe how well it is made. I got it for my 4 year old to complete her costume. Because it is adjustable, it fit her just fine.</li>
            <li> it is fine for a child .  I have a small head and wear childrens hat often but this did not fit</li>
            <li> This was great. I bought a different one at first, one that was for kids, but the thing didn&#x27;t even come close to fitting my 5 year old&#x27;s head. I ended up returning it and picking up this one, which was absolutely gorgeous. The hair is a bit thick, but it was pretty easy to clean up with a little hair spray. Would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> Will be giving this to my granddaughter for Christmas. very pretty.</li>
            <li> Poor quality item. Looks basically like the picture but wouldn&#x27;t stay on my five year old&#x27;s head and kept loosing hair strands. Not a great wig... save your money</li>
            <li> This wig looks and works great as an Elsa wig. Didn&#x27;t really fit my head, but fit my 5 year old daughter just fine. I like that it has the little elastic clip under the back to help it hold on to your head. It took forever to arrive though - ordered 9/18 and it didn&#x27;t arrive until 10/9. Overall it will work for Halloween and dress up play.</li>
            <li> This beautiful wig is just like described. It is beautiful and fist me so I know it will fit my granddaughter who will love it. Thank you for making such a quality product at an unbelievable price. I purchases another wig that was more expensive and it didn&#x27;t fit my four year old granddaughter or anyone else. It was very poorly made. But this is beautiufl.</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter&#x27;s Halloween costume. Fits my 4 year old nicely and easy to put on. Much better than most of the wigs I have seen in the stores. Styled more like Elsa as well. My daughter is beyond excited and can&#x27;t wait to wear it.</li>
            <li> The hair cap was nice but hard to secure on child&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> This was perfect for my 6 yr old Elsa.  Great quality and has held up well</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s a nice fiber for a wig. Too bad the advertised wig cap (which was a primary draw for me buying from Setony) was not included. Also, unless you pull the front hairline down, don&#x27;t expect full coverage over the front of your ears. You&#x27;re going to have to do a lot of work and styling to get the wig right. I&#x27;d call it more like a 3/4 fall though, and not a full head wig. The quality of the wig fibers save it from getting three stars. I&#x27;ll probably have to pull it back some and thread my own hair over it.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!  Will last forever!</li>
            <li> Gorgeous wig for the money very pleased looks real</li>
            <li> The wig was very good quality &amp; I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The wig fits like it should.  My 10 year old loves it.  There is only a small amount of hair line showing using a wig cap.  We will have to style the wig to try to cover her dark hair up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a concern of it reaching us in time, the time period I was given at checkout changed from 8-14 days to 14 to 28 days with an arrival date of November 3 upon confirmation, yikes!  Considering I placed the order on September 19th I was NOT happy.  but thankfully it arrived in plenty of time.</li>
            <li> This wig is even better then I had hoped for! The shipping was faster then they said it would be. Date was listed as Oct 20-Nov 3rd(which was fine because its for her birthday party..not halloween) and it came in the mail today! This wig is way better then the Disney Brand wig that they have out for the halloween costume and it didnt cost much more! If I ever need a wig again this will be my go to!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this wig and it is much better than any of the dress-up ones I&#x27;ve seen for children.  However, there is something odd about the fit.  I purchased this for my 7 yr old daughter to wear for Halloween.  She does not have a big head, but it hardly covers her hair when I put it on.  It will work better with the cap, but I have to wait to use that or it may not last until Halloween.</li>
            <li> As far as the quality of the wig, it is fabulous for the price. Will work for an adult or a child. My only gripe is that it wasn&#x27;t able to work for my child because it didn&#x27;t arrive until almost a month after Halloween. I ordered it in mid-September. The seller assured me it would arrive before then but I suppose things like these happen sometimes so I&#x27;m giving the wig itself the 5 stars it deserves. If you&#x27;re lucky enough to plan months in advance for whatever use you plan on putting it to, order it right then and there.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t show up until after Halloween so my little one didn&#x27;t get to wear it. We didn&#x27;t realize the seller we selected was shipping from  hong kong. It seems heavy, maybe a little too heavy for a child, but does seem to be of good quality, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Looks just like the picture on line. Perfect for Elsa dress up.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as full as the photo. Quite small, took very long to arrive.</li>
            <li> Is a really good product, problem is they run a little smaller than promised. won&#x27;t return because my very creative daughter found a solution.</li>
            <li> Grand daughter will love it.</li>
            <li> Well made wig! My 7 yo daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> Good quality wig, and the cap that comes with is great for keeping my daughter&#x27;s real hair out of the way. The color was perfect.</li>
            <li> Nice quality. Love that it is adjustable. Better than anticipated.</li>
            <li> This product arrived earlier than delivery date schedue, packed nice and neat.&lt;br /&gt;My 4 years old only complaint is that the wig was itching his head. So far, she was only wear it 2 times.</li>
            <li> perfect for halloween next week, came way sooner than expected</li>
            <li> This wig is very pretty at first. Until you begin to realize that it has been chopped everywhere to make the effect of Elsa&#x27;s hair. Also, this will not fit an adult. It barely fit my eight year old daughter. Given.. My daughter has a lot of hair and it&#x27;s very thick. Overall, it&#x27;s a great buy but the description is not exactly honest. I also received it in a timely manner. I was very happy with that.</li>
            <li> Having a hard time getting it on my grand daughter&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> Great wig for a little girl to be Elisa from Frozen. Large enough to fit a big head and very well made plus you cannot beat a $13 price. Very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Perfect for a child&#x27;s costume.  The item came much quicker than expected.  My daughter can&#x27;t wait to wear it for Halloween</li>
            <li> Very disappointed! Took for ever to get it. Then it was to small for a 6 year old head.</li>
            <li> I ordered this wig on October 8th. I didn&#x27;t  think it was going to make it here in time for Halloween but it did!!! I received it today!!!!! I couldn&#x27;t be happier!!! This wig is is 100 times better in quality than the ones at the Halloween stores and costs much less! It looks and feels like real hair!!! I will order all my Halloween wigs from this seller in the future! It&#x27;s worth the wait! I&#x27;m so happy with this purchase!!!!!!!!!! :-)</li>
            <li> Absolutely perfect!  Fits both adults or a toddler when adjusted. Looks like Elsa&#x27;s hair and the color matched great. My daughter loves it! I gave it 4 stars because it took forever to ship, so order with plenty of time before its actually needed.</li>
            <li> Ordered this the Wednesday before Halloween and got here in the promised two days. It is an exceptionally well made wig and stayed on perfectly.  My three-year-old was the happiest girl on the block and will be able to wear this for several years before it wears out.</li>
            <li> great quality, but did not fit at all!  Didn&#x27;t even use it</li>
            <li> Good quality. Looks real like. My niece totally loved it.</li>
            <li> very realistic and my grand daughter loved it for her costume</li>
            <li> This wig is made for a really big head.  It has a small adjustment in the back, but with that it is still too big.  The hair is going in several different directions and in some places you can see the wig netting underneath.  It also took a really long time to arrive. If you are thinking about buying this for a child...don&#x27;t.  It won&#x27;t fit.  If you are thinking of buying it for an adult, you can probably make it work with lots of pins.  But you&#x27;ll have to play with the hair to get it to look right.</li>
            <li> Very nice&lt;br /&gt;Many compliments!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter.  It does not fit well.  It is not comfortable.  My daughter wore it for 5 minutes and would not use it again.</li>
            <li> The wig itself is very pretty; however, it was too small for my four year old niece&#x27;s head. Shipping took over 30 days, but we did receive it in time for Halloween - with one day to spare. My niece was happy with it though and that&#x27;s the only reason I&#x27;m giving it three stars instead of two.</li>
            <li> Good quality, looks like Elsa.  A little large for kid heads, even with straps adjusted.</li>
            <li> Does not look this good on a real person. Hard to keep the hair in the front in the right place.</li>
            <li> For the price, I didn&#x27;t expect a $100 quality wig.  However, I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Elsa wig fit my 5 year old daughter pretty well.  I would imagine it could fit up to a small pre-teens head, but too small for my adult head.  It does have adjusting straps on the inside.  Because the wig is on the heavy side though, it does slip a bit, but again.  For the price.  I&#x27;m not too worried about it.&lt;br /&gt;The hair is thick and long.  And even when grabbed at by little hands it still looks great for play.  I would actually buy more because if my daughter gets too rough with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a pretty significant &amp;#34;widows peak&amp;#34; that I wasn&#x27;t really in the pictures, not a deal breaker by any means, I just didn&#x27;t expect it or think it was necessary.  I also plan on hair spraying the top hair down more because it get&#x27;s a little crazy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a great wig at a great price for the young ones.  4-stars only because it doesn&#x27;t stay on too well and I&#x27;m hard to please ;)</li>
            <li> This wig arrived faster than expected. While it says it is sized for adult, my almost 5 year old could barely wear it. When I tried it on it was slightly too small and I have a smaller head. It did the job and was cheaper than the Disney version for children.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this product for an adult. It was very very small. My 5 year old student wore it and it fit her perfectly.</li>
            <li> A lol on the yellow side</li>
            <li> Wonderful!!!! Our five year old wore this for Halloween &amp; little girls were coming up to her &amp; telling her she looked like the real Elsa.</li>
            <li> The wig was beautiful and the sender even sent it ahead of time at my request!</li>
            <li> It is to be adjustable but a challenge to get it to fit properly.</li>
            <li> It is good price but takes forever to get ( close to 2 month) if you want this for Halloween have to order before September</li>
            <li> Horrible! I bought it for my 4.5 yr old for her Elsa costume and it was way too big for her for one, for two its insanely itching and for three it looks like a mullet with a long braided tail. And since it took a month to recieve by the time i got it it was too late to get something else. A waste of my time and money. Highly do not recommend!!!</li>
            <li> The wig is a good quality, but is very difficult to put on and keep on a child. I bought this for my six year old granddaughter and she did not want to wear it after trying to put it on her to see how it looks.</li>
            <li> looks terrible on lol</li>
            <li> Not perfect - I got it for my 5 year old and it is hard to adjust.  No instructions on how to use the adjustable straps or put on the cap.  There are some bare spots that show if the hair is not arranged just right or the wind blows.</li>
            <li> The moment my 5 year old daughter opened the package, she was so exited to wear and made self of this great product.</li>
            <li> The package did arrive early and come neatly along with a wig cap, BUT the wig doesn&#x27;t fit an adult head. You either pick the front or back of your hair to show. It isn&#x27;t cut nicely either so the bangs and layers flair all over the place. It wasn&#x27;t expensive, but wasn&#x27;t worth my money.</li>
            <li> My daughter is very petite and I bought this off of their review that it was adjustable.  It does have that capabilities but didn&#x27;t fit right on her.  She still had fun.  And loves the wig.</li>
            <li> Wig looks exactly like it does on the mannequin in the picture. It&#x27;s a platinum blond braid. It fits my almost 5 year old perfectly without having to be adjusted. The quality matches the price. It&#x27;s perfect for a Halloween costume. It took a little over a month to get to me from China which is normal, I am told.</li>
            <li> Darker shade of blonde than expected. Order came much quicker than expected.</li>
            <li> daughter is very happy with this</li>
            <li> Real nice looking like real, very thick hair. My grandchild loves it. Was bought to complete Frozen Elsa&#x27;s outfit.</li>
            <li> The product is magnificent. Very high-quality and looks just like the product photo. Considering this was shipped from Tokyo I was impressed at how quickly it got here. Made my niece&#x27;s delighted on her bday</li>
            <li> Did not fit!!!! Very small dissapointed a waste of my money</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit right, and was never given the cap that is suppose to come with it.</li>
            <li> put it on my daughter today for school and it is AMAZING how much it looks like ELSA.. highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Ordered on 10/07 and it shipped on 10/08. Received it in Maryland on 10/27, well before the expected date and in time for Halloween. Looks pretty good, fits fine, and my 7-year-old loves it! We purchased a backup long, white-blonde &amp;#34;pop-star&amp;#34; wig at Wmart just in case this Elsa wig didn&#x27;t arrive on time, but this one is much, much nicer.</li>
            <li> Great wig, fits all size heads...</li>
            <li> The wig was very small, even on my eight year old. The underlying mesh showed through on the front, no matter how I tried to comb it. I emailed a complaint but received no response. The only good thing was that I received it on the early end of the window that they specified.</li>
            <li> Best Wig Ever! I can&#x27;t tell you how many compliments we got on this wig. I bought it for my 8 year old daughter to be Elsa. I used a few bobby pins and it stayed on her head perfectly. All the other wigs I looked at were so small. This one fit her head, and had a elastic band in the back that you could pull to make the wig tighter. (very nice). When trick-or-treating was over she took it off. So I put it on, and it felt great. Not itchy, and the hair is so soft. Everyone said how nice it looked! On a side not, I just went to Disney World and saw Elsa and Anna. This wig looked better then the ones they had on. I am holding on to this incase we need to use it again, because it&#x27;s still in good shape.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my daughters Halloween costume back in September . Halloween has come and gone and now going in the second week of November and we still do not have the wig!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Believe these reviews... very very very small..  I wish I had read them before ordering...  Not worth it.</li>
            <li> It is too small for an adult with long hair.</li>
            <li> Bangs cut jagidly, and all tangled before I took it out of the bag.</li>
            <li> This wig doesn&#x27;t even for a 3 yrs old kid. I bought for my daughters frozen party an I was to be the one wearing it an it wouldn&#x27;t even go on my head prod. Not even my daughters. It&#x27;s completely flat on the inside no room for a head. Unless you just supposed to pin it on like a hat.</li>
            <li> Nice size and well made.  Holding up for a 6 year old using it.  :)</li>
            <li> Poorly made, terrible fit</li>
            <li> Absolutely horrible. If you want to push the bangs back, they lay awfully. If you&#x27;d like any portion, even a small strand to lay forward, you can see the netting. The wig is the cheapest synthetic I&#x27;ve ever felt (and as a multi-convention cosplayer, that&#x27;s saying something.) and the wig netting is very irritable and uncomfortable. The braid doesn&#x27;t lay right, and the free wig cap has two holes in it.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for something that looks awful, or perhaps you simply don&#x27;t care how your costume looks, then go for it. Otherwise, save your money.</li>
            <li> WARNING - This may have free shipping, but it comes from China &amp; may take over 1 month - DON&amp;#34;t order if need for Halloween. Also, the Disney Elsa wig is terrible, - won&#x27;t stay on at all - so don&#x27;t go there either! sorry for lack of solution, but can at least keep you from making my mistakes .)</li>
            <li> This wig is way too small. My child is seven years old and we couldn&#x27;t get it on her head.  Also, although the quality is good, the hair is sparse on the sides and you can see the underside material of the wig when it is on.</li>
            <li> Not for adults-.vety small</li>
            <li> Perfect Elsa wig but wish it came with a nude color hair net instead of a black one.  You can see the black net through the wig.</li>
            <li> The wig it&#x27;s beutifull, great quality. An the view it&#x27;s exactly forma muy Dougther.</li>
            <li> Wow!!!  My 6 year old got amazing compliments on this wig for her Elsa &amp;#34;Frozen&amp;#34; costume.  It was so lifelike and very easy to style.  It didn&#x27;t hurt her head at all and she felt like a total princess in it!  I&#x27;m not sure of sizing for a large adult head, but it fit perfectly on her.</li>
            <li> These are definitely not full sized wigs. They are more like full toupees. It was great for the purpose of dress up. Much cooler looking than the crappy Disney kids brands ones. It&#x27;s not the easiest to keep on- but I figured hooking the 2 straps together at the base of the neck kept them on.</li>
            <li> Did not fit my 5year led head, too small and she has an average size head..actually smaller..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful wig!  I was a bit leery about buying this wig and having it shipped all the way from China but I&#x27;m so happy with it!!  The shipping was exactly as advertised, I bought it on Sept 21st and it arrived today, exactly 15 business days from the date of purchase and in time for my daughter&#x27;s Halloween parade, school party and Halloween, of course.  And just before I bought it, I checked in with the seller about it coming on time and he/she assured me that I could send it back if I wanted to which reassured me. It&#x27;s so soft and pretty, looks exactly like the pictures and mostly importantly, my 4-year-old daughter loves it!!  Thank you so much : )</li>
            <li> Loved the wig it fit my 5 year old great. Honestly it&#x27;s better them most at the store.</li>
            <li> Wig did not look like picture......but good for Halloween better then the disneys wigs....arrived fast but small packaged and smelled aweful.</li>
            <li> Wig was awesome!  Was nicely combed out and hair felt thick and real.  Also came with cap to hold real hair in place under wig.  A great value for the price!</li>
            <li> Got here super quick with two day Prime shipping and was PERFECT. Fit my 9 year old well.</li>
            <li> Wig came very quickly, in almost two weeks shipping from China. However, the wig did not fit well on my 4 year old daughters head. It had no depth to it and barely covered the hairline. I would not recommend this.</li>
            <li> I ordered the wig on Sept 25, received it Oct 24, which was plenty of time before Halloween. I did not receive a wig cap like it says it comes with. I like the long braid that can come around to lay on shoulder but the top of the wig is a mess, like a birds nest. Also I did not like the way it came packaged, just in a zip lock bag &amp; then in a package wrap, they may have something to do with why the top was a mess.</li>
            <li> very happy w quality of product, it is still a bit large on my daughter but I think we can make it work plus it gives her more time to play as she grows.</li>
            <li> This wig was spot on and looked very Elsa-like. I purchased a different stocking cap and used that one rather than the one it came with. The adjustable straps on the underside were great and with a few bobby pins it held in place nicely the entire time we went trick-or-treating. Would definitely purchase from this vendor again for other costume needs.</li>
            <li> This wig was okay. It was actually for my daughter and was a little big. It kept slipping off her forhead. The color was a light blond and was well made. I was not able to curl it though. The short hair around her face would have looked way better if it was curled.</li>
            <li> Too big and slipped off my daughters head easily, and it is adjustable, but doesn&#x27;t stay on easy. When the product arrived, it was smushed. I guess you get what you pay for though</li>
            <li> I bought this wig to go with my daughters Elsa Halloween costume. I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t arrive on time, but thank goodness we received it way before the expected delivery date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wig is phenomenal. It looks like Elsa&#x27;s hair, and does not feel like a cheap plastic hair wig does. For once, the price of an item is very fair in comparison to the quality of the product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint (and the only reason I gave 4 stars) is it&#x27;s small. The black net that my little Elsa wore under the wig kept showing because the wig was a bit small for her head. I fixed the problem by pulling the wig down in front so her real hair and/or black net she was wearing wouldn&#x27;t show. This meant that the back of her hair showed a bit, but that was ok because it was barely noticeable. Maybe there should be a few different sizes.</li>
            <li> LOOKED GREAT AND FIT WELL. THANKS!</li>
            <li> Good quality wig, but VERY poofy. Mine needed a lot of work with hairspray so it didn&#x27;t look ridiculous. The wig has a stretchy section in the back, so it would fit many different head sizes. Hairline is not very natural and the widow&#x27;s peak will need taping to stay down, but the braid is thick and overall the wig is good.</li>
            <li> Got the blond wigg an the brown for my 9 year old that loves the movie thought they would look cheep because of the price but NO they look grate love them I would wear them to a party looks better than the ones at the wal place! Lol</li>
            <li> My four-and-a-half year old granddaughter loves Elsa and was thrilled to get this wig. It is nicely made and seems quite real. However, be warned that it is for a very small head size and the cap does not stretch. My granddaughter is large for her age, so it should fit most little kids five or under if they have small to average sized heads.</li>
            <li> Great wig for the price. A few tweaks here and there and you&#x27;re on your way to being The Ice Queen!</li>
            <li> This does not fit an adult and should not be advertised for adults!</li>
