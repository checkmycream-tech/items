            <li>so everything was great from the purchase to the first use of this product!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best iron I have used.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite straightner.</li>
            <li>so I purchased it instead of laying out the $100+ for the authentic Chi.  </li>
            <li>Spend the money on the better flatiron (Chi, for me).</li>
            <li>I only need to run my hair through the iron once and staightens it perfectly!</li>
            <li>I love this hair straightener.</li>
            <li>how many times it fell.  </li>
            <li>I also love the edges that are covered with the plastic so that it doesn&#x27;t burn my forehead or scalp when I&#x27;m ironing my hair.</li>
            <li>This has got to be the best flat iron I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Best flat iron ever!  </li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>really works!!!</li>
            <li>Works good with coarse hair.</li>
            <li>I love the durability and how fast it warms up.  </li>
            <li>I am very well pleased with AMAZON HOUSEWARES and the efficient manner in which this order was handled.</li>
            <li>ordered it straight from HOT TOOLS !!!</li>
            <li>it came quickly and was well packaged</li>
            <li>Works well, heats up quickly, and does the job.  </li>
            <li>Got to say I love how long it lasted considering how many years I had it and</li>
            <li>Will NEVER buy another Hot Tools item again!</li>
            <li>I am thinking that is a pretty good life for a flat iron!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfectly straight and light afterwards.</li>
            <li>The larger plates seems to smooth my type of hair better than the thinner ones.</li>
            <li>My sister had this flat iron, and I loved it so much</li>
            <li>For the first few months after buying, it worked great.  </li>
            <li>Having used the Hot Tools product at a local gym, I liked how it straightened my hair</li>
            <li>This product is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Anyhow, it doesn&#x27;t get as hot after 15 years</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this hot iron for years.</li>
            <li>Love this flat iron better than any ceramic flat iron I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I love it because it has super wide panels and straightens wavy hair really well.</li>
            <li>The larger two inch is the best for long long hair with layers.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think it will get my hair straight.</li>
            <li>Not made very well.</li>
            <li>It was delivered to me in a very timely fashion though</li>
            <li>I have used both ceramic and metal and they all seem the same to me as far as keeping my hair healthy.  </li>
            <li>I have long, thick and somewhat to very, wirey hair and this flat iron works GREAT!  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I have gone through many flat irons since my last one broke in 2010.  </li>
            <li>This was the first I&#x27;ve ever bought off amazon instead of a major retailer.  </li>
            <li>I have used the original Hot Tools Flat Iron since 2000, when a girl friend gave me one for a Christmas present that year.  </li>
            <li>Love the bigger heating plate as it straightens her thick hair much faster!!!</li>
            <li>Love this brand, I&#x27;ve had for years, bought a new one (Same exact model) and the handle&#x27;s &amp;#34;bolt&amp;#34; (where you clamp down)</li>
            <li>With so many new products out and this being a somewhat older model it can be hard to find in stores and when it is available, it is more expensive in store than what I paid from this seller.</li>
            <li>This brand of flat iron is hard to find now a days, so I was stoked when I found it for a good price on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get hot, I would like to send it back to exchange or for a refund.</li>
            <li>and it is exactly the same...</li>
            <li>At one point in my teen years it was so hot and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sticking with hot tools when I replace her, now to decide if I get the same model or upgrade?</li>
            <li>I have very long hair and very thick hair and lots of it, so it is great that I can flat iron my hair a lot faster with the hot tools.  </li>
            <li>Next time, I&#x27;ll spend the few extra bucks at the major retailer and get a good product.</li>
            <li>Pieces didn&#x27;t fit tightly together.  </li>
            <li>I have not found anything else that works on my hair nearly as well.</li>
            <li>It came very quickly (even quicker than the usual amazon order and quicker than the shipping estimates) and did not require an additional shipping charge.  </li>
            <li>Well, yesterday before an important meeting, my poor Hot Tools flatiron decided to stop working.  </li>
            <li>For one I love how it&#x27;s not as expensive as when I first bought one in 2002.  </li>
            <li>Luckily my hair was almost done (and this thing gets really hot, so I was able to use the plates to sort of finish the front), but I am disappointed in the value of this product.  </li>
            <li>I bought this same model 15 years ago when I was in high school.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve dropped it countless times and it still works like new.</li>
            <li>Ive had other hot tools products before that have lasted years.  </li>
            <li>I am about to purchase this one but had to write my review on my previous experience with this exact one.  </li>
            <li>I also experimented with the Remington Wet 2 Straight ceramic flat iron</li>
            <li>completely gave way, I checked customer reviews, and apparently I&#x27;m not the only one this has happened to.</li>
            <li>little heavy but works really great.&lt;br /&gt;love hot tools</li>
            <li>If you have thick hair like me you will appreciate how very hot this iron gets</li>
    </ol>

            <li> If you have thick hair like me you will appreciate how very hot this iron gets</li>
            <li> This flat iron works just as good (if not better) than all expensive professional flat irons I have ever had.</li>
            <li> I had the same model for about 5 or 6 years and it only recently broke at the handle (the actual flat iron still worked).</li>
            <li> I prefer the width of it as apposed to the regular 1 inch flat irons.  </li>
            <li> It wont last long.</li>
            <li> This last time it developed a crack that my hair got stuck in and a few strands broke off.</li>
            <li> For me, my money was better spent on the more expensive iron that lasted 8+ years than the less expensive product that lasted just about 6 months.  </li>
            <li> I have used this model for years for long hair.  </li>
            <li> I usually get my hair done professionally when I have the time, but when I do it myself this flat iron helps to take all of the kinks out.</li>
            <li> but I had that issue with other big straighteners.</li>
            <li> Like the wide paddles.  </li>
            <li> but one went out after several several years of straightening my thick hair.</li>
            <li> And I have thick, coarse, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Twenty some dollars down the drain.</li>
            <li> So it is no good to me because you can&#x27;t flat iron  </li>
            <li> It did pull my hair a little</li>
            <li> If you drop it a few times it will start to crack and fall apart.</li>
            <li> I like the iron, but it was broken when it arrived</li>
            <li> With the expensive ceramic irons I have used in the past my hair has frizzed within hours!</li>
            <li> Sad story, but lesson learned.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy at all !</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s not nearly as awesome as I remember.</li>
            <li> Very poor construction.  </li>
            <li> TERRIBLE.</li>
            <li> I have the worst hair to try and straighten, just now the plates aren&#x27;t heated evenly after a decade of use and abuse.</li>
            <li> Give it some time to heat up and you wont be disappointed!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this flat iron better than any ceramic flat iron I have ever used. Leave see your hair with staying power! With the expensive ceramic irons I have used in the past my hair has frizzed within hours! With this my hair is straightened and stays that way!  If you have thick hair like me you will appreciate how very hot this iron gets</li>
            <li> My friend had this model so I knew it worked well. I love it because it has super wide panels and straightens wavy hair really well. I also experimented with the Remington Wet 2 Straight ceramic flat iron but I prefer this one. I&#x27;ve dropped it countless times and it still works like new. I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick and somewhat to very, wirey hair and this flat iron works GREAT!  I have been using this product for over 10 yrs.</li>
            <li> Best flat iron ever!  Gets the job done.  Like the wide paddles.  Great value for the price.  Buy this now.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite straightner. Works good with coarse hair. However, I have had to order several of these because the screw that holds it together keeps breaking.</li>
            <li> Item came in on time and product was as described.</li>
            <li> Love this brand, I&#x27;ve had for years, bought a new one (Same exact model) and the handle&#x27;s &amp;#34;bolt&amp;#34; (where you clamp down) completely gave way, I checked customer reviews, and apparently I&#x27;m not the only one this has happened to. The only reason I didn&#x27;t return was because I didn&#x27;t want the headache. Truly upsetting. Will NEVER buy another Hot Tools item again! TERRIBLE.</li>
            <li> I like the iron, but it was broken when it arrived - I rigged it back together to use it.</li>
            <li> I Bought this for my mom where she was using one of the 90&#x27;s and now she is happy with this one.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I wanted. I already have 2 but one went out after several several years of straightening my thick hair. So i purchased another...it came quickly and was well packaged so everything was great from the purchase to the first use of this product!</li>
            <li> I have the worst hair to try and straighten, just now the plates aren&#x27;t heated evenly after a decade of use and abuse. I keep it on the hightest setting and I&#x27;ve droped it a thousand times and still in one piece &#x3D;D been awesome and can&#x27;t wait for my new one I just ordered to get here</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get hot, I would like to send it back to exchange or for a refund.</li>
            <li> Sealing seam separated and warped so it will not go back together...  It&#x27;s the same model number Sally&#x27;s sells, but the quality of build has changed substantially over the years unless I unwittingly purchased a knock off...</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product, does what it says it will do...Must try it  really works!!! Great price and will work for you</li>
            <li> I had the Chi Flatiron from 2005 until earlier this year when it finally died.  Having used the Hot Tools product at a local gym, I liked how it straightened my hair (the temperature settings are great) so I purchased it instead of laying out the $100+ for the authentic Chi.  Well, yesterday before an important meeting, my poor Hot Tools flatiron decided to stop working.  Luckily my hair was almost done (and this thing gets really hot, so I was able to use the plates to sort of finish the front), but I am disappointed in the value of this product.  For me, my money was better spent on the more expensive iron that lasted 8+ years than the less expensive product that lasted just about 6 months.  Sad story, but lesson learned.  Spend the money on the better flatiron (Chi, for me).</li>
            <li> This flat iron works just as good (if not better) than all expensive professional flat irons I have ever had. I strongly recommend this product. I had the same model for about 5 or 6 years and it only recently broke at the handle (the actual flat iron still worked). That&#x27;s when I ordered this one and it is exactly the same...awesome!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t open it. Don&#x27;t think it will get my hair straight.</li>
            <li> I bought this same model 15 years ago when I was in high school. Its barely starting to die out on me. At one point in my teen years it was so hot and the combo of the heat and sticky hairspray caused my hair to melt. It was the under portion of my hair so it was no biggie. Anyhow, it doesn&#x27;t get as hot after 15 years and I payed well overs $20 for mine back then. I&#x27;m sticking with hot tools when I replace her, now to decide if I get the same model or upgrade?</li>
            <li> Give it some time to heat up and you wont be disappointed!!</li>
            <li> I have had this model before and it lasted well over 10 years!  I only need to run my hair through the iron once and staightens it perfectly!</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd order. I was getting this iron from Sally Beauty Supply until they stopped carrying it. I have not found anything else that works on my hair nearly as well. If you drop it a few times it will start to crack and fall apart. I always find a way to knock it around. This last time it developed a crack that my hair got stuck in and a few strands broke off. The larger two inch is the best for long long hair with layers. (Mid-back to waist length) I have never had any issues with the heating elements not working.</li>
            <li> I love this hair straightener. With so many new products out and this being a somewhat older model it can be hard to find in stores and when it is available, it is more expensive in store than what I paid from this seller. Happy with the product, and very happy with the price.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best iron I have used.  I am about to purchase this one but had to write my review on my previous experience with this exact one.  For one I love how it&#x27;s not as expensive as when I first bought one in 2002.  I prefer the width of it as apposed to the regular 1 inch flat irons.  I have used both ceramic and metal and they all seem the same to me as far as keeping my hair healthy.  I have gone through many flat irons since my last one broke in 2010.  Got to say I love how long it lasted considering how many years I had it and how many times it fell.  I have very long hair and very thick hair and lots of it, so it is great that I can flat iron my hair a lot faster with the hot tools.  I love the durability and how fast it warms up.  Can&#x27;t wait to purchase this again.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item for christmas and 2 months later one of the paddles does not heat up! So it is no good to me because you can&#x27;t flat iron  ordered it straight from HOT TOOLS !!! I&#x27;m not happy at all ! Twenty some dollars down the drain.</li>
            <li> It wont last long. Not made very well.</li>
            <li> This product was availabe through Housewares @Amazon.  It came very quickly (even quicker than the usual amazon order and quicker than the shipping estimates) and did not require an additional shipping charge.  I have used the original Hot Tools Flat Iron since 2000, when a girl friend gave me one for a Christmas present that year.  It began to lose its heat on one pad after 14 years.  I am thinking that is a pretty good life for a flat iron!  It is also why I chose to order the same product 14 years later.  I am very well pleased with AMAZON HOUSEWARES and the efficient manner in which this order was handled.</li>
            <li> Great experience with ordering and receiving this item.</li>
            <li> For the first few months after buying, it worked great.  It did pull my hair a little but I had that issue with other big straighteners. However, it just stopped heating after 2 1/2 months after I purchaed. Ive had other hot tools products before that have lasted years.  This was the first I&#x27;ve ever bought off amazon instead of a major retailer.  Next time, I&#x27;ll spend the few extra bucks at the major retailer and get a good product.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my daughter for Christmas.  Works great.  I have used this model for years for long hair.  Love the bigger heating plate as it straightens her thick hair much faster!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this hot iron for years. The larger plates seems to smooth my type of hair better than the thinner ones.</li>
            <li> Snags on hair, don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> Very poor construction.  Pieces didn&#x27;t fit tightly together.  Literally fell apart (into three pieces) after only two weeks.  In the garbage now and I&#x27;m on the hunt for another product.</li>
            <li> This brand of flat iron is hard to find now a days, so I was stoked when I found it for a good price on Amazon. However, it&#x27;s not nearly as awesome as I remember. There are gaps and cracks that my hair gets stuck in. I don&#x27;t think the last one I had was like that. It was delivered to me in a very timely fashion though so that was nice.</li>
            <li> This has got to be the best flat iron I have ever used. I have kinky hair and this iron works wonders after a wash and deep condition.  I usually get my hair done professionally when I have the time, but when I do it myself this flat iron helps to take all of the kinks out. It&#x27;s perfectly straight and light afterwards. I also love the edges that are covered with the plastic so that it doesn&#x27;t burn my forehead or scalp when I&#x27;m ironing my hair. Great product!</li>
            <li> My sister had this flat iron, and I loved it so much, I got rid of my current one for the upgrade! And I have thick, coarse, wavy hair. If this works on that, it will work on anything!</li>
            <li> I do like it was just what i had ordered&lt;br /&gt;a little heavy but works really great.&lt;br /&gt;love hot tools</li>
            <li> Love it!  Have used it for years.</li>
            <li> Works well, heats up quickly, and does the job.  My daughter and I use it still and I have had this for two years now.</li>
            <li> Works great love this straightener</li>
