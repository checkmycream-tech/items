            <li>/&gt;UPDATE - LOL!</li>
            <li>The best thing to do is go into your doctor&#x27;s office and have your skin tags removed there.  </li>
            <li>Worked GREAT for me!</li>
            <li>It does not smell good, it does not do the work, it&#x27;s just a loss of money!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell good but it works!  </li>
            <li>I am extremely happy with this product and very glad it worked!</li>
            <li>It worked great for me.</li>

            <li>I am so happy to have learned this.</li>
            <li>Just Amazing, this product make me very happy.</li>
            <li>Great Quality.</li>
            <li>Some times we win some times we lose.</li>
            <li>I have no clue, but I do know that in my case, it worked great.  </li>
            <li>had great hope in this produce.  </li>
            <li>Great guarantee, 30 days but takes 56 days for results.</li>
            <li>The seller did a good job of selling their great product to me.</li>
            <li>This product is also good for acne.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line it doesn&#x27;t make good on its promise.</li>
            <li>I agree the smell is not so good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping for good results.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and in superb</li>
            <li>Love it will buy again!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>I paid $14.99 at Walgrens and followed instructions for more tha a month -- nothing happened!</li>
            <li>Guess it would have been better to have searched reviews before I bought this stuff!  </li>
            <li>IF it had fabulous reviews saying how great it worked, I MAY have seen if I could have found something to mask the smell and given it a go for 6 weeks.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>It DID make my skin tags a darker color, so that was nice.  </li>
            <li>Okay sounds good, but the directions on the bottle say apply 3 times a day for 3-8 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Nice gift.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>My bottle came with a built in brush (kind of like a nail polish brush, it is attached to the cap).</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t wait till they needed their own birth certificate to try something.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what kind of \\&quot;plants\\&quot; they used</li>
            <li>I am using it now, will update with my own results.</li>
            <li>Also it has a very strong scent to it.</li>
            <li>The product is very strong smelling.</li>
            <li>Since my tag was on my neck the smell was very strong and caused headaches.</li>
            <li>I could not be more pleased!  </li>
            <li>I could not be more pleased!  </li>
            <li>The smell of the product isn&#x27;t pleasant but worth it!</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, it worked precisely as it indicated it would.</li>
            <li>It has a strong smell!</li>
            <li>If it sounds too good to be true, it is.</li>
            <li>Has anyone that knows they got the Nutrasil instead of Tag Away gone out and picked up some authentic Tag Away, and tried it?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like 100% skunk smell</li>
            <li>I love the results I got.</li>
            <li>After a couple more days I started seeing swelling at the site.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be using any more, because the smell is horrendous.</li>
            <li>over many, many weeks....</li>
            <li>is nothing more than a scam!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>You would do better using Apple cider vinager...</li>
            <li>now they are more noticeable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I saw how people said it stunk, and figured maybe that caused most of them to not use it according to directions, and maybe that&#x27;s why id didn&#x27;t work for them.  </li>
            <li>couple of more weeks</li>
            <li>The claim is that it take 3-6 weeks to work, or more, but mine started disappearing WITH NO SCARRING within 3 days.  </li>
            <li>It took me a while to get up my courage, but I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I am sure everyone has a different skin type and might have a totally wonderful experience with this product, but I will never use it again.</li>
            <li>as most &amp;#34;seen on TV&amp;#34; products, this does NOT work, have since found something that does,</li>
            <li>I have 4 skin tags, that I know of, and one on my neck I&#x27;ve had for many years.</li>
            <li>But it certainly isn&#x27;t a sure thing.</li>
            <li>Yep, I sure did.</li>
            <li>It seems to be doing good----and maybe it would do a better job if I could use it three times a day.</li>
            <li>I bought this product at my local Walmart for 15 dollars, I read many reviews after buying it (not the best idea).</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, no change at all in the skin tags; they continue to thrive :) -- and a one star rating is more than it deserves but there was no option for a zero rating :)</li>
            <li>My one tag on my arm is just as big..and just as healthy as ever...</li>
            <li>More faithful application?  </li>
            <li>More faithful application?  </li>
            <li>I love how it says it takes 3 to 8 weeks to work</li>
            <li>that so many people claim this product didn&#x27;t work for them.</li>
            <li>I kept thinking, \\&quot;maybe one more week?\\&quot;</li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t even realize it had fallen off until I went to put more Tag Away on.  </li>
            <li>A Q Tip absorbs most of it.</li>
            <li>I will keep using for a couple more weeks, hopefully there will become results.</li>
            <li>day.&lt;br /&gt;How many people would you find using this product three times a day ?</li>
            <li>Big whoop, it works AWESOME.</li>
            <li>but the smell kept me from being able to use it correctly.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>This product however, is mostly bunk.</li>
            <li>I know it could take up to 60 or more days.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s covered my most insurance.  </li>
            <li>There are too many greedy people in this world.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know whether or not it works because I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be able to reapply it.</li>
            <li>so I started putting more on and 4 times per day.</li>
            <li>Six more and still nothing.</li>
            <li>great product fast shipping</li>
            <li>I bought this online after seeing the convincing tv ad...</li>
            <li>OMG I would rather have 10 more sking tags than use it anymore.</li>
            <li>Much better than a trip to DR.</li>
            <li>This product is nothing more then a fraud...</li>
            <li>I had more than one person ask \\&quot;What</li>
            <li>then I can say, for sure....</li>
            <li>I was able to deal with the odor for five days, but after that it began to effect my breathing.</li>
            <li>I am more upset with myself then the product because I should have known better.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the discomfort I experienced was normal either.</li>
            <li>This product is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that for sure yet but not looking good so far!!</li>
            <li>I can still feel it raised ever-so-slightly, but I am TOTALLY HAPPY AND SURPRISED that it worked.</li>
            <li>This review will be very quick and painless - product DOES NOT WORK.  </li>
            <li>Make sure the area it clean before applying</li>
            <li>It dries up pimples very quickly.</li>
            <li>YOU GET THE IMPRESSION THAT THE SKIN TAGS DISAPPEAR VERY QUICKLY.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply</li>
            <li>This product produces a smell so strong that you need to ventilate&lt;br /&gt;the room.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, you can not leave your house with that strong liniment smell around you.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The smell is really strong.</li>
            <li>and I felt strongly like it was a scam.</li>
            <li>Its so strong that it makes my eyes water</li>
            <li>/&gt;THE PRODUCT HAS A STRONG SMELL</li>
            <li>This product seemed too good to be true when I first saw it on TV.</li>
            <li>truly didn&#x27;t think it would do anything for me, and when you do put it on it smells like a form of Eucalyptus, though quite strong.</li>
            <li>It smells really strong.</li>
            <li>Amazingly, I am still using that original bottle I purchased, so it has a long shelf life, and is a great value.  </li>
            <li>Amazingly, I am still using that original bottle I purchased, so it has a long shelf life, and is a great value.  </li>
            <li>but it was amazing for me, it did exactly what the ad said it would.</li>
            <li>QUICK, EASY, PAINLESS, CHEAP!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read many complaints about it and it certainly is strong (though it does go away rather quickly as the product dries).</li>
            <li>the smell if fine with me.  </li>
            <li>, I did not try this product, it may work fine, I don&#x27;t know</li>
            <li>So perhaps on really huge skin tags it might take longer?</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s really important.  </li>
            <li>I bought this in Walgreens to primarily deal with a skin tag that I had on my thigh that was about the size of a dime and would bleed a lot.  </li>
            <li>I think once you pass about 4 weeks of using it almost 100% as directed you will start to really wear on them and after this period you can kind of slack on it a bit.</li>
            <li>--I got mine at Rite-Aide--pretty cheap and</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s too much!!!</li>
            <li>Very useful.</li>
            <li>Making them more noticeable was exactly the result I hoped to achieve.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to give this a try</li>
            <li>Some homeopathic products claim to use a dilution, so dilute that not even a molecule of the original substance remains...</li>
            <li>Ok, first of all the smell.</li>
            <li>thing is, I live in South Florida and its been fairly warm here.</li>
            <li>Excellent quality, and fast shipment of product sooner than expected.</li>
            <li>The only good thing is the dermatologist removed a couple of moles as well.</li>
            <li>I bought two of these and followed rigorously the instructions for two full months.</li>
            <li>Save your money for a future trip to a good dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>I have almost a full bottle</li>
            <li>more then twice a day really bugged being nothing</li>
            <li>I used this produce as directed for 4 full weeks.</li>
            <li>I tried tag away as directed, two bottles, absolutely nothing nothing happened, gave them the benefit of the doubt and reordered two more bottles.</li>
            <li>If you read the guarantee it&#x27;s only good for 30 day&#x27;s, and they claim it takes 6 to 8 weeks to work.</li>
            <li>I have had no bad reaction to it whatsoever.</li>
            <li>No bad smell from my bottle either.  </li>
            <li>I quickly stopped the applications and had my doctor snip off the tags during an office visit.  </li>
            <li>It smells like rubbing alcohol and the scent dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>This wound up using up the product quickly.  </li>
            <li>, luckily it was on my side close to my waist</li>
            <li>I see a few of those with gerbil sized \\&quot;skin tags\\&quot; are venting their frustration on my candid yet honest review.</li>
            <li>However, if you have many or larger tags, you are probably better off saving your money and going to the dermatologist.</li>
            <li>Better to get professional to cut them off!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also pretty cheap.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very medicinal, &amp; so strong that I could smell it through my clothes, &amp; I was always worried</li>
            <li>I have finished one bottle and really don&#x27;t like the strong smell and NO effect at all.</li>
            <li>The only thing this product was capable of effectively removing was money from my wallet!</li>
            <li>I should have read the reviews first!</li>
            <li>but well worth the wait.</li>
            <li>There are FAR more than that.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d apply a fresh coat).</li>
            <li>Is it worth a shot...</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve done the right thing this time and given advice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s right,</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I was sent the right product.</li>
            <li>Right?</li>
            <li>The one on my hand which I got right away just took a couple weeks, so maybe the age and size makes a difference.  </li>
            <li>This stuff works if you apply it right.</li>
            <li>is it not working because I&#x27;m not doing it right.</li>
            <li>and it worked right away.</li>
            <li>should have figured out right there.</li>
            <li>it has a very strong odor similar to the muscle/pain rubbing creams.</li>
            <li>Second of all, they don&#x27;t tell you that it&#x27;s got a very strong scent that is so overpowering that you can&#x27;t use it unless you&#x27;re going to immediately take a shower afterwards.  </li>
            <li>I was all excited at first and better about remembering but after about ten days</li>
            <li>Do a cost comparison with your family doctor first, then decide for yourself if the cost is worth it.</li>
            <li>If I had known that, I probably would have contacted the manufacturer to ask how long it takes before you see any kind of results.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;100% Natural Plant Extracts\\&quot; but it has a strong chemical smell.  </li>
            <li>Used tag away as directed for three days and on the third evening I was able to wipe the tag right off.  </li>
            <li>it does not work as quickly as implied on TV, it also has a strong smell, it is not something you want to use and then go out in public.</li>
            <li>and they were big and many.  </li>
            <li>A real scam!</li>
            <li>I wish I would have read the reviews first.</li>
            <li>I should have researched first.  </li>
            <li>First day, put it on about 5-6 times.</li>
            <li>All this stuff did was smell funny.</li>
            <li>I had followed the directions and applied Tag Away every day, although not always three times a day, and it was a hot summer</li>
            <li>Many of them mentioned the putrid smell, which, oddly enough, I didn&#x27;t find all that offensive.  </li>
            <li>I used this exactly once</li>
            <li>I followed the direction and applied it 2-3 times a day after washing the area with hot, soapy water (or after getting out of the shower).  </li>
            <li>So be willing to pay up to $20 for nothing.</li>
            <li>I applied this product to them exactly as directed for about 3-4 weeks until I started to forget to use it sometimes.</li>
            <li>After about three to four weeks, the first tags started falling off.</li>
            <li>So obviously there are way more than 60 applications in this bottle.</li>
            <li>I used tag away for exactly 4 weeks.  </li>
            <li>I wondered if the higher temperatures helped the product to work faster for me.</li>
            <li>Freezing skin tags with a wart remover works pretty well.</li>
            <li>The product calls for daily use for 3 to 6 weeks, which I guess would be OK if it weren&#x27;t for the smell.  </li>
            <li>first of all, why would anyone need two bottles?  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off getting something like wart remover which does the same thing this was supposed to do and save your money.</li>
            <li>I put some vinegar on a cotton pad, used some first aid tape,</li>
            <li>I bet I could remove twenty five more tags of similar size with what is left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>had I done this first</li>
            <li>If anything my skin tag looks healthy and I have used it for 2 months plus on my second bottle...</li>
            <li>and I am consistent.  </li>
            <li>Used exactly as directed.  </li>
            <li>Larger skin tags would certainly take a bit longer, but I am confident they too would fall off if a person stuck with the treatment regimen for the recommended three weeks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was able to get rid of mine, with a regular applications (three times a day) of pure Tea Tree oil.</li>
            <li>regarding the \\&quot;it really works\\&quot; reviews...they are most likely company employees or distributors.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say 99.9% of the reviews I read or watched (which was a pretty large amount)</li>
            <li>Within the first 4 days, it had turned completely black (which kind of freaked me out</li>
            <li>I wonder, as I read the positive reviews from people that purchased Tag Away elsewhere.</li>
            <li>They need much clearer instructions than \\&quot;brush it on 3 times a day\\&quot;, they should tell you exactly what to expect.</li>
            <li>The tag had totally died and came off easily.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;to begin to see any results but may be strong enough for some people.</li>
            <li>only thing that&#x27;s changed is that I smell like ive been dipped in strong disinfectant.</li>
            <li>I only used a drop and the aroma is so strong that I&#x27;m getting a headache.  </li>
            <li>Tea Tree still is not very pleasant smelling, it is camphorous, so it has a very sterile kind of medical smell, and it can be very strong.</li>
            <li>I had a large skin tag on my thigh &amp; decided to try this instead of going to the doctor to have it removed.</li>
            <li>When started using had 14 skin tags, 2 large 4 med.</li>
            <li>I have a large number under each arm.</li>
            <li>Some are large and everything in between.  </li>
            <li>Tag Away worked extremely well and very quickly!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled to say this product worked great and my irritating neck skin tag turned black and fell off within 4 days of using this product.  </li>
            <li>Sadly right when I noticed a slight change, was when I lost the product and thus couldn&#x27;t use it for a week or more.</li>
            <li>I tried this on my sons skin tags 2-3 times a day for 3 months and absolutely NOTHING happened.</li>
            <li>Very misleading product....</li>
            <li>Look: homeopathy was disproven when we discovered modern medicine.</li>
            <li>You really have to follow the directions.  </li>
            <li>no change except for the bonus of smelling like straight tea tree oil all day.  </li>
            <li>I used it 3 times a day faithfully but did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>Still have the tags and now I have a very itchy rash which I would like to pass on to the producers of this junk.  </li>
            <li>Too much work you have to apply a lot doing the day.</li>
            <li>Too much money.</li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing for me at all.  </li>
            <li>and he says it really worked well.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t like the smell much</li>
            <li>I am near the end of my second bottle and ready to move on to something more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It says it takes 2-8 weeks and its been much longer.</li>
            <li>In the real world, it doesn&#x27;t work at all.  </li>
            <li>I used it for 2 months straight...</li>
            <li>Save your money and just make an appointment at a real doctor to have tags</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do much else.  </li>
            <li>Used this as directed for 3 weeks and it did absolutely nothing for my skin tags.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone trying to get rid of skin tags.  </li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing except stink when applied.</li>
            <li>I have seen and heard this much advertised product.</li>
            <li>I really want this product to work, but I have my doubts.</li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li>and then it got really sore</li>
            <li>Some of the reviews said they didn&#x27;t get the real Tag Away...</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>This stuff doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>in my opinion, absolutely.</li>
            <li>Absolutely does not work.</li>
            <li>If you want one bottle plus the free one (as advertised on TV) they try to dupe you and you wind up purchasing two boxes containing a total of four bottles.</li>
            <li>It smells very medicinal which makes you believe it works.  </li>
            <li>This product did absolutely nothing for me ,but take my money.</li>
            <li>Absolutely a scam.  </li>
            <li>The application with a qtip is really part of the mistique .....</li>
            <li>It really is pungent, it may work, I just don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s working fast for my mom.</li>
            <li>and it did absolutely NOTHING.</li>
            <li>Absolute rip off.  </li>
            <li>The product absolutely does not work at all.</li>
            <li>still waiting to see if this really works.</li>
            <li>YOU REALLY DON&#x27;T WANT A LIQUID APPLICATION.</li>
            <li>I used it consistently-3-4 times a day for weeks and absolutely nothing happened to the skin tag.</li>
            <li>Bought the product...found that it took multiple applications, for numerous weeks, to be effective.</li>
            <li>My review is full of information about exactly how this product performed for me, how can that possibly be unhelpful?  </li>
            <li>My review is full of information about exactly how this product performed for me, how can that possibly be unhelpful?  </li>
            <li>3Xs a day and Do Not Waste Your Money!!!</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m the kind of person who secretly likes a bit of skunk odor...or cow manure, so I&#x27;m probably not a reliable judge of what smells good or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this product has no good use if your having a problem with skin tag its best to go to a medical professional to have them removed</li>
            <li>funny thing is, they have a 30 day money back guarantee, but right on the bottle it says can take up to 8 weeks to work.</li>
            <li>This is a first time of using it and so far it seems to be working.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t think it was working on this old tag.  </li>
            <li>I am taking it back to Walmart for a full refund.  </li>
            <li>I have about 7 tags concentrated in a single area, and 2 were rather large, the others were barely even hanging off my skin (more like bumps if anything).</li>
            <li>If I could apply at night only and then shower it off the next day versus three times a day I may have given it more time.</li>
            <li>Go to WEB MD and read about their main ingredient Thuja Occidentalis</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s &amp;#34;just ok&amp;#34; because it&#x27;s not as strong as I expected and needed.</li>
            <li>Do no buy this product if you are looking to remove skin tags I recommend highly</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t have high hopes after reading the reviews here but tried it anyway .</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Two days later, complete success!  </li>
            <li>I have a rather large skin tag in a sensitive area.  </li>
            <li>But even that little progress took many months to achieve.  </li>
            <li>which pretty much means, the main ingredient, is not present...</li>
            <li>Honestly, it was hardly noticeable at all.</li>
            <li>It does have a strong smell, but not to me as pungent as some of the other reviewers have said.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand the bad reviews, it worked perfectly for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I kept telling myself it was normal).</li>
            <li>It does take time and daily application, but for me, it was totally worth the effort.  </li>
            <li>It does take time and daily application, but for me, it was totally worth the effort.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, my husband tied a piece of floss on it first but the floss began to dig into my skin, so I bought Tag Away at Walgreens for $14.99, I figured I am only out that much if it didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>pretty much just while I slept or when I was home and not in public (since it was on my neck)</li>
            <li>, I am willing to bet that most negative reviewers either didn&#x27;t follow the instructions, or were expecting a miracle.</li>
            <li>and I think there are a few more.</li>
            <li>It has such a strong odor to it ,that you need only apply it at night or your friends will probably ridicule the smell.</li>
            <li>It only took 5 1/2 weeks, and honestly I didn&#x27;t think it was doing anything but making it worse because my tag got swollen and red for most of the time</li>
            <li>The little tag skin does not have nerve endings I have been told, and I found it to be pretty much true.  </li>
            <li>and then I put it in a new spot between my breasts and I</li>
            <li>Having used a whole bottle of Tag Away on four different areas on face and arms, absolutely nothing happened.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, I think it smells rather natural and fresh, sort of like pine or cedar essential oil.</li>
            <li>natural and fresh, sort of like pine or cedar essential oil.</li>
            <li>I tried this stuff for a tag that was in a very sensitive place on my body.  </li>
            <li>I did think it was a little pricey at first, but now I realize there is pretty much a lifetime supply of it in the bottle.</li>
            <li>Normally I&#x27;d write a jokey, sarcastic review but claiming homoeopathy to work is bellow me.</li>
            <li>I used this product exactly as specified for three months and my one and only skin tag FLOURISHED.  </li>
            <li>I was pretty much only putting it on when I got out of the shower.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li>At first, I didn&#x27;t notice any change but after about a week, I started seeing the skin tag get a bit smaller and stop bleeding.  </li>
            <li>Skin tags look, feel, EXACTLY the same.  </li>
            <li>In fact, I have felt foolish over the past months for continuing to apply it in the hopes that it will magically have an effect at some point.</li>
            <li>I used the second bottle on looks EXACTLY like it did in the beginning.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend using a Tea Tree balm or salve, as it is generally thicker, so it may not need to be applied quite as much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why this didn&#x27;t work for so many...</li>
            <li>If I could get past the smell, I could apply Tag Away more often.</li>
            <li>The tags don&#x27;t look any different from when I first started.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It stayed exactly the same.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does have a strong, campho-like medicine smell when it goes on, but I certainly don&#x27;t consider this to be offensive, at least not to normal humans.</li>
            <li>The only problem is the pain, but it doesn&#x27;t last more than a day, and at least it&#x27;s not a constant 3 times per day thing for six weeks or more without results.</li>
            <li>I think the Tag Away did irritate my skin because I experienced some itching and a minor sharp pain, like being pricked with a pin, but the pain didn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li>The only earthly reason I can imagine there would be positive reviews for this product</li>
            <li>On TV, especially in commercials, ad people always try to make the product look good; in this case, they made it look like this product gets rid of those dumb &amp;#34;skin tags&amp;#34; within days.  </li>
            <li>applied it to a rather large skin tag under my left arm, three times per day, for seven weeks.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, I think anything that would seriously dry out your skin would work, perhaps even alcohol if used regularly on the same skin tag would offer similar results.</li>
            <li>The tag is gone in an instant and the pain is just kind of a little tiny sting.  </li>
            <li>Liquid\\&quot; and 100% natural.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s essentially &#x27;shrunk&#x27; and you really can&#x27;t even notice that it was ever there.</li>
            <li>Tie a length of white thread around your tag and gently tighten it each day until it dries up and falls off.</li>
            <li>so I sweated it off frequently.  </li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m using some Dr Scholl&#x27;s fast acting wart gel.  </li>
            <li>The product worked, my skin tag is completely gone, but I had no idea what to expect from the directions.</li>
            <li>but I have not seen any noticeable effects yet - since it is probably too early to tell.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money....</li>
            <li>So far it doesn&#x27;t seem to have any effect on the skin tags.</li>
            <li>and you will have accomplished the same thing...nothing!</li>
            <li>Save your money and time, just see a professional.</li>
            <li>Well i developed a method.</li>
            <li>But this stuff works really well on removing the smaller tags.</li>
            <li>I am here taking the time out of my busy life to write a review in hopes that people will see it and know that this product DOES work.</li>
            <li>Instead, see a doctor and have skin tags professionally removed.</li>
            <li>It will be taken straight back to wally mart on the morning...</li>
            <li>Does not work at all... do not waste your money</li>
            <li>Do not waste your time and money or get your hopes up for this product.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this on appx one quarter of the surface of my neck and throat three times a day for almost four weeks (and I really slather it on), and I have only used up about 1/8 of the contents on my 15ml bottle.</li>
            <li>However, if you are sensitive to smells or don&#x27;t like the scent of a tree, that could be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the skin tags I used this product on are now completely gone.  </li>
            <li>I am ready to wear low necked tops for summer with no self consciousness!  </li>
            <li>I am glad I gave this product a try despite all the negative reviews.  </li>

            <li>I am glad I gave this product a try despite all the negative reviews.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that this works.</li>
            <li>do not waste your money.  </li>
            <li>Been using for 5 weeks and so far has not worked at all.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>Personally, I didn&#x27;t find it that objectionable, sort of like a really pungent pine or cedar.</li>
            <li>I used it for the entire 2 month time and it did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>When friends have asked me how it works, I have told them do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>I was pleasently surprised as I&#x27;ve never tried anything like this before.</li>
            <li>Within the first two days, I could feel/see it start to dry out.</li>
            <li>I used it on 3 areas at first, and finally decided to focus on only one skin tag to see if I could create a productive result.  </li>
            <li>I purchased Tag Away 4 weeks ago and have applied it to 3 different skin tags 3 times a day for the last 4 weeks straight!</li>
            <li>However, anyone who discovers they don&#x27;t have the required self-discipline and patience could certainly use this as an excuse to complain and give up.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for getting rid of a couple of skin tags of various sizes.  </li>
            <li>I would not waste my money, especially with a seller who does not care about you once your purchase is complete!  </li>
            <li>It did not remove or diminish my skin tags, but only made them more noticeable by highlighting them with dark red splotches that crept up my entire neck.  </li>
            <li>It has Works for both skin tags and a NEW skin-colored mole that suddenly appeared.</li>
            <li>Then you won&#x27;t feel a need to discourage others by posting a scathing, critical review of this great product here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really was looking forward to getting this because it is so much more expensive to get this issue taken care of at the doctor, but after I got this</li>
            <li>My neck was full of tiny little tags.  </li>
            <li>spent 30 bucks and put two whole bottles on ONE skin tag, and its still there.</li>
            <li>I could barely stand it myself at home.</li>
            <li>I bought this directly from the company and got a discount on a second bottle.</li>
            <li>I eventually found it and have barely even been using it as directed.</li>
            <li>I have used it for one full month on one small tag on my neck.  </li>
            <li>You can easily call this a scam product that has enormous negative feedback.</li>
            <li>is that those people are receiving money for writing positive product reviews, and if that is the case, they should be ashamed of themselves for aiding in misleading people to spend good money on a worthless product.  </li>
            <li>It first starts to shrivel, then turn black and then falls off.  </li>
            <li>smells to high heaven, didn&#x27;t use long enough to get any results</li>
            <li>Not a single skin tag has fallen off.  </li>
            <li>My first experience was with the original product which had you tough the tag up basically with an empty board be for applying it.</li>
            <li>I have used one complete bottle and about a third of the second.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint would be that there is a slight odor to it, but considering how effective it dealt with that tag, I&#x27;m not even going to consider it in the rating.</li>
            <li>I was willing to try it a little longer</li>
            <li>Now I wouldn&#x27;t say they fell of totally painlessly, but they did come off, usually when I was washing the area they would catch on the wash cloth and pull off, with a quick pinprick of pain and some redness.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They got really irritated to the point where I snipped one with nail clippers and later pulled the other off with my nails.</li>
            <li>I bought this product and used it religiously according to the product directions for several months to try to remove a 3/8\\&quot; diameter skin tag near my left clavicle.  </li>
            <li>I could bare the smell if only it worked.</li>
            <li>As of today the whole thing is black and I assume it will fall off soon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think the only reason it has any success at all, is that it contains some amount of tea tree, it also has several other ingredients that there is no logical reason to assume would work for a skin tag, and the &amp;#34;main ingredient&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I had a large skin tag under my arm for years and it completely dried up and fell off within 2weeks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Though a few probably had hypersensitive bloodhound nostrils and just couldn&#x27;t take the smell, (my wife certainly falls into this category)</li>
            <li>My summary of this product is too little results from too much investment in time to apply.</li>
            <li>this stuff is not worth the high price you will pay for the junk...</li>
            <li>They just dried up, turned black, and fell right off completely and painlessly.</li>
            <li>As with most of the products of this kind advertised on TV they prey on people and give them false hope and bad info.</li>

            <li> Worked GREAT for me!</li>
            <li> It does not smell good, it does not do the work, it&#x27;s just a loss of money!</li>

            <li> Just Amazing, this product make me very happy.</li>

            <li> Some times we win some times we lose.</li>
            <li> I have no clue, but I do know that in my case, it worked great.  </li>
            <li> had great hope in this produce.  </li>
            <li> Great guarantee, 30 days but takes 56 days for results.</li>
            <li> The seller did a good job of selling their great product to me.</li>
            <li> This product is also good for acne.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line it doesn&#x27;t make good on its promise.</li>
            <li> I agree the smell is not so good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping for good results.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and in superb</li>
            <li> Love it will buy again!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> I paid $14.99 at Walgrens and followed instructions for more tha a month -- nothing happened!</li>
            <li> Guess it would have been better to have searched reviews before I bought this stuff!  </li>
            <li> IF it had fabulous reviews saying how great it worked, I MAY have seen if I could have found something to mask the smell and given it a go for 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> It DID make my skin tags a darker color, so that was nice.  </li>
            <li> Okay sounds good, but the directions on the bottle say apply 3 times a day for 3-8 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Nice gift.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> My bottle came with a built in brush (kind of like a nail polish brush, it is attached to the cap).</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t wait till they needed their own birth certificate to try something.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what kind of \\&quot;plants\\&quot; they used</li>
            <li> I am using it now, will update with my own results.</li>
            <li> Also it has a very strong scent to it.</li>
            <li> The product is very strong smelling.</li>
            <li> Since my tag was on my neck the smell was very strong and caused headaches.</li>
            <li> I could not be more pleased!  </li>
            <li> I could not be more pleased!  </li>
            <li> The smell of the product isn&#x27;t pleasant but worth it!</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, it worked precisely as it indicated it would.</li>
            <li> It has a strong smell!</li>
            <li> If it sounds too good to be true, it is.</li>
            <li> Has anyone that knows they got the Nutrasil instead of Tag Away gone out and picked up some authentic Tag Away, and tried it?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like 100% skunk smell</li>
            <li> I love the results I got.</li>
            <li> After a couple more days I started seeing swelling at the site.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be using any more, because the smell is horrendous.</li>
            <li> over many, many weeks....</li>
            <li> is nothing more than a scam!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You would do better using Apple cider vinager...</li>
            <li> now they are more noticeable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I saw how people said it stunk, and figured maybe that caused most of them to not use it according to directions, and maybe that&#x27;s why id didn&#x27;t work for them.  </li>
            <li> couple of more weeks</li>
            <li> The claim is that it take 3-6 weeks to work, or more, but mine started disappearing WITH NO SCARRING within 3 days.  </li>
            <li> It took me a while to get up my courage, but I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> I am sure everyone has a different skin type and might have a totally wonderful experience with this product, but I will never use it again.</li>
            <li> as most &amp;#34;seen on TV&amp;#34; products, this does NOT work, have since found something that does,</li>
            <li> I have 4 skin tags, that I know of, and one on my neck I&#x27;ve had for many years.</li>
            <li> But it certainly isn&#x27;t a sure thing.</li>
            <li> Yep, I sure did.</li>
            <li> It seems to be doing good----and maybe it would do a better job if I could use it three times a day.</li>
            <li> I bought this product at my local Walmart for 15 dollars, I read many reviews after buying it (not the best idea).</li>
            <li> Meanwhile, no change at all in the skin tags; they continue to thrive :) -- and a one star rating is more than it deserves but there was no option for a zero rating :)</li>
            <li> My one tag on my arm is just as big..and just as healthy as ever...</li>
            <li> More faithful application?  </li>
            <li> More faithful application?  </li>
            <li> I love how it says it takes 3 to 8 weeks to work</li>
            <li> that so many people claim this product didn&#x27;t work for them.</li>
            <li> I kept thinking, \\&quot;maybe one more week?\\&quot;</li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t even realize it had fallen off until I went to put more Tag Away on.  </li>
            <li> A Q Tip absorbs most of it.</li>
            <li> I will keep using for a couple more weeks, hopefully there will become results.</li>
            <li> day.&lt;br /&gt;How many people would you find using this product three times a day ?</li>
            <li> Big whoop, it works AWESOME.</li>
            <li> but the smell kept me from being able to use it correctly.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This product however, is mostly bunk.</li>
            <li> I know it could take up to 60 or more days.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s covered my most insurance.  </li>
            <li> There are too many greedy people in this world.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know whether or not it works because I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be able to reapply it.</li>
            <li> so I started putting more on and 4 times per day.</li>
            <li> Six more and still nothing.</li>
            <li> great product fast shipping</li>
            <li> I bought this online after seeing the convincing tv ad...</li>
            <li> OMG I would rather have 10 more sking tags than use it anymore.</li>
            <li> Much better than a trip to DR.</li>
            <li> This product is nothing more then a fraud...</li>
            <li> I had more than one person ask \\&quot;What</li>
            <li> then I can say, for sure....</li>
            <li> I was able to deal with the odor for five days, but after that it began to effect my breathing.</li>
            <li> I am more upset with myself then the product because I should have known better.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the discomfort I experienced was normal either.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty good.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that for sure yet but not looking good so far!!</li>
            <li> I can still feel it raised ever-so-slightly, but I am TOTALLY HAPPY AND SURPRISED that it worked.</li>
            <li> This review will be very quick and painless - product DOES NOT WORK.  </li>
            <li> Make sure the area it clean before applying</li>
            <li> It dries up pimples very quickly.</li>
            <li> YOU GET THE IMPRESSION THAT THE SKIN TAGS DISAPPEAR VERY QUICKLY.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply</li>
            <li> This product produces a smell so strong that you need to ventilate&lt;br /&gt;the room.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, you can not leave your house with that strong liniment smell around you.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The smell is really strong.</li>
            <li> and I felt strongly like it was a scam.</li>
            <li> Its so strong that it makes my eyes water</li>
            <li> /&gt;THE PRODUCT HAS A STRONG SMELL</li>
            <li> This product seemed too good to be true when I first saw it on TV.</li>
            <li> truly didn&#x27;t think it would do anything for me, and when you do put it on it smells like a form of Eucalyptus, though quite strong.</li>
            <li> It smells really strong.</li>
            <li> Amazingly, I am still using that original bottle I purchased, so it has a long shelf life, and is a great value.  </li>
            <li> Amazingly, I am still using that original bottle I purchased, so it has a long shelf life, and is a great value.  </li>
            <li> but it was amazing for me, it did exactly what the ad said it would.</li>
            <li> QUICK, EASY, PAINLESS, CHEAP!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read many complaints about it and it certainly is strong (though it does go away rather quickly as the product dries).</li>
            <li> the smell if fine with me.  </li>
            <li> , I did not try this product, it may work fine, I don&#x27;t know</li>
            <li> So perhaps on really huge skin tags it might take longer?</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s really important.  </li>
            <li> I bought this in Walgreens to primarily deal with a skin tag that I had on my thigh that was about the size of a dime and would bleed a lot.  </li>
            <li> I think once you pass about 4 weeks of using it almost 100% as directed you will start to really wear on them and after this period you can kind of slack on it a bit.</li>
            <li> --I got mine at Rite-Aide--pretty cheap and</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s too much!!!</li>
            <li> Very useful.</li>
            <li> Making them more noticeable was exactly the result I hoped to achieve.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to give this a try</li>
            <li> Some homeopathic products claim to use a dilution, so dilute that not even a molecule of the original substance remains...</li>
            <li> Ok, first of all the smell.</li>
            <li> thing is, I live in South Florida and its been fairly warm here.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, and fast shipment of product sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> The only good thing is the dermatologist removed a couple of moles as well.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these and followed rigorously the instructions for two full months.</li>
            <li> Save your money for a future trip to a good dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> I have almost a full bottle</li>
            <li> more then twice a day really bugged being nothing</li>
            <li> I used this produce as directed for 4 full weeks.</li>
            <li> I tried tag away as directed, two bottles, absolutely nothing nothing happened, gave them the benefit of the doubt and reordered two more bottles.</li>
            <li> If you read the guarantee it&#x27;s only good for 30 day&#x27;s, and they claim it takes 6 to 8 weeks to work.</li>
            <li> I have had no bad reaction to it whatsoever.</li>
            <li> No bad smell from my bottle either.  </li>
            <li> I quickly stopped the applications and had my doctor snip off the tags during an office visit.  </li>
            <li> It smells like rubbing alcohol and the scent dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> This wound up using up the product quickly.  </li>
            <li> , luckily it was on my side close to my waist</li>
            <li> I see a few of those with gerbil sized \\&quot;skin tags\\&quot; are venting their frustration on my candid yet honest review.</li>
            <li> However, if you have many or larger tags, you are probably better off saving your money and going to the dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Better to get professional to cut them off!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also pretty cheap.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very medicinal, &amp; so strong that I could smell it through my clothes, &amp; I was always worried</li>
            <li> I have finished one bottle and really don&#x27;t like the strong smell and NO effect at all.</li>
            <li> The only thing this product was capable of effectively removing was money from my wallet!</li>
            <li> I should have read the reviews first!</li>
            <li> but well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> There are FAR more than that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d apply a fresh coat).</li>
            <li> Is it worth a shot...</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve done the right thing this time and given advice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s right,</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I was sent the right product.</li>
            <li> Right?</li>
            <li> The one on my hand which I got right away just took a couple weeks, so maybe the age and size makes a difference.  </li>
            <li> This stuff works if you apply it right.</li>
            <li> is it not working because I&#x27;m not doing it right.</li>
            <li> and it worked right away.</li>
            <li> should have figured out right there.</li>
            <li> it has a very strong odor similar to the muscle/pain rubbing creams.</li>
            <li> Second of all, they don&#x27;t tell you that it&#x27;s got a very strong scent that is so overpowering that you can&#x27;t use it unless you&#x27;re going to immediately take a shower afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I was all excited at first and better about remembering but after about ten days</li>
            <li> Do a cost comparison with your family doctor first, then decide for yourself if the cost is worth it.</li>
            <li> If I had known that, I probably would have contacted the manufacturer to ask how long it takes before you see any kind of results.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;100% Natural Plant Extracts\\&quot; but it has a strong chemical smell.  </li>
            <li> Used tag away as directed for three days and on the third evening I was able to wipe the tag right off.  </li>
            <li> it does not work as quickly as implied on TV, it also has a strong smell, it is not something you want to use and then go out in public.</li>
            <li> and they were big and many.  </li>
            <li> A real scam!</li>
            <li> I wish I would have read the reviews first.</li>
            <li> I should have researched first.  </li>
            <li> First day, put it on about 5-6 times.</li>
            <li> All this stuff did was smell funny.</li>
            <li> I had followed the directions and applied Tag Away every day, although not always three times a day, and it was a hot summer</li>
            <li> Many of them mentioned the putrid smell, which, oddly enough, I didn&#x27;t find all that offensive.  </li>
            <li> I used this exactly once</li>
            <li> I followed the direction and applied it 2-3 times a day after washing the area with hot, soapy water (or after getting out of the shower).  </li>
            <li> So be willing to pay up to $20 for nothing.</li>
            <li> I applied this product to them exactly as directed for about 3-4 weeks until I started to forget to use it sometimes.</li>
            <li> After about three to four weeks, the first tags started falling off.</li>
            <li> So obviously there are way more than 60 applications in this bottle.</li>
            <li> I used tag away for exactly 4 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I wondered if the higher temperatures helped the product to work faster for me.</li>
            <li> Freezing skin tags with a wart remover works pretty well.</li>
            <li> The product calls for daily use for 3 to 6 weeks, which I guess would be OK if it weren&#x27;t for the smell.  </li>
            <li> first of all, why would anyone need two bottles?  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off getting something like wart remover which does the same thing this was supposed to do and save your money.</li>
            <li> I put some vinegar on a cotton pad, used some first aid tape,</li>
            <li> I bet I could remove twenty five more tags of similar size with what is left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> had I done this first</li>
            <li> If anything my skin tag looks healthy and I have used it for 2 months plus on my second bottle...</li>
            <li> and I am consistent.  </li>
            <li> Used exactly as directed.  </li>
            <li> Larger skin tags would certainly take a bit longer, but I am confident they too would fall off if a person stuck with the treatment regimen for the recommended three weeks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was able to get rid of mine, with a regular applications (three times a day) of pure Tea Tree oil.</li>
            <li> regarding the \\&quot;it really works\\&quot; reviews...they are most likely company employees or distributors.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say 99.9% of the reviews I read or watched (which was a pretty large amount)</li>
            <li> Within the first 4 days, it had turned completely black (which kind of freaked me out</li>
            <li> I wonder, as I read the positive reviews from people that purchased Tag Away elsewhere.</li>
            <li> They need much clearer instructions than \\&quot;brush it on 3 times a day\\&quot;, they should tell you exactly what to expect.</li>
            <li> The tag had totally died and came off easily.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;to begin to see any results but may be strong enough for some people.</li>
            <li> only thing that&#x27;s changed is that I smell like ive been dipped in strong disinfectant.</li>
            <li> I only used a drop and the aroma is so strong that I&#x27;m getting a headache.  </li>
            <li> Tea Tree still is not very pleasant smelling, it is camphorous, so it has a very sterile kind of medical smell, and it can be very strong.</li>
            <li> I had a large skin tag on my thigh &amp; decided to try this instead of going to the doctor to have it removed.</li>
            <li> When started using had 14 skin tags, 2 large 4 med.</li>
            <li> I have a large number under each arm.</li>
            <li> Some are large and everything in between.  </li>
            <li> Tag Away worked extremely well and very quickly!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled to say this product worked great and my irritating neck skin tag turned black and fell off within 4 days of using this product.  </li>
            <li> Sadly right when I noticed a slight change, was when I lost the product and thus couldn&#x27;t use it for a week or more.</li>
            <li> I tried this on my sons skin tags 2-3 times a day for 3 months and absolutely NOTHING happened.</li>
            <li> Very misleading product....</li>
            <li> Look: homeopathy was disproven when we discovered modern medicine.</li>
            <li> You really have to follow the directions.  </li>
            <li> no change except for the bonus of smelling like straight tea tree oil all day.  </li>
            <li> I used it 3 times a day faithfully but did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> Still have the tags and now I have a very itchy rash which I would like to pass on to the producers of this junk.  </li>
            <li> Too much work you have to apply a lot doing the day.</li>
            <li> Too much money.</li>
            <li> It did absolutely nothing for me at all.  </li>
            <li> and he says it really worked well.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like the smell much</li>
            <li> I am near the end of my second bottle and ready to move on to something more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It says it takes 2-8 weeks and its been much longer.</li>
            <li> In the real world, it doesn&#x27;t work at all.  </li>
            <li> I used it for 2 months straight...</li>
            <li> Save your money and just make an appointment at a real doctor to have tags</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much else.  </li>
            <li> Used this as directed for 3 weeks and it did absolutely nothing for my skin tags.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone trying to get rid of skin tags.  </li>
            <li> It did absolutely nothing except stink when applied.</li>
            <li> I have seen and heard this much advertised product.</li>
            <li> I really want this product to work, but I have my doubts.</li>
            <li> It did absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li> and then it got really sore</li>
            <li> Some of the reviews said they didn&#x27;t get the real Tag Away...</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> in my opinion, absolutely.</li>
            <li> Absolutely does not work.</li>
            <li> If you want one bottle plus the free one (as advertised on TV) they try to dupe you and you wind up purchasing two boxes containing a total of four bottles.</li>
            <li> It smells very medicinal which makes you believe it works.  </li>
            <li> This product did absolutely nothing for me ,but take my money.</li>
            <li> Absolutely a scam.  </li>
            <li> The application with a qtip is really part of the mistique .....</li>
            <li> It really is pungent, it may work, I just don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working fast for my mom.</li>
            <li> and it did absolutely NOTHING.</li>
            <li> Absolute rip off.  </li>
            <li> The product absolutely does not work at all.</li>
            <li> still waiting to see if this really works.</li>
            <li> YOU REALLY DON&#x27;T WANT A LIQUID APPLICATION.</li>
            <li> I used it consistently-3-4 times a day for weeks and absolutely nothing happened to the skin tag.</li>
            <li> Bought the product...found that it took multiple applications, for numerous weeks, to be effective.</li>
            <li> My review is full of information about exactly how this product performed for me, how can that possibly be unhelpful?  </li>
            <li> My review is full of information about exactly how this product performed for me, how can that possibly be unhelpful?  </li>
            <li> 3Xs a day and Do Not Waste Your Money!!!</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m the kind of person who secretly likes a bit of skunk odor...or cow manure, so I&#x27;m probably not a reliable judge of what smells good or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this product has no good use if your having a problem with skin tag its best to go to a medical professional to have them removed</li>
            <li> funny thing is, they have a 30 day money back guarantee, but right on the bottle it says can take up to 8 weeks to work.</li>
            <li> This is a first time of using it and so far it seems to be working.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t think it was working on this old tag.  </li>
            <li> I am taking it back to Walmart for a full refund.  </li>
            <li> I have about 7 tags concentrated in a single area, and 2 were rather large, the others were barely even hanging off my skin (more like bumps if anything).</li>
            <li> If I could apply at night only and then shower it off the next day versus three times a day I may have given it more time.</li>
            <li> Go to WEB MD and read about their main ingredient Thuja Occidentalis</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s &amp;#34;just ok&amp;#34; because it&#x27;s not as strong as I expected and needed.</li>
            <li> Do no buy this product if you are looking to remove skin tags I recommend highly</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have high hopes after reading the reviews here but tried it anyway .</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Two days later, complete success!  </li>
            <li> I have a rather large skin tag in a sensitive area.  </li>
            <li> But even that little progress took many months to achieve.  </li>
            <li> which pretty much means, the main ingredient, is not present...</li>
            <li> Honestly, it was hardly noticeable at all.</li>
            <li> It does have a strong smell, but not to me as pungent as some of the other reviewers have said.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the bad reviews, it worked perfectly for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I kept telling myself it was normal).</li>
            <li> It does take time and daily application, but for me, it was totally worth the effort.  </li>
            <li> It does take time and daily application, but for me, it was totally worth the effort.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, my husband tied a piece of floss on it first but the floss began to dig into my skin, so I bought Tag Away at Walgreens for $14.99, I figured I am only out that much if it didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> pretty much just while I slept or when I was home and not in public (since it was on my neck)</li>
            <li> , I am willing to bet that most negative reviewers either didn&#x27;t follow the instructions, or were expecting a miracle.</li>
            <li> and I think there are a few more.</li>
            <li> It has such a strong odor to it ,that you need only apply it at night or your friends will probably ridicule the smell.</li>
            <li> It only took 5 1/2 weeks, and honestly I didn&#x27;t think it was doing anything but making it worse because my tag got swollen and red for most of the time</li>
            <li> The little tag skin does not have nerve endings I have been told, and I found it to be pretty much true.  </li>
            <li> and then I put it in a new spot between my breasts and I</li>
            <li> Having used a whole bottle of Tag Away on four different areas on face and arms, absolutely nothing happened.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , I think it smells rather natural and fresh, sort of like pine or cedar essential oil.</li>
            <li> natural and fresh, sort of like pine or cedar essential oil.</li>
            <li> I tried this stuff for a tag that was in a very sensitive place on my body.  </li>
            <li> I did think it was a little pricey at first, but now I realize there is pretty much a lifetime supply of it in the bottle.</li>
            <li> Normally I&#x27;d write a jokey, sarcastic review but claiming homoeopathy to work is bellow me.</li>
            <li> I used this product exactly as specified for three months and my one and only skin tag FLOURISHED.  </li>
            <li> I was pretty much only putting it on when I got out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t notice any change but after about a week, I started seeing the skin tag get a bit smaller and stop bleeding.  </li>
            <li> Skin tags look, feel, EXACTLY the same.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I have felt foolish over the past months for continuing to apply it in the hopes that it will magically have an effect at some point.</li>
            <li> I used the second bottle on looks EXACTLY like it did in the beginning.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend using a Tea Tree balm or salve, as it is generally thicker, so it may not need to be applied quite as much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this didn&#x27;t work for so many...</li>
            <li> If I could get past the smell, I could apply Tag Away more often.</li>
            <li> The tags don&#x27;t look any different from when I first started.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It stayed exactly the same.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have a strong, campho-like medicine smell when it goes on, but I certainly don&#x27;t consider this to be offensive, at least not to normal humans.</li>
            <li> The only problem is the pain, but it doesn&#x27;t last more than a day, and at least it&#x27;s not a constant 3 times per day thing for six weeks or more without results.</li>
            <li> I think the Tag Away did irritate my skin because I experienced some itching and a minor sharp pain, like being pricked with a pin, but the pain didn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> The only earthly reason I can imagine there would be positive reviews for this product</li>
            <li> On TV, especially in commercials, ad people always try to make the product look good; in this case, they made it look like this product gets rid of those dumb &amp;#34;skin tags&amp;#34; within days.  </li>
            <li> applied it to a rather large skin tag under my left arm, three times per day, for seven weeks.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, I think anything that would seriously dry out your skin would work, perhaps even alcohol if used regularly on the same skin tag would offer similar results.</li>
            <li> The tag is gone in an instant and the pain is just kind of a little tiny sting.  </li>
            <li> Liquid\\&quot; and 100% natural.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s essentially &#x27;shrunk&#x27; and you really can&#x27;t even notice that it was ever there.</li>
            <li> Tie a length of white thread around your tag and gently tighten it each day until it dries up and falls off.</li>
            <li> so I sweated it off frequently.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m using some Dr Scholl&#x27;s fast acting wart gel.  </li>
            <li> The product worked, my skin tag is completely gone, but I had no idea what to expect from the directions.</li>
            <li> but I have not seen any noticeable effects yet - since it is probably too early to tell.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money....</li>
            <li> So far it doesn&#x27;t seem to have any effect on the skin tags.</li>
            <li> and you will have accomplished the same thing...nothing!</li>
            <li> Save your money and time, just see a professional.</li>
            <li> Well i developed a method.</li>
            <li> But this stuff works really well on removing the smaller tags.</li>
            <li> I am here taking the time out of my busy life to write a review in hopes that people will see it and know that this product DOES work.</li>
            <li> Instead, see a doctor and have skin tags professionally removed.</li>
            <li> It will be taken straight back to wally mart on the morning...</li>
            <li> Does not work at all... do not waste your money</li>
            <li> Do not waste your time and money or get your hopes up for this product.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this on appx one quarter of the surface of my neck and throat three times a day for almost four weeks (and I really slather it on), and I have only used up about 1/8 of the contents on my 15ml bottle.</li>
            <li> However, if you are sensitive to smells or don&#x27;t like the scent of a tree, that could be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the skin tags I used this product on are now completely gone.  </li>
            <li> I am ready to wear low necked tops for summer with no self consciousness!  </li>
            <li> I am glad I gave this product a try despite all the negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> However, if you are sensitive to smells or don&#x27;t like the scent of a tree, that could be an issue.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone trying to get rid of skin tags.  </li>
            <li> All the skin tags I used this product on are now completely gone.  </li>
            <li> I am ready to wear low necked tops for summer with no self consciousness!  </li>
            <li> I am glad I gave this product a try despite all the negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that this works.</li>
            <li> do not waste your money.  </li>
            <li> Been using for 5 weeks and so far has not worked at all.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> Personally, I didn&#x27;t find it that objectionable, sort of like a really pungent pine or cedar.</li>
            <li> I used it for the entire 2 month time and it did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> When friends have asked me how it works, I have told them do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> I was pleasently surprised as I&#x27;ve never tried anything like this before.</li>
            <li> Within the first two days, I could feel/see it start to dry out.</li>
            <li> I used it on 3 areas at first, and finally decided to focus on only one skin tag to see if I could create a productive result.  </li>
            <li> I purchased Tag Away 4 weeks ago and have applied it to 3 different skin tags 3 times a day for the last 4 weeks straight!</li>
            <li> However, anyone who discovers they don&#x27;t have the required self-discipline and patience could certainly use this as an excuse to complain and give up.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for getting rid of a couple of skin tags of various sizes.  </li>
            <li> I would not waste my money, especially with a seller who does not care about you once your purchase is complete!  </li>
            <li> It did not remove or diminish my skin tags, but only made them more noticeable by highlighting them with dark red splotches that crept up my entire neck.  </li>
            <li> It has Works for both skin tags and a NEW skin-colored mole that suddenly appeared.</li>
            <li> Then you won&#x27;t feel a need to discourage others by posting a scathing, critical review of this great product here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really was looking forward to getting this because it is so much more expensive to get this issue taken care of at the doctor, but after I got this</li>
            <li> My neck was full of tiny little tags.  </li>
            <li> spent 30 bucks and put two whole bottles on ONE skin tag, and its still there.</li>
            <li> I could barely stand it myself at home.</li>
            <li> I bought this directly from the company and got a discount on a second bottle.</li>
            <li> I eventually found it and have barely even been using it as directed.</li>
            <li> I have used it for one full month on one small tag on my neck.  </li>
            <li> You can easily call this a scam product that has enormous negative feedback.</li>
            <li> is that those people are receiving money for writing positive product reviews, and if that is the case, they should be ashamed of themselves for aiding in misleading people to spend good money on a worthless product.  </li>
            <li> It first starts to shrivel, then turn black and then falls off.  </li>
            <li> smells to high heaven, didn&#x27;t use long enough to get any results</li>
            <li> Not a single skin tag has fallen off.  </li>
            <li> My first experience was with the original product which had you tough the tag up basically with an empty board be for applying it.</li>
            <li> I have used one complete bottle and about a third of the second.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint would be that there is a slight odor to it, but considering how effective it dealt with that tag, I&#x27;m not even going to consider it in the rating.</li>
            <li> I was willing to try it a little longer</li>
            <li> Now I wouldn&#x27;t say they fell of totally painlessly, but they did come off, usually when I was washing the area they would catch on the wash cloth and pull off, with a quick pinprick of pain and some redness.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They got really irritated to the point where I snipped one with nail clippers and later pulled the other off with my nails.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and used it religiously according to the product directions for several months to try to remove a 3/8\\&quot; diameter skin tag near my left clavicle.  </li>
            <li> I could bare the smell if only it worked.</li>
            <li> As of today the whole thing is black and I assume it will fall off soon.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think the only reason it has any success at all, is that it contains some amount of tea tree, it also has several other ingredients that there is no logical reason to assume would work for a skin tag, and the &amp;#34;main ingredient&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I had a large skin tag under my arm for years and it completely dried up and fell off within 2weeks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Though a few probably had hypersensitive bloodhound nostrils and just couldn&#x27;t take the smell, (my wife certainly falls into this category)</li>
            <li> My summary of this product is too little results from too much investment in time to apply.</li>
            <li> this stuff is not worth the high price you will pay for the junk...</li>
            <li> They just dried up, turned black, and fell right off completely and painlessly.</li>
            <li> As with most of the products of this kind advertised on TV they prey on people and give them false hope and bad info.</li>
            <li> I apply it maybe once or twice every few days, because I tend to forget and still my tags are shrinking, and I mean the difference in size is VERY significant.</li>
            <li> I used it religiously for8 weeks on one large and 6 small tags.</li>
            <li> It turned dark gray the first day and by the second day it was all black and on the 3rd morning, it literally rubbed</li>
            <li> I tried it on a odd dark funny  freckle I have had on my arm for years and nothing has worked on it, and it is making it smaller....</li>
            <li> A couple of days later I noticed that the skin tag was a strange color &amp; it still felt irritated, then over the next week</li>
            <li> I have not used this product, but for a really fast, nearly painless alternative, take a small, sharp pair of manicure scissors, pull out the tag and snip this skin.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product hoping it really did work because I have skin tags an usually go to a dermatologist to freeze off.</li>
            <li> I might update this review if I try it on larger skin tags and there is a noticeable difference in how long it takes.</li>
            <li> A simple product to use just read the directions, but it doesn,t give any idea on how long you will have to use it to get the desired effects.</li>
            <li> However, I do have a fair number of annoying skin tags, and as the months passed, and I kept seeing the commercial, I finally decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I have been applying it with a cotton ball every evening before I go to bed and every morning as soon as I am dry enough after my shower.</li>
            <li> I used the entire bottle faithfully following the instructions with absolutely no results.</li>
            <li> I am surprised that a few of my smaller tags have already disappeared.  </li>
            <li> The tag turned reddish-black, and a few days later was gone completely.  </li>
            <li> so I dont blame Amazon, but as a reputable company, Amazon really shouldn&#x27;t sell this worthless junk.</li>
            <li> So far, the only thing that I have found that works to remove skin tags is to cut it off with small scissors.  </li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I have not used it a lot to know how long it will take</li>
            <li> Takes too long to work.</li>
            <li> Several weeks using per the instructions and absolutely no difference.  </li>
            <li> I used it over a long period of time and it my skin tag didn&#x27;t come off.  </li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;ve been using it for about three weeks now and a couple of days ago something strange happened.</li>
            <li> I was wearing a turtleneck sweater and all day long I kept feeling the skin tag sort of pricking.</li>
            <li> have followed directions carefully and have been using the product for several weeks now.  </li>
            <li> I had a medium sized, long skin tag on my armpit, and I always dreaded shaving for fear of shaving it off.  </li>
            <li> I suppose the company thinks you will be grossed out by the smell long before you find out it doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> AS IT TAKES A LONG TIME FOR RESULTS.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely no change in them, it&#x27;s a total ripoff!</li>
            <li> Taking 3-5 weeks is just too long.</li>
            <li> They tell you 3 to six weeks....almost as long just waiting for them to rub off.</li>
            <li> A complete waste of money</li>
            <li> For me, it was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I recommend this stuff for removal of your minor skin tags.</li>
            <li> Very long process, got really frustrating after the first week of not seeing any changes at all.i bought a different product that worked within 3 days.</li>
            <li> to my local dermatologist and had 5 removed painlessly and in less then 5 minutes for 25$ total.</li>
            <li> and I only used it once a day instead of the required three times a day, just because I would forget after getting involved in other projects.</li>
            <li> The only reason I haven&#x27;t continued using it is due to its smell.  </li>
            <li> While I can&#x27;t say whether this will work as advertised after using 3 times a day for several weeks, I can say that it can&#x27;t be used around other people - which about takes care of the 3 times a day requirement.</li>
            <li> Remove your own skin tags by dabbing dental orajel on them, when they become numb cut with a small nail scissors and wipe with peroxide, no big deal.</li>
            <li> I have had a few new skin tags start to develop in other areas, and I have found that if you treat them as soon as you notice them they go away even faster.  </li>
            <li> I have had a few new skin tags start to develop in other areas, and I have found that if you treat them as soon as you notice them they go away even faster.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Please be aware, this stuff stinks to high Heaven.</li>
            <li> After each application I would keep my arm up and let the solution dry for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> The trick is to keep it dry.  </li>
            <li> Once I covered it up while in the shower it remained dry and fell off within the week.</li>
            <li> , it won&#x27;t dry out and my neck is still itchy and discolored.</li>
            <li> The thing is so ridiculous that even says on the package &amp;#34;Fast and easy&amp;#34;, how can you call this thing fast if on the box it says that it takes 8 weeks and apply 3 times a day...</li>
            <li> I have not used the product in several months and my skin is itchy and painful to the touch where I was applying it on top of the skin tag still being there.</li>
            <li> /&gt; To be perfectly clear, my skin tag was relatively small.</li>
            <li> x 3/8 \\&quot;, started turning dark then suddenly just was not there.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be a victim like me.  </li>
            <li> it happened over about three days, but after that, it was like having a loose scab under my arm.</li>
            <li> I should have ordered this a long time ago!!</li>
            <li> I have used this religiously, 3 times a day, for several months now and have seen NO difference in small skin tags at all.  </li>
            <li> I finally lost two small tags, but not by following the directions.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about 3 weeks and over half of the skin tags are gone and the rest are considerably smaller.</li>
            <li> I only got wafts of it throughout the day, but maybe that&#x27;s because it was in a hidden spot (</li>
            <li> Monday morning it looked less red but still hurt.</li>
            <li> Then after reading all the bad reviews here, I felt even less enthusiastic about trying it.</li>
            <li> I used it since the beginning of June until last week when I was down to the last few drops.</li>
            <li> The only discomfort was a little stinging now and then like a scab might feel as it dries.</li>
            <li> ,the little brush didn&#x27;t get enough on.</li>
            <li> Please, please do not waste your hard earned money on this product.</li>
            <li> Then, negative reviews from people that purchased through Amazon, possibly getting a different product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s considerably cheaper than a doctor, though based on these reviews I&#x27;d say not effective for everyone.</li>
            <li> As to the negative reviews, no idea where they&#x27;re coming from (perhaps they are all dermatologists that would like to charge several hundred dollars to do the same?).  </li>
            <li> The only one I can blame is me for being such a sucker.</li>
            <li> A total waste of money and time for a product</li>
            <li> I had a few larger ones on my face as well.  </li>
            <li> I did apply it as directed 99% of the time daily, and believe it is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This product is a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27; t even produce partial results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had absolutely no results through the 3 to 8 week period.  </li>
            <li> Not great,, it really is overrated.  </li>
            <li> and there was absolutely no change to my skin tag</li>
            <li> is the money I spent.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money . . . .</li>
            <li> spent all that money applied 3x a day</li>
            <li> I used this product as directed, and have been using for 6 weeks with absolutely no change.  </li>
            <li> Only took a few days to remove the one skin tag I had.</li>
            <li> Total waste of time and money.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely no complaints here.</li>
            <li> If your so called \\&quot;skin tag\\&quot; resembles a third ear, PLEASE, just see a plastic surgeon and don&#x27;t waste your time with Tag Away.</li>
            <li> there is absolutely no change in my skin tags.</li>
            <li> These people should be thrown in jail.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Oh it really is no stars.</li>
            <li> After about three weeks my smaller skin tags dried up and turned brown.</li>
            <li> &quot; appearance on the surface, the product never seemed to penetrate that deep and even after six weeks they were still firmly attached.</li>
            <li> I will continue use until the damn bottle is empty, applying 3 times per day, and liberally at that....</li>
            <li> After two weeks they were shriveled and dried out, and by 4 weeks they all fell off, leaving a tiny pink dot, which soon disappeared.</li>
            <li> IT DOES NOT WORK, plain and simple.</li>
            <li> There was not a sign of any skin changes, and certainly no removal of the tags.  </li>
            <li> A complete and utter waste of money and it stinks to high heaven...</li>
            <li> I had a terrible skin tag problem on my neck, highly visible, about 30 or more.</li>
            <li> No positive results noted-this product did not work for me.  </li>
            <li> The online offers of $29.95 plus $10 shipping are ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Better to use a sterile razor and tweezer, much less painful.</li>
            <li> In the fifth week, all of a sudden my tag turned black and dried up, then fell off</li>
            <li> some days two applications, others 3, and about 5 weeks later, the tag just went black, and dried out.</li>
            <li> It smells exactly like tea tree oil which was also useless for removing skin tags.  </li>
            <li> I used the product for only 4 weeks (faithfully)and the tags started falling off little by little.  </li>
            <li> For those where it didn&#x27;t work, I wonder if you have something other than a skin tag...</li>
            <li> From the other reviews, it looks like it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> that other people could too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If it truly worked for other folks it must have something to do with skin type.</li>
            <li> After weeks of using this product with no effects whatsoever, I followed the advice of some posters, and tried apple cider vinegar--soaked into a small wad of cotton, stuck on with medical tape.  </li>
            <li> I see only a small improvement.</li>
            <li> There is no way you can use this product 3 times a day if have to be around other people.  </li>
            <li> I tried it on six small tags regularly for two months.</li>
            <li> Total waste of your money!</li>
            <li> Total waste of time and money!</li>
            <li> It took only two weeks once a day then one day with a bandage soaked with a few drops and bam!</li>
            <li> These guys should be closed down.</li>
            <li> also had put it in a new spot on my leg and ended up with at least 50 red dots on each Thigh which are very itchy and painful</li>
            <li> I ended up having one taken of at the dermatologist office the other day, just couldn&#x27;t wait, but I do see them turning dark</li>
            <li> I applied it 3 times a day per the simple instructions and it removed two small skin tags for me in less than a week.</li>
            <li> But if you looked at it it looked like a little pink worm crawling out of my neck so it still made me self-conscious.</li>
            <li> results taking a little longer than expected, but I am seeing results.</li>
            <li> So, to make me feel less like a fool, I&#x27;m searching for other uses.  </li>
            <li> Its hard to review in so short a time.</li>
            <li> At some point during this the skin tag did come off, but I had a huge, painful lump on the side of my neck for two weeks.  </li>
            <li> This product is Not worth the money...</li>
            <li> no success so wanted to try  </li>
            <li> (Tuesday)to a dark shriveled up tag that has since fallen on</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see that this product was rated so poorly.  </li>
            <li> Rubbing Crap on skin tags would probably work and smell better than Tag Away......</li>
            <li> And now I am down to 1</li>
            <li> Skin tags &amp; moles are genetic, passed down through your family.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a total waste of time and money!!</li>
            <li> What I mean by the above statement is that this product takes 3-5 weeks before you see any results.  </li>
            <li> I mean that literally, because every time I went to pull it off, there was the similar pain of picking a scab.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it worked great for me, maybe it has something to do with the type of skin you have, I put off buying it because of the bad reviews, my skin tag was cutting into my necklace so I bought it</li>
            <li> I go to the Dermatologist yearly because of my previous skin melanoma and there all kinds of things that can crop up.</li>
            <li> Turned black within a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> looked at it when I got home and, lo and behold, the tip of the tag was completely black.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a quick method, but it works.</li>
            <li> 2 of the tags got black and fell off.</li>
            <li> well they became less puffy, and seemed like they would die off, but they never did.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t see any changes at all until about the 4th week when I noticed the largest tag had shrunken slightly.</li>
            <li> I ran out after about three and a half weeks.  </li>
            <li> It shrunk one tags to half size.  </li>
            <li> Less than one star...</li>
            <li> About half of them on the area I was using as a test are gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Perhaps that helps to use less product than having to use cotton swabs to soak it up and dab it</li>
            <li> Its been about a week and a half and my largest skin tag fell off this morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using half the bottle ,my husband didn&#x27;t see any difference on his tags.</li>
            <li> Used it for several weeks past the instructions recommended use andit never showed signs of working on my small tags.</li>
            <li> I had 5 ugly skin tags on the side and back of my neck,one was very big,the size and color of a pencil eraser.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so mad right now that I used it for 3 months and got nothing in return.</li>
            <li> The armpit skin tag is red and angry looking and got flat as a pancake.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used a little each day.</li>
            <li> The tags shrank a little but were still there.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gotten rid of other skin nasties in the past.  </li>
            <li> So that would be a little over 2 months, with no results.</li>
            <li> It helps a little.  </li>
            <li> 2 minutes tops!Just a little pinch when she numbed the area.</li>
            <li> it burned a little.</li>
            <li> , bad, not good, waste of time, waste of money, this rating link reuires too many words.</li>
            <li> But you will be a few bucks Lighter and perhaps a little smarter.</li>
            <li> Not one tag dried up and fell off.  </li>
            <li> I wasted my money on this product and it does not work at all.</li>

            <li> Waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use the contents everyday</li>
            <li> otherwise it would have fallen off in a few days instead of within the week.  </li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of this at a local chain drugstore before reading the reviews on it, which I&#x27;m sorry for now, but at least I have personal experience with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I have wasted time applying it for months and wasted my money.  </li>
            <li> forward a few days</li>
            <li> Oh well, what a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Used it faithfully everyday for 6 weeks and nothing happened.  </li>
            <li> Very difficult to apply and very oily!</li>
            <li> but I will tell you this: DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY AND TIME WITH ANY OF THESE PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> I used tag away 3 times daily for almost 6 weeks before I got tired of this product , instructions tell you to use 3-8 weeks</li>
            <li> This is a waste of time.</li>
            <li> I started to believe I had wasted my money, but I continued applying</li>
            <li> I think, they have change colors a few times, but still there.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> When done correctly (burning feeling) the product worked within a few days to a week of application.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your  money.</li>
            <li> waste your money.</li>
            <li> and it just plain doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> cause I used plain sissors to cut them off that was cheaper</li>
            <li> I am puzzled and disappointed by all the down votes this review received, because I can&#x27;t envision HOW exactly this review is &amp;#34;unhelpful&amp;#34;??  </li>
            <li> I am puzzled and disappointed by all the down votes this review received, because I can&#x27;t envision HOW exactly this review is &amp;#34;unhelpful&amp;#34;??  </li>
            <li> Only down side is that you have a faint odor of apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li> It STINKS to high heaven and may have caused damage to my respiratory system.</li>
            <li> and it stinks to high heaven...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, I really hoped it would work too bad, again don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> had to put at least 1 star in the rating to post this review, but it&#x27;s not worth ANY STARS.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually a skeptic of homeopathic stuff, but I purchased this product because I had one skin tag under my arm that was giving me some trouble when I&#x27;d go jogging</li>
            <li> Do not bother wasting money on this product, I do recommend a natural way to get rid of skin tags - Lime Juice apply 2-3 times daily, doesn&#x27;t have the same horrible smell and works faster.</li>
            <li> you have a few small skin tags and don&#x27;t mind the smell and the wait, the product works as intended.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little crazy to work with when it is near your eyes and nose.  </li>
            <li> Classic &#x27;informercial&#x27; product USELESS!</li>
            <li> Even after six weeks of using this product, there should have been at least a slight improvement</li>
            <li> The smell made it impossible for me to use long enough to find out if it works.</li>
            <li> I saw very little difference in the size of my skin tags.  </li>
            <li> I rubbed it firmly on, pressing hard going in circles.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think it has a bad odor as some have indicated.  </li>
            <li> it really did was smell bad.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how this is going to work based on the reviews I have read.</li>
            <li> WASTED MONEY!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> Used it for a week, not sure if it works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why it worked so well for me and not at all for others.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past month,</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!  </li>
            <li> So, in sum, I couldn&#x27;t get past the smell and from the reviews</li>
            <li> I had a small skin tag on my neck.</li>
            <li> but I am sorry that I did not read the reviews prior to buying it.  </li>
            <li> I used it faithfully for 2 months nightly hoping to be rid of 2 small tags on my neck.</li>
            <li> AM NOT SURE</li>
            <li> - don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I used this for almost five weeks on a small tag under my arm.</li>
            <li> /have there are relatively small.</li>
            <li> Not sure why it worked well for me when others say it did not for them.  </li>
            <li> Are people just angry because my experience was different than theirs?rather</li>
            <li> Not sure why it worked well for me when others say it did not for them.  </li>
            <li> Are people just angry because my experience was different than theirs?</li>
            <li> Some are small.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t even destroy THEM!</li>
            <li> I will admit that I was skeptical especially since it seemed to take awhile to work.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product 2x3 times a day for the past six weeks with no results.</li>
            <li> I usually do research on things before I buy, but this time I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Even though the bottles are small, by applying it with my finger I should get another week out of the 1st bottle.</li>
            <li> I have used Tag away for approximately 4 months now and there has been absolutely no change in my skin tag.  </li>
            <li> Like I said, my skin tags were small.</li>
            <li> It was small, but it would get irritated whenever I would exercise.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product, I try it  for 10 weeks and did not work at all!</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> A waste of money!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works or not, I have yet to get past the odor.  </li>
            <li> I am a little confused as some people said it &#x27;fell off&#x27; or &#x27;turned black and fell off&#x27; and</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m feeling pretty stupid.</li>
            <li> What an absolute disappointment!</li>
            <li> I guess everyone bought this crap at the same time and it took this long to realize the scam.</li>
            <li> and the rest small to very small.</li>
            <li> This is hard to keep up with knowing you have to put it on 4 times a day.</li>
            <li> and I really wanted this stupid skin tag gone...</li>
            <li> This product  sucks it doesn&#x27;t work at all</li>
            <li> they say at least they are going to refund my money.</li>
            <li> If I could give it negative stars, I would.  </li>
            <li> Big disappointment.</li>
            <li> Why did I not follow the negative reviews on this product.  </li>
            <li> I started applying Tag Away again at least twice a day.  </li>
            <li> A total disappointment.</li>
            <li> all said that this product did not work or was not effective.</li>
            <li> After a couple of days of using it, I decided to read the reviews online and to my disappointment I found a lot of negative feed back on the product.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d think there would be some succes on at least one or two.  </li>
            <li> I have at least 20 tags and some of them are miniscule...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give it any stars, but it made me give at least one star.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t always use it three times a day but always at least once or twice.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too late to get a refund.</li>
            <li> Was worried when I saw all of the negative reviews on this site--and when I saw that it could take 5 weeks for this product to work.  </li>
            <li> If I could give this product a negative star, it would be -5 star.</li>
            <li> Scab slowly disappears.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste the money!!</li>
            <li> a try - I mean, if doesn&#x27;t work, I could just go to the doc.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money people!!  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this!!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells horrible, cant stand it much longer, I&#x27;m going to call it a complete  waste of money, unless you like smelling bad.</li>
            <li> after buying it, I did read the reviews and they were not good, to say the least.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t try this product unless u have a very small skin tag on an exposed area.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s specifically for warts, although it did get rid of two very small skin tags on my neck.  </li>
            <li> 1st thing is the bottles are very small (not what they look like in the ads).</li>
            <li> but it was rather big and ugly</li>
            <li> The warranty is no good.</li>
            <li> I hate false advertising and this is clear one of them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an expensive waste of time!</li>
            <li> Smells terribly and could not be consistent applying it.</li>
            <li> It smells so bad you can&#x27;t use it very long.  </li>
            <li> Too bad there aren&#x27;t negative stars (black holes?)</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money!!!  </li>
            <li> The only thing this crap does is smell and burn.</li>
            <li> It arrived to my house in a broken bottle</li>
            <li> but it made it worse.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with this product ..</li>
            <li> but the false promises were too alluring to pass up.</li>
            <li> I will not say bad things about this, or any other product that I haven&#x27;t tried.</li>
            <li> The irritation went down alittle but the skin tag is still there and the smell wasn&#x27;t too bad</li>
            <li> Eventually I had a bump the size of half a ping pong ball on the side of my neck and just turning my head was painful.  </li>
            <li> After a few weeks of applying the product as recommended, I broke out in a painful and itchy rash that persisted for months even after discontinuing use of the product.  </li>
            <li> has horrible smell did not work so far leaves odors on sheets and clothing wish can be applied without odor</li>
            <li> So far this product has done NOTHING and the worst part is the smell!</li>
            <li> works slowly (takes about 3 - 4 weeks to notice effect) but it does work !!</li>
            <li> Wasted $20 :(</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even waste your money on this crap, as I am now trying to get my ginormous skin tag off with rubber bands and Compound W, as well as Freeze Away by Dr Schools.  </li>
            <li> Product is useless, don&#x27;t buy it.  </li>
            <li> Even the smallest tag failed to come off.  </li>
            <li> Not only does this product smell horrible, it doesn&#x27;t work either!</li>
            <li> It was a weird feeling like the tag was getting hung on the sweater.  </li>
            <li> this stuff is useless.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t try spending your money with this fake product that never works.</li>
            <li> So $150 +$20 for this useless bottle, I&#x27;m out $170.</li>
            <li> It should be a crime for a company to promote a useless product like this.</li>
            <li> useless.</li>
            <li> No surprise this comes from the same company that makes the horrible Sobokawa Pillows.</li>
            <li> The worst thing is that on the commercials they say &amp;#34;we will give your money back in 30 days&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I seem to recall the TV ad saying there were &amp;#34;60 applications per bottle&amp;#34;, but this is wrong.</li>
            <li> I am angry about this.  </li>
            <li> I find it weird</li>
            <li> It is totally useless.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product at Wal Mart, The smell is awful, but it actually works for me.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my tags are on my neck so the smell is just out there for everyone to smell.  </li>
            <li> For the price I paid for this stuff was useless.</li>
            <li> It does not work and it is extremely expensive.  </li>
            <li> Not only did it not work, but it smelled so awful</li>
            <li> Sorry....</li>
            <li> Useless, Useless.</li>
            <li> Useless.</li>
            <li> And, it has a terrible odor, so it can not be worn in public, and it gets into sheets and clothes.  </li>
            <li> TOTAL CRAP!!!!      </li>
            <li> And actually it doesn&#x27;t smell horrible, and it goes away in 30 minutes or so.</li>
            <li> I feel bad that he WASTED his money on this BS!!  </li>
            <li> I dad a small but annoying skin tag on my neck.  </li>
            <li> At worst, I would have wasted less than $20, and the skin tags were really annoying me.</li>
            <li> wish I had read the other reviews of horrible smell, rashes and that after all that no results&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a horrible smell and I was very disappointed that for 6 weeks it did absolutely nothing.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love it will buy again!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this after reading the reviews, but then I saw it at the store and thought what the heck, I&#x27;ll try it and I only used it once a day instead of the required three times a day, just because I would forget after getting involved in other projects. So I put it on at bedtime and after just a week, almost all of my tags are gone and they were big and many.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product simply doesn&#x27;t work at all!!  I have numerous skin tags; used the product faithfully for three months.  Not one tag dried up and fell off.  If it did work, I would buy a case.  Since it doesn&#x27;t, stop advertising it on TV.  A total waste of money and time for a product I was so eager to try!!  A real scam!</li>
            <li> This product  sucks it doesn&#x27;t work at all I recommend save your money go in utube</li>
            <li> Normally I&#x27;d write a jokey, sarcastic review but claiming homoeopathy to work is bellow me. All homoeopathic products work in the same way a placebo works: All in your head. However, I&#x27;ve done the right thing this time and given advice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go to this website and that will tell you how to fix skin tags http://www.medicinenet.com/skin_tag/page5.htm#how_are_skin_tags_treated</li>
            <li> it does not work and it stinks</li>
            <li> This product is a rip off, do not buy it, it doesn&#x27;t work at all, you will be loosing your time and money, should be taken out of the market....Stop advertising, shame on you!!!!</li>
            <li> I tried this on my sons skin tags 2-3 times a day for 3 months and absolutely NOTHING happened. No change in the skin tags whatsoever. It&#x27;s a total waste of time and money!!</li>
            <li> Used this for 3 weeks applying morning and night.  The smell was awful and everyone you were around you could smell it.  The smell would give me headaches.  After 3 weeks, nothing happened.  Could not recommend this.  Better to get professional to cut them off!!</li>
            <li> I wasted my money on this product and it does not work at all. Save your money and go to a doctor instead. Tell the doctor it is bothersome and gets caught and the insurance will pay. I wish I would have read the reviews first.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about a month of using item.  Skin tag has not fallen off yet.  using twice a day since beginning so I  should see something soon.</li>
            <li> This review will be very quick and painless - product DOES NOT WORK.  It&#x27;s that simple.  It DID make my skin tags a darker color, so that was nice.  Making them more noticeable was exactly the result I hoped to achieve.  And the smell is horrific, so you stink as an added bonus.  Complete waste of money.  Wish I would&#x27;ve read the reviews before I purchased.</li>
            <li> I just bought the tag away a couple of days ago.  I should have researched first.  After reading all the negativity about the smell and it just plain doesn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;m taking this stuff back to Walgreens and getting my money back.</li>
            <li> My fiance bought this for me about two months ago.  I have been using it regularly and noticed that my skin tag was getting BIGGER and HEALTHIER.  Don&#x27;t even waste your money on this crap, as I am now trying to get my ginormous skin tag off with rubber bands and Compound W, as well as Freeze Away by Dr Schools.  I feel bad that he WASTED his money on this BS!!  Don&#x27;t even Bother!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product as directed for six weeks.  There has been no change in the skin tags.  I have two of them and they are still there.  I really don&#x27;t think it has a bad odor as some have indicated.  But I do believe that it does NOT work.  Snake Oil is what they are selling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple - save your money, This product does NOT WORK!!!</li>
            <li> For me Tagaway was an absolute waste of money. I have been using the product since January 2013, and not one tag has dried up and fallen off. This product is a lot like Obama, a lot of talk, no subtance.</li>
            <li> This product does nothing. It is just stinky oily water. I used it for 8 eights and it did nothing to remove my skin tags. I feel totally ripped off.</li>
            <li> I have used this religiously, 3 times a day, for several months now and have seen NO difference in small skin tags at all.  It smells exactly like tea tree oil which was also useless for removing skin tags.  The only earthly reason I can imagine there would be positive reviews for this product is that those people are receiving money for writing positive product reviews, and if that is the case, they should be ashamed of themselves for aiding in misleading people to spend good money on a worthless product.  I&#x27;m making an appointment with my skin doc to have the tags removed as I should have to begin with, and writing this off as another lesson learned.  If it sounds too good to be true, it is.</li>
            <li> I purchased some Tag Away at my local Rite Aid Pharmacy. I am not sure how this is going to work based on the reviews I have read. My husband has lots of skin tags and asked me to get this product. I doubt, however, he will be as diligent about using it as all of you have been. I wonder, as I read the positive reviews from people that purchased Tag Away elsewhere. Then, negative reviews from people that purchased through Amazon, possibly getting a different product. Are we comparing two different products? Has anyone that knows they got the Nutrasil instead of Tag Away gone out and picked up some authentic Tag Away, and tried it? What are your results?</li>
            <li> yea, save your money. this stuff doesn&#x27;t work at all. used it for 4 weeks...nothing.&lt;br /&gt;guess I&#x27;ll go to the doctor.</li>
            <li> works slowly (takes about 3 - 4 weeks to notice effect) but it does work !!</li>
            <li> A complete and utter waste of money and it stinks to high heaven...</li>
            <li> Tag Away does NOT work. WASTED MONEY! I used one bottle as directed and I still have my skin tags. It mentioned \\&quot;Tropical Liquid\\&quot; and 100% natural. It&#x27;s more like 100% skunk smell (That&#x27;s natural).&lt;br /&gt;The odor is an embarrassment putting it on before work &amp; bedtime!&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy this product.</li>
            <li> This has not worked for me.</li>
            <li> Very misleading product....apply 3x daily for 3-8 wks....who has time to do that?  And I have been applying as often as possible for over 3 wks. And can&#x27;t see any hope for the tags falling off.  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Look: homeopathy was disproven when we discovered modern medicine. But even the placebo effect doesn&#x27;t work here.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 2 months and nothing happened! Don&#x27;t waste the money!! The only thing this crap does is smell and burn.</li>
            <li> did not work. cannot give zero stars. spent 30 bucks and put two whole bottles on ONE skin tag, and its still there. funny thing is, they have a 30 day money back guarantee, but right on the bottle it says can take up to 8 weeks to work. looks like a scam. maybe it works for some people...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;oh, and by the way. this stuff stinks. BAD!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i will say they stood by their product and they say at least they are going to refund my money.</li>
            <li> I thing (tag away) is the worst product in the market.do not buy, it is nothing but a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff twice a day for three months and it did nothing at all. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This product was used over two months without any results.</li>
            <li> I used the product as directed over 120 days and the skin tags are still on. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> I say it works!  My neck was full of tiny little tags.  I had a few larger ones on my face as well.  I used the product for only 4 weeks (faithfully)and the tags started falling off little by little.  You really have to follow the directions.  Make sure the area it clean before applying, that&#x27;s really important.  I would say give it a try even if you don&#x27;t like the smell (which is eucalyptus, by the way). I love the results I got.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, doesn&#x27;t work! After over eight weeks of application, three to four times daily, I ended up using the reliable toenail clipper method, OUCH.</li>
            <li> Followed the directions and ....drumroll please....NOTHING, that&#x27;s right, no change except for the bonus of smelling like straight tea tree oil all day.  This stuff is a fraudulent product and someone should take this company to court.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this for me, after a skin tag showed up on my neck over the course of a few months. It was the size of a pencil eraser and I just lived with it for about a year. When she bought it for me, I came here to read reviews and thought she wasted our money but went ahead and tried it with no expectations. Well... I applied it 4 - 5 times a day, and now at 2 1/2 weeks it&#x27;s essentially &#x27;shrunk&#x27; and you really can&#x27;t even notice that it was ever there. I can still feel it raised ever-so-slightly, but I am TOTALLY HAPPY AND SURPRISED that it worked. For those where it didn&#x27;t work, I wonder if you have something other than a skin tag... I go to the Dermatologist yearly because of my previous skin melanoma and there all kinds of things that can crop up. I am a little confused as some people said it &#x27;fell off&#x27; or &#x27;turned black and fell off&#x27; and my experience was that is simply shrunk and is not noticeable anymore.</li>
            <li> After a couple weeks of using Tag Away the skin on my neck became very painful at the site of the skin tag and I stopped using it.  After a couple more days I started seeing swelling at the site.  Eventually I had a bump the size of half a ping pong ball on the side of my neck and just turning my head was painful.  At some point during this the skin tag did come off, but I had a huge, painful lump on the side of my neck for two weeks.  It eventually subsided to almost nothing.  But another couple of weeks later the site is starting to swell and hurt again!  I have not touched the product for several weeks and I&#x27;m still seeing this side effect.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this Tag Away to anyone for any reason.  If I could give it negative stars, I would.  Do not be fooled into thinking there are no possible side effects to this product because it&#x27;s \\&quot;natural.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I went the store and bought it without reading the reviews.  Smells horrible!  Used it for a week, not sure if it works. It smells so bad you can&#x27;t use it very long.  Just tied a thread around the tag and it is starting to come off!</li>
            <li> Product is useless, don&#x27;t buy it.  This product doesn&#x27;t meet it&#x27;s claims, and it will not do what it says it will.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never know if this works or not. From the other reviews, it looks like it doesn&#x27;t. I won&#x27;t be using any more, because the smell is horrendous. It says to use it 3 times a day, but you can&#x27;t go out in public smelling like this. I could barely stand it myself at home. Big disappointment.</li>
            <li> I used this Product for two weeks with no change whatsoever and then I put it in a new spot between my breasts and I ended up with red raised  bumps and itching all over I also had put it in a new spot on my leg and ended up with at least 50 red dots on each Thigh which are very itchy and painful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had read the other reviews of horrible smell, rashes and that after all that no results&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money or end up with the rash I got</li>
            <li> Bought the product...found that it took multiple applications, for numerous weeks, to be effective. I quickly stopped the applications and had my doctor snip off the tags during an office visit.  I wish I had never seen the product advertised!  It may work, after diligent applications....over many, many weeks....but that&#x27;s too much!!!</li>
            <li> Used and used and no results</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for getting rid of a couple of skin tags of various sizes.  I was faithful in applying the oil as directed for 9 weeks.  Nothing happened - my skin was irritated by the oil.  Even the smallest tag failed to come off.  I am very disappointed.  Can I get my money back?</li>
            <li> This product simply did nothing for me after weeks of using the product faithfully twice a day.  In addition, I contacted the seller through Amazon and they never had the courtesy to even contact me.  I would not waste my money, especially with a seller who does not care about you once your purchase is complete!  E. Vernier. Mooie50@aol.com</li>
            <li> This stuff does not work!&lt;br /&gt;This is nothing more than a scam!&lt;br /&gt;I followed instructions explicitly, except for a lot longer than it is supposed to be used and the skin tag is still there.&lt;br /&gt;Horrible smell too!</li>
            <li> I bought this directly from the company and got a discount on a second bottle. I have now finished both. IT DOES NOT WORK, plain and simple.</li>
            <li> I bought mine on a Friday afternoon at a local Walgreens store. First day, put it on about 5-6 times. Turned black within a couple of hours. By Sunday the skin tag on my neck was gone!  I&#x27;m not sure why it worked so well for me and not at all for others. But I also couldn&#x27;t stand the smell, but tolerated it.</li>
            <li> I faithfully used  Tag Away for 8 weeks...3 times a day.&lt;br /&gt;It did nothing.&lt;br /&gt;I felt like I had purchased something from an old&lt;br /&gt;west medicine wagon.</li>
            <li> This product produces a smell so strong that you need to ventilate&lt;br /&gt;the room. My sister, who has asthma, could not use this product.&lt;br /&gt;Because of the smell, you cannot sleep using this product, and&lt;br /&gt;therefore it cannot be used (at all).</li>
            <li> THIS IS JUST ANOTHER RIP OFF PRODUCE : It didn&#x27;t work for me. I used it three to for times a day from the day I received it with no results.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past month, 3Xs a day and Do Not Waste Your Money!!! The skin tags look the same as they did a month ago!</li>
            <li> Did not work at all for me. I used it 3 times a day faithfully but did absolutely nothing. Wasted $20 :(</li>
            <li> The commercial says one bottle is enough for sixty applications.  Okay sounds good, but the directions on the bottle say apply 3 times a day for 3-8 weeks.  For three week you need 63 applications and for 8 weeks you will need 168 applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if it takes 3 weeks.......2 bottles @ 12.99&#x3D;$25.98&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it takes 8 weeks...168 applications&#x3D;6 bottles x 12.99(Wal-Mart)&#x3D;$77.94 For ONE skin tag.  Heaven forbid if you have several.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested it on one skin tag for 12 weeks because I figured it would be cheaper than paying a doctor to have it removed and it never did anything.  I still have the stupid thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I bought this Item Tag Away &amp; I have used it for 8 weeks like stated, this Product does not work, I still have my Skin Tag.  I would not reccomend wasting your money on this product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!  Used the product for about 2 months as directed.  Still have the tags and now I have a very itchy rash which I would like to pass on to the producers of this junk.  Anyone know how to get rid of the irritatioin/rash?</li>
            <li> This is a first time of using it and so far it seems to be working. I have not used it a lot to know how long it will take but I like it</li>
            <li> This product is Not worth the money... You would do better using Apple cider vinager... To put it simply it stinks...</li>
            <li> Why did I not follow the negative reviews on this product.  It stinks and it does not work.  Here I am posting my regret.  Don&#x27;t buy this worthless snake oil.  There are products that make promises we want to believe (grow back your hair, lose weight, look younger) we by them because we want them to work.  People make a fortune selling them to us.  Don&#x27;t be a victim like me.  I tried this for the recommended period of time and there were no noticeable changes, even to my smallest, thinnest tags.  The smell is embarrassing.  Tie a length of white thread around your tag and gently tighten it each day until it dries up and falls off. End of story.</li>
            <li> You are supposed to apply it 3 times a day for 3 to 8 weeks to be effective.&lt;br /&gt;However, you can not leave your house with that strong liniment smell around you.&lt;br /&gt;I think the smell is similar to Tea Tree oil.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s somewhat bearable at home, and you can kinda get used to it, but you can&#x27;t go out in public smelling like horse liniment.</li>
            <li> Tag Away worked extremely well and very quickly! I had a large skin tag under my arm for years and it completely dried up and fell off within 2weeks. I used a little each day. The only discomfort was a little stinging now and then like a scab might feel as it dries. You have to try not to get it onto surrounding skin. After each application I would keep my arm up and let the solution dry for about 10 minutes. I am not sure why others have had no success. It worked great for me.</li>
            <li> Takes too long to work. Smells really bad.</li>
            <li> I used this smelly stuff for 3 months and my skin tags are still present and accounted for. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I went back and forth for months and finally decided to try Tag Away.  Several weeks using per the instructions and absolutely no difference.  Waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Tag away does NOT work. Save your money. It&#x27;s been 2 months and skin tags still in place just turned brown now they are more noticeable.</li>
            <li> All this stuff did was smell funny. I went through one bottle applying to three different areas with tiny skin tags and nothing happened. I did apply it as directed 99% of the time daily, and believe it is a waste of money. Not recommended</li>
            <li> I had a skin tag under my armpit and i bout this product and put it on my skin tag three times a day for two weeks and i put a bandaid on it for those two weeks i was applying it and it fell off within those two weeks!! This product is a life saver!!!</li>
            <li> I saw this product in a drugstore and on a whim, bought it. I should have read the reviews first! The smell is awful!! If I could apply at night only and then shower it off the next day versus three times a day I may have given it more time. IF it had fabulous reviews saying how great it worked, I MAY have seen if I could have found something to mask the smell and given it a go for 6 weeks. So, in sum, I couldn&#x27;t get past the smell and from the reviews don&#x27;t see a reason to try.</li>
            <li> ...but 170 out of 238 reviews were 1 star.  I have a rather large skin tag in a sensitive area.  Tried floss, no success so wanted to try  but the reviews deterred me.  I wouldn&#x27;t try this product unless u have a very small skin tag on an exposed area.  I&#x27;m thinking about some ice and scissors now.  Yikes!  Pray for mama.  Lol</li>
            <li> I applied it three times a day for 10 weeks. The tags shrank a little but were still there. During the 11th week and on the skins around the tags turned red and I felt a burning sensation every time I applied the solution. I had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> Too much work you have to apply a lot doing the day. I don&#x27;t like the smell. Too much money.</li>
            <li> I used it over a long period of time and it my skin tag didn&#x27;t come off.  Classic &#x27;informercial&#x27; product USELESS!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s &amp;#34;just ok&amp;#34; because it&#x27;s not as strong as I expected and needed. You have to apply it over &amp; over &amp; over&lt;br /&gt;to begin to see any results but may be strong enough for some people.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t even give this product one star but I had to in order to post a review.  I used this product exactly as specified for three months and my one and only skin tag FLOURISHED.  It actually grew!!!  Do no buy this product if you are looking to remove skin tags I recommend highly Compound W Freeze Off.  I didn&#x27;t use the contents everyday otherwise it would have fallen off in a few days instead of within the week.  The trick is to keep it dry.  Once I covered it up while in the shower it remained dry and fell off within the week.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and all it did was make me smell like crap and made my eyes water, do not buy this, they are thieves!</li>
            <li> I finally lost two small tags, but not by following the directions.  I had followed the directions and applied Tag Away every day, although not always three times a day, and it was a hot summer so I sweated it off frequently.  I gave up after two months when nothing seemed to be happening.  Then this fall, the tags seemed irritated.  I started applying Tag Away again at least twice a day.  They got really irritated to the point where I snipped one with nail clippers and later pulled the other off with my nails.</li>
            <li> It has such a strong odor to it ,that you need only apply it at night or your friends will probably ridicule the smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using it like it said &amp; after 3 weeks nothing happen yet, so I think it probably don&#x27;t work! I don&#x27;t know that for sure yet but not looking good so far!!</li>
            <li> I bought this oil with the hope of removing skin tags on my neck - the oil did nothing to the tags - they are still hanging where they were . . .!</li>
            <li> The smell reminds me of insect spray &amp; it stays with you a while.&lt;br /&gt;However, it does the job it&#x27;s made for.</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of this at a local chain drugstore before reading the reviews on it, which I&#x27;m sorry for now, but at least I have personal experience with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after buying it, I did read the reviews and they were not good, to say the least.  Many of them mentioned the putrid smell, which, oddly enough, I didn&#x27;t find all that offensive.  But I&#x27;m the kind of person who secretly likes a bit of skunk odor...or cow manure, so I&#x27;m probably not a reliable judge of what smells good or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I saw how people said it stunk, and figured maybe that caused most of them to not use it according to directions, and maybe that&#x27;s why id didn&#x27;t work for them.  I was determined to prove them wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied it to a rather large skin tag under my left arm, three times per day, for seven weeks.  The only thing that happened was the skin tag got sort of shrivelly looking like a soggy rice crispy (the cereal) hanging on for dear life to my armpit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I did wave the white flag of surrender here.  Now I&#x27;m using some Dr Scholl&#x27;s fast acting wart gel.  It&#x27;s specifically for warts, although it did get rid of two very small skin tags on my neck.  The stuff burns, though.  The armpit skin tag is red and angry looking and got flat as a pancake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of more weeks and I&#x27;ll just go with the Dr Scholl&#x27;s freeze away kit.  It&#x27;s gotten rid of other skin nasties in the past.  The only problem is the pain, but it doesn&#x27;t last more than a day, and at least it&#x27;s not a constant 3 times per day thing for six weeks or more without results.</li>
            <li> OMG....Not only does this product smell horrible, it doesn&#x27;t work either! Used as directed and tags are softer and as another reviewer said \\&quot;look healthier\\&quot;, but still the same size. WASTE of $$&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your $$ and AVOID this product.</li>
            <li> The instructions are &amp;#34;apply 3 times daily&amp;#34; for 3-8 weeks.  My doctor just dabs something on my skin tags and they are gone in a week or so...no pain..no fuss.  I thought this was going to be the same thing but I could do it at home.</li>
            <li> I used the entire bottle faithfully following the instructions with absolutely no results. This product is a total waste of money. It doesn&#x27; t even produce partial results. Nothing! A total disappointment.</li>
            <li> I had a large skin tag on my thigh &amp; decided to try this instead of going to the doctor to have it removed. I followed the directions for about 3 weeks with no visible result when it started to hurt a bit. I decided to stop using it at that point because of the irritation &amp; the fact that nothing seemed to be happening. A couple of days later I noticed that the skin tag was a strange color &amp; it still felt irritated, then over the next week, it shriveled up &amp; fell off. The product worked, my skin tag is completely gone, but I had no idea what to expect from the directions. I didn&#x27;t know if what was happening was the way it was supposed to work, or if I had a problem. They need much clearer instructions than \\&quot;brush it on 3 times a day\\&quot;, they should tell you exactly what to expect. I don&#x27;t know if the discomfort I experienced was normal either. Another problem with the product is the smell. It&#x27;s very medicinal, &amp; so strong that I could smell it through my clothes, &amp; I was always worried that other people could too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, the product worked for me, but there is definitely some improvement needed.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work, this product needs to be taking off the market.</li>
            <li> I had a small skin tag on my neck. Honestly, it was hardly noticeable at all. But if you looked at it it looked like a little pink worm crawling out of my neck so it still made me self-conscious. The Tag-Away was an impulse buy.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used the product strictly according to the package directions. You know how it goes. I was all excited at first and better about remembering but after about ten days I was pretty much only putting it on when I got out of the shower. Well I&#x27;ve been using it for about three weeks now and a couple of days ago something strange happened. I was wearing a turtleneck sweater and all day long I kept feeling the skin tag sort of pricking. It was a weird feeling like the tag was getting hung on the sweater.  I figured something was happening because I had never felt it before.&lt;br /&gt;I looked at it when I got home and, lo and behold, the tip of the tag was completely black. I would have been grossed out if I wasn&#x27;t so happy it was working. As of today the whole thing is black and I assume it will fall off soon.&lt;br /&gt; To be perfectly clear, my skin tag was relatively small. Probably about a mm across and 2 mm tall so I couldn&#x27;t say if it would work on larger tags. As for the smell... it smelled like tea tree oil. It&#x27;s earthy and herbal. It didn&#x27;t bother me at all but I like that sort of thing.</li>
            <li> YES!  I was amazed that this stuff actually works.  I am covered with skin tags.  The claim is that it take 3-6 weeks to work, or more, but mine started disappearing WITH NO SCARRING within 3 days.  No kidding.  This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product hoping it really did work because I have skin tags an usually go to a dermatologist to freeze off. This is very painful, BUT at least that does work!  When I see this Ad on TV I get upset because people buy it thinking it will do what the ad claims it will do. Do not waste your money! It&#x27;s all about the money not the product working.</li>
            <li> This product does not work. My dad and I have tried the bottles we bought and nothing has happened.  And yes, we followed the instructions.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I was sent the right product. I got something called Naturasil. I ordered the Tag Away. The stuff I got doesn&#x27;t work at all.&lt;br /&gt;I have followed directions carefully and have been using the product for several weeks now.  No sign of any results.</li>
            <li> I have not used this product, but for a really fast, nearly painless alternative, take a small, sharp pair of manicure scissors, pull out the tag and snip this skin.  The little tag skin does not have nerve endings I have been told, and I found it to be pretty much true.  The tag is gone in an instant and the pain is just kind of a little tiny sting.  The perfect fix for no money at all unless you don&#x27;t have manicure scissors.  I have done this personally.  It took me a while to get up my courage, but I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> Product Does Not Work at all...Waste Of Time and money...Used as per instructions with no results so tried a second and even third time still nothing.... Don&#x27;t waste your money on this item</li>
            <li> I had a terrible skin tag problem on my neck, highly visible, about 30 or more. I was going to buy this until I read the reviews. Then a friend told me to use rubbing alcohol. It smells like rubbing alcohol and the scent dissipates quickly. It&#x27;s not a quick method, but it works. I have been applying it with a cotton ball every evening before I go to bed and every morning as soon as I am dry enough after my shower. It&#x27;s been about 3 weeks and over half of the skin tags are gone and the rest are considerably smaller. I will keep doing this until they are gone. I am so happy to have learned this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had absolutely no results through the 3 to 8 week period.  I would save my money if I were you.</li>
            <li> I used Tag Away as directed. 3x/day, cleaned every tag before applying, etc. I used it since the beginning of June until last week when I was down to the last few drops. So that would be a little over 2 months, with no results. Then all of a sudden my neck started to itch and hurt. Every tag got very red and all the surrounding skin. Very painful and itchy. 2 of the tags got black and fell off. There were 8 that needed to be cut with a razor--that method didn&#x27;t hurt. And now I am down to 1, it won&#x27;t dry out and my neck is still itchy and discolored. I am sure everyone has a different skin type and might have a totally wonderful experience with this product, but I will never use it again. Better to use a sterile razor and tweezer, much less painful.</li>
            <li> It is too soon to ask for a review since it takes several weeks to see results.  It seems to be working but I have not seen any noticeable effects yet - since it is probably too early to tell.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I had a big skin tag.....started using the product on Sunday, the tag was gone by Thursday.  Awesome awesome awesome</li>
            <li> This product is also good for acne. It dries up pimples very quickly. I take a while for it to work on moles.  I see a difference but it hasn&#x27;t fallen off yet.</li>
            <li> I used this exactly once so I don&#x27;t know if it works or not.  What I do know is the smell was so awful I had to shower to get it off because I couldn&#x27;t stand it.</li>
            <li> I was excited to give this a try but I am sorry that I did not read the reviews prior to buying it.  It did absolutely nothing for me at all.  It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This seems to take longer to work. The smell is really strong. But it beats having skin tags on you!</li>
            <li> I have went thru &amp;#34;3&amp;#34; bottles &amp; followed directions &amp; my skin tags are still with me.  I would not have gone with 3, but I had did a layaway &amp; put them with my stuff.  HOWEVER, I will not be buying again &amp; will NOT recommend it to anyone...</li>
            <li> I bought this in Walgreens to primarily deal with a skin tag that I had on my thigh that was about the size of a dime and would bleed a lot.  I followed the direction and applied it 2-3 times a day after washing the area with hot, soapy water (or after getting out of the shower).  At first, I didn&#x27;t notice any change but after about a week, I started seeing the skin tag get a bit smaller and stop bleeding.  Another week later and it was 1/4 the size.  This morning, after about 2.5 weeks, the tag fell off.  This stuff is wonderful!  My only complaint would be that there is a slight odor to it, but considering how effective it dealt with that tag, I&#x27;m not even going to consider it in the rating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually a skeptic of homeopathic stuff, but I purchased this product because I had one skin tag under my arm that was giving me some trouble when I&#x27;d go jogging so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try - I mean, if doesn&#x27;t work, I could just go to the doc.  Surprisingly, it worked precisely as it indicated it would. Within the first two days, I could feel/see it start to dry out. Within the first 4 days, it had turned completely black (which kind of freaked me out but I kept telling myself it was normal). Finally, by the seventh day, it had fallen off (either while I was jogging or in the shower...idk when).  I applied it 3-4 times a day.  It does have a strong smell, but not to me as pungent as some of the other reviewers have said. It smelled like a pine-scented car freshener to me. I only got wafts of it throughout the day, but maybe that&#x27;s because it was in a hidden spot (and sometimes I covered it up with a band aid).</li>
            <li> I  purchase this item for my husband and he says it really worked well. I  would recommend it to antone</li>
            <li> When started using had 14 skin tags, 2 large 4 med. and the rest small to very small. after using tag away for well over 8 weeks I now have 14 skin tags. It did not even effect the smallest tag. Totality Worthless product.</li>
            <li> I had a medium sized, long skin tag on my armpit, and I always dreaded shaving for fear of shaving it off.  It also got caught in my shirts and bras and was just a pain in the butt!  I was so determined to get rid of it that I didn&#x27;t listen to the recommended 3 times a day and just put it on probably 10 times the day I bought it, and well....it fell off 6 hours later!  I really didn&#x27;t like the smell much and I really wanted this stupid skin tag gone...and now it is, and it didn&#x27;t hurt or irritate me!</li>
            <li> After using twice a day for over three weeks I have seen no change at all.  What a waste of time.  So disappointed.</li>
            <li> A bit smelly, but it does work. I recommend just once a day at night so you can shower the smell off</li>
            <li> this stuff is useless. don&#x27;t waste your money. use a dog nail clipper and antiseptic. doesn&#x27;t  someone test this stuff?</li>
            <li> Just Amazing, this product make me very happy. I recommended it for everyone. Perfect. Great Quality. Very useful. Nice gift.</li>
            <li> It removed all my tags especially from my face.  It&#x27;s a little crazy to work with when it is near your eyes and nose.  I hung in there and now my tags are gone.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money....as most &amp;#34;seen on TV&amp;#34; products, this does NOT work, have since found something that does,</li>
            <li> Not great,, it really is overrated.  I would. It recommend this to anyone at all.  I didn&#x27;t like it at all</li>
            <li> Had it for a week. The smell is offensive but I&#x27;ve been applying it. So far it doesn&#x27;t seem to have any effect on the skin tags.Its hard to review in so short a time.</li>
            <li> I have been using this pdoduct 3X a day for 10 weeks. The skin tags have changed size but show no sign of going away. I think this product is a sham and doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me.  I used it religously for several weeks; twice a day.  No change to skin tag.  If it truly worked for other folks it must have something to do with skin type.</li>
            <li> I have used it as prescribed instructions came with this product.  I have used it for one full month on one small tag on my neck.  Tag is still there.  This product does not work as advertised.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Arrived quickly and in superb</li>
            <li> This does NOT work at all. You have a THIRTY day money back guarantee BUT they tell you it could take 6-8 weeks to work. That is over 30 days and that is how they get away with their &amp;#34;guarantee&amp;#34;. Please, please do not waste your hard earned money on this product.</li>
            <li> It helps a little.  I had one tag that did shrivel and detach eventually.  The others ...... well they became less puffy, and seemed like they would die off, but they never did.  I am near the end of my second bottle and ready to move on to something more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line it doesn&#x27;t make good on its promise.</li>
            <li> This product takes forever to work and you have to apply twice a day. Who has time for that.&lt;br /&gt;I just went to a dermotologist and had them removed in 5 mins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have 4 skin tags, that I know of, and one on my neck I&#x27;ve had for many years. I&#x27;ve been using skin tag remover liberally, 3 times a day like directed, for over 2 months. It says it takes 2-8 weeks and its been much longer. No difference at all. I&#x27;m not gonna say it doesn&#x27;t work for some people because it might. But it certainly isn&#x27;t a sure thing. So be willing to pay up to $20 for nothing.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty good.  You are supposed to apply it 3 times a day.  It does work on skin tags if used as directed.  It does not work on moles and is not advertised to on moles either.</li>
            <li> Product works fantastic.......on TV!  In the real world, it doesn&#x27;t work at all.  I suppose the company thinks you will be grossed out by the smell long before you find out it doesn&#x27;t work.  Did I mention it stinks?  Smells like a cross between tar, gasoline and road kill!  Did I mention it stinks?  The reason I gave it one star, zero is not an option.  Save your money, get some tar, gasoline and road kill, smell that and you will have accomplished the same thing...nothing!</li>
            <li> this product stinks smells so bad cant keep it on to see if it works  waste of time and money</li>
            <li> The tag a way smelled really bad and you had to put it on a couple of times a day. I only used it one day I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell.</li>
            <li> Does not work! Period.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t seen any change in  my tag... using it regularly and it is still on my neck.</li>
            <li> It did work at all.&lt;br /&gt;It is stinky and it did nothing.  It was a waste of money!!!  Don&#x27;t make the company &amp;#34;natures pillows&amp;#34; rich!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t try spending your money with this fake product that never works. Keep your money. I will never use this product anymore in the future.</li>
            <li> I started using tag away and 2 1/2 weeks later they were gone! simple as that. they looked the same throughout the treatment and I was going to make an application and they were gone-no sign of where they were. im very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> Yep, I sure did. After using this product for 10 weeks and there was absolutely no change to my skin tag, I went to the dermatologist and had it removed for $150. So $150 +$20 for this useless bottle, I&#x27;m out $170. The only good thing is the dermatologist removed a couple of moles as well. Save your money and time, just see a professional. She cut it off.Poof! 2 minutes tops!Just a little pinch when she numbed the area.</li>
            <li> The product does not work at all. Don&#x27;t waste your time and money. I followed the directions and after one month 3 skin tags are still present. You can easily call this a scam product that has enormous negative feedback. It should be a crime for a company to promote a useless product like this.</li>
            <li> I would give this product zero stars if I could!  Don&#x27;t waste your money people!!  I used it as directed for a month and it made no change to my skin tags whatsoever.  It smells horrible too.</li>
            <li> This is hard to keep up with knowing you have to put it on 4 times a day. Well i developed a method. If you use the bath room to do #1 well everytime you go in the bath room before you leave the bathroom keep it at reach or hands and vision. so you wont forget.&lt;br /&gt;This worked for me.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  Didn&#x27;t do anything like product was advertised. Should be removed from Amazon. Some times we win some times we lose. I lost this time</li>
            <li> Used faithfully for 9 weeks, smell was horrible, and offputting.  Skin tags look, feel, EXACTLY the same.  No change what-so-ever.  DO NOT BUY</li>
            <li> I am waiting and waiting and waiting, NOTHING!&lt;br /&gt;Waste of time and money! Now I need to go find something else.</li>
            <li> Skin tags &amp; moles are genetic, passed down through your family. But this stuff works really well on removing the smaller tags. It takes a while but well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it religiously and it hasn&#x27;t worked yet</li>
            <li> I used it for 2 months straight... it hasn&#x27;t done nothing.. it doesn&#x27;t work..</li>
            <li> I bought this product and used it religiously according to the product directions for several months to try to remove a 3/8\\&quot; diameter skin tag near my left clavicle.  It did nothing except stain some of my clothing.  If I could have given this rating NO stars, I would have. My advice is not to waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 4 weeks and I still have my skin tag.&lt;br /&gt;Please save your money.  I did not see these reviews before I&lt;br /&gt;Purchase this product.  Never again.</li>
            <li> Gone through two bottles and been applying for over 5 months.  Not a single skin tag has fallen off.  My dermatologist recommends either cutting them off with a nail clipper (yes, they will bleed), or tying them off with dental floss.  I&#x27;d give it zero stars if I could.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on TagAway.</li>
            <li> 3 stars because I have not seen anything go &#x27;away&#x27; as of yet.  I would recommend the product though as it has worked some.</li>
            <li> This product does not appear to work. I have been applying 3 times a day for weeks &amp; nothing.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon should take this product off their website...</li>
            <li> I used 2 bottles as directed for over 8 weeks until they were gone. ZERO effect. Nothing. Waste of money</li>
            <li> smells to high heaven, didn&#x27;t use long enough to get any results</li>
            <li> Does not work. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. I used it faithfully for 2 months nightly hoping to be rid of 2 small tags on my neck. No difference was made whatsoever, and this stuff smells horrible! Save your money.</li>
            <li> I used this product daily for weeks with no results. Skin tags still present. The only thing gone &amp;#34;away&amp;#34; is the money I spent. Don&#x27;t make the same mistake.</li>
            <li> It seems to be doing good----and maybe it would do a better job if I could use it three times a day. I do not like to go out among the people and smell like Tag Away. But I can put it on every night at bed time/ the smell if fine with me.  fs</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work.  ended up going to doctor to have skin tags removed.  Save your money and either cut your skin tags yourself or go to the doctor.</li>
            <li> I bought this product at my local Walmart for 15 dollars, I read many reviews after buying it (not the best idea). I&#x27;d say 99.9% of the reviews I read or watched (which was a pretty large amount) all said that this product did not work or was not effective. I am here taking the time out of my busy life to write a review in hopes that people will see it and know that this product DOES work. My fear was that maybe the individuals who wrote all of these reviews just simply didn&#x27;t have the patience to follow with it week after week seeing no changes. The 3-8 week commitment definitely made me iffy about this product and I felt strongly like it was a scam. I have about 7 tags concentrated in a single area, and 2 were rather large, the others were barely even hanging off my skin (more like bumps if anything). I applied this product to them exactly as directed for about 3-4 weeks until I started to forget to use it sometimes. I couldn&#x27;t see any changes at all until about the 4th week when I noticed the largest tag had shrunken slightly. Sadly right when I noticed a slight change, was when I lost the product and thus couldn&#x27;t use it for a week or more. I eventually found it and have barely even been using it as directed. I apply it maybe once or twice every few days, because I tend to forget and still my tags are shrinking, and I mean the difference in size is VERY significant. I think once you pass about 4 weeks of using it almost 100% as directed you will start to really wear on them and after this period you can kind of slack on it a bit. I have had no bad reaction to it whatsoever. Regardless, this product DOES work and all that is required is PATIENCE. So give it a shot and maybe spare yourself the trip to the doctor where they may charge you PER skin tag to remove. Just wait and be patient.</li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t NOT work at all!! My bf used religiously like the instructions say and I didn&#x27;t notice any type of change at all... It smells too... Finally we tied a piece of floss around it to cut off the circulation and it&#x27;s almost about to fall off only after 24 hours! I DO NOT recommend this product! It&#x27;s an expensive waste of time!</li>
            <li> Tried it haven&#x27;t noticed a difference yet but I haven&#x27;t given up yet</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t Work... Buyer Be wear</li>
            <li> this product has no good use if your having a problem with skin tag its best to go to a medical professional to have them removed</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 2 months now and none of my skin tags have disappeared. Even the smallest skin tags are just as they were 8 weeks ago. This product is very disappointing! Don&#x27;t bother wasting your money.</li>
            <li> doeas not work.  useless., bad, not good, waste of time, waste of money, this rating link reuires too many words. blecccchhh</li>
            <li> I saw Tag Awa ma ny times on TV and though I&#x27;d try it. I paid $14.99 at Walgrens and followed instructions for more tha a month -- nothing happened! There was not a sign of any skin changes, and certainly no removal of the tags.  Don&#x27;t wate your moey on this product!</li>
            <li> Having used a whole bottle of Tag Away on four different areas on face and arms, absolutely nothing happened.&lt;br /&gt;I followed all instructions but saw no reactions!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought the product to get rid of a few skin tags on my neck.  After a few weeks of applying the product as recommended, I broke out in a painful and itchy rash that persisted for months even after discontinuing use of the product.  It did not remove or diminish my skin tags, but only made them more noticeable by highlighting them with dark red splotches that crept up my entire neck.  Do not buy the product.  Instead, see a doctor and have skin tags professionally removed.</li>
            <li> I suspect Tag Away probably works.  It makes sense.  The only reason I haven&#x27;t continued using it is due to its smell.  It has a strong smell!</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 bottles of tag away through website &amp;#34;two for one&amp;#34; promotion. I have finished one bottle and really don&#x27;t like the strong smell and NO effect at all. Very disappointed to see this product is still cheating on the consumers with unreal advertisement.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t even try it.</li>
            <li> Ive been putting this stuff on a skin tag 2 to 3 times a day for 5 weeks and the skin tag is still there.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that&#x27;s changed is that I smell like ive been dipped in strong disinfectant. Its so strong that it makes my eyes water&lt;br /&gt;I wouldnt mind if it just worked</li>
            <li> No surprise this comes from the same company that makes the horrible Sobokawa Pillows. This product does not work. It does not do anything. I&#x27;m so mad right now that I used it for 3 months and got nothing in return. I had to bend over backwards to use this 3 times a day every day, It took over my life. and all for nothing. I bought this from Rite Aid, Not Amazon so I dont blame Amazon, but as a reputable company, Amazon really shouldn&#x27;t sell this worthless junk. YOU&#x27;VE BEEN WARNED! DONT BUY THIS!!</li>
            <li> you have to us it everyday for a month before it  works.</li>
            <li> One of the worst products I&#x27;ve have tried. I hate false advertising and this is clear one of them. The thing is so ridiculous that even says on the package &amp;#34;Fast and easy&amp;#34;, how can you call this thing fast if on the box it says that it takes 8 weeks and apply 3 times a day... The worst thing is that on the commercials they say &amp;#34;we will give your money back in 30 days&amp;#34;. How is that even possible!!! Next time do the math.</li>
            <li> Bought this on Saturday from local store before I read the reviews. Had a eraser sized inflamed skin tag on my neck. Didn&#x27;t have high hopes after reading the reviews here but tried it anyway . Saturday nothing. Sunday day poked it with a sterile needle and decided to keep it saturated overnight so took a same piece of a cotton ball soaked with this stuff and applied it to tag covered by bandaid it burned a little. Monday morning it looked less red but still hurt. That night applied cotton ball again. Woke up today (Tuesday)to a dark shriveled up tag that has since fallen on it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> This product does not work....at all. In fact, I have felt foolish over the past months for continuing to apply it in the hopes that it will magically have an effect at some point. Meanwhile, no change at all in the skin tags; they continue to thrive :) -- and a one star rating is more than it deserves but there was no option for a zero rating :)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work !! Sent back to sender !!!</li>
            <li> I have been putting this on since before Christmas .. It&#x27;s now Feb 18th and I still have it... I have been applying it 3-4 times a day and have never missed a day.. A lesson learned! I will just go to the Doctor to take care of it.. Save your money!</li>
            <li> I have been applying to three different tags three times a day for ten weeks and have had no results.</li>
            <li> Has a very bad smell and I used as directed it did NOT work as advertized. Save your money and just make an appointment at a real doctor to have tags removed.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t wast your money or 6 weeks 3 times a day of your time on this.</li>
            <li> It has done anything as yet.</li>
            <li> After weeks of using this product with no effects whatsoever, I followed the advice of some posters, and tried apple cider vinegar--soaked into a small wad of cotton, stuck on with medical tape.  Two days later, complete success!  The tag had totally died and came off easily. So, don&#x27;t break your heart using this product--use the vinegar.  I changed it 2x/day and kept it on at all times.</li>
            <li> I had several tags/ warts/ mole.  Used a q tip as I didn&#x27;t want to spread the virus around or in the bottle.  This wound up using up the product quickly.  I ran out after about three and a half weeks.  Some reddening on one wart, no change to tags.</li>
            <li> I RECEIVED THE PRODUCT IN A TIMELY MANNER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I AM NOT SURE HOW I FEEL ABOUT THE PRODUCT AS IT TAKES A LONG TIME FOR RESULTS.  ON TV YOU GET THE IMPRESSION THAT THE SKIN TAGS DISAPPEAR VERY QUICKLY. BUT, THE INSTRUCTIONS DO NOT SAY THAT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE PRODUCT HAS A STRONG SMELL SO YOU DO NOT WANT TO APPLY IT IF YOU ARE GOING TO BE IN CONTACT WITH SOMEONE WITHIN A FEW MINUTES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I CANNOT REVIEW THIS PRODUCT UNTIL ANOTHER MONTH HAS GONE BY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD RECOMMENT BUYING FROM THIS COMPANY AS THEY DELIVERED THE PRODUCT ON TIME.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money and does not work</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me.  Used eight weeks as instructed on several tags.  It shrunk one tags to half size.  Didn&#x27;t do much else.  Back to using nail clippers.</li>
            <li> Less than one star...Agree with everyone else..this stuff is not worth the high price you will pay for the junk...My one tag on my arm is just as big..and just as healthy as ever...It will be taken straight back to wally mart on the morning... (after a month of trying!!)</li>
            <li> has horrible smell did not work so far leaves odors on sheets and clothing wish can be applied without odor</li>
            <li> I tried this item for the two-month period 3x/day as stated on the directions. There is no change in my skin tags. I&#x27;m very disappointed in this. Now I have to get them burned off by the doctor. Would not recommend this. If I could rate a zero star, I would.</li>
            <li> Does not work - doesn&#x27;t even start to work - doesn&#x27;t even make you think it&#x27;s working - don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> This did not work. I used this for almost five weeks on a small tag under my arm. Religiously put this on 3 times a day. Nothing!</li>
            <li> I really was looking forward to getting this because it is so much more expensive to get this issue taken care of at the doctor, but after I got this I used it and it may actually work if you use it for the 3 to 6 weeks, but my husband said that I smelled so badly that I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> Used this as directed for 3 weeks and it did absolutely nothing for my skin tags.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Does not work at all... do not waste your money</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as advertised!</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 bottles of Tag Away (from TV ad) for my husband hoping it would do what it says, which is remove skin tags in 3 to 6 weeks. He has been using it faithfully  and  is discouraged and disgusted.  It simple DOES NOT WORK.  We see no change in the appearance of his skin tags at all. Do not waste your time and money or get your hopes up for this product.  It is a big disapointment.  In my opinion, they should stop selling it and refund eveyone&#x27;s money.  Does anyone know of anything that does work?  Please pos t if you do.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0096AWT72 Tag Away for Skin Tags (15 ml)- As Seen On Tv]]</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about the rest of you but I used this product and two weeks later the skin tag fell off, it worked great for me, maybe it has something to do with the type of skin you have, I put off buying it because of the bad reviews, my skin tag was cutting into my necklace so I bought it and now it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> I am surprised that a few of my smaller tags have already disappeared.  I should have ordered this a long time ago!!</li>
            <li> Very long process, got really frustrating after the first week of not seeing any changes at all.i bought a different product that worked within 3 days.</li>
            <li> To my astonishment, the stuff actually works! This product seemed too good to be true when I first saw it on TV. Then after reading all the bad reviews here, I felt even less enthusiastic about trying it. However, I do have a fair number of annoying skin tags, and as the months passed, and I kept seeing the commercial, I finally decided to give it a try. At worst, I would have wasted less than $20, and the skin tags were really annoying me. So I bought a bottle, used it as directed, and to my amazement, the skin tags are starting to fall off!! About half of them on the area I was using as a test are gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;- Zero pain&lt;br /&gt;- Works&lt;br /&gt;- Relatively inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;- A bottle lasts longer than they claim on the TV commercial&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- It smells &amp;#34;herbal&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;- It takes several weeks to work&lt;br /&gt;- You are supposed to apply it 3 times a day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The test area I was using this on is on my neck and throat, and the skin tags I had/have there are relatively small. So perhaps on really huge skin tags it might take longer? I might update this review if I try it on larger skin tags and there is a noticeable difference in how long it takes. I applied the Tag Away three times a day as directed. After about three to four weeks, the first tags started falling off. I am thrilled!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I seem to recall the TV ad saying there were &amp;#34;60 applications per bottle&amp;#34;, but this is wrong. There are FAR more than that. I have been using this on appx one quarter of the surface of my neck and throat three times a day for almost four weeks (and I really slather it on), and I have only used up about 1/8 of the contents on my 15ml bottle. So obviously there are way more than 60 applications in this bottle. My bottle came with a built in brush (kind of like a nail polish brush, it is attached to the cap). Perhaps that helps to use less product than having to use cotton swabs to soak it up and dab it on?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have an herbal smell. I don&#x27;t find it offensive at all, I think it smells rather natural and fresh, sort of like pine or cedar essential oil. However, if you are sensitive to smells or don&#x27;t like the scent of a tree, that could be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone trying to get rid of skin tags.  I purchased my bottle at my local Walmart, and the price was around $11.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDITED FOR UPDATE 7/7/2013:&lt;br /&gt;All the skin tags I used this product on are now completely gone.  I could not be more pleased!  It does take time and daily application, but for me, it was totally worth the effort.  I had quite a few skin tags on my neck, and now they are all gone and there is no trace they were ever there.  I am ready to wear low necked tops for summer with no self consciousness!  I am glad I gave this product a try despite all the negative reviews.  Not sure why it worked well for me when others say it did not for them.  Skin type difference?  More faithful application?  I have no clue, but I do know that in my case, it worked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SECOND UPDATE 10/4/15:&lt;br /&gt;The skin tags I removed with this have all stayed gone after two years, so it is a permanent solution.  I have had a few new skin tags start to develop in other areas, and I have found that if you treat them as soon as you notice them they go away even faster.  Amazingly, I am still using that original bottle I purchased, so it has a long shelf life, and is a great value.  I also bought a bottle for a friend with lots of skin tags, and it worked well for him as well.  I do have to say, I am puzzled and disappointed by all the down votes this review received, because I can&#x27;t envision HOW exactly this review is &amp;#34;unhelpful&amp;#34;??  My review is full of information about exactly how this product performed for me, how can that possibly be unhelpful?  Are people just angry because my experience was different than theirs?rather natural and fresh, sort of like pine or cedar essential oil.

            <li> TAG AWAY DOESN&#x27;T WORK.  I have wasted time applying it for months and wasted my money.  I am angry about this.  Buyer beware!  And shame on this company.  Thieves!</li>
            <li> Too bad there aren&#x27;t negative stars (black holes?) for rating this product. It&#x27;s worthless.  Tried for six weeks and used as directed.  It did absolutely nothing except stink when applied. Might as well use snake oil.  Oh, wait... maybe that&#x27;s what this is.</li>
            <li> I bought this and followed the directions to the T..Nothing happened...I still have the skin tags! Didn&#x27;t even get rid of the smaller ones...Don&#x27;t waste your money on this!! I gave it one star because it would not let me leave the rating blank.......this doesnt even deserve a 1 star rating!! I love how it says it takes 3 to 8 weeks to work but you can only get your MONEY BACK if you return it in 30 days.......Please save your money...dont buy this product</li>
            <li> This product is a joke....it simply does not work. Save your money and don&#x27;t buy this scam product. What was I thinking?</li>
            <li> I used tag away for exactly 4 weeks.  The instructions state to use it three times daily.  I only used it once daily.  The tag turned reddish-black, and a few days later was gone completely.  I&#x27;d use it again without any question.  It&#x27;s also pretty cheap.  I agree the smell is not so good.</li>
            <li> Bought Tag Away at Walmart.  I&#x27;m still working on it, but getting discouraged, so decided to look for reviews.  Guess it would have been better to have searched reviews before I bought this stuff!  Nothing has changed at all in 4 weeks! So, to make me feel less like a fool, I&#x27;m searching for other uses.  Perhaps it kills ants. Well, the smell alone should kills ants 10 feet away. Or repel skunks!!!  There&#x27;s a thought.  All I know is that it is not working and I&#x27;m feeling pretty stupid.</li>
            <li> I find it weird that so many people claim this product didn&#x27;t work for them. It worked just as advertised for me. I purchased this at my local Walgreens as a somewhat impulse buy as i was checking out. I just had a baby and the hormones caused me to develop a lot of skin tags on my neck that were starting to become unsightly. Anyways I purchased Tag Away and applied it when I got home. After a couple of days of using it, I decided to read the reviews online and to my disappointment I found a lot of negative feed back on the product. So I discontinued use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward a few days and I noticed my skin tags were getting \\&quot;loose\\&quot; and were shriveling up. I decided to continue using the product. Every day I applied various times a day depending on when I remembered (I put it in my bathroom and every time I saw it on the sink I&#x27;d apply a fresh coat). Its been about a week and a half and my largest skin tag fell off this morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue using this product and I hope others have the luck I had. I don&#x27;t understand the bad reviews, it worked perfectly for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing is, I live in South Florida and its been fairly warm here. I wondered if the higher temperatures helped the product to work faster for me. Just a thought.</li>
            <li> I have a large number under each arm. Some are small. Some are large and everything in between.  I bought two bottles and followed the regimen. It didn&#x27;t work on any of them.  Not a one.  You&#x27;d think there would be some succes on at least one or two.  But I have nothing which would lead me to keep trying or buying.</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t work AT ALL! Used it according to the instructions..it&#x27;s all gone and all the skin tags are still sitting here...looking just like they dnotid before using it. It STINKS to high heaven and may have caused damage to my respiratory system. I have at least 20 tags and some of them are miniscule...it didn&#x27;t even destroy THEM! Save your money, and your nose! Plus Melaleuca products have NO MSDS sheets so who knows how damaging some of this stuff might be in the end...Like i said, now i can&#x27;t breath properly after smelling this stuff for weeks. Ugh.</li>
            <li> bought 3 bottles jan 3rd, by April 1st. doesn&#x27;t look any different. I&#x27;ve smelled like pine sap for all that time. I kept thinking, \\&quot;maybe one more week?\\&quot; and now I don&#x27;t know how to get my money back. Oh well, what a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I had only 1 skin tag but it was rather big and ugly, luckily it was on my side close to my waist so my clothes hid it.  Anyway, my husband tied a piece of floss on it first but the floss began to dig into my skin, so I bought Tag Away at Walgreens for $14.99, I figured I am only out that much if it didn&#x27;t work.  I will admit that I was skeptical especially since it seemed to take awhile to work.  The bottle states 3 - 8 weeks and I figured my tag would take the 8 weeks.  It only took 5 1/2 weeks, and honestly I didn&#x27;t think it was doing anything but making it worse because my tag got swollen and red for most of the time, I had to wear a bandaid on it because when my clothes rubbed it, it hurt.  I think the Tag Away did irritate my skin because I experienced some itching and a minor sharp pain, like being pricked with a pin, but the pain didn&#x27;t last long.  In the fifth week, all of a sudden my tag turned black and dried up, then fell off, I didn&#x27;t even realize it had fallen off until I went to put more Tag Away on.  Yes, there is a smell but that was not a big deal to me.  I am extremely happy with this product and very glad it worked!</li>
            <li> Used it for two weeks, no results.  It is totally useless.  Freezing skin tags with a wart remover works pretty well.</li>
            <li> The product calls for daily use for 3 to 6 weeks, which I guess would be OK if it weren&#x27;t for the smell.  I used for two days and gave it up because the smell was just overpowering.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered the product Tag Away and received two for the price of 19.99.  I have used one complete bottle and about a third of the second.  I have used all the product on one skin tag and as of today there has been no change.  The color has not changed nor is there any hint of the skin tag being removed.&lt;br /&gt;I had great hope in this produce.  My doctor looked at the place on my neck and told me it was a skin tag and it should be no problem to get rid of.  So I had heard advertisements on TagAway and decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;Sure wish it worked.</li>
            <li> I used it religiously for8 weeks on one large and 6 small tags. Absolutely no change in them, it&#x27;s a total ripoff!</li>
            <li> This stuff did nothing.....would not recommend it to anyone... save your money and go to a doctor to have the tag removed</li>
            <li> Smelled like a hemlock tree for 6 weeks, had them removed by dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;He also said it doesn&#x27;t work  nufsaid.</li>
            <li> This product did not perform as they said it would it does not work even when following instructions i hope know one has the same problem</li>
            <li> While I can&#x27;t say whether this will work as advertised after using 3 times a day for several weeks, I can say that it can&#x27;t be used around other people - which about takes care of the 3 times a day requirement. it has a very strong odor similar to the muscle/pain rubbing creams.</li>
            <li> I have seen and heard this much advertised product. I have used this product 2x3 times a day for the past six weeks with no results.</li>
            <li> After 2.5 months there was litter change.&lt;br /&gt;Went to my local dermatologist and had 5 removed painlessly and in less then 5 minutes for 25$ total.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see that this product was rated so poorly.  I dad a small but annoying skin tag on my neck.  Used tag away as directed for three days and on the third evening I was able to wipe the tag right off.  No fuss  no muss no pain.  It worked foe me?</li>
            <li> My emotions have nothing to do with this product, but I chose &amp;#34;hate it&amp;#34; because that was the only choice provided in the critique. It just doesn&#x27;t work...and it stinks to high heaven...so whats the point!!! Don&#x27;t make the mistake I did!</li>
            <li> Used it faithfully everyday for 6 weeks and nothing happened.  Total waste of money . . . . but the false promises were too alluring to pass up.</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 bottles around the end of May. I usually do research on things before I buy, but this time I didn&#x27;t. After I purchased it I started reading these reviews and I became a bit concerned. Anyway I had 2 bottles now so I might as well use them. 1st thing is the bottles are very small (not what they look like in the ads). The smell to me smells like a cross between Pine Sol and BBQ lighter fluid. BUT it does go away in about 1/2 hour. I started using it June 10th 2013, I have just finished my 4th week (almost). I use it 3 times a day every day. I read that someone was applying it with their finger. This is the way to apply it. A Q Tip absorbs most of it. I just put a drop on my finger and rub it in real good. BTW I have 5 tags in my left arm pit. I am a stage performer and I can&#x27;t wear a sleeveless shirt because of them. Even though the bottles are small, by applying it with my finger I should get another week out of the 1st bottle. So about 5 weeks total per bottle. As of today...NOTHING. No change at all. When I finish both bottles I will post again. I really want this product to work, but I have my doubts. And the money back thing.... 30 days, but it says it takes 6 - 8 weeks to work. That also show me the company does not have faith in it&#x27;s product. Right? If they did it would be 9 weeks and if nothing then get your money back. That does not make sense to me. I will update as necessary.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work for crap  spent all that money applied 3x a day and it still didn&#x27;t work, finally cleared up cause I used plain sissors to cut them off that was cheaper</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give it any stars, but it made me give at least one star. It didn&#x27;t work at all. Tried it as directed and didn&#x27;t do a  thing.</li>
            <li> Do not bother wasting money on this product, I do recommend a natural way to get rid of skin tags - Lime Juice apply 2-3 times daily, doesn&#x27;t have the same horrible smell and works faster.</li>
            <li> I used this product as directed, and have been using for 6 weeks with absolutely no change.  I am very disappointed at this point.  I will keep using for a couple more weeks, hopefully there will become results.</li>
            <li> I tried this stuff for a tag that was in a very sensitive place on my body.  I used it faithfully for several weeks 3 times per day.  It did absolutely nothing.  Plus, it was the worst smelling stuff imaginable.  You could still smell it hours after applying it.  So, I decided to try the dental floss remedy and that worked in about two weeks.</li>
            <li> The only way we got this to work was not by following the directions. We ended up tying a thread around the tag and putting the medicine on it, covering it with a bandaid for a day or two and then it got really sore so we didn&#x27;t use the bandaids anymore. Continued with the medicine for maybe a week and the tag just fell off! So don&#x27;t follow the instructions, you have to sorta ghetto-rig it.</li>
            <li> I have now used this for 10 months no change , just a lost of money and it smells bad . And you just try to put it on three times a day as it tells you to .</li>
            <li> I bought two of these and followed rigorously the instructions for two full months. My skin tags are still here and even look healthier! Forget about this product. It does not smell good, it does not do the work, it&#x27;s just a loss of money!</li>
            <li> I have tried this product and have not found any result. The one thing they won&#x27;t tell you is that, you have to apply it three times a day.&lt;br /&gt;How many people would you find using this product three times a day ? You would have to go to public bathrooms to do it if you&#x27;re a working person. Also it has a very strong scent to it. Save you money.</li>
            <li> Some of the reviews said they didn&#x27;t get the real Tag Away...I bought a bottle at Walgreens and it worked.  The directions said to use three times a day and that was not doable for me.  Just in the morning and before bed.  No bad smell from my bottle either.  At first I didn&#x27;t think it was working on this old tag.  But what was their to lose and I was not using it as directed so I kept it up and after about 5-6 weeks I thought noticed a change in the tag so I persevered and after 4 months it is gone. I tried it on a odd dark funny  freckle I have had on my arm for years and nothing has worked on it, and it is making it smaller....and now as soon as I see something growing I am on it and it is working faster.  The one on my hand which I got right away just took a couple weeks, so maybe the age and size makes a difference.  I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> i am using this product for 2 weeks . I see only a small improvement. I will wait for another 4 weeks as they mentioned in the instructions and re assess the rating at htis time.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t order this again... first of all, why would anyone need two bottles?  Second of all, they don&#x27;t tell you that it&#x27;s got a very strong scent that is so overpowering that you can&#x27;t use it unless you&#x27;re going to immediately take a shower afterwards.  I don&#x27;t think it works... I couldn&#x27;t give it a chance because of the horrible smell.  Very difficult to apply and very oily!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping for good results. I hope it&#x27;s everything the television commercials led me to believe. We shall see. Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several weeks with zero results. I will say that some days it is only applied twice instead of three times. But still no discernible difference in appearance of skin tags. Will not reorder.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work the way it said.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, and fast shipment of product sooner than expected. I would buy again, and recommend friends and family to buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Tag Away for 3 or 4 weeks now.  None of my &amp;#34;tags&amp;#34; have come off.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li> It just did not work. Don&#x27;t waste your money, I really hoped it would work too bad, again don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t believe the hype just because you saw this on TV.  It does NOT work.  Even if you follow instructions to the letter it doesn&#x27;t do what it says it&#x27;s supposed to.  Skin tags do not come off.  You&#x27;re better off getting something like wart remover which does the same thing this was supposed to do and save your money.</li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t really work. I&#x27;ve been putting it on tags for 2 weeks and it&#x27;s not taking any of them off. Smells terrible too!</li>
            <li> I will not say bad things about this, or any other product that I haven&#x27;t tried. Yes that&#x27;s correct, I did not try this product, it may work fine, I don&#x27;t know but I will tell you this: DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY AND TIME WITH ANY OF THESE PRODUCTS. I read another reviewers comments on a similar product and they said use APPLE CIDER VINEGAR. I though what could it hurt, I already had some in the cupboard. IT TOOK 3 DAYS, NO JOKE. I put some vinegar on a cotton pad, used some first aid tape, heck I even used a big band aid, but something sticky enough to hold the damp cotton on to the skin will work. It turned dark gray the first day and by the second day it was all black and on the 3rd morning, it literally rubbed away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had it on over night and then took it off for work... pretty much just while I slept or when I was home and not in public (since it was on my neck). It&#x27;s gone as of this morning. APPLE CIDER VINEGAR PEOPLE. QUICK, EASY, PAINLESS, CHEAP! Only down side is that you have a faint odor of apple cider vinegar. Big whoop, it works AWESOME.</li>
            <li> What I mean by the above statement is that this product takes 3-5 weeks before you see any results.  If I had known that, I probably would have contacted the manufacturer to ask how long it takes before you see any kind of results.  On TV, especially in commercials, ad people always try to make the product look good; in this case, they made it look like this product gets rid of those dumb &amp;#34;skin tags&amp;#34; within days.  Taking 3-5 weeks is just too long.</li>
            <li> It stinks so bad I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> After using half the bottle ,my husband didn&#x27;t see any difference on his tags. He also hated the smell. he has stopped using it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product at Wal Mart, The smell is awful, but it actually works for me. I read that tying the tag cuts the blood supply, so prior to applying Tag Away I tie the tag with thread. I apply 2 to 3 times a day and within a week the tag falls off.</li>
            <li> I bought two bottles of Tag Away and I am close to finishing the second bottle.  I used it on 3 areas at first, and finally decided to focus on only one skin tag to see if I could create a productive result.  The skin tag I used the second bottle on looks EXACTLY like it did in the beginning.  The stuff stinks and it doesn&#x27;t work.  Save your money for a future trip to a good dermatologist.  This is a joke.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve applied this product 3 times a day faithfully for 7 weeks now and I haven&#x27;t seen anything happen.  The tags were supposedly to fall off after 3 to 8 weeks.  Since I&#x27;m on my 7th week, I&#x27;ll see what happens after another week but it doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s going to do what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> I tried this and see nothing happening. They tell you 3 to six weeks....almost as long just waiting for them to rub off.</li>
            <li> I bought this product about 9 weeks ago and have been using it diligently as suggested for about 8 1/2 weeks.  No positive results noted-this product did not work for me.  Very disappointed with results as no disclaimer noted on advertisements about it not working for all users.</li>
            <li> There is no way you can use this product 3 times a day if have to be around other people.  It&#x27;s smells terrible.  Unfortunately, my tags are on my neck so the smell is just out there for everyone to smell.  I tried just using it when I got home, before I went to bed and on the weekends but that didn&#x27;t work.  When I put it on before bed, I couldn&#x27;t sleep because of the terrible smell.  I wore it only once to work and several people asked \\&quot;What&#x27;s that smell\\&quot;.  It might work if you use it correctly but the smell kept me from being able to use it correctly.</li>
            <li> This product performs as advertised.  Only took a few days to remove the one skin tag I had. Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I am still using it, nothing has happened yet,  I don&#x27;t always use it three times a day but always at least once or twice. I ended up having one taken of at the dermatologist office the other day, just couldn&#x27;t wait, but I do see them turning dark and I am still trying it because I want to see if it does work.</li>
            <li> I thought is was just me and I was not using this correctly.  I have used this and followed directions just as they said and nothing.  I agree the smell is awful and made me feel sick.</li>
            <li> Total waste of time and money.  By the time you realize that it doesn&#x27;t work......it&#x27;s too late to get a refund.</li>
            <li> For the price I paid for this stuff was useless. To me this product is just a scam to get your money. I have almost a full bottle and it does not work. Do not buy it.</li>
            <li> I used this as Instructed but nothing ever fell off... I hated the smell and having to put it on more then twice a day really bugged being nothing fell off... wouldn&#x27;t buy it just go to dr and get them clipped...</li>
            <li> I have used Tag away for approximately 4 months now and there has been absolutely no change in my skin tag.  DOES NOT WORK!</li>
            <li> Absolutely no complaints here. I applied it 3 times a day per the simple instructions and it removed two small skin tags for me in less than a week. One was on my neck and one was under my arm. They just dried up, turned black, and fell right off completely and painlessly. Larger skin tags would certainly take a bit longer, but I am confident they too would fall off if a person stuck with the treatment regimen for the recommended three weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a strong, campho-like medicine smell when it goes on, but I certainly don&#x27;t consider this to be offensive, at least not to normal humans. However, anyone who discovers they don&#x27;t have the required self-discipline and patience could certainly use this as an excuse to complain and give up. I did think it was a little pricey at first, but now I realize there is pretty much a lifetime supply of it in the bottle. I bet I could remove twenty five more tags of similar size with what is left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though a few probably had hypersensitive bloodhound nostrils and just couldn&#x27;t take the smell, (my wife certainly falls into this category), I am willing to bet that most negative reviewers either didn&#x27;t follow the instructions, or were expecting a miracle. Like I said, my skin tags were small. I didn&#x27;t wait till they needed their own birth certificate to try something. If your so called \\&quot;skin tag\\&quot; resembles a third ear, PLEASE, just see a plastic surgeon and don&#x27;t waste your time with Tag Away. Then you won&#x27;t feel a need to discourage others by posting a scathing, critical review of this great product here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$.02&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - LOL! I see a few of those with gerbil sized \\&quot;skin tags\\&quot; are venting their frustration on my candid yet honest review. Fire away, folks! I guess the truth hurts, huh?</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that this works. It shriveled up the skin tag and then fell off. I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I was able to get rid of mine, with a regular applications (three times a day) of pure Tea Tree oil. Tea Tree still is not very pleasant smelling, it is camphorous, so it has a very sterile kind of medical smell, and it can be very strong. I would recommend using a Tea Tree balm or salve, as it is generally thicker, so it may not need to be applied quite as much. Honestly, I think anything that would seriously dry out your skin would work, perhaps even alcohol if used regularly on the same skin tag would offer similar results. This product however, is mostly bunk. I think the only reason it has any success at all, is that it contains some amount of tea tree, it also has several other ingredients that there is no logical reason to assume would work for a skin tag, and the &amp;#34;main ingredient&amp;#34; is in a &amp;#34;homeopathic dilution&amp;#34; which pretty much means, the main ingredient, is not present... it exists in 1 part per one million parts of water, (a 6X dilution). If you bought this because it&#x27;s homeopathic... you need an education, homeopathy gives results only in your head. Some homeopathic products claim to use a dilution, so dilute that not even a molecule of the original substance remains... think about that for a moment...</li>
            <li> I used this product for well over the recommended time period and had followed the recommended dosage.  I saw very little difference in the size of my skin tags.  They were a bit smaller, well one of the tags was that I could tell.  But even that little progress took many months to achieve.  Some tags I saw no difference at all.  My summary of this product is too little results from too much investment in time to apply.</li>
            <li> i used this stuff for 8 weeks, 3 times a day.  never missed an application. there is absolutely no change in my skin tags. regarding the \\&quot;it really works\\&quot; reviews...they are most likely company employees or distributors.  do not waste your money.  the product does not work.</li>
            <li> THE BOTTLE INDICATES 3 TIMES A DAY - FOR 3-8 WEEKS TO WORK............WILL UPDATE RESULTS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!!!!!  WORKING OR NOT!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TADA!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;STARTED USING August 7, 2013, TAGS REMOVED OCTOBER 21, 2013</li>
            <li> I tried tag away and, being a clinical pharmacologist, strictly adhered to the directions for use.  It has been over one month and there is no visible change to my skin tags.  I&#x27;ve researched the \\&quot;active\\&quot; ingredients and there is no data to support their efficacy.......and it smells BAD !  A complete waste of money</li>
            <li> I had a Skin Tag under my arm, and I had had it for years. It was small, but it would get irritated whenever I would exercise. i went to the doctor, and they said it would be about $150 bucks to get rid of it, which i wasn&#x27;t about to pay. I saw Tag Away a couple years after that visit, and figured that it wouldn&#x27;t work, but it was a lot cheaper than the doctor, so what they hay right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I truly didn&#x27;t think it would do anything for me, and when you do put it on it smells like a form of Eucalyptus, though quite strong. I followed the schedule relatively close. some days two applications, others 3, and about 5 weeks later, the tag just went black, and dried out. it happened over about three days, but after that, it was like having a loose scab under my arm. I mean that literally, because every time I went to pull it off, there was the similar pain of picking a scab.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, about a week after that, it simply fell off, and no scar. Personally I would recommend it. It&#x27;s considerably cheaper than a doctor, though based on these reviews I&#x27;d say not effective for everyone. Is it worth a shot... in my opinion, absolutely. Do a cost comparison with your family doctor first, then decide for yourself if the cost is worth it.</li>
            <li> I purchased Tag Away for Skin Tags and it did not work at all! All it did was smell really bad and stung my skin. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> its a piece of junk it doesnt even work ? . . i think ill have this crap on my skin forever .</li>
            <li> It works!  It doesn&#x27;t smell good but it works!  I use it daily and those &amp;#34;tags&amp;#34; are just falling off.  I was quoted $2,000 to have them lasered off but, if you&#x27;re patient, this works just as well!</li>
            <li> Who has time to put this stinky stuff on 3 times a day for 3 months.</li>
            <li> After a while it irritated my skin around mole.  Skin got itchy, red and darkened.</li>
            <li> Only 30 days in to it with no noticeable affect, yet. Hope it does work. I know it could take up to 60 or more days.</li>
            <li> Rip off ....... I was taken. Sent a letter to our stat AG.  These people should be thrown in jail.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time. This just did not do what it is supposed to do. Smells really bad too. All hype, no results.</li>
            <li> Absolutely does not work. What a was of $15.00.  Have applied TAG AWAY 2-3 times per day for about 6 weeks and nothing is happening.  They say it takes 3-8 weeks.  No way this is going to work.  Save your money!</li>
            <li> The product is very strong smelling. I have used it for 6 weeks with no results. Very disappointed. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I used tag away 3 times daily for almost 6 weeks before I got tired of this product , instructions tell you to use 3-8 weeks but I used up the 2nd bottle with no hint that my skin tag is drying up or about to go away. Didn&#x27;t work for me at all ! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this stuff to anyone !</li>
            <li> I tried it for 6 weeks, no improvement to report. The website purchase form (several companies are doing this) is convoluted. If you want one bottle plus the free one (as advertised on TV) they try to dupe you and you wind up purchasing two boxes containing a total of four bottles. The bill will come out to about $60, then you have have to hassle to return the product at your expense. They provide a stick-on to put on the outside of the box with a bar code that (they tell you)has their return addy embedded, but in fact it is not, and you have to write the return addy on the sticky. If you forget to take their address with you to the post office, the post office will not mail it. The product doesn&#x27;t work. Even after six weeks of using this product, there should have been at least a slight improvement but there wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Used it faithfully but without any change or results at all.  For me, it was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Used this product as directed on the label for 6 weeks 3 times a day. It has a horrible smell and I was very disappointed that for 6 weeks it did absolutely nothing. What an absolute disappointment!</li>
            <li> It arrived to my house in a broken bottle so i never got to use it.  I never got around to reordering.</li>
            <li> This product WORKS!  You need to be patient and apply religiously, but I can vouch for the fact that it does work. I recommend this stuff for removal of your minor skin tags.</li>
            <li> This is a waste of time. Crap product. Don&#x27;t get sucked in to buying this it is snake oil. Stay away.</li>
            <li> It does not work and it is extremely expensive.  I used it for 12 weeks and the skin tag is STILL there.  I am taking it back to Walmart for a full refund.  The best thing to do is go into your doctor&#x27;s office and have your skin tags removed there.  It&#x27;s covered my most insurance.  I give this product zero stars because it does not do what it claims.  It smells very medicinal which makes you believe it works.  IT DOES NOT!!!</li>
            <li> A simple product to use just read the directions, but it doesn,t give any idea on how long you will have to use it to get the desired effects.</li>
            <li> Does not work! Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product, I try it  for 10 weeks and did not work at all!</li>
            <li> results taking a little longer than expected, but I am seeing results.</li>
            <li> I have treated 18 tags ranging in size from a pencil head to an eraser for eight weeks with zero results. The only thing this product was capable of effectively removing was money from my wallet! As with most of the products of this kind advertised on TV they prey on people and give them false hope and bad info. Go to WEB MD and read about their main ingredient Thuja Occidentalis had I done this first I would have never used this product.</li>
            <li> I have to believe the people who say it does not work did not apply it correctly. I had already purchased Tag Away when I came upon this site and these bad reviews. I started to believe I had wasted my money, but I continued applying Tag Away anyway. I put it on 4-5 times a day for about a week. The tag on my face, which was about 1/8 \\&quot; x 3/8 \\&quot;, started turning dark then suddenly just was not there. This stuff works if you apply it right. I bought my product at Rite Aid for $15. The online offers of $29.95 plus $10 shipping are ridiculous. $40 for what you can buy retail for $15? These rip offs artists should be taken out and tortured then shot. There are too many greedy people in this world.</li>
            <li> It did,nt work at all , I would,nt recommend it to anyone. This product did absolutely nothing for me ,but take my money.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY! This product does not work! I tried it on six small tags regularly for two months. Applied it three times a day without a missed application. It made no difference to the tags at all. Not only did it not work, but it smelled so awful it was almost unbearable. Total waste of your money! This product should be taken off the market. SCAM !!!!! Don&#x27;t say you weren&#x27;t warned.</li>
            <li> Product literally stinks. The smell made it impossible for me to use long enough to find out if it works.</li>
            <li> Use on four tags for about ten weeks.  Did absolutely nothing but waste my time.  Save your money and don&#x27;t buy this one.</li>
            <li> Been using for 5 weeks and so far has not worked at all. No difference noted in the area applied</li>
            <li> Absolutely a scam.  Boycott this band of thieves.</li>
            <li> the smell is awful...it might do what it says but if u want to smell like crap use it. Sorry....</li>
            <li> Product is not working did not meet my expectations. it has an unpleasant odor.you stated that it works In 6 weeks but you have 30 days for return</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on week 4 I think, they have change colors a few times, but still there.  This stuff smells horrible, cant stand it much longer, I&#x27;m going to call it a complete  waste of money, unless you like smelling bad.</li>
            <li> Does not do anything except frustrate you! Do not waster your time. Do not waste your money. Useless, Useless. Useless.</li>
            <li> A waste of money! This smells terrible, kinda like witch hazel. You can&#x27;t put on and go to work. I used over 1 month and saw no change at all. These guys should be closed down. This is one you should stay away from!</li>
            <li> This product is NOT the Tag-Away seen on TV.  It&#x27;s Naturasil.  It comes with no directions, so I don&#x27;t know how often I&#x27;m supposed to apply it.  It says it&#x27;s made of \\&quot;100% Natural Plant Extracts\\&quot; but it has a strong chemical smell.  I only used a drop and the aroma is so strong that I&#x27;m getting a headache.  I don&#x27;t know what kind of \\&quot;plants\\&quot; they used -- maybe they got them from Chernobyl.  I don&#x27;t know whether or not it works because I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be able to reapply it.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for the recommended period of up to eight weeks.  It didn&#x27;t work at all!  Then when I tried to pursue the guarantee \\&quot;or your money back\\&quot; I was told the guarantee expired after 30 days!</li>
            <li> This item is junk. Used for 10 weeks and nothing about it works. Plus the smell stinks.  The warranty is no good.</li>
            <li> Was worried when I saw all of the negative reviews on this site--and when I saw that it could take 5 weeks for this product to work.  I&#x27;m thrilled to say this product worked great and my irritating neck skin tag turned black and fell off within 4 days of using this product.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  As to the negative reviews, no idea where they&#x27;re coming from (perhaps they are all dermatologists that would like to charge several hundred dollars to do the same?).  Give it a shot--I got mine at Rite-Aide--pretty cheap and the bottle will no doubt last forever given my experience.</li>
            <li> I USED TAG AWAY FOR ABOUT 10-12 WEEKS AND IT DID NOTHING AT ALL!  I DID NOT NOTICE ANY CHANGES.</li>
            <li> I bought and used 3 times a day as directions say. After about six weeks  nothing seemed to be happening so I started putting more on and 4 times per day. Six more and still nothing. Total waste of money.Great guarantee, 30 days but takes 56 days for results.</li>
            <li> The product claims 3-6 weeks to work.  The product does not work at all.  I would challenge this company to produce any documented unbiased results.  Out of 5 stars, I expect the company to give me stars since they got my money for medicinal smelling water.  Save your money, it just doesn&#x27;t work...PERIOD.</li>
            <li> My Mom used this product as directed and her tag fell off after a week! I am using it now, will update with my own results.</li>
            <li> Product did not work after several weeks of use. Smell is awful and unbearable at times. Since my tag was on my neck the smell was very strong and caused headaches. I have not used the product in several months and my skin is itchy and painful to the touch where I was applying it on top of the skin tag still being there. So basically all it did was give me headaches and irritate he skin on my neck where my tag remains.</li>
            <li> Used it for several weeks past the instructions recommended use andit never showed signs of working on my small tags. It stinks! Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This does not work at all. I have been using it faithfully for 10 weeks and have had no results.  And, it has a terrible odor, so it can not be worn in public, and it gets into sheets and clothes.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> great product fast shipping</li>
            <li> TOTAL CRAP!!!!      Rubbing Crap on skin tags would probably work and smell better than Tag Away......</li>
            <li> My wife uses Tea Tree Oil. Put oil on tag, cover it with bandaid, repeat daily for about a month. Scab slowly disappears. You can find Tea Tree Oil online for as low as $4 a bottle.</li>
            <li> I bought this online after seeing the convincing tv ad... It&#x27;s a scan. I could bare the smell if only it worked. If anything my skin tag looks healthy and I have used it for 2 months plus on my second bottle...don&#x27;t bother...looking for something else.</li>
            <li> I guess everyone bought this crap at the same time and it took this long to realize the scam. I was willing to try it a little longer but she gave me the ultimatum, that stinking crap or her.Since it wasn&#x27;t working after 3 months, no problem.The application with a qtip is really part of the mistique .....is it not working because I&#x27;m not doing it right. Oh it really is no stars.</li>
            <li> Remove your own skin tags by dabbing dental orajel on them, when they become numb cut with a small nail scissors and wipe with peroxide, no big deal.</li>
            <li> I wish I had taken a picture of the growth on my belly before I started using it.  It didn&#x27;t go away but much smaller.  I just started using Tag Away recently and I am consistent.  I was told by my doctor that I cannot use my insurance to get it removed because &#x27;it is a beauty procedure&#x27; even thought it bothered me a lot.  I wish I could find one for my lip... There is a growth also and the dentist told me my co pay is $700.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is helping me connect with homeopathic ....procedures and medicine.</li>
            <li> So far this product has done NOTHING and the worst part is the smell! OMG I would rather have 10 more sking tags than use it anymore. A friend of mine who is a hunter says it remind him od deer urine! DON&#x27;T buy it! Unless you want to smell miserable 3 times a day for 8 weeks!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works or not, I have yet to get past the odor.  It really is pungent, it may work, I just don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working fast for my mom. I thought it didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> It has Works for both skin tags and a NEW skin-colored mole that suddenly appeared. Patience! My first experience was with the original product which had you tough the tag up basically with an empty board be for applying it. When done correctly (burning feeling) the product worked within a few days to a week of application. It first starts to shrivel, then turn black and then falls off.  In the case of the Mike, it hardened and fell off. I&#x27;m committed. Much better than a trip to DR.</li>
            <li> Save your money and this is the most useless products to claim to remove skin tags...This product is nothing more then a fraud...Save your money.</li>
            <li> I should have known.  I don&#x27;t think I have ever bought anything from a TV ad that works and this is the same.  Just a con job to get your money.  The guarantee is worthless.  The only one I can blame is me for being such a sucker.</li>
            <li> After weeks of use I saw no effect on skin tags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please be aware, this stuff stinks to high Heaven.</li>
            <li> I have used tag away for 2 months and nothing has happened.  I used it as directed with no results.  It smells like tea tree oil, that doesn&#x27;t work either.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This product not only did not remove my skin tag but it made it worse. The tag has swollen and hurts when anything rubs against it. I&#x27;m even going to have to go to the doctor for treatment. Horrible product with equally horrible results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this didn&#x27;t work for so many...but it was amazing for me, it did exactly what the ad said it would. I had 5 ugly skin tags on the side and back of my neck,one was very big,the size and color of a pencil eraser. I applied it twice a day, morning and night, and I used my finger to apply it,the little brush didn&#x27;t get enough on. I rubbed it firmly on, pressing hard going in circles. After two weeks they were shriveled and dried out, and by 4 weeks they all fell off, leaving a tiny pink dot, which soon disappeared. Worked GREAT for me! And actually it doesn&#x27;t smell horrible, and it goes away in 30 minutes or so. I give it an A plus!</li>
            <li> Ok, first of all the smell. I&#x27;ve read many complaints about it and it certainly is strong (though it does go away rather quickly as the product dries). Personally, I didn&#x27;t find it that objectionable, sort of like a really pungent pine or cedar. However, my teenage daughter thought it smelled like cat urine, so your mileage may vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So how does it work?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well...don&#x27;t expect any miracles overnight. After about three weeks my smaller skin tags dried up and turned brown. Now I wouldn&#x27;t say they fell of totally painlessly, but they did come off, usually when I was washing the area they would catch on the wash cloth and pull off, with a quick pinprick of pain and some redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I also had a couple larger skin tags under my arms, (a bit larger than a grain of rice), although these also turned brown and got a&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;pruny\\&quot; appearance on the surface, the product never seemed to penetrate that deep and even after six weeks they were still firmly attached. I eventually gave up and had my doctor burn them off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Conclusion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a few small skin tags and don&#x27;t mind the smell and the wait, the product works as intended. However, if you have many or larger tags, you are probably better off saving your money and going to the dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with this product .. Used it for over a month and&lt;br /&gt;does not do as stated on label or by advertising.. Very unhappy...!!!</li>
            <li> DO NOT buy this. It doesn&#x27;t work. You can even apply 10 times a day, doesn&#x27;t matter, your tags will stay!!! Don&#x27;t waste your  money.</li>
            <li> DOES NOT WORK AND IT STINKS.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money. Rip off !!!!</li>
            <li> Instructions say to use for 3-8 weeks. I used it for the entire 2 month time and it did absolutely nothing. I could deal with the nasty smell if it worked, but it doesn&#x27;t. Apple cider vinegar is supposed to work also, but it did nothing for me either.</li>
            <li> If I could give this product a negative star, it would be -5 star. Total waste of time and money! I used it on one tiny skin tag for over 10 weeks and it did absolutely NOTHING. And the smell is awful. Worst product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> It has an offensive odor. To date no skin tags have been removed. If I could get past the smell, I could apply Tag Away more often.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for 2-weeks but I have not seen a difference in my skin tag.  It smells really strong.</li>
            <li> Nothing happened. The irritation went down alittle but the skin tag is still there and the smell wasn&#x27;t too bad</li>
            <li> I have used two bottles for three skin tags.Followed their directions. it did nothing except make me smell bad. the odor of the product is horrible.Went through the embarrassing smell for nothing.When friends have asked me how it works, I have told them do not waste your money.I have yet to have spoken to someone who has used this product that it actually did as claimed.</li>
            <li> I used this produce as directed for 4 full weeks. I applied it three times a day, hoping that the tags would come off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing happened. The tags don&#x27;t look any different from when I first started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All it really did was smell bad. If I would have thrown my money into the trash can, I would have had the same result.</li>
            <li> it does not work as quickly as implied on TV, it also has a strong smell, it is not something you want to use and then go out in public. unless you don&#x27;t mind people wrinkling their nose up and staring at you.</li>
            <li> Not only did it not work, but the smell was nauseating.  I had more than one person ask \\&quot;What the hell is that smell?\\&quot;  My skin tags are still there and I think there are a few more.</li>
            <li> It took only two weeks once a day then one day with a bandage soaked with a few drops and bam! Two days after that - gone!!!!  I will always use this product!!</li>
            <li> I used Tag Away according to directions for 8 weeks and nothing happened, so I continued to use it for 13 weeks.  Still no results.  Absolute rip off.  Amazon should discontinue selling it.  So far, the only thing that I have found that works to remove skin tags is to cut it off with small scissors.  I also tried fingernail polish, which did not work.</li>
            <li> The seller did a good job of selling their great product to me.</li>
            <li> I purchased Tag Away 4 weeks ago and have applied it to 3 different skin tags 3 times a day for the last 4 weeks straight! The Skin Tags are still there with no signs of leaving.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t wast your money. Just go to a Dr and have them taken off with laser.</li>
            <li> The product absolutely does not work at all.I used two bottles Three times a day for six weeks and not even the slightest sign of the tags removal.Tagaway should be renamed my money away or no tagaway.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 3.5 weeks, still no results and smells like you put on vicks vapor rub/terrible.</li>
            <li> still waiting to see if this really works., nice&lt;br /&gt;product but I think I have to keep putting this&lt;br /&gt;on as the direction stated. its been over three&lt;br /&gt;weeks now, still applying. can&#x27;t say too much&lt;br /&gt;more as of yet.</li>
            <li> IF YOU HAVE TAGS UNDER THE ARMPITS YOU REALLY DON&#x27;T WANT A LIQUID APPLICATION. THINK ABOUT IT. YOU HOLD YOUR ARMS UP FOR 1 HOUR AFTER YOU APPLY---LOL</li>
            <li> Smells terribly and could not be consistent applying it. (6 weeks?)</li>
            <li> I used the product as directed for three months with no results-waste of money.</li>
            <li> Did not work. Still have skin tabs. Terrible smell. Used exactly as directed.  Was very disappointed.  Should be pulled for sale.</li>
            <li> I used this for a neck tag and it worked right away. I was pleasently surprised as I&#x27;ve never tried anything like this before.</li>
            <li> This stuff DOES NOT WORK! I used it consistently-3-4 times a day for weeks and absolutely nothing happened to the skin tag. It didn&#x27;t change in color, size or appearance. It stayed exactly the same. This oil has a HORRIFIC odor that lasts for hours and hours as well. YUCK.</li>
            <li> If you buy this stuff you get what you deserve.  Nothing.  But you will be a few bucks Lighter and perhaps a little smarter. And whatever you do don&#x27;t call number on the TV ad and buy.  You can but be prepared to get snake oil and bombarded by telemarketing.  You have been forewarned. Don&#x27;t get ripped off.</li>
            <li> I tried tag away as directed, two bottles, absolutely nothing nothing happened, gave them the benefit of the doubt and reordered two more bottles. Well only goes to show you I was fooled twice.If you read the guarantee it&#x27;s only good for 30 day&#x27;s, and they claim it takes 6 to 8 weeks to work. should have figured out right there. Save your money IT IS A SCAM. NOTE!!!! had to put at least 1 star in the rating to post this review, but it&#x27;s not worth ANY STARS.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this product for 8 weeks and her skin tag is the same.&lt;br /&gt;Awful smell.&lt;br /&gt;Not as advertise</li>
            <li> I have used this product on a skin tag I didn&#x27;t even think it would work on because of the size. I used product as directed and it worked! The smell of the product isn&#x27;t pleasant but worth it! Thank you Thank you</li>
            <li> I have put up with the smell, the soreness that came from the product use, and NO PROGRESS. I will continue use until the damn bottle is empty, applying 3 times per day, and liberally at that....then I can say, for sure....IT did NOT work for ME.</li>
            <li> I was able to deal with the odor for five days, but after that it began to effect my breathing. My breath would catch when the fumes hit me in the face. It even made my apartment smell like a retirement home.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for myself and husband and used it as directed on instructions. After 2 months of daily use I can only tell you this \\&quot;DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT\\&quot;, it does not work and the smell makes you nauseous. I am more upset with myself then the product because I should have known better.</li>
