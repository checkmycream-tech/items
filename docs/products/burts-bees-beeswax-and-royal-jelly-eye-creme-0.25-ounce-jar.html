            <li>Love this product, have used many eye creams but never has anything performed like this Burt Bee&#x27;s royal jelly.</li>
            <li>like is it&#x27;s quite greasy, more of an ointment.</li>
            <li>Love the combo.</li>
            <li>YES, it is more like an ointment texture.</li>
            <li>I love putting this around my eyes each night.  </li>
            <li>Great stuff and gentle</li>
            <li>The area under my eyes seemed more puffy in the morning.</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees Beeswax &amp; Royal Jelly Eye Cream is BEYOND FABULOUS.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So worth it!</li>
            <li>Gives the eye area a very hydrated smooth look.</li>
            <li>Althought i am young, my area around the eye has been dry compared to the rest of my face and let me tell you this is BY FAR the BEST i&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Just finished my first jar and am reordering another.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite products, I use it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>I really like this Royal Jelly eye cream.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>But very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Really helps with the fine lines and dry, thin-looking skin.</li>
            <li>As you get older the skin around the eye gets dryer, the bees wax holds the moisture in.  </li>
            <li>Highly, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I live in the desert</li>
            <li>(I have very sensitive skin/eyes)</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin very soft by morning...</li>
            <li>WOW it does burn!</li>
            <li>I previously used an expensive eye cream with a fancy applicator, and I like the results of my Burt&#x27;s Bees much better, and it is much more affordable!  </li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant enough, but as others have mentioned, this cream is very thick.</li>
            <li>66 years old and no eye wrinkles yet.</li>
            <li>I wake up in the morning with no lines or wrinkles around the eye, and I&#x27;m 43 years old.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still young</li>
            <li>But you know what, makes my undereye as soft as it can be when i wake up in the morning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it should be called  &#x27;not to near the eye cream&#x27;.</li>
            <li>If you put it &#x27;near&#x27; the eye \, it creeps into the eye and  </li>
            <li>The only one I found which is easy on the eye if it enters and it usually does.</li>
            <li>I find it hard to smooth on without tugging, even after warming it between my fingertips before applying.</li>
            <li>My eyes get tired after working at my computer most of the day and I rub my eyes.  </li>
            <li>A bit thick, but I just apply lightly when wearing it during the day under make up.</li>
            <li>I get dry skin around my eyes because of my Proactiv face wash, and I couldn&#x27;t seem to find a product that would hydrate my eyes without completely burning them!</li>
            <li>This eye cream was very thick and did not go on smoothly.  </li>

            <li> and it&#x27;s cold and super dry here right now.  </li>
            <li> so no major lines to repair</li>
            <li> This eye creme has definitely helped my dry eyes.  </li>
            <li> I have not noticed any change because it has not been very long.</li>
            <li> Under eye looks refreshed even when had limited sleep.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very heavy, and I only wear it at night.</li>

            <li> longer, thicker, and less brittle.</li>
            <li> I really was not expecting this eye cream to stand up to the expensive eye creams that I usually use but guess what?</li>
            <li> a few minutes before I put on my make up.</li>
            <li> All those $80+ eye creams were a waste compared to this Royal jelly.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for at least 10 years.  </li>
            <li> In addition, it makes my eyelashes thick and silky.  </li>
            <li> YES, it is thick.</li>
            <li> It can be hard to order cosmetics for fear they melt or are damaged, but no problems!</li>
            <li> It has a very thick texture</li>
            <li> You can never go wrong with Burts Bees.</li>

            <li> 66 years old and no eye wrinkles yet. Using for 20 years</li>
            <li> This is the best eye cream that I have ever used. Being a woman of an age where we worry about those lines and wrinkles, I have tried a great many lotions, creams and potions for may face and eye area. I really was not expecting this eye cream to stand up to the expensive eye creams that I usually use but guess what? I truly think it is better! I don&#x27;t only use it at night before I go to bed but I also use just a tad a few minutes before I put on my make up. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I love this and have been using it for years. It&#x27;s very heavy, and I only wear it at night. I wake up in the morning with no lines or wrinkles around the eye, and I&#x27;m 43 years old. Gives the eye area a very hydrated smooth look. I hope that I can always get this.</li>
            <li> This eye cream was very thick and did not go on smoothly.  I felt that it pulled at the skin around my eyes which defeats the purpose of the eye cream in my opinion</li>
            <li> Best eye cream around even for these old eyes</li>
            <li> This is the only eye cream that I&#x27;ll use.  I use it morning and evening.  As you get older the skin around the eye gets dryer, the bees wax holds the moisture in.  My eyes get tired after working at my computer most of the day and I rub my eyes.  This cream stays on and keeps me from damaging the tender skin around my eye when I rub them.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Beeswax &amp; Royal Jelly Eye Cream is BEYOND FABULOUS.  I have been using it for at least 10 years.  It erases wrinkles around my eyes.  Also,  I have hereditary dark circles and this cream lightens them up.  In addition, it makes my eyelashes thick and silky.  I have tried others and nothing comes close to Burt&#x27;s Bees Beeswax &amp; Royal Jelly Eye Cream.  Highly, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Really helps with the fine lines and dry, thin-looking skin.I use it at night only b/c it is really thick. I swear my eyelashes love it too ... longer, thicker, and less brittle.</li>
            <li> best eye cream ive ever used. noticed results in 2 weeks. I&#x27;m still young so no major lines to repair but it&#x27;s made my eye skin softer and smoother. my eyes look 60% healthier. will never stop using this!</li>
            <li> Love this product, have used many eye creams but never has anything performed like this Burt Bee&#x27;s royal jelly. Under eye looks refreshed even when had limited sleep. All those $80+ eye creams were a waste compared to this Royal jelly. Reduces under eye circles and dismisses lines. Best product</li>
            <li> I really like this Royal Jelly eye cream.  Just finished my first jar and am reordering another.  I previously used an expensive eye cream with a fancy applicator, and I like the results of my Burt&#x27;s Bees much better, and it is much more affordable!  Seems to reduce my eye puffiness, and keeps my skin and eye lashes well moisturized.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. No damage to product. It can be hard to order cosmetics for fear they melt or are damaged, but no problems!</li>
            <li> I was recommended this product by a friend and it has been a life saver! I get dry skin around my eyes because of my Proactiv face wash, and I couldn&#x27;t seem to find a product that would hydrate my eyes without completely burning them! (I have very sensitive skin/eyes) Anyway, this product is amazing! A bit thick, but I just apply lightly when wearing it during the day under make up.</li>
            <li> This eye creme has definitely helped my dry eyes.  I live in the desert and it&#x27;s cold and super dry here right now.  I put this on at night and the skin around my eyes still feels moist in the morning.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> greasy- can only use it at night. But very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years.  There is no product like it.  A small container lasts a long, long time because you use so little each each application.</li>
            <li> I have been using the burts bees royal jelly/beeswax eye cream for about 2-3 weeks. The only thing I don&#x27;t  like is it&#x27;s quite greasy, more of an ointment.I have to use it at night because of that. I have not noticed any change because it has not been very long.</li>
            <li> Awesome eye cream! I cannot express how much i loved this product! It has a very thick texture so i use it as a night eye cream and during the day i use the Burts bees hydration eye cream as well. Love the combo. Althought i am young, my area around the eye has been dry compared to the rest of my face and let me tell you this is BY FAR the BEST i&#x27;ve used. YES, it is thick. YES, it is more like an ointment texture. YES, it is sticky! But you know what, makes my undereye as soft as it can be when i wake up in the morning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So worth it!</li>
            <li> Excellent eye jelly.  The only one I found which is easy on the eye if it enters and it usually does.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite products, I use it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin very soft by morning...but it is sort of greasy when putting it on. Can only use at night or makeup will smear.</li>
            <li> I love putting this around my eyes each night.  Great stuff and gentle</li>
            <li> Great Product.  You can never go wrong with Burts Bees.</li>
            <li> This might work for others, but not for me. The scent is pleasant enough, but as others have mentioned, this cream is very thick. I find it hard to smooth on without tugging, even after warming it between my fingertips before applying. I also think I may have had a bit of a reaction to the formula. The area under my eyes seemed more puffy in the morning.</li>
            <li> They call it &#x27;eye&#x27; cream but it should be called  &#x27;not to near the eye cream&#x27;. If you put it &#x27;near&#x27; the eye \, it creeps into the eye and  WOW it does burn! I use it for my forehead now.</li>
