            <li>This is one of my favorite colors</li>

            <li>It has sort of a matte finish, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for then you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a cute summer color for my nails.</li>
            <li>Lovely color.</li>
            <li>This color was cute.</li>
            <li>The color was perfect, if only it would be smooth while applying it.l.l,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect pink with a tinge of peach.</li>
            <li>It applies smoothly, it removes easily.</li>
            <li>The applicate of this varnish is absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li>Perfect for all year round.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic color for spring and summer.</li>
            <li>Was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>But luckily I hopped on Amazon and found if $3 cheaper</li>
            <li>So I will use this polish when I go in for a manicure at the places that let you bring your own polish (have found higher end salons don&#x27;t always allow polish other than their own).  </li>
            <li>She said the item was great and now she has only 100 different colors and needs more.</li>
            <li>Very neutral and easy to wear.</li>
            <li>and it really is nice and shiney, unlike some I have recently purchased from another company.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s by far my favorite Essie color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about this color</li>
            <li>Overall, gorgeous color and a highly recommended purchase.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still a pretty color.</li>
            <li>Love this color and the brightness of the pink.</li>
            <li>I ordered this because I love an easter-candy pink color for a mani &amp; pedi.  </li>
            <li>I found this polish much darker than pictured.  </li>
            <li>but I really can&#x27;t complain about this product.</li>
            <li>It was a lot more coral than I expected.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for something more pink.  </li>
            <li>Really like this color.</li>
            <li>The vendor is cheaper than the rest &amp; shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>About 3 coats turned it into a light neon pink which is exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li>I do a decent job of painting</li>
            <li>will purchase from them again and highly reccommend to all.</li>
            <li>I thought it looked a little dull in the bottle,but once you put it on it really brightens up and is a perfect mix between peach and a really gentle pink.</li>
            <li>Simple and pretty</li>
            <li>Wear time is pretty standard for an Essie</li>
            <li>It does require three thin coats for full opacity, as the first two may be streaky, but I find the effort to be well worth it.</li>
            <li>I just wanted to try creamy color of nail polish, and I was wondering to buy essie nail polish at walgreens, but actually buying here was so much reasonable.</li>
            <li>love that it is pink with a little bit of peachiness to it....</li>
            <li>This nail polish color is cute, it&#x27;s a little too bubble gum pink for me.</li>

            <li> This nail polish color is cute, it&#x27;s a little too bubble gum pink for me.</li>
            <li> The color is a candy shell pink, and very opaque as I have read on other reviews.  </li>
            <li> So I googled a peachy pink color and saw an image that said the person who used it had Van D&#x27;Go on their nails.</li>

            <li> my only complaint is that my brush is a little frazzled...</li>
            <li> and I tend to have to touch up the tips every few days.</li>
            <li> Two coats is all you need &amp; the formula isn&#x27;t too thick or too thin.</li>
            <li> I went to three local Walgreens stores and was disappointed.</li>
            <li> not sure if I just received a bad brush.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to apply evenly though, tending to streak or gum up.  </li>
            <li> I got it with a week and have been obsessed with it sence</li>
            <li> I was instantly obsessed!!</li>
