    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Great stuff!  </li>
            <li>- then use it as a finishing oil after using a straightning iron - my husband keeps a buzzed head but loves this product on his scalp - the smell is awesome!</li>
            <li>My wife, who buys shampoos, conditioners, and hair treatments like others buy milk, especially liked it.  </li>
            <li>Smells delicious!</li>
            <li>Great buy!</li>
            <li>But the best thing of all is the dispensing system.</li>
            <li>product smells exquisite.</li>
            <li>It is, without a doubt, the best smelling hair product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I do this when it&#x27;s still damp, and it works perfectly!  </li>
            <li>This product is a replacement of FEKKAI Ironless serum - which was a superb product and did what it said on the tin-</li>
            <li>I ordered this stuff and gave it a real good try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A very good serum but the item leaked in the package so the bottles might be faulty.</li>
            <li>It smells incredible and truly does nourish and protect the hair.</li>
            <li>Beautiful packaging</li>
            <li>Tames the fly aways and makes my hair shine.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It works great.</li>
            <li>That aside, this moisturizing treatment does a great job on damaged hair.</li>
            <li>This seems to be a great prep for your hair before going to the beach for the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Kort</li>
            <li>She sprayed my hair and it smelled great.</li>
            <li>I put some of the oil in my hand using the want and rubbed it between my fingers and it feels great.</li>
            <li>product contols it, smells great and makes your hair shine</li>
            <li>now I get this amazing after-shampoo product for the best price anywhere.  </li>
            <li>However, I do like vanilla, so the scent is very nice for</li>
            <li>Hair is smoother, softer, and smells very nice.</li>
            <li>Shinier, more manageable hair, in an attractive dispenser, with a very pleasant fragrance.  </li>
            <li>And it smells amazing!</li>
            <li>The scent of this is just amazing!</li>
            <li>best product ever, static all over this winter...</li>
            <li>This oil has a pleasant, but not overpowering scent.  </li>
            <li>Gives me softer, smoother hair, isn&#x27;t greasy or sticky and has a pleasant almost chocolate-like fragrance.</li>
            <li>I loved the scent of vanilla.</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re looking to pamper yourself, this is a good choice for a &amp;#34;dry oil&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It smells so good, the vanilla.</li>
            <li>The scent lingers, so expect a vanilla overtone to any hair treated with Fekkai for a good part of the day.</li>
            <li>Still happier with my beloved Oil from its&#x27; Moroccan origin.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s quite good.</li>
            <li>This comes in  a beautiful pakcahge and has an ingenious twist/dropper mechanism to control the amount you put on your hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Speaking of smell, it has a pleasant aroma, like a somewhat warm vanilla.  </li>
            <li>Love it, love it, love it!!!!</li>
            <li>The smell is wonderful, like vanilla &amp; the whole bottle &amp; the way the top twists off &amp; has a dropper is so neat!!  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>This is the most attractive packaging I&#x27;ve ever seen for a hair product.</li>
            <li>This product does a very nice job in smoothing hair and has a lovely vanilla/cream scent.</li>
            <li>I think the best time to work it in is after a hot shower with your hair still damp.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed when I opened the bottle was the delicious vanilla smell.  </li>
            <li>The first day I applied this potion, I had the BEST HAIR DAY THAT I HAD HAD IN YEARS!  </li>
            <li>:-)in, and I don&#x27;t need for it to start breaking!  </li>
            <li>My hair feels amazing.</li>
            <li>I thought it was going to be amazing-</li>
            <li>Smells amazing</li>
            <li>manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fekkai comes nicely packaged with a built-in dropper for application.</li>
            <li>The two women in my house both tried this and liked it ..</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, nice product</li>
            <li>I use Moroccan oil and to be honest I seem to like that better</li>
            <li>I will keep using it for the very nice notes of vanilla, but I wouldn&#x27;t consider the scent alone worth the reorder.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products</li>
            <li>so they are dispersed more evenly.</li>
            <li>It was nicely moisturized and lay in smooth waves.</li>
            <li>Ok-</li>
            <li>(Ok-</li>
            <li>I want to keep trying though as something that feels, smells and looks (the packaging it comes in is stunning-</li>
            <li>Lovely packaging.</li>
            <li>In some respects it deserves even more than 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>When you unscrew the top, it activates the dropper attached to the top and automatically draws product into the dropper.</li>
            <li>So basically all you need to do is unscrew the top</li>
            <li>Innovative dispensing design</li>
            <li>Better to apply to damp hair</li>
            <li>I would never use it ever day, or even once per week, but for a rare occasion when my hair will not cooperate and I want to look good, I might try this again.  </li>
            <li>I would never use it ever day, or even once per week, but for a rare occasion when my hair will not cooperate and I want to look good, I might try this again.  </li>
            <li>Hope this helps!  :-)</li>
            <li>and it make the hair feel more manageable.  </li>
            <li>The first thing you&#x27;ll notice about the Fekkai Prx Oil is the scent!!!  </li>
            <li>Love this product!&lt;br /&gt;Beautifully packaged and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a warm vanilla smell - think fresh baked sugar cookies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m seeing some improvement in how easy it is to manage my hair.</li>
            <li>I know that the Fekkai brand makes good high quality products.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this product.  </li>
            <li>it seemed light and fresh and not chemically at all; again, it wasn&#x27;t anything amazing, but it was fine</li>
            <li>It smells nice, it&#x27;s a pretty bottle, but that&#x27;s about all I can say.  </li>
            <li>They have great packaging, smell terrific, feels good when testing it out, but when it comes to real result, it&#x27;s marginal.</li>
            <li>It is beautifully packaged; the smell opening the box was heavenly and I couldn&#x27;t get enough of it.  </li>
            <li>The next time I used Prx Oil, things weren&#x27;t nearly as beautiful.  </li>
            <li>A very little does a phenomenal job in taming flyaways, silkening up your locks, and providing magnificent shine.</li>
            <li>all, it&#x27;s a fine product.  </li>
            <li>hair is fine</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a fine oil, as oils go.</li>
            <li>Once that is opened, you pull out an absolutely beautiful light blue teardrop shaped glass bottle.</li>
            <li>This truly has done wonders for my hair from the very first applicaiton!</li>
            <li>I mention the vanilla scent is fantastic?</li>
            <li>but it is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>This product worked great for me and will purchase in the future.</li>
            <li>I wish the dispenser, which is fun to use, provided a bit more product with each squeeze.</li>
            <li>This oil eliminates that, and leaves my hair smooth, not greasy.  </li>
            <li>It adds does smooth fly-aways</li>
            <li>It also smells fantastic.  </li>
            <li>(namely coconut oil is what I use on her hair &amp; mine to smooth away frizz and flyaways).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This oil keeps my hair smooth and tames the frizz.</li>
            <li>Not heavy, gives a shine to my hair and it smells good,</li>
            <li>Did absolutely NOTHING for my hair!!!</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with this product and will definitely purchase more.</li>
            <li>I was hoping that it would make my hair softer or more easy to style or shinier, but it really didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>but I love this one because it really works!  </li>
            <li>first this was OK with me.  </li>
            <li>Very nice oil with a light dry feeling.</li>
            <li>First off, I love this product&#x27;s scent - the vanilla and argan oil together smell really nice - even for my very sensitive nose.</li>
            <li>I started using Fekkai products sometime ago and stumbled upon this oil - its great right after washing hair - i put it on my damp hair prior to blowdrying it</li>
            <li>The bottle and the fluid inside is positively glamorous, and I am almost tempted to keep it just because of how beautifully packaged it is.  </li>
            <li>Even the packaging is cool.</li>
            <li>One or two droppers full is plenty for shoulder length</li>
            <li>First, this product does smell strongly of vanilla.</li>
            <li>The oil has a strong scent, at first</li>
            <li>This has worked amazingly on my fine thin hair and smells great too!</li>
            <li>I prefer no smell or a fresh, clean smell on my hair.</li>
            <li>A decent one to be sure</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>The memory of the day it did so much to make my hair unusually beautiful makes me think there is a use for this product on a very limited basis.  </li>
            <li>The memory of the day it did so much to make my hair unusually beautiful makes me think there is a use for this product on a very limited basis.  </li>
            <li>The next morning, my hair felt really lovely!</li>
            <li>I have color treated hair, if you use hot tools like I do, I suggest getting this for the health of your hair!</li>
            <li>My hair was still very frizzy!!</li>
            <li>It works well in my fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, which has a major tendency to frizz and have flyaways.  </li>
            <li>Controls flyaways and hides dry ends exceptionally well..</li>
            <li>My daughter also liked it enough to move it into her bedroom.  </li>
            <li>and I liked it enough to keep using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Still I think that as an oil it&#x27;s earned 4 stars--light, fresh scent, soothes damaged</li>
            <li>and you are ready to dispense the product by simply pushing the button on the top of the bottle top.</li>
            <li>Most products don&#x27;t help much, so I didn&#x27;t expect much.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>and I put it on when my hair is damp right after detangling.  </li>
            <li>I use a dropper full &amp; rub it in my hands to heat it up (penetrates hair shaft better) &amp; put in my ends &amp; then whatever is left</li>
            <li>Every time I used it, my hair got more and more weighed down - the product was progressively building up and not washing out when I shampooed.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly, fine, and practically weightless, so it gets frizzy at the ends.</li>
            <li>My wife has been using this hair serum for weeks now, and it works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>It releases a substantial fragrance when she first rubs her palms together, but the aroma once the oil is in her hair is not so powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I apply it mostly to the ends of my hair that tend to be drier despite conditioning treatments and regular haircuts.</li>
            <li>I think it smells pretty good, but some may find it a bit heavy and cloying.</li>
            <li>She (and I) could tell the difference after the first use:  </li>
            <li>The only thing that could make it better is the price...</li>
            <li>But when I brought the products home, they were only ok.</li>
            <li>I tried the pink line when Costco had a set for a nice price.</li>
            <li>I read in Marie Claire that this would restore my hair to a youthful state after being abused by hot styling tools.  </li>
            <li>It works as well or better then my usual macadamia oil, but this one smells better &amp; the bottle is fancier.</li>
            <li>The bottle comes first packaged in a tubular cardboard box.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, the performance of the product was not quite as good as an inexpensive Suave product which I reviewed a few weeks before.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve used better oils on my hair to smooth it down.</li>
            <li>The best way to use the product is to use it right after shampooing when hair is wet or towel dried.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and wavy, but I have a lot of it, which tends to be dry and flyaway after an enthusiastic session with my blow dryer and flat iron.</li>
            <li>The applicator is cleverly designed and dispenses just the right amount of oil with one push of the button.</li>
            <li>Afterwards they no longer look dry but look healthy.  </li>
            <li>I gave this to someone with hair that is not thick and coarse like mine and one drop made her love her hair.</li>
            <li>The packaging says that you can use on dry hair, but I recommend against that unless you have very dry, fly away hair.</li>
            <li>but I have a large quantity of the stuff</li>
            <li>this new PRX oil doesn&#x27;t come anywhere near the Ironless serum - it doesn&#x27;t do the same job and is not an amazing</li>
            <li>and I live in a super dry climate that takes it&#x27;s toll on hair that is easily damaged.  </li>
            <li>I am not certain that I would repurchase this, if your hair is extremely dry, you may find a great benefit by using this hair oil.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>The one thing that stands out is the smell - it&#x27;s very distinctive.</li>
            <li>But this isn&#x27;t a styling product, so it really doesn&#x27;t have any hold to speak of.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen much in the way of results.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this off and on for about a month now, and I find this very helpful.  </li>
            <li>I do think this is very nourishing, and I find that I can use about a dime&#x27;s amount without my hair getting greasy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;But the real question is what does it do for your damaged locks?</li>
            <li>Too much, and you are wasting product and turning shine into grease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>I really do.  </li>
            <li>This allows for you to have control over how much you disperse into your palm.  </li>
            <li>It really helps the waves hold together.</li>
            <li>Makes my flat ironed hair shine &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li>I do like this oil, but I can&#x27;t say it is any better than any other hair oil or pomade that I have tried.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, I have fine straight hair (color treated), that gets dry at the ends.  </li>
            <li>It did help her hair not be as flyaway as normal, but again not any more so than other products</li>
            <li>I also can&#x27;t say that it really made my hair stronger, since hair is dead keratin and really can&#x27;t be strengthened any more than it is when it grows out of your scalp.</li>
            <li>After shampooing, conditioning, using a leave in creme, and blow drying I dispense the oil in my palm and activate it by rubbing my palms until warm then, smoothing over my dry hair and/or flat ironed hair.</li>
            <li>but I was provided a single free bottle as part of the Vine program.</li>
            <li>Will update after a little more use to report long-term affects.</li>
            <li>I have very thick and unmanageable hair, and this product has been good to keep it under control.</li>
            <li>You may not pay much attention to these things, but Fekkai clearly did.</li>
            <li>It was a little gooey when it arrived at my house, and to be honest, it took me a while to figure out how exactly to open the thing.</li>
            <li>Fantastic at smoothing down frizzies but didn&#x27;t leave a high gloss on the hair.  </li>
            <li>have naturally curly hair that&#x27;s prone to frizzies and flyaways, particularly if I don&#x27;t put any product in it.</li>
            <li>and generally does whatever it wants no matter what I do.</li>
            <li>Mine is fine and hard to control, and I like this better than mouses and other products.</li>
            <li>I have shorter, coarse, straight, salon colored hair and it really didn&#x27;t do much for my hair except make it a bit oilier on the ends--which was the only place I applied it--to the tips of my hair.</li>
            <li>You press the top of the lid down, and when it returns back to it&#x27;s position, it draws the oil into the syringe.  </li>
            <li>This product, while maybe a little pricey for the size, does do a fine job.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not anything special and certainly not worth the price, but I have not used much oil in the past, and so it&#x27;s not an important part of my hair styling regimen.</li>
            <li>It smells old to me.</li>
            <li>Wished I had not wasted my money on this product.</li>
            <li>This product completely helps with frizz without leaving my hair greasy and the smell is &amp;#34;to die for&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>The oil is more like a thick elixir, that doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or leave your palm greasy.  </li>
            <li>I apply this oil to wet hair after I shower and to smooth my hair after I flat iron</li>
            <li>It works on dry hair pretty well also.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t really see that much of a difference between this and other oils I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>so I use somewhere between half to a full pump.</li>
            <li>She puts a few  drops on her palms from the bottle&#x27;s eyedropper, rubs her palms together and then smooths her hair from mid length to ends (her hair is straight, full, and a bit longer than shoulder length).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with other reviewers that the opening of the bottle and dispensing of the oil was unusual; I eventually figured it out, mainly from coming to the reviews and reading them</li>
            <li>Used on dry hair it can make hair look greasy if too much is applied.</li>
            <li>This is one of those cases where I&#x27;ll definitely order my next bottle when this one is finished; I like it that much.</li>
            <li>Definitely makes my hair feel very soft.</li>
            <li>uses popped my bubble and brought me back down to former earth friendly ways.  </li>
            <li>Even though I am a naturally &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; lady, I was willing to sell out shamelessly for this little bit of magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Subsequent</li>
            <li>What I like about the Fekkai Prx Oil is the same as my old hair serum</li>
            <li>Overall, it helps make hair moisturized, soft and</li>
            <li>but you can barely tell the difference.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t be surprised if it has leaked when you open it!</li>
            <li>It took about 2 weeks for my natural hair to start bouncing back.  </li>
            <li>It took about 2 weeks for my natural hair to start bouncing back.  </li>
            <li>so I have to be careful not to use too much or it flattens my hair.</li>
            <li>You put a small dropper full of the oil on your palm, rub your hands together, and then apply it to your hair.</li>
            <li>Grand daughter with thick long hair, also three.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s possible my hair is too thick for this though, so if you have fine hair</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference between this product and other oils that I&#x27;ve used in my hair.</li>
            <li>Not more frequently than once per month, though, or you could end up with pretty severe build-up that resists washing out.  </li>

            <li>The product itself is very thick and smells very sweet.  </li>
            <li>it is short, thin, fine, curly, frizzy-</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> Great stuff!  </li>
            <li> - then use it as a finishing oil after using a straightning iron - my husband keeps a buzzed head but loves this product on his scalp - the smell is awesome!</li>
            <li> My wife, who buys shampoos, conditioners, and hair treatments like others buy milk, especially liked it.  </li>
            <li> Smells delicious!</li>
            <li> Great buy!</li>
            <li> But the best thing of all is the dispensing system.</li>
            <li> product smells exquisite.</li>
            <li> It is, without a doubt, the best smelling hair product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I do this when it&#x27;s still damp, and it works perfectly!  </li>
            <li> This product is a replacement of FEKKAI Ironless serum - which was a superb product and did what it said on the tin-</li>
            <li> I ordered this stuff and gave it a real good try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A very good serum but the item leaked in the package so the bottles might be faulty.</li>
            <li> It smells incredible and truly does nourish and protect the hair.</li>
            <li> Beautiful packaging</li>
            <li> Tames the fly aways and makes my hair shine.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It works great.</li>
            <li> That aside, this moisturizing treatment does a great job on damaged hair.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a great prep for your hair before going to the beach for the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Kort</li>
            <li> She sprayed my hair and it smelled great.</li>
            <li> I put some of the oil in my hand using the want and rubbed it between my fingers and it feels great.</li>
            <li> product contols it, smells great and makes your hair shine</li>
            <li> now I get this amazing after-shampoo product for the best price anywhere.  </li>
            <li> However, I do like vanilla, so the scent is very nice for</li>
            <li> Hair is smoother, softer, and smells very nice.</li>
            <li> Shinier, more manageable hair, in an attractive dispenser, with a very pleasant fragrance.  </li>
            <li> And it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> The scent of this is just amazing!</li>
            <li> best product ever, static all over this winter...</li>
            <li> This oil has a pleasant, but not overpowering scent.  </li>
            <li> Gives me softer, smoother hair, isn&#x27;t greasy or sticky and has a pleasant almost chocolate-like fragrance.</li>
            <li> I loved the scent of vanilla.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re looking to pamper yourself, this is a good choice for a &amp;#34;dry oil&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It smells so good, the vanilla.</li>
            <li> The scent lingers, so expect a vanilla overtone to any hair treated with Fekkai for a good part of the day.</li>
            <li> Still happier with my beloved Oil from its&#x27; Moroccan origin.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s quite good.</li>
            <li> This comes in  a beautiful pakcahge and has an ingenious twist/dropper mechanism to control the amount you put on your hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Speaking of smell, it has a pleasant aroma, like a somewhat warm vanilla.  </li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it!!!!</li>
            <li> The smell is wonderful, like vanilla &amp; the whole bottle &amp; the way the top twists off &amp; has a dropper is so neat!!  </li>
            <li> Very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> This is the most attractive packaging I&#x27;ve ever seen for a hair product.</li>
            <li> This product does a very nice job in smoothing hair and has a lovely vanilla/cream scent.</li>
            <li> I think the best time to work it in is after a hot shower with your hair still damp.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed when I opened the bottle was the delicious vanilla smell.  </li>
            <li> The first day I applied this potion, I had the BEST HAIR DAY THAT I HAD HAD IN YEARS!  </li>
            <li> :-)in, and I don&#x27;t need for it to start breaking!  </li>
            <li> My hair feels amazing.</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to be amazing-</li>
            <li> Smells amazing</li>
            <li> manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fekkai comes nicely packaged with a built-in dropper for application.</li>
            <li> The two women in my house both tried this and liked it ..</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, nice product</li>
            <li> I use Moroccan oil and to be honest I seem to like that better</li>
            <li> I will keep using it for the very nice notes of vanilla, but I wouldn&#x27;t consider the scent alone worth the reorder.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products</li>
            <li> so they are dispersed more evenly.</li>
            <li> It was nicely moisturized and lay in smooth waves.</li>
            <li> Ok-</li>
            <li> (Ok-</li>
            <li> I want to keep trying though as something that feels, smells and looks (the packaging it comes in is stunning-</li>
            <li> Lovely packaging.</li>
            <li> In some respects it deserves even more than 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> When you unscrew the top, it activates the dropper attached to the top and automatically draws product into the dropper.</li>
            <li> So basically all you need to do is unscrew the top</li>
            <li> Innovative dispensing design</li>
            <li> Better to apply to damp hair</li>
            <li> I would never use it ever day, or even once per week, but for a rare occasion when my hair will not cooperate and I want to look good, I might try this again.  </li>
            <li> I would never use it ever day, or even once per week, but for a rare occasion when my hair will not cooperate and I want to look good, I might try this again.  </li>
            <li> Hope this helps!  :-)</li>
            <li> and it make the hair feel more manageable.  </li>
            <li> The first thing you&#x27;ll notice about the Fekkai Prx Oil is the scent!!!  </li>
            <li> Love this product!&lt;br /&gt;Beautifully packaged and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a warm vanilla smell - think fresh baked sugar cookies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seeing some improvement in how easy it is to manage my hair.</li>
            <li> I know that the Fekkai brand makes good high quality products.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this product.  </li>
            <li> it seemed light and fresh and not chemically at all; again, it wasn&#x27;t anything amazing, but it was fine</li>
            <li> It smells nice, it&#x27;s a pretty bottle, but that&#x27;s about all I can say.  </li>
            <li> They have great packaging, smell terrific, feels good when testing it out, but when it comes to real result, it&#x27;s marginal.</li>
            <li> It is beautifully packaged; the smell opening the box was heavenly and I couldn&#x27;t get enough of it.  </li>
            <li> The next time I used Prx Oil, things weren&#x27;t nearly as beautiful.  </li>
            <li> A very little does a phenomenal job in taming flyaways, silkening up your locks, and providing magnificent shine.</li>
            <li> all, it&#x27;s a fine product.  </li>
            <li> hair is fine</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a fine oil, as oils go.</li>
            <li> Once that is opened, you pull out an absolutely beautiful light blue teardrop shaped glass bottle.</li>
            <li> This truly has done wonders for my hair from the very first applicaiton!</li>
            <li> I mention the vanilla scent is fantastic?</li>
            <li> but it is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> This product worked great for me and will purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> I wish the dispenser, which is fun to use, provided a bit more product with each squeeze.</li>
            <li> This oil eliminates that, and leaves my hair smooth, not greasy.  </li>
            <li> It adds does smooth fly-aways</li>
            <li> It also smells fantastic.  </li>
            <li> (namely coconut oil is what I use on her hair &amp; mine to smooth away frizz and flyaways).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This oil keeps my hair smooth and tames the frizz.</li>
            <li> Not heavy, gives a shine to my hair and it smells good,</li>
            <li> Did absolutely NOTHING for my hair!!!</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product and will definitely purchase more.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that it would make my hair softer or more easy to style or shinier, but it really didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> but I love this one because it really works!  </li>
            <li> first this was OK with me.  </li>
            <li> Very nice oil with a light dry feeling.</li>
            <li> First off, I love this product&#x27;s scent - the vanilla and argan oil together smell really nice - even for my very sensitive nose.</li>
            <li> I started using Fekkai products sometime ago and stumbled upon this oil - its great right after washing hair - i put it on my damp hair prior to blowdrying it</li>
            <li> The bottle and the fluid inside is positively glamorous, and I am almost tempted to keep it just because of how beautifully packaged it is.  </li>
            <li> Even the packaging is cool.</li>
            <li> One or two droppers full is plenty for shoulder length</li>
            <li> First, this product does smell strongly of vanilla.</li>
            <li> The oil has a strong scent, at first</li>
            <li> This has worked amazingly on my fine thin hair and smells great too!</li>
            <li> I prefer no smell or a fresh, clean smell on my hair.</li>
            <li> A decent one to be sure</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> The memory of the day it did so much to make my hair unusually beautiful makes me think there is a use for this product on a very limited basis.  </li>
            <li> The memory of the day it did so much to make my hair unusually beautiful makes me think there is a use for this product on a very limited basis.  </li>
            <li> The next morning, my hair felt really lovely!</li>
            <li> I have color treated hair, if you use hot tools like I do, I suggest getting this for the health of your hair!</li>
            <li> My hair was still very frizzy!!</li>
            <li> It works well in my fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, which has a major tendency to frizz and have flyaways.  </li>
            <li> Controls flyaways and hides dry ends exceptionally well..</li>
            <li> My daughter also liked it enough to move it into her bedroom.  </li>
            <li> and I liked it enough to keep using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Still I think that as an oil it&#x27;s earned 4 stars--light, fresh scent, soothes damaged</li>
            <li> and you are ready to dispense the product by simply pushing the button on the top of the bottle top.</li>
            <li> Most products don&#x27;t help much, so I didn&#x27;t expect much.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> and I put it on when my hair is damp right after detangling.  </li>
            <li> I use a dropper full &amp; rub it in my hands to heat it up (penetrates hair shaft better) &amp; put in my ends &amp; then whatever is left</li>
            <li> Every time I used it, my hair got more and more weighed down - the product was progressively building up and not washing out when I shampooed.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly, fine, and practically weightless, so it gets frizzy at the ends.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this hair serum for weeks now, and it works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> It releases a substantial fragrance when she first rubs her palms together, but the aroma once the oil is in her hair is not so powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I apply it mostly to the ends of my hair that tend to be drier despite conditioning treatments and regular haircuts.</li>
            <li> I think it smells pretty good, but some may find it a bit heavy and cloying.</li>
            <li> She (and I) could tell the difference after the first use:  </li>
            <li> The only thing that could make it better is the price...</li>
            <li> But when I brought the products home, they were only ok.</li>
            <li> I tried the pink line when Costco had a set for a nice price.</li>
            <li> I read in Marie Claire that this would restore my hair to a youthful state after being abused by hot styling tools.  </li>
            <li> It works as well or better then my usual macadamia oil, but this one smells better &amp; the bottle is fancier.</li>
            <li> The bottle comes first packaged in a tubular cardboard box.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, the performance of the product was not quite as good as an inexpensive Suave product which I reviewed a few weeks before.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve used better oils on my hair to smooth it down.</li>
            <li> The best way to use the product is to use it right after shampooing when hair is wet or towel dried.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and wavy, but I have a lot of it, which tends to be dry and flyaway after an enthusiastic session with my blow dryer and flat iron.</li>
            <li> The applicator is cleverly designed and dispenses just the right amount of oil with one push of the button.</li>
            <li> Afterwards they no longer look dry but look healthy.  </li>
            <li> I gave this to someone with hair that is not thick and coarse like mine and one drop made her love her hair.</li>
            <li> The packaging says that you can use on dry hair, but I recommend against that unless you have very dry, fly away hair.</li>
            <li> but I have a large quantity of the stuff</li>
            <li> this new PRX oil doesn&#x27;t come anywhere near the Ironless serum - it doesn&#x27;t do the same job and is not an amazing</li>
            <li> and I live in a super dry climate that takes it&#x27;s toll on hair that is easily damaged.  </li>
            <li> I am not certain that I would repurchase this, if your hair is extremely dry, you may find a great benefit by using this hair oil.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the real deal.  </li>
            <li> The one thing that stands out is the smell - it&#x27;s very distinctive.</li>
            <li> But this isn&#x27;t a styling product, so it really doesn&#x27;t have any hold to speak of.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much in the way of results.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this off and on for about a month now, and I find this very helpful.  </li>
            <li> I do think this is very nourishing, and I find that I can use about a dime&#x27;s amount without my hair getting greasy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;But the real question is what does it do for your damaged locks?</li>
            <li> Too much, and you are wasting product and turning shine into grease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> I really do.  </li>
            <li> This allows for you to have control over how much you disperse into your palm.  </li>
            <li> It really helps the waves hold together.</li>
            <li> Makes my flat ironed hair shine &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li> I do like this oil, but I can&#x27;t say it is any better than any other hair oil or pomade that I have tried.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, I have fine straight hair (color treated), that gets dry at the ends.  </li>
            <li> It did help her hair not be as flyaway as normal, but again not any more so than other products</li>
            <li> I also can&#x27;t say that it really made my hair stronger, since hair is dead keratin and really can&#x27;t be strengthened any more than it is when it grows out of your scalp.</li>
            <li> After shampooing, conditioning, using a leave in creme, and blow drying I dispense the oil in my palm and activate it by rubbing my palms until warm then, smoothing over my dry hair and/or flat ironed hair.</li>
            <li> but I was provided a single free bottle as part of the Vine program.</li>
            <li> Will update after a little more use to report long-term affects.</li>
            <li> I have very thick and unmanageable hair, and this product has been good to keep it under control.</li>
            <li> You may not pay much attention to these things, but Fekkai clearly did.</li>
            <li> It was a little gooey when it arrived at my house, and to be honest, it took me a while to figure out how exactly to open the thing.</li>
            <li> Fantastic at smoothing down frizzies but didn&#x27;t leave a high gloss on the hair.  </li>
            <li> have naturally curly hair that&#x27;s prone to frizzies and flyaways, particularly if I don&#x27;t put any product in it.</li>
            <li> and generally does whatever it wants no matter what I do.</li>
            <li> Mine is fine and hard to control, and I like this better than mouses and other products.</li>
            <li> I have shorter, coarse, straight, salon colored hair and it really didn&#x27;t do much for my hair except make it a bit oilier on the ends--which was the only place I applied it--to the tips of my hair.</li>
            <li> You press the top of the lid down, and when it returns back to it&#x27;s position, it draws the oil into the syringe.  </li>
            <li> This product, while maybe a little pricey for the size, does do a fine job.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not anything special and certainly not worth the price, but I have not used much oil in the past, and so it&#x27;s not an important part of my hair styling regimen.</li>
            <li> It smells old to me.</li>
            <li> Wished I had not wasted my money on this product.</li>
            <li> This product completely helps with frizz without leaving my hair greasy and the smell is &amp;#34;to die for&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The oil is more like a thick elixir, that doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or leave your palm greasy.  </li>
            <li> I apply this oil to wet hair after I shower and to smooth my hair after I flat iron</li>
            <li> It works on dry hair pretty well also.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t really see that much of a difference between this and other oils I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> so I use somewhere between half to a full pump.</li>
            <li> She puts a few  drops on her palms from the bottle&#x27;s eyedropper, rubs her palms together and then smooths her hair from mid length to ends (her hair is straight, full, and a bit longer than shoulder length).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with other reviewers that the opening of the bottle and dispensing of the oil was unusual; I eventually figured it out, mainly from coming to the reviews and reading them</li>
            <li> Used on dry hair it can make hair look greasy if too much is applied.</li>
            <li> This is one of those cases where I&#x27;ll definitely order my next bottle when this one is finished; I like it that much.</li>
            <li> Definitely makes my hair feel very soft.</li>
            <li> uses popped my bubble and brought me back down to former earth friendly ways.  </li>
            <li> Even though I am a naturally &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; lady, I was willing to sell out shamelessly for this little bit of magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Subsequent</li>
            <li> What I like about the Fekkai Prx Oil is the same as my old hair serum</li>
            <li> Overall, it helps make hair moisturized, soft and</li>
            <li> but you can barely tell the difference.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t be surprised if it has leaked when you open it!</li>
            <li> It took about 2 weeks for my natural hair to start bouncing back.  </li>
            <li> It took about 2 weeks for my natural hair to start bouncing back.  </li>
            <li> so I have to be careful not to use too much or it flattens my hair.</li>
            <li> You put a small dropper full of the oil on your palm, rub your hands together, and then apply it to your hair.</li>
            <li> Grand daughter with thick long hair, also three.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s possible my hair is too thick for this though, so if you have fine hair</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference between this product and other oils that I&#x27;ve used in my hair.</li>
            <li> Not more frequently than once per month, though, or you could end up with pretty severe build-up that resists washing out.  </li>
            <li> Not more frequently than once per month, though, or you could end up with pretty severe build-up that resists washing out.  </li>
            <li> The product itself is very thick and smells very sweet.  </li>
            <li> it is short, thin, fine, curly, frizzy-</li>
            <li> I also have used this product on my daughter&#x27;s thick &amp; straight hair, while it was wet and dry (to smooth it down).</li>
            <li> Her hair tends to curl a little especially on the high humidity days of Florida.  </li>
            <li> I have extra thick hair, past shoulder length hair and likely used 1 drop too many.  </li>
            <li> But would it work???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have problem hair - (long, thin, fine, curly, frizzy)</li>
            <li> With just a few drops, it gives my hair a nice aroma that is subtle enough not to clash with any other scent I chose to wear.  </li>
            <li> It only takes a few small drops to smooth over your hair.  </li>
            <li> The instructions on how much to use, though, are a little thin, so start out with a little bit and work your way up if your hair needs more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ended up needing half of my current styling product and some days can skip it completely because the smoothing effect is so noticeable.</li>
            <li> There seemed to be a dullness and my hair was lying flat.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I also apply the oil  when my hair is dry, to the ends only.</li>
            <li> But what they don&#x27;t hype is that there is a LONG list of unpronounceable ingredients, with the argan and vanilla in tiny amounts at the bottom of a very long list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After I wash my hair, I towel dry it and apply a dime-sized amount of oil to the ends only, then let it air dry.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and the 1.6 oz bottle, though a lot smaller than the Suave product, will probably last equally as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> I have to try it with wet application and will try to report back once I do.</li>
            <li> I have long hair which isn&#x27;t too frizz-prone, though, so I may not be the target consumer.  </li>
            <li> But I was not completely on the mark-</li>
            <li> I have long hair and my ends sometimes look like they want to be cut off.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a twist-off, and when fully twisted on, the button on top goes down.  </li>
            <li> If i use this I HAVE to wash my hair the next day - which is not the case with some of the other oils I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> My hair is fairly short and it is hard to say how well it works, though it does leave soft strands after application.</li>
            <li> I like dry hair oils, but the ones i like come in a spray form</li>
            <li> For the purposes of testing, I applied this to damp hair and then braided it so it would dry overnight.</li>
            <li> I put it on my hair dry</li>
            <li> I usually just put a little PURE olive oil or argan oil in my hair to keep it moisturized and tamed, but who am I to argue with &amp;#34;progress&amp;#34;?  </li>
            <li> To me, the vanilla scent is a little strange for hair, but it isn&#x27;t a big deal.</li>
            <li> I have dry hair due to chemical treatment, I have been coloring my hair for a long time.  </li>
            <li> My hair is just below my shoulder blades, and I found that one dropper-ful was enough to run through the lower half of my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product on my hair (naturally curly 3b/3c hair) while wet, as that is how I usually use oil for my hair.</li>
            <li> I had to put up with some pretty bad hair days during that time, but with careful babying and lots of olive oil and REAL argan oil</li>
            <li> I had to put up with some pretty bad hair days during that time, but with careful babying and lots of olive oil and REAL argan oil</li>
            <li> Considering how little product it takes to achieve the desired result (I have short hair)</li>
            <li> After using this product for a few weeks, there is definitely an improvement in the swing and softness of my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought several products from their green line while shopping at Nordstrom.</li>
            <li> I tried smoothing on wet hair too and then drying it.</li>
            <li> Unlike some other similar products, it doesn&#x27;t sit heavily on the hair, which is a plus.</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair that I flat iron daily.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Again, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Did any of the other reviewers mention the vanilla?</li>
            <li> Her hair was shinier and had a relaxed look she seldom gets with other hair treatments.  </li>
            <li> I will put this with the other bottles of Fekkai stuff I&#x27;ve collected over the years.</li>
            <li> On dry hair, I could see a little bit of a difference.</li>
            <li> Put a dropper or two of product into your hand and rub your palms together then run your hands through your hair - especially dry ends.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, used on dry hair it can weigh hair down and make it look heavy.</li>
            <li> I put it on my hair wet and it helps a little</li>
            <li> FYI, for my mid-back length, average thickness hair, I use three dropper tube fill-ups.  </li>
            <li> I have short, wavy &amp; thick hair, and look for something that gives a bit of shine as well as some &#x27;lift.&#x27;</li>
            <li> press down to fill, then withdraw to dispense.  </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a dry application, it&#x27;s not the easiest applicator, it does tame strays, but it also makes hair fall limp.</li>
            <li> I find when using this product, my hair looks shinier, smoother, and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> key here is NOT to overdo it (and keep at least an inch away from the roots, unless you want to look like you bathed in an oil slick.)</li>
            <li> it came, the bottle had leaked into the package but the amount lost was not significant.  </li>
            <li> Some smoothing a faint glisten where the oil actually stuck to the dry strands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really expensive and there are other products out there that will deliver similar results for less money.  </li>
            <li> That is the heavy scent that permeates the Fekkai Prx hair treatment.</li>
            <li> I have trouble with my hair</li>
            <li> I take a few drops of this oil, rub it between my hands and then rub it on my ends.  </li>
            <li> Also, when done applying it, I massage the thin coating of oil left on my hands into the skin, and it works well to soften them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit heavy and the applicator pumps out quite a bit</li>
            <li> but it mellows out after a few minutes</li>
            <li> Weirdly, my daughter who has twice as much hair that is curly and thick, also uses three.  </li>
            <li> But since a little goes a long way, you&#x27;ll get tired of the oil before you run out of it.</li>
            <li> Trust those who say to use very very little ...</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a little thick</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is a placebo effect</li>
            <li> 1-2 small drops is all that&#x27;s needed.  </li>
            <li> This is very heavy and silicone-y.</li>
            <li> I have very thick and wavy hair prone to frizz, and this product didn&#x27;t do much to tame it.  </li>
            <li> subtle smell too.</li>
            <li> although as other reviewers mentioned it had leaked a little during shipping) just can&#x27;t be bad!</li>
            <li> This is a heavier, VIctoria&#x27;s Secret Vanilla-lace scent inspired version of the CHI serum in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m always a little disappointed by Fekkai products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a sucker for packaging!!</li>
            <li> My hair is already thin, and I don&#x27;t need for it to start breaking!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This has worked amazingly on my fine thin hair and smells great too!</li>
            <li> My hair feels amazing.</li>
            <li> does nothing ever. ever, elp my haver, ever ever, I promise I will never believe in anything tHING  to help my hair again</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  I have tried so many products but I love this one because it really works!  Tames the fly aways and makes my hair shine.  And it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> This stuff is the real deal.  Infused with Argan extracts. I loved the scent of vanilla. Makes my flat ironed hair shine &amp; smooth. After shampooing, conditioning, using a leave in creme, and blow drying I dispense the oil in my palm and activate it by rubbing my palms until warm then, smoothing over my dry hair and/or flat ironed hair. Controls flyaways and hides dry ends exceptionally well..</li>
            <li> This product does a very nice job in smoothing hair and has a lovely vanilla/cream scent. It&#x27;s lightweight enough that it doesn&#x27;t make my color-treated hair feel oily after a day or two. I have short, wavy &amp; thick hair, and look for something that gives a bit of shine as well as some &#x27;lift.&#x27; Very pleased with the product. It does its job!!</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this hair serum for weeks now, and it works pretty well.  A little bit goes a long way.  She puts a few  drops on her palms from the bottle&#x27;s eyedropper, rubs her palms together and then smooths her hair from mid length to ends (her hair is straight, full, and a bit longer than shoulder length).  This Fekkai oil actually does improve luster and helps to prevent frizz.  I can tell whether she has used it or not, and not just because I can smell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of smell, it has a pleasant aroma, like a somewhat warm vanilla.  It isn&#x27;t floral or like perfume, just fragrant.  Whether you like it will be a personal issue.  It releases a substantial fragrance when she first rubs her palms together, but the aroma once the oil is in her hair is not so powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, it&#x27;s a fine product.  It&#x27;s really expensive and there are other products out there that will deliver similar results for less money.  But if you&#x27;re looking to pamper yourself, this is a good choice for a &amp;#34;dry oil&amp;#34; hair serum.</li>
            <li> I like dry hair oils, but the ones i like come in a spray form so they are dispersed more evenly. As a dry application, it&#x27;s not the easiest applicator, it does tame strays, but it also makes hair fall limp. If i use this I HAVE to wash my hair the next day - which is not the case with some of the other oils I&#x27;ve tried. I have to try it with wet application and will try to report back once I do.</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair that I flat iron daily. I apply this oil to wet hair after I shower and to smooth my hair after I flat iron my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great. I have tried several similar products from John Frieda, Bed Head, and Pearatin and this is very similar. The one thing that stands out is the smell - it&#x27;s very distinctive. It is listed as vanilla, but it smells different once it&#x27;s applied in the hair. When I use this oil, I catch whiffs of it and I don&#x27;t like the smell. It smells old to me. I prefer no smell or a fresh, clean smell on my hair. I like this oil, I just have to use it sparingly.</li>
            <li> I would buy this product even if it did nothing to restore my hair ... just for the way my hair smells!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I have fine straight hair (color treated), that gets dry at the ends.  After using this product for a few weeks, there is definitely an improvement in the swing and softness of my hair. Trust those who say to use very very little ... otherwise you can get the oily hair look.</li>
            <li> First, this product does smell strongly of vanilla. If you&#x27;re not a vanilla fan, you&#x27;re probably not going to like this. However, I do like vanilla, so the scent is very nice for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally curly hair that&#x27;s prone to frizzies and flyaways, particularly if I don&#x27;t put any product in it. For the purposes of testing, I applied this to damp hair and then braided it so it would dry overnight. The next morning, my hair felt really lovely! It was nicely moisturized and lay in smooth waves. But this isn&#x27;t a styling product, so it really doesn&#x27;t have any hold to speak of. My hair eventually did start puffing up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works well for moisturizing and smoothing, but don&#x27;t expect it to provide hold. I also can&#x27;t say that it really made my hair stronger, since hair is dead keratin and really can&#x27;t be strengthened any more than it is when it grows out of your scalp. My hair does feel healthier, though, when I use this after washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, let&#x27;s talk about the bottle. It was a little gooey when it arrived at my house, and to be honest, it took me a while to figure out how exactly to open the thing. When you twist the cap, a plunger will pop up, sucking the oil into the dropper inside the bottle. My hair is just below my shoulder blades, and I found that one dropper-ful was enough to run through the lower half of my hair. The instructions on how much to use, though, are a little thin, so start out with a little bit and work your way up if your hair needs more.</li>
            <li> This truly has done wonders for my hair from the very first applicaiton! It smells incredible and truly does nourish and protect the hair. I have color treated hair, if you use hot tools like I do, I suggest getting this for the health of your hair!</li>
            <li> I used a product like this years ago but like every favorite hair product I&#x27;ve come to rely upon, it was sadly discontinued. What I like about the Fekkai Prx Oil is the same as my old hair serum: it&#x27;s lightweight enough to not be greasy, yet substantial enough to actually make a difference in the smoothness and moisture content of my hair. I find when using this product, my hair looks shinier, smoother, and less frizzy. I&#x27;ve ended up needing half of my current styling product and some days can skip it completely because the smoothing effect is so noticeable. I&#x27;m not sure if this is a placebo effect but my hair actually *seems* stronger as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is fine but I have a large quantity of the stuff so I use somewhere between half to a full pump. Your quantity needs may vary. I apply it mostly to the ends of my hair that tend to be drier despite conditioning treatments and regular haircuts. Then, whatever is still left on my hands gets smoothed over the rest of the hair shaft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I mention the vanilla scent is fantastic? Did any of the other reviewers mention the vanilla? It smells so good, the vanilla. Mmmmm vanilla.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not get paid to write this review but I was provided a single free bottle as part of the Vine program. This is one of those cases where I&#x27;ll definitely order my next bottle when this one is finished; I like it that much. That doesn&#x27;t often happen.</li>
            <li> It smells nice, it&#x27;s a pretty bottle, but that&#x27;s about all I can say.  It took me a bit to figure out how to use the applicator--press down to fill, then withdraw to dispense.  I haven&#x27;t seen much in the way of results.  I have long hair which isn&#x27;t too frizz-prone, though, so I may not be the target consumer.  I will keep using it for the very nice notes of vanilla, but I wouldn&#x27;t consider the scent alone worth the reorder.</li>
            <li> I started using Fekkai products sometime ago and stumbled upon this oil - its great right after washing hair - i put it on my damp hair prior to blowdrying it - then use it as a finishing oil after using a straightning iron - my husband keeps a buzzed head but loves this product on his scalp - the smell is awesome!</li>
            <li> Did absolutely NOTHING for my hair!!! Could not tell any difference. My hair was still very frizzy!! Wished I had not wasted my money on this product.</li>
            <li> I use Moroccan oil and to be honest I seem to like that better but this works well.  Just depends on what your hair is like.</li>
            <li> Vanilla. That is the heavy scent that permeates the Fekkai Prx hair treatment. I think it smells pretty good, but some may find it a bit heavy and cloying. That aside, this moisturizing treatment does a great job on damaged hair. My hair is fairly short and it is hard to say how well it works, though it does leave soft strands after application. I think the best time to work it in is after a hot shower with your hair still damp. It works on dry hair pretty well also. Overall, it helps make hair moisturized, soft and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fekkai comes nicely packaged with a built-in dropper for application. Just put some in the palm of you hand, vigorously spread it around your hands, and then apply it to the hair you want.  The scent lingers, so expect a vanilla overtone to any hair treated with Fekkai for a good part of the day. This seems to be a great prep for your hair before going to the beach for the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Kort</li>
            <li> The two women in my house both tried this and liked it .. a lot.  My wife, who buys shampoos, conditioners, and hair treatments like others buy milk, especially liked it.  Her hair tends to curl a little especially on the high humidity days of Florida.  She (and I) could tell the difference after the first use:  Her hair was shinier and had a relaxed look she seldom gets with other hair treatments.  My daughter also liked it enough to move it into her bedroom.  Shinier, more manageable hair, in an attractive dispenser, with a very pleasant fragrance.  The only thing that could make it better is the price...I think a fairer price would be around $15.</li>
            <li> Ok- I have trouble with my hair it is short, thin, fine, curly, frizzy- and generally does whatever it wants no matter what I do. When I got this Oil I thought it was going to be amazing- it smells terrific- the feel of it is luxurious. But I was not completely on the mark- I put it on my hair dry and it gave my hair a clumpy needs to be washed look. (Ok- I&#x27;m never doing that again!) I put it on my hair wet and it helps a little but you can barely tell the difference. I want to keep trying though as something that feels, smells and looks (the packaging it comes in is stunning- although as other reviewers mentioned it had leaked a little during shipping) just can&#x27;t be bad!</li>
            <li> I have been using this off and on for about a month now, and I find this very helpful.  I have dry hair due to chemical treatment, I have been coloring my hair for a long time.  I do think this is very nourishing, and I find that I can use about a dime&#x27;s amount without my hair getting greasy.  I do like this oil, but I can&#x27;t say it is any better than any other hair oil or pomade that I have tried.  I know that the Fekkai brand makes good high quality products.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this product.  I am not certain that I would repurchase this, if your hair is extremely dry, you may find a great benefit by using this hair oil.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m the only one who feels this way. But I&#x27;m always a little disappointed by Fekkai products. They have great packaging, smell terrific, feels good when testing it out, but when it comes to real result, it&#x27;s marginal. I bought several products from their green line while shopping at Nordstrom. They had a lady demonstrating it there. She sprayed my hair and it smelled great. But when I brought the products home, they were only ok. I tried the pink line when Costco had a set for a nice price. That was so so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked this Prx Oil up to try from Amazon. Out of the box... Lovely packaging. I even kept it because can&#x27;t get myself to throw it out just yet. I put some of the oil in my hand using the want and rubbed it between my fingers and it feels great. Smells delicious! I tried it in my hair. On dry hair, I could see a little bit of a difference. Some smoothing a faint glisten where the oil actually stuck to the dry strands. I tried smoothing on wet hair too and then drying it. No noticeable difference. I will put this with the other bottles of Fekkai stuff I&#x27;ve collected over the years.</li>
            <li> I freaking adore almost everything in the Fekkai line, and the Prx Oil was no exception. The scent of this is just amazing! You&#x27;re going to want to bathe in it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the real question is what does it do for your damaged locks? My hair is fine and wavy, but I have a lot of it, which tends to be dry and flyaway after an enthusiastic session with my blow dryer and flat iron. Just a drop or two in the palm of your hands, run through your hair (and onto those ends) transforms your mane into a silky, shiny wonder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key here is NOT to overdo it (and keep at least an inch away from the roots, unless you want to look like you bathed in an oil slick.) A very little does a phenomenal job in taming flyaways, silkening up your locks, and providing magnificent shine. Too much, and you are wasting product and turning shine into grease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this price point, Prx Oil is a bargain. But since a little goes a long way, you&#x27;ll get tired of the oil before you run out of it. Great buy! Recommend!</li>
            <li> ****&lt;br /&gt;This is a fine oil, as oils go. I have shorter, coarse, straight, salon colored hair and it really didn&#x27;t do much for my hair except make it a bit oilier on the ends--which was the only place I applied it--to the tips of my hair. I like the scent--to me it seemed light and fresh and not chemically at all; again, it wasn&#x27;t anything amazing, but it was fine and I liked it enough to keep using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with other reviewers that the opening of the bottle and dispensing of the oil was unusual; I eventually figured it out, mainly from coming to the reviews and reading them here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me it&#x27;s not anything special and certainly not worth the price, but I have not used much oil in the past, and so it&#x27;s not an important part of my hair styling regimen. I was hoping that it would make my hair softer or more easy to style or shinier, but it really didn&#x27;t. Still I think that as an oil it&#x27;s earned 4 stars--light, fresh scent, soothes damaged ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.&lt;br /&gt;****</li>
            <li> Smells amazing but it&#x27;s a little thick</li>
            <li> I read in Marie Claire that this would restore my hair to a youthful state after being abused by hot styling tools.  After using it 3x I wouldn&#x27;t call it the miracle worker I was expecting but it is a fantastic product.  I have extra thick hair, past shoulder length hair and likely used 1 drop too many.  1-2 small drops is all that&#x27;s needed.  The vanilla scent is addicting.  Fantastic at smoothing down frizzies but didn&#x27;t leave a high gloss on the hair.  Still happier with my beloved Oil from its&#x27; Moroccan origin.  When comparing the &amp;#34;other oil&#x27;s&amp;#34; bottle size with this one, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a cost-savings.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend purchasing this for yourself. This product worked great for me and will purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> The smell is wonderful, like vanilla &amp; the whole bottle &amp; the way the top twists off &amp; has a dropper is so neat!!  Even the packaging is cool. A cylinder package that I keep mine in. I&#x27;m ordering another bottle, because mines almost gone. It works well in my fine, straight hair. I use a dropper full &amp; rub it in my hands to heat it up (penetrates hair shaft better) &amp; put in my ends &amp; then whatever is left I rub on the rest of my hair. It works as well or better then my usual macadamia oil, but this one smells better &amp; the bottle is fancier. I&#x27;m a sucker for packaging!!</li>
            <li> #1, the bottle leaked while in transit.  It took me a while to figure out how to even get the cap off.  It&#x27;s a twist-off, and when fully twisted on, the button on top goes down.  The button dispenses the product in an eyedropper fashion.  The product itself is very thick and smells very sweet.  I have very thick and wavy hair prone to frizz, and this product didn&#x27;t do much to tame it.  It&#x27;s possible my hair is too thick for this though, so if you have fine hair you could give this a try.  Just don&#x27;t be surprised if it has leaked when you open it!</li>
            <li> I like it.  Not heavy, gives a shine to my hair and it smells good,</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it!!!! This product completely helps with frizz without leaving my hair greasy and the smell is &amp;#34;to die for&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Very nice oil with a light dry feeling. Definitely makes my hair feel very soft. To me, the vanilla scent is a little strange for hair, but it isn&#x27;t a big deal. I wish the dispenser, which is fun to use, provided a bit more product with each squeeze.</li>
            <li> Love this product!&lt;br /&gt;Beautifully packaged and easy to use. You put a small dropper full of the oil on your palm, rub your hands together, and then apply it to your hair. Mine is fine and hard to control, and I like this better than mouses and other products. It adds shine but does not leave the hair stiff.&lt;br /&gt;Very subtle smell too.</li>
            <li> best product ever, static all over this winter...product contols it, smells great and makes your hair shine shine shine shine</li>
            <li> A very good serum but the item leaked in the package so the bottles might be faulty.</li>
            <li> I wish that I could have given this product 5 stars.  I really do.  In some respects it deserves even more than 5 stars.  For example, the packaging. You may not pay much attention to these things, but Fekkai clearly did. This is the most attractive packaging I&#x27;ve ever seen for a hair product. The bottle comes first packaged in a tubular cardboard box. Once that is opened, you pull out an absolutely beautiful light blue teardrop shaped glass bottle. But the best thing of all is the dispensing system. When you unscrew the top, it activates the dropper attached to the top and automatically draws product into the dropper. So basically all you need to do is unscrew the top and you are ready to dispense the product by simply pushing the button on the top of the bottle top. One or two droppers full is plenty for shoulder length hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product smells exquisite. It is, without a doubt, the best smelling hair product I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s a warm vanilla smell - think fresh baked sugar cookies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the performance of the product was not quite as good as an inexpensive Suave product which I reviewed a few weeks before.  The packaging says that you can use on dry hair, but I recommend against that unless you have very dry, fly away hair. Otherwise, used on dry hair it can weigh hair down and make it look heavy. The best way to use the product is to use it right after shampooing when hair is wet or towel dried. Put a dropper or two of product into your hand and rub your palms together then run your hands through your hair - especially dry ends. A little goes a long way, and the 1.6 oz bottle, though a lot smaller than the Suave product, will probably last equally as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;-  Beautiful packaging&lt;br /&gt;-  Innovative dispensing design&lt;br /&gt;-  Smells wonderful&lt;br /&gt;-  Works well when applied to wet/damp hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-  Pricey&lt;br /&gt;-  Used on dry hair it can make hair look greasy if too much is applied.

            <li> This oil has a pleasant, but not overpowering scent.  A little goes a long way.  I have very fine hair, which has a major tendency to frizz and have flyaways.  This oil eliminates that, and leaves my hair smooth, not greasy.  It also doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a pump type syringe applicator.  You press the top of the lid down, and when it returns back to it&#x27;s position, it draws the oil into the syringe.  This allows for you to have control over how much you disperse into your palm.  The oil is more like a thick elixir, that doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or leave your palm greasy.  Rub the oil in your palm, and apply to your hair.  I do this when it&#x27;s still damp, and it works perfectly!  Again, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The first thing you&#x27;ll notice about the Fekkai Prx Oil is the scent!!!  Smells delish!  I have long hair and my ends sometimes look like they want to be cut off.  I take a few drops of this oil, rub it between my hands and then rub it on my ends.  Afterwards they no longer look dry but look healthy.  And did I mention the scent ...yummy</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed when I opened the bottle was the delicious vanilla smell.  With just a few drops, it gives my hair a nice aroma that is subtle enough not to clash with any other scent I chose to wear.  Just a tiny amount takes care of my fly-aways and gives me a polished look.  Considering how little product it takes to achieve the desired result (I have short hair) this bottle will last quite sometime.</li>
            <li> This product is a replacement of FEKKAI Ironless serum - which was a superb product and did what it said on the tin- this new PRX oil doesn&#x27;t come anywhere near the Ironless serum - it doesn&#x27;t do the same job and is not an amazing product.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> The ad hypes &amp;#34;Argan Oil Extracts&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Vanilla&amp;#34;.  But what they don&#x27;t hype is that there is a LONG list of unpronounceable ingredients, with the argan and vanilla in tiny amounts at the bottom of a very long list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first this was OK with me.  After all, I&#x27;m not planning on drinking it, so I didn&#x27;t mind putting a scientifically formulated mending and strengthening elixir on my hair.  I usually just put a little PURE olive oil or argan oil in my hair to keep it moisturized and tamed, but who am I to argue with &amp;#34;progress&amp;#34;?  I ordered this stuff and gave it a real good try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it came, the bottle had leaked into the package but the amount lost was not significant.  It is beautifully packaged; the smell opening the box was heavenly and I couldn&#x27;t get enough of it.  The bottle and the fluid inside is positively glamorous, and I am almost tempted to keep it just because of how beautifully packaged it is.  But would it work???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have problem hair - (long, thin, fine, curly, frizzy) and I live in a super dry climate that takes it&#x27;s toll on hair that is easily damaged.  Most products don&#x27;t help much, so I didn&#x27;t expect much.  The first day I applied this potion, I had the BEST HAIR DAY THAT I HAD HAD IN YEARS!  I kept passing my the mirror to gaze at my head of shiny, curly, bouncy, moist hair!  I was sold.  Even though I am a naturally &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; lady, I was willing to sell out shamelessly for this little bit of magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Subsequent uses popped my bubble and brought me back down to former earth friendly ways.  The next time I used Prx Oil, things weren&#x27;t nearly as beautiful.  There seemed to be a dullness and my hair was lying flat.  Every time I used it, my hair got more and more weighed down - the product was progressively building up and not washing out when I shampooed. Eventually, I noticed some breakage starting to happen, and when that became obvious, I discontinued use.  My hair is already thin, and I don&#x27;t need for it to start breaking!  It took about 2 weeks for my natural hair to start bouncing back.  I had to put up with some pretty bad hair days during that time, but with careful babying and lots of olive oil and REAL argan oil, things gradually recovered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I use it again?  The memory of the day it did so much to make my hair unusually beautiful makes me think there is a use for this product on a very limited basis.  I would never use it ever day, or even once per week, but for a rare occasion when my hair will not cooperate and I want to look good, I might try this again.  Not more frequently than once per month, though, or you could end up with pretty severe build-up that resists washing out.  Another possible use is to use it sparingly on the ends ONLY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if you are a die-hard earth momma, you will want to pass this chemical concoction by altogether.  Hope this helps!  :-)in, and I don&#x27;t need for it to start breaking!  It took about 2 weeks for my natural hair to start bouncing back.

            <li> I&#x27;m on my third bottle.  I set it up for Subscribe and Save almost immediately, so now I get this amazing after-shampoo product for the best price anywhere.  It removes any left-over tangles, smoothes the frizzies, and adds shine.  FYI, for my mid-back length, average thickness hair, I use three dropper tube fill-ups.  Weirdly, my daughter who has twice as much hair that is curly and thick, also uses three.  Grand daughter with thick long hair, also three.  I have everyone hooked on it.</li>
            <li> This is a heavier, VIctoria&#x27;s Secret Vanilla-lace scent inspired version of the CHI serum in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know lots of people like it---it&#x27;s not a fix, it&#x27;s a temporary solution. A decent one to be sure but I&#x27;ve used better oils on my hair to smooth it down. This is very heavy and silicone-y. If I use it I know that I will NOT be getting another day of unwashed hair out of the deal. I gave this to someone with hair that is not thick and coarse like mine and one drop made her love her hair. Mine just didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> This comes in  a beautiful pakcahge and has an ingenious twist/dropper mechanism to control the amount you put on your hair.  It only takes a few small drops to smooth over your hair.  I have curly 4b hair and I put it on when my hair is damp right after detangling.  It adds does smooth fly-aways and it make the hair feel more manageable.  It also smells fantastic.  A little goes a long way and I can see this bottle lasting for awhile.  Will update after a little more use to report long-term affects.</li>
            <li> Gives me softer, smoother hair, isn&#x27;t greasy or sticky and has a pleasant almost chocolate-like fragrance. Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> This product, while maybe a little pricey for the size, does do a fine job. Hair is smoother, softer, and smells very nice.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly, fine, and practically weightless, so it gets frizzy at the ends. Fekkai Prx Oil is recommended for that hair type for moisturization and control. After I wash my hair, I towel dry it and apply a dime-sized amount of oil to the ends only, then let it air dry. It really helps the waves hold together. Sometimes I also apply the oil  when my hair is dry, to the ends only. Also, when done applying it, I massage the thin coating of oil left on my hands into the skin, and it works well to soften them. The applicator is cleverly designed and dispenses just the right amount of oil with one push of the button. Very satisfied with this product and will definitely purchase more.</li>
            <li> First off, I love this product&#x27;s scent - the vanilla and argan oil together smell really nice - even for my very sensitive nose. I&#x27;ve tried this product on my hair (naturally curly 3b/3c hair) while wet, as that is how I usually use oil for my hair. I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference between this product and other oils that I&#x27;ve used in my hair. I also have used this product on my daughter&#x27;s thick &amp; straight hair, while it was wet and dry (to smooth it down). It did help her hair not be as flyaway as normal, but again not any more so than other products (namely coconut oil is what I use on her hair &amp; mine to smooth away frizz and flyaways).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, nice product but I didn&#x27;t really see that much of a difference between this and other oils I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This oil keeps my hair smooth and tames the frizz. It&#x27;s a bit heavy and the applicator pumps out quite a bit so I have to be careful not to use too much or it flattens my hair. The oil has a strong scent, at first but it mellows out after a few minutes and it&#x27;s not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I have very thick and unmanageable hair, and this product has been good to keep it under control. Unlike some other similar products, it doesn&#x27;t sit heavily on the hair, which is a plus. I&#x27;m seeing some improvement in how easy it is to manage my hair. This product doesn&#x27;t work any sort of miracles but it&#x27;s quite good.</li>
