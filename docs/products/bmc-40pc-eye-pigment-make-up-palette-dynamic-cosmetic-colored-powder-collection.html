            <li>Hope they make more colors but loving the ones I have!!!  </li>
            <li>Good quality for a great price.</li>
            <li>Each color is build-able so if you want a bright color you can reach that.</li>
            <li>Ever bit as good as the BE pigment shadows I used to have.</li>
            <li>However, I was under the impression that they&#x27;d be good for eyeshadow without adding anything to it...</li>
            <li>I purchased two palettes; one for my good friend and one for myself.</li>
            <li>The packaging was really great with each jar nestled firmly in it&#x27;s own hole in this foam tray inside a cardboard box.</li>
            <li>Great for making color acrylic powder, home made lipstick,and much more.</li>
            <li>I am happy to say that I am pleased with these eye pigments.</li>

            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love the colors.</li>
            <li>Either way, I was so impressed by the quality of these eye shadows that I would definitely buy again when I run out.</li>
            <li>The pigments are more lovely than the pictures show</li>
            <li>you have to swatch them to be sure of the color and finish.</li>
            <li>:) hope my review helped.</li>
            <li>These are a must have if you love eyeshadows.</li>
            <li>As I kept searching, I came across the BMC pigments and it was at a better price.</li>
            <li>I have created an eye look and I can&#x27;t wait to play around a bit more with my pigments.</li>
            <li>Omg I love every singal one of</li>
            <li>I love love love the box it makes it easy to organise them</li>
            <li>not one single color repeats even my husband was picking out his favorite ones for me to try lol!</li>
            <li>A very nice size and high pigmented works well with or without primer.</li>
            <li>I really love the colors &amp; they came very quick.</li>
            <li>This are all truly stunning and amazing and even better in person you can do wonderful eye looks with them and even make lipstick with them all highly pigmented and each color is different from the rest !</li>
            <li>The colors stand out so well and as another reviewer pointed out, they blend really easily.</li>
            <li>Perfect for people who like to play around with makeup, conventional or unconventional.</li>
            <li>all 40 beautiful colors were accounted for an different shades...</li>
            <li>Because I tried them as eyeshadow, beautiful colors, but easily brushed away when trying to blend.</li>
            <li>also , some colors I fell their pigmentation is light</li>
            <li>Lots of colors and really worth the price for so many colors.</li>
            <li>It blends so smoothly.</li>
            <li>They work great mixed with almond oil or Glycerine,as a paint medium for my soaps though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not paraben free.....</li>
            <li>and my sister is so jealous and wants her own set.</li>
            <li>and it was free shipping.</li>
            <li>but I love them and wish I could wear them all right now.</li>
            <li>im pleased with my pigments must buy &amp; can&#x27;t wait to use them this weekend ;)</li>
            <li>I am excited to play with this makeup.</li>
            <li>I mixed it with clear gloss and with carmex chap-stick, both came out AMAZING!!!</li>
            <li>Lots of product, many different colors, and the box they come in is handy too.</li>
            <li>And because it is a loose powder, you don&#x27;t have to use a lot to get a great effect.</li>
            <li>They are perfect for eyeshadow, or could be used for pigment painting like runway models have been sporting lately.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that you have to use a good eyeshadow primer so that the powder holds to the skin</li>
            <li>So fun to have all the colors available to you.</li>
            <li>Super quick shipping</li>
            <li>Totally worth the $$$.</li>
            <li>Worth the price at just over $1.00 per each 40 shades.  </li>
            <li>I have been having so much fun playing around with these.</li>
            <li>I love Mac pigments also but one of the old mac pigments were 7.5g for 21 bucks.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s hard to find good quality ones that have good pigments to them and these definitely do.</li>
            <li>The colors are great, but I was missing 1 colors!</li>
            <li>beutiful colors .....came fast and so pretty!</li>
            <li>Will buy more from this company in the future!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommed it highly for lip color though!!</li>
            <li>Shipping fast and well packaged for mobility!</li>
            <li>The only thing that could make this better is if they had a matte version c:</li>
            <li>; )</li>
            <li>Very useful for pigmenting clear resin or color dusting molds.</li>
            <li>They really liked , use them as eyeliner with a thin brush and wet; as eye shadow are beautiful</li>
            <li>Not quite pure pigment</li>
            <li>VERY PRETTY EVEN HAS CUTE LITTLE NAME&#x27;S FOR ALL OF THEM</li>
            <li>This was for my daughter and she absolutely LOVES it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Luv da colors thank u so much</li>
            <li>only downside is that I wish I had the whole set in matte as well!!!</li>
            <li>And remember, always use a primer with mineral pigments, especially anything glittery, or it falls right off!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using this to color cold process soap, so far so good :)</li>
            <li>none were opened or broken ,they were a decent size &amp; filled to the top...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have preferred if only some were metallic, while others were left as more matte.</li>
            <li>I should have read a little more or even asked.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot better than what I expected considering the price is low</li>
            <li>You get a good amount and the only thing to watch out for is that on some of the jars, there is a little dust from the color inside it on the outside.</li>
            <li>I actually use these mica pigments in my art/paintings, which might be an unusual application!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t mess with ordering from overseas vendors when you can get this and be assured of the quality and receive it quickly!</li>
            <li>Not only did my package come a day early but everything was exactly as advertised</li>
            <li>I initially thought some were similar but when swatched, the differences are clear.  </li>
            <li>I will be sharing this on my social networks.</li>
            <li>My only downside on this item is that ALL of the pigments are metallic and have major sheen.</li>
            <li>These will last one person for a really long time, and you can combine the colors to make new shades.</li>

            <li> none were opened or broken ,they were a decent size &amp; filled to the top...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have preferred if only some were metallic, while others were left as more matte.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I love them and I use them alot . the colors are amazing and they stay in place . also , some colors I fell their pigmentation is light so I put them in top of a shadow . I am very happy of my purchase and I am very happy that I bought them . I love love love the box it makes it easy to organise them and it would be a great gift .</li>
            <li> Ever bit as good as the BE pigment shadows I used to have. Totally worth the $$$. Not quite pure pigment but I&#x27;m not a total stickler on that score....</li>
            <li> came just as shown, the pigments go on well and the colors are nice! only downside is that I wish I had the whole set in matte as well!!!</li>
            <li> Quite a variety of colors, but does not seem as pigmented as other brands I have purchased through Amazon. It somewhat served it&#x27;s purpose, but I don&#x27;t know that I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Goes on the color you choose. Doesn&#x27;t fade and there&#x27;s not really any need to &amp;#34;pack&amp;#34; it on.</li>
            <li> The colors are great, but I was missing 1 colors!</li>
            <li> Worth the price at just over $1.00 per each 40 shades.  I initially thought some were similar but when swatched, the differences are clear.  Love these and the ideas are rolling in on the combinations I want to try.  Hope they make more colors but loving the ones I have!!!  Will buy more from this company in the future!</li>
            <li> Not only did my package come a day early but everything was exactly as advertised all 40 beautiful colors were accounted for an different shades...none were opened or broken ,they were a decent size &amp; filled to the top...im pleased with my pigments must buy &amp; can&#x27;t wait to use them this weekend ;)</li>
            <li> I love these! I use them all the time. Lots of colors and really worth the price for so many colors.</li>
            <li> These things are gorgeous!!! I didn&#x27;t realize all the pigments have a shimmer, but still works for me. I&#x27;m only in the beginning stages of doing makeup on myself, so maybe I don&#x27;t know anything... But my selfies are cute (my opinion counts to me)</li>
            <li> GORGEOUS EYE SHADOWS PERFECT &amp; VERY PRETTY EVEN HAS CUTE LITTLE NAME&#x27;S FOR ALL OF THEM AWESOME DEAL THANK U :)</li>
            <li> These are Amazing! I have been having so much fun playing around with these. They are perfect for eyeshadow, or could be used for pigment painting like runway models have been sporting lately. You cannot beat the price! These will last one person for a really long time, and you can combine the colors to make new shades. Perfect for people who like to play around with makeup, conventional or unconventional. Amazing number of uses!</li>
            <li> Love love love them. I use them to make colored acrylic for my nails. It blends so smoothly. When i tested it out on my skin it also blends very nice. The colors are so bright and pigmented!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use these for Beauty products.They work great mixed with almond oil or Glycerine,as a paint medium for my soaps though.</li>
            <li> I love the colors, and the large variety!!!! Beautiful .. However, I was under the impression that they&#x27;d be good for eyeshadow without adding anything to it... Is this not so? Because I tried them as eyeshadow, beautiful colors, but easily brushed away when trying to blend. Do you suggest primer or anything beneath the eyelids? I&#x27;d recommed it highly for lip color though!! I mixed it with clear gloss and with carmex chap-stick, both came out AMAZING!!! longer lasting than my other products as well...</li>
            <li> I really love the colors &amp; they came very quick. I don&#x27;t use them for eyeshadow I use them to make nail polish but they are great either way</li>
            <li> Good quality for a great price. This will me forever.</li>
            <li> The packing was perfect I love the colors</li>
            <li> These are beautiful I just recieve mines today. They are better looking in person then in picture! A very nice size and high pigmented works well with or without primer. Great for making color acrylic powder, home made lipstick,and much more. If your a DIY kind of person on a budget like myself. I recommend this product. The packaging was great and I got this 3 days before I expected!</li>
            <li> I purchased two palettes; one for my good friend and one for myself. We both love the palette</li>
            <li> Very good product, all pigments are pearl finishes. It is a steal for sure. Each color is build-able so if you want a bright color you can reach that.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be more happier! Love love all the pigments...pass expectation! I am extremely happy with this product! Shipping fast and well packaged for mobility!</li>
            <li> This was for my daughter and she absolutely LOVES it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The variety of shades is awesome and she can&#x27;t get over how pigmented it is.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money, beautiful colors that work well with or without primer. The only thing that could make this better is if they had a matte version c:</li>
            <li> I actually use these mica pigments in my art/paintings, which might be an unusual application! But, it works. It&#x27;s a great set with a large variety of colors. My only downside on this item is that ALL of the pigments are metallic and have major sheen. I&#x27;d have preferred if only some were metallic, while others were left as more matte.</li>
            <li> too many bright colors</li>
            <li> These pigments are spectacular. I love it.</li>
            <li> Luv da colors thank u so much</li>
            <li> Love the colors. Very useful for pigmenting clear resin or color dusting molds.</li>
            <li> I should have read a little more or even asked. It&#x27;s not paraben free.....</li>
            <li> beutiful colors .....came fast and so pretty! perfect!</li>
            <li> I love love love these pigments! The colors are Georg!#happy #mua</li>
            <li> I actually bought this set from Walmart.com at the beginning of the year and it was cheaper then ($30) [this was before I discovered Amazon]. Either way, I was so impressed by the quality of these eye shadows that I would definitely buy again when I run out. They are AMAZING. I&#x27;ve always been a fan of loose eye shadows colors but it&#x27;s hard to find good quality ones that have good pigments to them and these definitely do. The colors stand out so well and as another reviewer pointed out, they blend really easily. And because it is a loose powder, you don&#x27;t have to use a lot to get a great effect. The only thing is that you have to use a good eyeshadow primer so that the powder holds to the skin better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to EVERYBODY and my sister is so jealous and wants her own set. ; )</li>
            <li> These are awesome!!!! The bottles are much larger than I expected and the colors are auhmazeballs. Very awesome.</li>
            <li> This are all truly stunning and amazing and even better in person you can do wonderful eye looks with them and even make lipstick with them all highly pigmented and each color is different from the rest ! Amazing quality and variety !&lt;br /&gt;(All are shimmer though :( )</li>
            <li> So fun to have all the colors available to you. If your just getting into the pigments, this is a great kickoff.</li>
            <li> This deal is terrific! (Remember: check the grams when comparing! Also, these containers are about 1&amp;#34; tall by 1.125&amp;#34; wide and contain 7.5 grams each!!) The pigments are more lovely than the pictures show and they are quality, not cheap junk! You get a good amount and the only thing to watch out for is that on some of the jars, there is a little dust from the color inside it on the outside. However, the sealing sticker over the dispensing holes was not breached and I suspect this dust was from the initial filling of the jars. To me, this was no big deal and I simply wiped down all the jars with a damp paper towel. The packaging was really great with each jar nestled firmly in it&#x27;s own hole in this foam tray inside a cardboard box. I checked all over Amazon comparing price per gram and whatnot and this is the best deal at this time, bar none! I only worried they would have duplicates or low quality. Well, I&#x27;m telling you right now, this is excellent quality and there are no duplicates and plenty of colors are here. Even if some look similar in the jars, such as some of the neutral bronze colors, they are very different when applied, so keep that in mind - you have to swatch them to be sure of the color and finish. And remember, always use a primer with mineral pigments, especially anything glittery, or it falls right off! I use a sponge applicator and press the color on if I really want to build it up, then I can blend afterward with brushes - this prevents so much waste, but you have enough here to last a LONG time. Don&#x27;t mess with ordering from overseas vendors when you can get this and be assured of the quality and receive it quickly!</li>
            <li> These pigments are great! Lots of product, many different colors, and the box they come in is handy too. I love Mac pigments also but one of the old mac pigments were 7.5g for 21 bucks. This set comes with 40, 7.5g jars. I&#x27;ll do my best to describe some of the shades. These a black or charcoal color, grey, pearl white, bronze color, campaign, yellows, blues, purple, pinks, copper, and peachy colors. My favorite is called moon dust! Check it out! This set is all shimmery and no matte. :) hope my review helped.</li>
            <li> Ordered these 3 days ago and got them today. I swatched most of the colors and they look amazing. It&#x27;s a lot better than what I expected considering the price is low but I love them and wish I could wear them all right now. These are a must have if you love eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> Great Product! Lots of colors, value for money. I&#x27;m using this to color cold process soap, so far so good :)</li>
            <li> Works awesome with Mehron Mixing Liquid.</li>
            <li> I was considering buying the 40pc Shany Eye Pigment. As I kept searching, I came across the BMC pigments and it was at a better price. I took a chance, since there are not many reviews on their product on the social media sites that I frequent.  I am happy to say that I am pleased with these eye pigments. I ordered this week on Wednesday and received them on today, Friday. Super quick shipping and it was free shipping. I have created an eye look and I can&#x27;t wait to play around a bit more with my pigments. I will be sharing this on my social networks. I can&#x27;t wait to display a look using the pigments as an eye shadow, blush, and lip color. This is a multi-purpose product.  This has given me a boost in my makeup mentality. I am excited to play with this makeup. It works well for the price and I don&#x27;t have any complaints.  Use a primer is one tip, which BMC states on the back of their box. Also I tried applying it wet and it worked. It works for me!</li>
            <li> Best product ever love it fast shipping</li>
            <li> Omg I love every singal one of these yes you need a primer to wear under it but they are beautiful the jars are a great size theres plenty in each one not one single color repeats even my husband was picking out his favorite ones for me to try lol!</li>
            <li> They really liked , use them as eyeliner with a thin brush and wet; as eye shadow are beautiful</li>
