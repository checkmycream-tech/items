            <li>These are perfect, gives me some volume and length without making me look like a wanna be barbie.</li>
            <li>i trim the edge and it fits perfectly.  </li>
            <li>The applicator helps a lot and the glue is great.</li>
            <li>great price.  </li>
            <li>I hoped that since this one included the applicator and glue they would be a good quality</li>
            <li>Nicely made product and a good way to start out and practice without breaking the budget.</li>
            <li>My first pair of lashes and I loved them!</li>
            <li>I am pretty happy with this kit.</li>
            <li>I just reordered 4 more sets.  </li>
            <li>I love the lashes, but the glue it comes with isn&#x27;t the glue it would come with in stores.</li>
            <li>Lashes are okay</li>
            <li>The glue held pretty good, but I was still able to pull them off with some effort.</li>
            <li>The product is easy to use with the applicator.  </li>
            <li>Once I had them on my eyes they didn&#x27;t make a huge impression.</li>
            <li>Easy to wear, quick delivery, pretty lashes!</li>
            <li>They are just right!</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m pretty happy with these, like I said though</li>
            <li>Looks good on but definitely need to practice.</li>
            <li>It got it for $7-8 at Sally&#x27;s, so the Amazon price is really good, considering if you order it with other \\&quot;free super saver shipping\\&quot; items then shipping is included.</li>
            <li>it looks very nature and easy to apply</li>
            <li>Excellent product, easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t look fake</li>
            <li>I trim them down a little and they blend in perfectly with my own lashes, it gives a much more natural lash look.  </li>
            <li>I got one of them too close to my nose and the other one looked good.</li>
            <li>My first try</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s my first try</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re looking for something natural to add a boost to your natural lashes, i would strongly recommend this!</li>
            <li>I swear that each lash is like, a centimeter long or more.</li>
            <li>but instead they worked about the same as a cheap pair would.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Glue works for a couple of hours comes up right away on contact with water, eye lashes look extremely natural</li>
            <li>I actually needed more lash Grip glue, so it was a &amp;#34;no brainer&amp;#34; to pay for the kit instead of just paying for the glue at almost the same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Human hair lashes with all you need to put them on at a VERY REASONABLE PRICE.</li>
            <li>Very natural looking.</li>
            <li>Very natural feel and look.</li>
            <li>The lashes look natural too.</li>
            <li>I use loreal telescopic mascara to blend my natural lashes in.</li>
            <li>I put a dot of glue on some foil and used a tooth pick to smear it across the lash band, I don&#x27;t trust myself squeezing the bottle directly on the lashes.</li>
            <li>No 110 is natural style.</li>
            <li>It is good but very thin.</li>
            <li>i have small asian eyes and always love wearing ardell no. 110.  </li>
            <li>everyday~  items arrived fast and packaged very well.  </li>
            <li>I have sparse lashes and was hoping to use these to fill in the bare areas.  </li>
            <li>These lashes are so long, they do not look natural at all.  </li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;m looking for something way more subtle and less noticeable.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ll admit that I&#x27;m not great at putting these on, but even if I had gotten them on right, they are so long that they look like something a stage performer would wear with full hair, heavy make-up, and a rhinestone jumpsuit.  </li>
            <li> The applicator thing it comes with is pretty useless, though, so unless you really can&#x27;t stand having your fingers close to your eyes, don&#x27;t bother with it.</li>
            <li> cuz the clear band is a little noticeable</li>
            <li> It is totally what I expected.</li>
            <li> I have naturally long lashes, but not much in the way of volume.</li>
            <li> Everyone told me to do a few dry runs with lashes before I actually had to wear them out anywhere.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think that the little plastic thing actually helps you put the strip lash on any easier.</li>
            <li> It seemed like the only way to get them to blend in along the eyelid is to wear heavy eyeliner so they aren&#x27;t so noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never worn fake lashes before, so I had to practice to get them glued on right, but it&#x27;s manageable.</li>
            <li> I have used Ardel lashes and other products for years.  </li>
            <li> The glue came out white and very messy.</li>
            <li> I need to wear black eyeliner with these so there won&#x27;t be visible skin between my real and fake.</li>
            <li> Just use eyeliner to make the band black</li>
            <li> I cut the lashes in to 2 pieces and use half on each lid.</li>
            <li> I did look on Amazon for fake eyelashes and it seems like there are plenty of decent ones you can get for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> Never really wore lashes before but it is hard to put them on with out any sort of help.</li>
            <li> Ive tried a bunch of lashes and usually i just dony like the way they look, i end up looking way too done up.</li>
            <li> They only did a little bit for volume, which is disappointing, but they add a whooole lot of length.</li>
            <li> I even added extra glue but ended up just peeling them off and tossing them which was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I have purchased false eyelashes before.</li>
            <li> they are not overly dramatic</li>
            <li> They were difficult to line up correctly using the applicator</li>
            <li> Not too flashy.</li>
            <li> I was somewhat disappointed with this product.</li>

            <li> I was somewhat disappointed with this product. I have purchased false eyelashes before. I hoped that since this one included the applicator and glue they would be a good quality but instead they worked about the same as a cheap pair would. The glue came out white and very messy. Once I had them on my eyes they didn&#x27;t make a huge impression. They were difficult to line up correctly using the applicator so I ended up just using my fingers. Then within an hour of wearing them they were peeling up at the edges. I even added extra glue but ended up just peeling them off and tossing them which was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Looks good on but definitely need to practice.</li>
            <li> Human hair lashes with all you need to put them on at a VERY REASONABLE PRICE. Nicely made product and a good way to start out and practice without breaking the budget.</li>
            <li> It is good but very thin.</li>
            <li> Easy to wear, quick delivery, pretty lashes!</li>
            <li> Rec&#x27;d as advertised.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Never really wore lashes before but it is hard to put them on with out any sort of help. The applicator helps a lot and the glue is great. The lashes look natural too. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> These lashes are so long, they do not look natural at all.  I have sparse lashes and was hoping to use these to fill in the bare areas.  I&#x27;ll admit that I&#x27;m not great at putting these on, but even if I had gotten them on right, they are so long that they look like something a stage performer would wear with full hair, heavy make-up, and a rhinestone jumpsuit.  I even tried trimming the length but they they were so dense that they looked bristle-y.  It seemed like the only way to get them to blend in along the eyelid is to wear heavy eyeliner so they aren&#x27;t so noticeable.  I guess I&#x27;m looking for something way more subtle and less noticeable.</li>
            <li> it looks very nature and easy to apply</li>
            <li> Ive tried a bunch of lashes and usually i just dony like the way they look, i end up looking way too done up. These are perfect, gives me some volume and length without making me look like a wanna be barbie. I use loreal telescopic mascara to blend my natural lashes in. Just use eyeliner to make the band black cuz the clear band is a little noticeable</li>
            <li> I am pretty happy with this kit. I was looking for something that had the glue and lashes in it so I didn&#x27;t have to buy it all separately. It got it for $7-8 at Sally&#x27;s, so the Amazon price is really good, considering if you order it with other \\&quot;free super saver shipping\\&quot; items then shipping is included. Everyone told me to do a few dry runs with lashes before I actually had to wear them out anywhere. My first try I got one of them too close to my nose and the other one looked good. I need to wear black eyeliner with these so there won&#x27;t be visible skin between my real and fake. The glue held pretty good, but I was still able to pull them off with some effort. I put a dot of glue on some foil and used a tooth pick to smear it across the lash band, I don&#x27;t trust myself squeezing the bottle directly on the lashes. Overall, I&#x27;m pretty happy with these, like I said though, it&#x27;s my first try so I&#x27;m no expert. I wish the package showed a picture of someone with the set that&#x27;s included. All the pictures on the front are of the same pair of eyelashes, it makes it more difficult to imagine what they&#x27;d look like on someone with the lashes on and their eyes open. I did look on Amazon for fake eyelashes and it seems like there are plenty of decent ones you can get for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> Glue works for a couple of hours comes up right away on contact with water, eye lashes look extremely natural</li>
            <li> great price.  Recommend the kit if you are a beginner at putting on lashes.</li>
            <li> The product is easy to use with the applicator.  I cut the lashes in to 2 pieces and use half on each lid. I trim them down a little and they blend in perfectly with my own lashes, it gives a much more natural lash look.  The adhesive holds in place for days.  I just reordered 4 more sets.  Thanks</li>
            <li> My first pair of lashes and I loved them! They are just right! Not too flashy. Very natural looking. They stayed on until I took them off. I can&#x27;t wait to wear them again and again.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t look fake</li>
            <li> I love the lashes, but the glue it comes with isn&#x27;t the glue it would come with in stores. I had to buy glue to use them.</li>
            <li> i have small asian eyes and always love wearing ardell no. 110.  i trim the edge and it fits perfectly.  they are not overly dramatic so i can wear it everyday~  items arrived fast and packaged very well.  if you&#x27;re looking for something natural to add a boost to your natural lashes, i would strongly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Like it. No 110 is natural style. It is totally what I expected. I have already recommended it to others.</li>
            <li> Lashes are okay but I don&#x27;t think that the little plastic thing actually helps you put the strip lash on any easier.</li>
            <li> Very natural feel and look. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I have naturally long lashes, but not much in the way of volume. I bought these thinking they would add both. They only did a little bit for volume, which is disappointing, but they add a whooole lot of length. I swear that each lash is like, a centimeter long or more. I&#x27;ve never worn fake lashes before, so I had to practice to get them glued on right, but it&#x27;s manageable. The applicator thing it comes with is pretty useless, though, so unless you really can&#x27;t stand having your fingers close to your eyes, don&#x27;t bother with it.</li>
            <li> I have used Ardel lashes and other products for years.  I actually needed more lash Grip glue, so it was a &amp;#34;no brainer&amp;#34; to pay for the kit instead of just paying for the glue at almost the same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The freebie for me was the plastic applicator for the lashes and the extra set of lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good deal for the money.</li>
