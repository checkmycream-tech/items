            <li> great product,.....works like it should.</li>
            <li> I love this foot cream!  Not only is it effective but it smells fantastic.  Most foot creams have a peppermint odor but not this one.  It&#x27;s a nice, sweet scent - very subtle.  This is my 3rd time for ordering this product.  If you are a daily user of foot cream like myself, this will be your new favorite!!</li>

            <li> i&#x27;ve used this before and it works really well! i put it on morning and night. one tube last me one year.</li>
            <li> Quick &amp; easy... thank you.</li>
            <li> When I run out you can tell the difference, nothing else moisturizes my feet like this!</li>
            <li> This product did just what it said. It&#x27;s make your feet so soft and smooth . No need for that nail shop product. Callous remover.</li>
            <li> I could tell a difference after a few days, thanks</li>
            <li> I live in AZ and wear sandals every day, all year long so my feet have to look nice. The problem is that my feet are prone to cracking which hurts and is ugly. I&#x27;ve tried a gazillion creams, Vaseline w/socks, oil etc. and nothing worked so I got a pedicure every 10 days. That gets expensive. Then I tried Nu Skin and in 2 weeks the cracking was gone and my feet were softer. The longer i use it the better my feet get. Now I can go 5 or 6 weeks between pedicures and my feet look and feel good. Nu Skin is a must have!</li>
