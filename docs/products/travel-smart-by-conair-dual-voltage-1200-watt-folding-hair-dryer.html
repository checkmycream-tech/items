            <li>a great purchase this was&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>The dual voltage worked great with an adapter.  </li>
            <li>Cheap piece, do not invest any time and money in this!!!</li>
            <li>It is especially hazardous to those who have fine hair that tends to have flyaways.</li>
            <li>so you have to be fairly close to the outlet when you use it.  </li>
            <li>Good dryer for the price.</li>
            <li>its all good.  </li>
            <li>and he is more than happy</li>
            <li>Perfect for travel and my silicon diffuser fits right over the nozzles.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;m pretty happy with it!</li>
            <li>and I absolutely LOVE it!</li>
            <li>I was very happy with the travel smart dryer and will use it each year when we travel abroad.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer very compact and perfect for traveling.  </li>
            <li>The dual voltage will come in handy for any trip abroad.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s surprisingly very strong.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as directional as a full-sized dryer with a longer barrel, but it&#x27;s better than most travel dryers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had to figure out if it works for my rather challenging</li>
            <li>This lightweight dryer with the on/off switch on the back of the handle fits the bill perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I figured I&#x27;d just have to keep it at that setting, as it still worked okay.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more compact than the travel one she uses when traveling and is a lot faster.</li>
            <li>It was ok and I completed drying my hair..</li>
            <li>I was initially pleased with this compact, inexpensive dryer.  </li>
            <li>most if not all of the world.</li>
            <li>I love this thing...</li>
            <li>I will use Amazon for all my shopping in the future because they provide excellent service.</li>
            <li>and he still tells me how he like that one better than the one we have a home,</li>
            <li>So far mine is working great.  </li>
            <li>I spotted this in the Target luggage section for about the same price and loved it at first sight and had to have it!!!!  </li>
            <li>Its size, weight, and performance make this an easy choice for travel.</li>
            <li>It can easily go in your carry-on if you prefer not to check luggage.  </li>
            <li>Easy to switch voltage which I did before going to Italy.</li>
            <li>The wattage is easily changed for travel abroad.</li>
            <li>Easy for travel use.</li>
            <li>Easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>This dryer is easy to hold and has alot of power and force.  </li>
            <li>This is hands down the best one I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>has worked fine.  </li>
            <li>My husband checked it out and said everything was working fine</li>
            <li>When I used it in the States it was fine.</li>
            <li>It seemed to be working fine</li>
            <li>but at home it works just fine.</li>
            <li>The size and weight are perfect for carrying in my swim bag, taking up much less room that my defunct dryer.  </li>
            <li>air is quite strong for it&#x27;s size which I did not expect which is a huge plus.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Light weight, efficient, dual voltage and work fine</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried cheap travel hair dryers.</li>
            <li>great dryer (enough power) that i use not just for travel.  </li>
            <li>I bought this hair dryer two years ago, and it worked great for its tiny size.</li>
            <li>10 min)  and meets my picky standards for a smooth, shiny blowout.</li>
            <li>Dryer is light and foldable.</li>
            <li>I wish it was a tad more powerful</li>
            <li>Best travel hairdryer ever thanks to the ultra compact size and low wattage.  </li>
            <li>Both are great for traveling and work better than I expected.</li>
            <li>I love this small and easy to carry hair dryer, ideal for traveling.</li>
            <li>So portable &amp; small, perfect for travel or keeping at your partner&#x27;s house on overnights.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how POWERFUL this hair drier is for its size!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to use it at all because it was so HOT</li>
            <li>I originally jumped the gun and gave this5 stars.  </li>
            <li>still a great size if you have limited luggage space.  </li>
            <li>I love the travel smart conair 1200 watt for traveling.</li>
            <li>the price was right!</li>
            <li>It is light, but powerful too.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for my wife and and she recently took it on a trip and loved it.</li>
            <li>It performed just like a full size model</li>
            <li>But I couldn&#x27;t use it at all the last couple of months of my travels and that wasn&#x27;t good.  </li>
            <li>But does a decent job, with good air on the high setting.</li>
            <li>The other great thing is that it has &amp;</li>
            <li>I received the hair dryer quickly.</li>
            <li>The smell goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>best thing I bought for travel recently since finding a hand-held luggage scale!  </li>
            <li>It fits into a small space and is ideal for packing.</li>
            <li>After my favorite dryer broke, I looked for one like it that is lightweight, has power but not too much power, and most importantly, has the high/low/off switch on the BACK of the dryer handle, not in the front.  </li>
            <li>I was the type of person who insisted carrying my full sized, non-folding hair dryer under all circumstance during trips, this product has become vital for me :)</li>
            <li>I have short hair, and this dryer delivers quick drying at a comfortable sound level with no hassle with easy packability.</li>
            <li>It was way too noisy, overheated so much that it stopped working all together!!</li>
            <li>Very light weight and worked fine for my hair which is mid length.  </li>
            <li>Powerful for size</li>
            <li>Powerful yet compact hair dryer.</li>
            <li>PACKS ENOUGH POWER NICE &amp; COMPACT.</li>
            <li>I like how small it is and has good power makes it easy to travel with</li>
            <li>From the other reviews I can see that many people will assume it will switch automatically (like most laptops and cell phone chargers).  </li>
            <li>The price is right.</li>
            <li>This one has just the right amount of wattage.</li>
            <li>Yes, it was the right plug shape</li>
            <li>Great little hair dryer!  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not as powerful or capable as a &amp;#34;full-sized&amp;#34; dryer.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what you want from a travel dryer.</li>
            <li>have used it for several trips and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>Works really well!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>So unless I would have brought my toolbox with me on my trip, I could not switch it (even if I was aware that you need to do so).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No weird smells as someone else</li>
            <li>Maybe better for local travel and</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>We have had 2 of these break after exactly 13 months of use (so just outside the warranty; on top of that the cost of mailing ect.</li>
            <li>So I used it on high - the job was done quickly</li>
            <li>Tiny and light, just right for carryon air travel.</li>
            <li>and it dries my hair as well as the large one I use when at home.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works well enough......can&#x27;t expect too much from a dryer this little......might take me five more minutes to dry my hair</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not worried about how long it will take, but this thing is pretty strong.  </li>
            <li>This lines the airflow up giving a useful stream of air instead of the every-which-way mess of air that most travel dryers produce.  </li>
            <li>It drys my hair almost as fast as my &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; dryer at home.  </li>
            <li>I used it for a trip abroad when I didn&#x27;t have much space and wanted to limit the weight of my suitcase.  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t take up much room</li>
            <li>(very curly, very thin/fine, frizzy)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this dryer, and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li>This is important to me as I have started travelling using only a 21\\&quot; rolling bag for shorter trips and the 21\\&quot; bag plus a carry-on for trips longer than a week.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for 2 years and highly recommend!</li>
            <li>and I guess a whole lot of electronics and stuff like this is made</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than that, it&#x27;s very lightweight, compact and dries&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I travel all summer and never take a blow dryer with me because they take up too much room.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my trips and it is absolutely convenient and</li>
            <li>Has more BTU&#x27;s than any other she&#x27;s ever used.</li>
            <li>This survived a trip to rural abroad and worked great, so long as I used it on low.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I will say that the weight of this dryer is almost nothing - it&#x27;s super light, and takes up next to no space, especially when folded.  </li>
            <li>I ordered it shortly before taking a trip to Europe, trusting that it would work, happy about the fact that it was small and compact.</li>
            <li>If it only had a cool setting</li>
            <li>Hotter than my full size blow dryer actually.</li>
            <li>Nice small package hairdryer.  </li>
            <li>While it is true that many modern electronic devices have &amp;#34;auto-ranging&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;universal&amp;#34; AC inputs and work properly on any line voltage anywhere, this little hairdryer isn&#x27;t one of them.  </li>
            <li>initial impression wasn&#x27;t great - the &#x27;high&#x27; mode is really, really strong and &#x27;low&#x27; is way too weak.  </li>
            <li>After many years use with a larger hair dryer it finally died.</li>
            <li>maybe their particular product has an issue.  </li>
            <li>I did use it on high and had no issues so did not experience what some others posted.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;We bought the second one because the quality of the rest of the components as well as the construction is very good, but after the second break-down with exactly the same problem and after exactly the same time, we must conclude that this is not worth the money.</li>
            <li>This dryer gets the job done in nearly the same time as my full size dryer (+/-</li>
            <li>next time I used it, alternating between high and low heat, it seemed to be fine...</li>
            <li>Later I lived in a second, very modern house in the country&#x27;s modern capital and it wouldn&#x27;t plug into the wall at all in any part of the house!!  </li>
            <li>This little thing is powerful and can get hot!</li>
            <li>I live out of a suitcase.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>So here is the tricky part if this stuff is new for you, too...</li>
            <li>but I can live with it &amp;#34;as is&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It is very light weight and small when folded.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I did not give it five stars is because it has a funky hot plastic smell after I use it.  </li>
            <li>Certainly strong enough to dry one&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>Very compact, yet enough power to dry my hair quickly.</li>
            <li>This morning a large clump of my hair was pulled into the fan and subsequently torn out!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted, very small and very powerful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very compact and light, and I will use one at least a year before it bites the dust.</li>
            <li>The Low/Off/High switch and the voltage selector are clearly marked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, the documentation does not make it clear that you MUST switch it manually from 125 to 250 volts.  </li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>The result was voluminous, soft hair with no frizz.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wow - so lightweight.</li>
            <li>And those things can be loud too.</li>
            <li>This one isn&#x27;t so loud at 1200 watts.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because it&#x27;s so loud, I would not recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li>Not to mention, it was so loud to use.  </li>
            <li>And I barely used it!!!  </li>
            <li>Very small and very light.  </li>
            <li>Love it, can&#x27;t wait to take it traveling since it&#x27;s so darn small!</li>
            <li>It is small and packs easily.</li>
            <li>Since then I&#x27;ve experimented with a few different things and what works best is to start with really wet hair - turn head upside down and dry on high using the nozzle that comes with the dryer.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect but needed a small, inexpensive dryer for travel - my regular one pretty much takes up half a suitcase</li>
            <li>Small and light weight.</li>
            <li>Only by trial and error (and the fact that it was supposed to be initially set to 125 volts), did I figure out which was which.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed to use a screwdriver to turn the switch because, unlike most devices, a coin will not fit in the slot.  </li>
            <li>I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t be powerful enough or hot enough as I have long (middle of my back)</li>
            <li>It was a waste of money and I highly discourage anyone else who might be interested in this product.</li>
            <li>My hair is dry, it is very portable and inexpensive.</li>
            <li>It has a lot of power for its size and dried my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have thick hair and it dries my hair very quickly.  </li>
            <li>This is my second one; first one lasted for several years with DAILY use.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s strong and small enough for travelling</li>
            <li>These other users apparently did not flip this switch and reported that it gets hot and noisy when they use it at 250 volts.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t blow an older circuit, but it is not so wimpy as to take forever to dry my hair.</li>
            <li>I have only been using it for about two weeks, and it is meeting all of my expectations thus far.  </li>
            <li>Powerful enough, not too noisy, takes up little space.</li>
            <li>I anticipated a loud, high pitched scream, due to the compact size, but it operates with quiet efficiency.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d never rely on this for every day or for a long trip, but since it&#x27;s so light and small, will keep it on hand for overnights.</li>
            <li>The main problem is that I have long hair and occasionally I will get the back side of the dryer too close to my hair, and hair in the fan is what will kill &#x27;em.</li>
            <li>I barely started using it back home a month</li>
            <li>Powerful and small.</li>
            <li>But I am changing my rating from 5 to 3 because the darn thing nearly gave me a heart attack the few times I accidentally put it on high while trying to turn it off.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it for foreign travel.</li>
            <li>I purchased this hair dryer after looking without success for one this small in local stores.  </li>
            <li>It packs up super small, and the cord, (which probably rolls up the size of the dryer itself!)</li>
    </ol>

            <li> so you have to be fairly close to the outlet when you use it.  </li>
            <li> Good dryer for the price.</li>
            <li> its all good.  </li>
            <li> and he is more than happy</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel and my silicon diffuser fits right over the nozzles.  </li>
            <li> This is the perfect travel hair dryer--lightweight, good drying power and very durable.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty happy with it!</li>
            <li> and I absolutely LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the travel smart dryer and will use it each year when we travel abroad.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer very compact and perfect for traveling.  </li>
            <li> The dual voltage will come in handy for any trip abroad.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s surprisingly very strong.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as directional as a full-sized dryer with a longer barrel, but it&#x27;s better than most travel dryers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to figure out if it works for my rather challenging</li>
            <li> This lightweight dryer with the on/off switch on the back of the handle fits the bill perfectly.  </li>
            <li> I figured I&#x27;d just have to keep it at that setting, as it still worked okay.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more compact than the travel one she uses when traveling and is a lot faster.</li>
            <li> It was ok and I completed drying my hair..</li>
            <li> I was initially pleased with this compact, inexpensive dryer.  </li>
            <li> most if not all of the world.</li>
            <li> I love this thing...</li>
            <li> I will use Amazon for all my shopping in the future because they provide excellent service.</li>
            <li> and he still tells me how he like that one better than the one we have a home,</li>
            <li> So far mine is working great.  </li>
            <li> I spotted this in the Target luggage section for about the same price and loved it at first sight and had to have it!!!!  </li>
            <li> Its size, weight, and performance make this an easy choice for travel.</li>
            <li> It can easily go in your carry-on if you prefer not to check luggage.  </li>
            <li> Easy to switch voltage which I did before going to Italy.</li>
            <li> The wattage is easily changed for travel abroad.</li>
            <li> Easy for travel use.</li>
            <li> Easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> This dryer is easy to hold and has alot of power and force.  </li>
            <li> This is hands down the best one I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> has worked fine.  </li>
            <li> My husband checked it out and said everything was working fine</li>
            <li> When I used it in the States it was fine.</li>
            <li> It seemed to be working fine</li>
            <li> but at home it works just fine.</li>
            <li> The size and weight are perfect for carrying in my swim bag, taking up much less room that my defunct dryer.  </li>
            <li> air is quite strong for it&#x27;s size which I did not expect which is a huge plus.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Light weight, efficient, dual voltage and work fine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried cheap travel hair dryers.</li>
            <li> great dryer (enough power) that i use not just for travel.  </li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer two years ago, and it worked great for its tiny size.</li>
            <li> 10 min)  and meets my picky standards for a smooth, shiny blowout.</li>
            <li> Dryer is light and foldable.</li>
            <li> I wish it was a tad more powerful</li>
            <li> Best travel hairdryer ever thanks to the ultra compact size and low wattage.  </li>
            <li> Both are great for traveling and work better than I expected.</li>
            <li> I love this small and easy to carry hair dryer, ideal for traveling.</li>
            <li> So portable &amp; small, perfect for travel or keeping at your partner&#x27;s house on overnights.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how POWERFUL this hair drier is for its size!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to use it at all because it was so HOT</li>
            <li> I originally jumped the gun and gave this5 stars.  </li>
            <li> still a great size if you have limited luggage space.  </li>
            <li> I love the travel smart conair 1200 watt for traveling.</li>
            <li> the price was right!</li>
            <li> It is light, but powerful too.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife and and she recently took it on a trip and loved it.</li>
            <li> It performed just like a full size model</li>
            <li> But I couldn&#x27;t use it at all the last couple of months of my travels and that wasn&#x27;t good.  </li>
            <li> But does a decent job, with good air on the high setting.</li>
            <li> The other great thing is that it has &amp;</li>
            <li> I received the hair dryer quickly.</li>
            <li> The smell goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> best thing I bought for travel recently since finding a hand-held luggage scale!  </li>
            <li> It fits into a small space and is ideal for packing.</li>
            <li> After my favorite dryer broke, I looked for one like it that is lightweight, has power but not too much power, and most importantly, has the high/low/off switch on the BACK of the dryer handle, not in the front.  </li>
            <li> I was the type of person who insisted carrying my full sized, non-folding hair dryer under all circumstance during trips, this product has become vital for me :)</li>
            <li> I have short hair, and this dryer delivers quick drying at a comfortable sound level with no hassle with easy packability.</li>
            <li> It was way too noisy, overheated so much that it stopped working all together!!</li>
            <li> Very light weight and worked fine for my hair which is mid length.  </li>
            <li> Powerful for size</li>
            <li> Powerful yet compact hair dryer.</li>
            <li> PACKS ENOUGH POWER NICE &amp; COMPACT.</li>
            <li> I like how small it is and has good power makes it easy to travel with</li>
            <li> From the other reviews I can see that many people will assume it will switch automatically (like most laptops and cell phone chargers).  </li>
            <li> The price is right.</li>
            <li> This one has just the right amount of wattage.</li>
            <li> Yes, it was the right plug shape</li>
            <li> Great little hair dryer!  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not as powerful or capable as a &amp;#34;full-sized&amp;#34; dryer.  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what you want from a travel dryer.</li>
            <li> have used it for several trips and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> Works really well!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> So unless I would have brought my toolbox with me on my trip, I could not switch it (even if I was aware that you need to do so).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No weird smells as someone else</li>
            <li> Maybe better for local travel and</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> We have had 2 of these break after exactly 13 months of use (so just outside the warranty; on top of that the cost of mailing ect.</li>
            <li> So I used it on high - the job was done quickly</li>
            <li> Tiny and light, just right for carryon air travel.</li>
            <li> and it dries my hair as well as the large one I use when at home.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works well enough......can&#x27;t expect too much from a dryer this little......might take me five more minutes to dry my hair</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not worried about how long it will take, but this thing is pretty strong.  </li>
            <li> This lines the airflow up giving a useful stream of air instead of the every-which-way mess of air that most travel dryers produce.  </li>
            <li> It drys my hair almost as fast as my &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; dryer at home.  </li>
            <li> I used it for a trip abroad when I didn&#x27;t have much space and wanted to limit the weight of my suitcase.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t take up much room</li>
            <li> (very curly, very thin/fine, frizzy)</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this dryer, and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> This is important to me as I have started travelling using only a 21\\&quot; rolling bag for shorter trips and the 21\\&quot; bag plus a carry-on for trips longer than a week.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for 2 years and highly recommend!</li>
            <li> and I guess a whole lot of electronics and stuff like this is made</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other than that, it&#x27;s very lightweight, compact and dries&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I travel all summer and never take a blow dryer with me because they take up too much room.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my trips and it is absolutely convenient and</li>
            <li> Has more BTU&#x27;s than any other she&#x27;s ever used.</li>
            <li> This survived a trip to rural abroad and worked great, so long as I used it on low.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I will say that the weight of this dryer is almost nothing - it&#x27;s super light, and takes up next to no space, especially when folded.  </li>
            <li> I ordered it shortly before taking a trip to Europe, trusting that it would work, happy about the fact that it was small and compact.</li>
            <li> If it only had a cool setting</li>
            <li> Hotter than my full size blow dryer actually.</li>
            <li> Nice small package hairdryer.  </li>
            <li> While it is true that many modern electronic devices have &amp;#34;auto-ranging&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;universal&amp;#34; AC inputs and work properly on any line voltage anywhere, this little hairdryer isn&#x27;t one of them.  </li>
            <li> initial impression wasn&#x27;t great - the &#x27;high&#x27; mode is really, really strong and &#x27;low&#x27; is way too weak.  </li>
            <li> After many years use with a larger hair dryer it finally died.</li>
            <li> maybe their particular product has an issue.  </li>
            <li> I did use it on high and had no issues so did not experience what some others posted.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;We bought the second one because the quality of the rest of the components as well as the construction is very good, but after the second break-down with exactly the same problem and after exactly the same time, we must conclude that this is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> This dryer gets the job done in nearly the same time as my full size dryer (+/-</li>
            <li> next time I used it, alternating between high and low heat, it seemed to be fine...</li>
            <li> Later I lived in a second, very modern house in the country&#x27;s modern capital and it wouldn&#x27;t plug into the wall at all in any part of the house!!  </li>
            <li> This little thing is powerful and can get hot!</li>
            <li> I live out of a suitcase.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> So here is the tricky part if this stuff is new for you, too...</li>
            <li> but I can live with it &amp;#34;as is&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It is very light weight and small when folded.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give it five stars is because it has a funky hot plastic smell after I use it.  </li>
            <li> Certainly strong enough to dry one&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Very compact, yet enough power to dry my hair quickly.</li>
            <li> This morning a large clump of my hair was pulled into the fan and subsequently torn out!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted, very small and very powerful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very compact and light, and I will use one at least a year before it bites the dust.</li>
            <li> The Low/Off/High switch and the voltage selector are clearly marked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, the documentation does not make it clear that you MUST switch it manually from 125 to 250 volts.  </li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> The result was voluminous, soft hair with no frizz.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wow - so lightweight.</li>
            <li> And those things can be loud too.</li>
            <li> This one isn&#x27;t so loud at 1200 watts.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because it&#x27;s so loud, I would not recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> Not to mention, it was so loud to use.  </li>
            <li> And I barely used it!!!  </li>
            <li> Very small and very light.  </li>
            <li> Love it, can&#x27;t wait to take it traveling since it&#x27;s so darn small!</li>
            <li> It is small and packs easily.</li>
            <li> Since then I&#x27;ve experimented with a few different things and what works best is to start with really wet hair - turn head upside down and dry on high using the nozzle that comes with the dryer.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect but needed a small, inexpensive dryer for travel - my regular one pretty much takes up half a suitcase</li>
            <li> Small and light weight.</li>
            <li> Only by trial and error (and the fact that it was supposed to be initially set to 125 volts), did I figure out which was which.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed to use a screwdriver to turn the switch because, unlike most devices, a coin will not fit in the slot.  </li>
            <li> I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t be powerful enough or hot enough as I have long (middle of my back)</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money and I highly discourage anyone else who might be interested in this product.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry, it is very portable and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> It has a lot of power for its size and dried my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair and it dries my hair very quickly.  </li>
            <li> This is my second one; first one lasted for several years with DAILY use.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s strong and small enough for travelling</li>
            <li> These other users apparently did not flip this switch and reported that it gets hot and noisy when they use it at 250 volts.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t blow an older circuit, but it is not so wimpy as to take forever to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for about two weeks, and it is meeting all of my expectations thus far.  </li>
            <li> Powerful enough, not too noisy, takes up little space.</li>
            <li> I anticipated a loud, high pitched scream, due to the compact size, but it operates with quiet efficiency.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never rely on this for every day or for a long trip, but since it&#x27;s so light and small, will keep it on hand for overnights.</li>
            <li> The main problem is that I have long hair and occasionally I will get the back side of the dryer too close to my hair, and hair in the fan is what will kill &#x27;em.</li>
            <li> I barely started using it back home a month</li>
            <li> Powerful and small.</li>
            <li> But I am changing my rating from 5 to 3 because the darn thing nearly gave me a heart attack the few times I accidentally put it on high while trying to turn it off.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it for foreign travel.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair dryer after looking without success for one this small in local stores.  </li>
            <li> It packs up super small, and the cord, (which probably rolls up the size of the dryer itself!)</li>
            <li> I reset it, gave it a few minutes to cool down and tried again on the low heat setting...</li>
            <li> but my hair ended up flat and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> It is light and packs down to a very small size.</li>
            <li> Once hair is damp, remove nozzle and attach a travel diffuser, then continue drying with diffuser on low until hair is dry.  </li>
            <li> , is extra long making it easier to use with limited outlet locations.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s 4-5 inches long (not counting the cord).  </li>
            <li> I have long, thick, curly hair that I always blow out straight.</li>
            <li> It really is all you could want in a travel sized hair dryer and you won&#x27;t believe how small it is, but don&#x27;t let that scare you away!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe how small and yet powerful this little thing is!  </li>
            <li> It is much smaller than all of the other travel dryers I have seen.  </li>
            <li> If you plug this dryer into 250V (European) power without manually changing the voltage selector switch to the 250V setting, the dryer will quickly fail exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> It lasted less than 2 weeks before it overheated and stopped working entirely.  </li>
            <li> Several places we were staying did not supply a hair dryer and I saw this little jewel in a travel store.  </li>
            <li> This is a problem for me, because when I style my hair with a dryer and a round brush, I have to constantly turn the dryer on and off.  </li>
            <li> The power is stronger than expected for its size, but won&#x27;t fry your hair.</li>
            <li> This is expected and is extremely</li>
            <li> When I turned it on high it was like a crazy loud rocket ship</li>
            <li> It has only 2 heat settings without a cold shot button, doesn&#x27;t work consistently every time...</li>
            <li> This is a perfect little travel dryer; too bad that the plastic of the fan rotor is such bad quality.</li>
            <li> reviewers have complained of it making a very high-pitched motor noise, getting very hot, smelling bad, and then dying.  </li>
            <li> Much smaller than anticipated - not sure what they measured for the dimensions.</li>
            <li> That is an extra problem with travel dryers since they are so small.</li>
            <li> Yes, I did use my adapter, and it&#x27;s possible it behaved this way because of the junkie old remote house with questionable wiring I was living in.</li>
            <li> It is not super powerful which is why I bought it because I have very thin hair and need a tamer blow.</li>
            <li> Well, at that time my hair was about half dried and straightened, with the other half wet and beginning to curl...</li>
            <li> When the buttons are on the front of the handle, I have to set my brush down to turn it on and off with two hands.  </li>
            <li> I thought maybe when it cooled down overnight, it would start working again.  </li>
            <li> I, myself, expect a lot less than this dryer</li>
            <li> Might be difficult to change to US current, but I will keep it for the next trip overseas.</li>
            <li> I check on Amazon and bought it for less.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this off Amazon as it was half the price of Target.  </li>
            <li> I am still highly recommending this product for travel, but taking it abroad may be questionable.  </li>
            <li> This is not true on the dryer I received.  </li>
            <li> The adapter is just the little plug part that goes into the wall</li>
            <li> Some dual voltage products have a little switch you have to bother with</li>
            <li> Although it folds for travel, the cord attachment increases its overall size, making it clumsy and hard to pack.  </li>
            <li> You can find adapters for just a few bucks.  </li>
            <li> It basically went dead.  </li>
            <li> Not fit for my traveling adventures.</li>
            <li> Wife used it a few times to see how it worked</li>
            <li> Nope, it was dead.  </li>
            <li> It took very little room to pack it and worked well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unbelievably efficient.</li>
            <li> All of the dryers I have looked at in the past have the switch(es)</li>
            <li> Purchased this small hairdryer for a trip to London, 1st use it started smoking and sparks</li>
            <li> It is quite small and compact.  </li>
            <li> When I say &amp;#34;little&amp;#34;, I mean little!  </li>
            <li> thick hair.  </li>
            <li> It is just what I wanted--a very small, lightweight hairdryer for traveling with me in a carry on bags.</li>
            <li> Startlingly small and flimsy looking, with a thin plastic grill over the fan.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer has a serious design flaw.</li>
            <li> ; (excuse the bad pun).  </li>
            <li> It is also fairly weak if you have thicker hair.</li>
            <li> OMG, I have been looking for this dryer for at least 5 years!  </li>
            <li> And that will be your fault, misuse, and not cause for a poor</li>
            <li> But when I tried to switch it to 250 volts before traveling,  I found it is poorly designed, poorly documented, and dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And when I do get a hair caught in the fan, it doesn&#x27;t rip it out of my head in a vicious way like the high wattage dryers do.</li>
            <li> Switching the badly documented, badly designed switch is really necessary to change the circuit from 125 to 250 volts and avoid dangerous overvoltage and overheating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried expensive ones.</li>
            <li> The power switch sticks, making it difficult to turn on/off.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to find a travel blow drier that is both lightweight and has an air-director nozzle.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I am quite unhappy about it.</li>
            <li> This dryer was disappointing.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s dangerous if you forget to change that switch...</li>
            <li> and the dang thing started making crazy noises</li>
            <li> Turns out this was a piece of unreliable junk and potentially dangerous unreliable junk after all...</li>
            <li> and I decided to take it apart to see if the design really is as bad as it appears.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> This is the worst hair dryer I have ever owned!!</li>
            <li> switch is horrible.  </li>
            <li> it was frightening!!!!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product. Used in Ireland with no problems. Powerful for size</li>
            <li> Wow.  This thing is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, it&#x27;s not as powerful or capable as a &amp;#34;full-sized&amp;#34; dryer.  But, what do you expect from something that literally fits in the palm of your hand?  I, myself, expect a lot less than this dryer delivers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike a lot of travel hair dryers, this one locates the fan at the back of the barrel and has some barrel length to it.  This lines the airflow up giving a useful stream of air instead of the every-which-way mess of air that most travel dryers produce.  It&#x27;s not as directional as a full-sized dryer with a longer barrel, but it&#x27;s better than most travel dryers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One reviewer reported that the controls are not labeled.  This is not true on the dryer I received.  The Low/Off/High switch and the voltage selector are clearly marked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several reviewers have complained of it making a very high-pitched motor noise, getting very hot, smelling bad, and then dying.  The unit is shipped set for 125V (USA) power.  While it is true that many modern electronic devices have &amp;#34;auto-ranging&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;universal&amp;#34; AC inputs and work properly on any line voltage anywhere, this little hairdryer isn&#x27;t one of them.  If you plug this dryer into 250V (European) power without manually changing the voltage selector switch to the 250V setting, the dryer will quickly fail exactly as described.  And that will be your fault, misuse, and not cause for a poor review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine has worked fine.  It drys my hair almost as fast as my &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; dryer at home.  Its size, weight, and performance make this an easy choice for travel.</li>
            <li> I received the hair dryer quickly. It dries my hair quicker than my last hair dryer and it is neat and compact. I can&#x27;t wait to use it when I&#x27;m overseas and can use it&#x27;s setting for their electrical currents.</li>
            <li> Great little hair dryer!  When I say &amp;#34;little&amp;#34;, I mean little!  Wonderful to slip in your suitcase or overnight bag.  It is light, but powerful too.  I have only used it for a couple of weeks - every day - and although I have short hair, it drys my hair in a very short time.  If you are traveling and thinking about getting a traveling hair dryer - this is the dryer to buy!</li>
            <li> Much smaller than anticipated - not sure what they measured for the dimensions. It is also fairly weak if you have thicker hair.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer very compact and perfect for traveling.  It would be perfect for a carry-on.  I used it for a trip abroad when I didn&#x27;t have much space and wanted to limit the weight of my suitcase.  It is much smaller than all of the other travel dryers I have seen.  It has a lot of power for its size and dried my hair quickly.  The only reason I did not give it five stars is because it has a funky hot plastic smell after I use it.  My husband checked it out and said everything was working fine and it isn&#x27;t&#x27; a safety concern.  The smell goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife and and she recently took it on a trip and loved it. Powerful enough, not too noisy, takes up little space. It does exactly what you want from a travel dryer.</li>
            <li> I like how small it is and has good power makes it easy to travel with doesn&#x27;t take up much room</li>
            <li> Ouch! My medium-length hair got caught in the engine.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect but needed a small, inexpensive dryer for travel - my regular one pretty much takes up half a suitcase and that&#x27;s not something I can deal with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that the weight of this dryer is almost nothing - it&#x27;s super light, and takes up next to no space, especially when folded.  It can easily go in your carry-on if you prefer not to check luggage.  This was encouraging so next I had to figure out if it works for my rather challenging (very curly, very thin/fine, frizzy) hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My initial impression wasn&#x27;t great - the &#x27;high&#x27; mode is really, really strong and &#x27;low&#x27; is way too weak.  So I used it on high - the job was done quickly but my hair ended up flat and frizzy.  Since then I&#x27;ve experimented with a few different things and what works best is to start with really wet hair - turn head upside down and dry on high using the nozzle that comes with the dryer.  Once hair is damp, remove nozzle and attach a travel diffuser, then continue drying with diffuser on low until hair is dry.  The result was voluminous, soft hair with no frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t traveled with it overseas yet so I don&#x27;t yet know how the voltage change part works but will update once I find out.</li>
            <li> Wow - so lightweight. It&#x27;s unbelievably efficient. If it only had a cool setting it would be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Still - it comes close. Great price.</li>
            <li> I live out of a suitcase. I&#x27;ve tried cheap travel hair dryers. I&#x27;ve tried expensive ones. This is hands down the best one I&#x27;ve ever used. The price is right. It&#x27;s very compact and light, and I will use one at least a year before it bites the dust. The main problem is that I have long hair and occasionally I will get the back side of the dryer too close to my hair, and hair in the fan is what will kill &#x27;em. That is an extra problem with travel dryers since they are so small. This one has just the right amount of wattage. It won&#x27;t blow an older circuit, but it is not so wimpy as to take forever to dry my hair. And when I do get a hair caught in the fan, it doesn&#x27;t rip it out of my head in a vicious way like the high wattage dryers do. And those things can be loud too. This one isn&#x27;t so loud at 1200 watts.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done.  My hair is dry, it is very portable and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> This little thing is powerful and can get hot! Hotter than my full size blow dryer actually. So portable &amp; small, perfect for travel or keeping at your partner&#x27;s house on overnights. Love it, can&#x27;t wait to take it traveling since it&#x27;s so darn small!</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift for my wife, she loves it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how POWERFUL this hair drier is for its size! It packs up super small, and the cord, (which probably rolls up the size of the dryer itself!), is extra long making it easier to use with limited outlet locations. The dual voltage will come in handy for any trip abroad. I&#x27;m pretty happy with it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for a European trip. When I used it in the States it was fine. When we arrived in Europe, and switched the voltage to 220, it burned out immediately.  Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> This dryer was disappointing. Although it folds for travel, the cord attachment increases its overall size, making it clumsy and hard to pack.  The power switch sticks, making it difficult to turn on/off.</li>
            <li> great dryer (enough power) that i use not just for travel.  only problem is the cord is very short so you have to be fairly close to the outlet when you use it.  if they would make the cord longer, it would be perfect.  i also used it when i was in italy with no problems (although you do need an adapter but the converter is built in).</li>
            <li> Much smaller than it looks in the photo, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Very light weight and worked fine for my hair which is mid length.  Easy to switch voltage which I did before going to Italy. I did use it on high and had no issues so did not experience what some others posted.  You will need just an adapter.</li>
            <li> Great lightweight hair dryer with 2 speeds, worked well in Italy.  Might be difficult to change to US current, but I will keep it for the next trip overseas.</li>
            <li> Very compact, yet enough power to dry my hair quickly.</li>
            <li> OMG, I have been looking for this dryer for at least 5 years!  After my favorite dryer broke, I looked for one like it that is lightweight, has power but not too much power, and most importantly, has the high/low/off switch on the BACK of the dryer handle, not in the front.  All of the dryers I have looked at in the past have the switch(es) on the front of the handle.  This is a problem for me, because when I style my hair with a dryer and a round brush, I have to constantly turn the dryer on and off.  With the buttons on the back of the handle like this one, I can turn it on and off with one hand.  When the buttons are on the front of the handle, I have to set my brush down to turn it on and off with two hands.  What a hassle!  This lightweight dryer with the on/off switch on the back of the handle fits the bill perfectly.  I will probably buy another one as a back-up for when this one wears out.  I highly recommend this dryer, and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Purchased this small hairdryer for a trip to London, 1st use it started smoking and sparks flew - died immediately. Lukily it wasn&#x27;t a lot of money.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer two years ago, and it worked great for its tiny size. However, after flipping the voltage switch to 220 for trips abroad and then back to 120 for domestic trips several times, the switch got misaligned and it was stuck on 220. I figured I&#x27;d just have to keep it at that setting, as it still worked okay. But a week later the entire handle fell apart in my hand.</li>
            <li> I bought this for travelling (and don&#x27;t use it at home) and I love it.  It is very light weight and small when folded.  This is important to me as I have started travelling using only a 21\\&quot; rolling bag for shorter trips and the 21\\&quot; bag plus a carry-on for trips longer than a week.  When trying to save space and weight, every bit helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for several trips and absolutely love it.  I use it on the low setting plus add a diffuser and it dries my hair as well as the large one I use when at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This product was the perfect size for me to take on my vacation abroad.  It took very little room to pack it and worked well.</li>
            <li> Powerful yet compact hair dryer. Works really well!</li>
            <li> This is the worst hair dryer I have ever owned!! I ordered it shortly before taking a trip to Europe, trusting that it would work, happy about the fact that it was small and compact. I wasn&#x27;t able to use it at all because it was so HOT I couldn&#x27;t use it; and secondly it was burning my hair!! It was a waste of money and I highly discourage anyone else who might be interested in this product.</li>
            <li> PACKS ENOUGH POWER NICE &amp; COMPACT. I WOULD RECOMEND THIS HAIR DRYER TO ANY ONE ESPECIALLLY IF THEY TRAVEL !!</li>
            <li> Purchased this for a trip to Italy where suitcase space was such a premium.  It performed just like a full size model and I absolutely LOVE it!</li>
            <li> My wife picked this out. After many years use with a larger hair dryer it finally died. My wife picked this out of the products listed, bought it and she loves it. It&#x27;s more compact than the travel one she uses when traveling and is a lot faster. Thinking about buying a second one for the travel bag. Has more BTU&#x27;s than any other she&#x27;s ever used.</li>
            <li> Perfect foldable size!</li>
            <li> I love the travel smart conair 1200 watt for traveling. It is small and packs easily. The wattage is easily changed for travel abroad. It actually had two speeds when I used it in Europe. Often hair dryers have two speeds in the states but when traveling abroad with the change in voltage they do not. I was very happy with the travel smart dryer and will use it each year when we travel abroad. I would highly recommend it for foreign travel.</li>
            <li> Powerful and small. Like the compact convenience of it and am happy this dryer doesn&#x27;t take over my drawer space.</li>
            <li> This is the best of hair dryer. Light weight, efficient, dual voltage and work fine</li>
            <li> Great product.  Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Tiny and light, just right for carryon air travel. This is my second one; first one lasted for several years with DAILY use. Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, curly hair that I always blow out straight. This dryer gets the job done in nearly the same time as my full size dryer (+/- 10 min)  and meets my picky standards for a smooth, shiny blowout. The power is stronger than expected for its size, but won&#x27;t fry your hair. I&#x27;ve also used it in Europe several times (UK, France and Germany) with the same performance and results--no voltage or overheating issues whatsoever. For international use, you only need a plug adaptor, no converter (there&#x27;s a dial on the handle). I&#x27;ve had it for 2 years and highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Very small and very light.  Perfect for travel and my silicon diffuser fits right over the nozzles.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer before a trip to India. I used it for a couple of weeks in the US at the 120 V setting and then for about 4 weeks in India at the 230 V setting. It seemed to be working fine and I was happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However when I came back to US and reset the voltage to 120V, that&#x27;s when the thing started acting up. It was way too noisy, overheated so much that it stopped working all together!! Well, at that time my hair was about half dried and straightened, with the other half wet and beginning to curl... So I had no option but to somehow get this thing working again! I reset it, gave it a few minutes to cool down and tried again on the low heat setting... It was ok and I completed drying my hair..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next time I used it, alternating between high and low heat, it seemed to be fine... The time after that, it overheated again and I finally gave up on it... Its no use investing even $20 in this piece... It has only 2 heat settings without a cold shot button, doesn&#x27;t work consistently every time... And if you change the voltage settings, it doesn&#x27;t work properly! Cheap piece, do not invest any time and money in this!!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t put it to the test while traveling but at home it works just fine. It is just what I wanted--a very small, lightweight hairdryer for traveling with me in a carry on bags. It&#x27;s the smallest one I could find, and in fact I returned one from Brookstone as it was much larger.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted, very small and very powerful. Perfect for travel. Amazon should make it easier to go back in and order another, no option for that on your confirmation site after you get the product.</li>
            <li> Works well enough......can&#x27;t expect too much from a dryer this little......might take me five more minutes to dry my hair but.......so what!.......this is perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> I was initially pleased with this compact, inexpensive dryer.  But when I tried to switch it to 250 volts before traveling,  I found it is poorly designed, poorly documented, and dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the documentation does not make it clear that you MUST switch it manually from 125 to 250 volts.  From the other reviews I can see that many people will assume it will switch automatically (like most laptops and cell phone chargers).  It will not.  These other users apparently did not flip this switch and reported that it gets hot and noisy when they use it at 250 volts. This is expected and is extremely dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The switch is horrible.  It has no markings to point to the 125 or 250 volt setting, so I had to guess.  Only by trial and error (and the fact that it was supposed to be initially set to 125 volts), did I figure out which was which.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed to use a screwdriver to turn the switch because, unlike most devices, a coin will not fit in the slot.  So unless I would have brought my toolbox with me on my trip, I could not switch it (even if I was aware that you need to do so).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After turning the switch back and forth a couple of times it broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a mechanical engineer and I decided to take it apart to see if the design really is as bad as it appears.  It is.  Switching the badly documented, badly designed switch is really necessary to change the circuit from 125 to 250 volts and avoid dangerous overvoltage and overheating.</li>
            <li> I spotted this in the Target luggage section for about the same price and loved it at first sight and had to have it!!!!  It&#x27;s the tiniest dryer I&#x27;ve ever seen!!!  It almost fits in the palm of my hand.  Folded, it&#x27;s 4-5 inches long (not counting the cord).  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now just to test it out before my trip abroad and it&#x27;s surprisingly very strong.  No weird smells as someone else mentioned- maybe their particular product has an issue.  So far mine is working great.  My hair is shorter so I&#x27;m not worried about how long it will take, but this thing is pretty strong.  I&#x27;m done in minutes.  The other great thing is that it has &amp;#34;dual voltage.&amp;#34;  I had to read up on this because I haven&#x27;t traveled in a while and I guess a whole lot of electronics and stuff like this is made dual voltage today- so check your product and educate yourself.  Just look at this hair dryer, for example, and it will say 125V / 250V on the handle.  This means it will work anywhere where the voltage falls in that range... most if not all of the world. BUT YOU WILL NEED AN ADAPTER when going abroad with this.  So here is the tricky part if this stuff is new for you, too... you DON&#x27;T need a converter (more expensive) for anything that&#x27;s dual voltage,  just an adapter.  The adapter is just the little plug part that goes into the wall so you can plug it in.  The converter is usually bigger and box-like and more expensive.  It converts the voltage. You can find adapters for just a few bucks.  Some dual voltage products have a little switch you have to bother with and it&#x27;s dangerous if you forget to change that switch... no switch and no worries with this hair dryer!!  Just Google dual voltage and you can read up on it, and the difference between converter and adapter.  All these things are helpful to know when traveling abroad.  I love this thing... best thing I bought for travel recently since finding a hand-held luggage scale!  I originally jumped the gun and gave this5 stars.  Read my updates below.  12/20/12 Update:  This survived a trip to rural abroad and worked great, so long as I used it on low.  When I turned it on high it was like a crazy loud rocket ship and I thought it would take off or start fire- it was frightening!!!!  Yes, I did use my adapter, and it&#x27;s possible it behaved this way because of the junkie old remote house with questionable wiring I was living in. Later I lived in a second, very modern house in the country&#x27;s modern capital and it wouldn&#x27;t plug into the wall at all in any part of the house!!  Yes, it was the right plug shape and I have no idea what that was about, again, the randomness is possibly the result of the house and the country I was in.  Who knows.  But I couldn&#x27;t use it at all the last couple of months of my travels and that wasn&#x27;t good.  I will continue to use it here at home in the USA where it works perfect.  Maybe better for local travel and still a great size if you have limited luggage space.  But I am changing my rating from 5 to 3 because the darn thing nearly gave me a heart attack the few times I accidentally put it on high while trying to turn it off.  I am still highly recommending this product for travel, but taking it abroad may be questionable.  1/15/13 UPDATE:  I barely started using it back home a month and the dang thing started making crazy noises and I thought it would explode or catch fire.  It basically went dead.  I tossed it in the garbage.  I am now changing my 3 star rating to 1 star.  I was wrong.  Turns out this was a piece of unreliable junk and potentially dangerous unreliable junk after all... didn&#x27;t even last me a year.  And I barely used it!!!  Not fit for my traveling adventures.</li>
            <li> Great product, perfect for my travels all over Europe.</li>
            <li> I love this small and easy to carry hair dryer, ideal for traveling. I will use Amazon for all my shopping in the future because they provide excellent service.</li>
            <li> Smell burning from the dryer</li>
            <li> Dryer is light and foldable. Easy for travel use. Certainly strong enough to dry one&#x27;s hair. One of the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect travel hair dryer--lightweight, good drying power and very durable.  I&#x27;ve taken it on several trips and each time I think &amp;#34;what a great purchase this was&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> awesome good size and is power ful</li>
            <li> Small and light weight. Easy to travel with. Good dryer for the price.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer is the loudest one I have ever owned!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m actually thinking of buying another and using this only&lt;br /&gt;for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it&#x27;s very lightweight, compact and dries&lt;br /&gt;well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it&#x27;s so loud, I would not recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> Startlingly small and flimsy looking, with a thin plastic grill over the fan. But does a decent job, with good air on the high setting. I&#x27;d never rely on this for every day or for a long trip, but since it&#x27;s so light and small, will keep it on hand for overnights.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for traveling abroad and the price was right! I wish it was a tad more powerful but I can live with it &amp;#34;as is&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect size for traveling! It is not super powerful which is why I bought it because I have very thin hair and need a tamer blow. It fits into a small space and is ideal for packing. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair dryer after looking without success for one this small in local stores.  I have only been using it for about two weeks, and it is meeting all of my expectations thus far.  The size and weight are perfect for carrying in my swim bag, taking up much less room that my defunct dryer.  A bonus for me was the low noise level of this appliance.  I anticipated a loud, high pitched scream, due to the compact size, but it operates with quiet efficiency.  I have short hair, and this dryer delivers quick drying at a comfortable sound level with no hassle with easy packability.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe how small and yet powerful this little thing is!  Best travel hairdryer ever thanks to the ultra compact size and low wattage.  Will be perfect for our trip to Europe.  Wife used it a few times to see how it worked and she is &amp;#34;blown away&amp;#34; (excuse the bad pun).  It really is all you could want in a travel sized hair dryer and you won&#x27;t believe how small it is, but don&#x27;t let that scare you away!</li>
            <li> This hairdryer has a serious design flaw. There is no &amp;#34;guard&amp;#34; preventing hair from being pulled into the fan and ripped from the scalp. It is especially hazardous to those who have fine hair that tends to have flyaways. I should have returned it immediately but I decided to continue using it with caution. Mistake! This morning a large clump of my hair was pulled into the fan and subsequently torn out! Needless to say, I am quite unhappy about it. I will be contacting the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for a trip to India.  I had it set on the lower voltage setting and used it with a travel adapter.  It lasted less than 2 weeks before it overheated and stopped working entirely.  I thought maybe when it cooled down overnight, it would start working again.  Nope, it was dead.  I ended up throwing the thing out.  Not to mention, it was so loud to use.  Do not buy!</li>
            <li> Nice small package hairdryer.  Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Works great ! it&#x27;s strong and small enough for travelling</li>
            <li> This is a perfect little travel dryer; too bad that the plastic of the fan rotor is such bad quality. We have had 2 of these break after exactly 13 months of use (so just outside the warranty; on top of that the cost of mailing ect. inside the warranty period is prohibitive for actually using the warranty)&lt;br /&gt;We bought the second one because the quality of the rest of the components as well as the construction is very good, but after the second break-down with exactly the same problem and after exactly the same time, we must conclude that this is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to take to Spain in September.  Several places we were staying did not supply a hair dryer and I saw this little jewel in a travel store.  I check on Amazon and bought it for less.  It is quite small and compact.  The dual voltage worked great with an adapter.  No problems and it has plenty of power.  I recommend this.  Buy it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this off Amazon as it was half the price of Target.  I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t be powerful enough or hot enough as I have long (middle of my back) thick hair.  It works just like a bigger dryer and is the size of my hand.  I travel all summer and never take a blow dryer with me because they take up too much room.  Got this dryer and Remington Travel curlers...its all good.  Both are great for traveling and work better than I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to find a travel blow drier that is both lightweight and has an air-director nozzle. This is the best one I&#x27;ve found. It is light and packs down to a very small size.</li>
            <li> I got this for my hubby when we trabel he is what we call a metro guy and he is more than happy I left this on my Moms house last trip there and he still tells me how he like that one better than the one we have a home,</li>
            <li> Works perfectly with an adaptor plug in Europe.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my trips and it is absolutely convenient and compact!&lt;br /&gt;The air is quite strong for it&#x27;s size which I did not expect which is a huge plus.&lt;br /&gt;As I was the type of person who insisted carrying my full sized, non-folding hair dryer under all circumstance during trips, this product has become vital for me :)&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
            <li> This dryer is easy to hold and has alot of power and force.  I have thick hair and it dries my hair very quickly.  A great buy!</li>
