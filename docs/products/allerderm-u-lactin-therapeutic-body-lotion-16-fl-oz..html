            <li>I ordered this to deal with maddening itch caused by renal disease, having read somewhere that ueea-containing creams are the most efficient to cope.</li>
            <li>The bottle size is squatter than most lotion bottles which I like.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to use it all over.</li>
            <li>It two weeks to kick in with some added exfoliation but now my legs have improved tremendously, feel smooth like a baby&#x27;s butt and are getting better every day.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S GOOD FOR THE REGULAR SKIN BUT NOT FOR EXEMA SKIN PROBLEMS</li>
            <li>My skin looks more even and my arms are much smoother.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is perfect for dry, itchy, super sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The lotion seems &amp;#34;thinner&amp;#34; and does not absorb quickly.  </li>

            <li>and this is the first time I am unsatisfied.  </li>
            <li>great product especially for dry, cracked heels.</li>
            <li>It smoothes out the skin on one&#x27;s elbows and feet and is more effective than average for conditions such as Keritosis Pilaris (aka \\&quot;goose flesh\\&quot;).</li>
            <li>I have been using this for two years or more..very good to use on extra dry skin.!  </li>

            <li>My face and eyes are very sensitive and sometimes it burns my cheeks.</li>
            <li>My wife has also now been using it pretty regularly.  </li>
            <li>have tried 10% urea lotions in the past combined with lactic acid lotions and this works amazing, especially if you have issues with ingrown hairs and exfoliation.</li>
            <li>Both my 9 year old daughter &amp; husband have keratosis pilaris a/k/a &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34;.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My son has very dry skin. He is sick ихтиозом. After the skin becomes softer and looks much better. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had alligator skin forever. A friend who also has dry skin recommended this to me as the only thing that has ever worked for her. Since nothing&#x27;s ever worked for me either, I decided to give it a try. I&#x27;ve been using it now for about 2 weeks now and am already beginning to see a difference. YAY!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended that I use it on my face after I had an allergic reaction to some eye makeup. My face and eyes are very sensitive and sometimes it burns my cheeks. It is great on the body.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for two years or more..very good to use on extra dry skin.!  Even my face!</li>
            <li> This lotion is perfect for dry, itchy, super sensitive skin.  The best lotion I have found for my problem skin.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S GOOD FOR THE REGULAR SKIN BUT NOT FOR EXEMA SKIN PROBLEMS</li>
            <li> Have not had very long so hard to tell if I will purchase again. Does not have any odor. Like that.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products to improve the KP on the back of my arms.  Within a week of using U-Lactin, I have seen a drastic improvement.  I apply every morning after I shower (one squirt is enough for both arms).  It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t have any odor once it is dry.  There is a slight tack to the skin but not unpleasant.  My skin looks more even and my arms are much smoother.  I also use dry brushing everyday before showering and exfoliators (Derma Dr scrub) in the shower every few days.  This lotion has given me the best results so far for my KP!</li>
            <li> This lotion is incredible!  My dermatologist recommended this and I can&#x27;t do without it! My Grandson uses it too and has great results.</li>
            <li> Both my 9 year old daughter &amp; husband have keratosis pilaris a/k/a &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34;. U-Lactin helps with the dryness and bumps. For winter dryness in general, this is a great lotion! It soaks in nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling tacky or greasy.</li>
            <li> This stuff is hard to find offline, but if you can get it here or from a local pharmacy, you won&#x27;t regret it. Best stuff ever. No added fragrance. No lanolin or silicone (unusual for a skin lotion). The lactic acid and urea do what other lotions can&#x27;t, which is to deeply condition the skin so that it remains softer even if you don&#x27;t use it daily.

            <li> It is the best skin lotion I have ever used - was recommended by my doctor. The price is right.</li>
            <li> I have been using U-Lactin Body Lotion for over twenty-five years and this is the first time I am unsatisfied.  The lotion seems &amp;#34;thinner&amp;#34; and does not absorb quickly.  My skin feels &amp;#34;slightly slimy&amp;#34; for several minutes atyer applying&#x27;  Thank you for asking.</li>
            <li> Cheapest I found. Dermstore seller packaged well and included free French lotion samples :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried 10% urea lotions in the past combined with lactic acid lotions and this works amazing, especially if you have issues with ingrown hairs and exfoliation.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff for my dry skin and it&#x27;s easy to use it all over. Seems to stop my itching caused by the dryness.</li>
            <li> I have diabetic legs that were dry, scaly and this lotion is wonderful.</li>
            <li> great product especially for dry, cracked heels.</li>
            <li> Having a skin sensitivity to Glycerin based moisturizing products (Gold Bond, Vaseline Intensive Care, etc.), my Dermo Doc provided me with a sample of U-Lactin about 6+ years ago.  It works GREAT for me, with my general dry skin issues during the winter, and I have been using this ever since.  My wife has also now been using it pretty regularly.  She has no sensitivity like I do but she really likes it (light smelling) and works very well for her also.</li>
            <li> Excellent price and delivery.  Works much better than other lotions I have tried.  The bottle size is squatter than most lotion bottles which I like.</li>
            <li> It two weeks to kick in with some added exfoliation but now my legs have improved tremendously, feel smooth like a baby&#x27;s butt and are getting better every day. I have KP.</li>
