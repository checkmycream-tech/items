            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>These products when used together are amazing for my skin.</li>
            <li>I am really loving this product.  </li>
            <li>Either way, I feel good about doing and using something more than the popular drug store products.</li>
            <li>The spots seem to be fading nicely with this serum.</li>
            <li>, you&#x27;ll love these products even more!</li>
            <li>Fine lines, pores, even milia that wouldn&#x27;t go away for months - all diminishing before my eyes!</li>
            <li>I had been very pleased with the Vit C serum, but when I added this serum, the improvement was significant.  </li>
            <li>I love the texture of this</li>
            <li>I really do love this product, hope it never stops being made.  </li>
            <li>The eye serum is also fantastic!</li>
            <li>It is definitely a Top product in my book.</li>
            <li>This product makes my skin look as smooth as it feels!  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>My skin looks healthy and even tone.</li>
            <li>I love them.  </li>
            <li>and I am really pleased.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for 5 months and my skin continues to look better and better.</li>
            <li>, I just ordered 2 more bottles (just never know when a company might discontinue a product!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: The Resurfacing Serum is my \\&quot;must-have,\\</li>
            <li>It felt like I had a sticky residue sitting on top of my skin after I applied the product.</li>
            <li>I love the Vitamin C serum</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m going to give to my mother to see if she has better luck.</li>
            <li>Yesterday, he informed me that I needed to order more.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, I also use Hydra B5 Gel and Vitamin C + E Serum, Firming Eye Gel, I love them all...</li>
            <li>I also find that I enjoy serums much more than creams for my skin type as my skin tends to be a bit oilier and these products seem to take much better than thicker creams.  </li>
            <li>and I am happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li>The antioxidant 20 serum made by this company is superior to the competition&#x27;s and comparatively, very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>and it goes on easily</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend Cosmetic Solutions products.</li>
            <li>My skin has never looked better and I&#x27;m not overpaying for high quality, effective skin care.</li>
            <li>The fine lines under my eyes have diminished and my skin tone is smooth and even.</li>
            <li>and my pores looked huge  when I wasn&#x27;t using it.</li>
            <li>This is especially true if you are over 55 years old.  </li>
            <li>So far so good hope it produces radiant.</li>
            <li>well worth the price!  </li>
            <li>Resurfacing Serum comes immediately after cleansing, and wow, I can sure feel the difference!  </li>
            <li>and I really notice that my skin is appearing much better as a result.  </li>
            <li>and I make sure to really rub it in.</li>
            <li>This is seriously one of the BEST serums I have ever used!</li>
            <li>CSS&#x27;s company treats its customers to superior products at reasonable prices backed by truly professional customer service.  </li>
            <li>Orders are processed quickly, packaged well and with care, and delivered on time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>consider myself a loyal customer now.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using several different combinations of Cosmetic&#x27;s products for almost two years and have found the Hydra B5 Gel and Vitamin C 20% is giving me excellent results.</li>
            <li>This does have some mild sensations but my skin can handle it</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t exfoliate at all even though it has some really good ingredients, just the re surfacing aspect of this product kind of sucks.</li>
            <li>have fair, sensitive skin while his is more olive and not sensitive.</li>
            <li>My skin is clearer, brighter and fresh looking.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my eary 60&#x27;s so with more mature skin</li>
            <li>I bought this with the Vit C serum and the combination has really helped clean up my skin from a disaster acne breakout while on vacation wearing lots of sunscreen.</li>
            <li>that makes me think that this &amp;#34;is it&amp;#34;, love the bottle, love the feel, and slight exfoliation, still looking for the miracle product....</li>
            <li>I find they are a great value (as compared to other competing lines) and they address a wide range of issues for many skin issues (aging, exfoliation, acne, etc.).  </li>
            <li>Great affordable serum comparable to much more expensive brand.</li>
            <li>I dont have overly sensitive skin, but more &amp;#34;resurface&amp;#34; type serums burn and tingle too much for me.</li>
            <li>After the first 3-5 days I could tell a noticeable difference in the texture and brightness of my skin.</li>
            <li>And that will be difficult. :D</li>
            <li>I first tried the sample pack, that help to figure out my correct combination.</li>
            <li>So luxurious to apply and does exactly what it should.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m two thirds through the first bottle and already ordering another for fear I might run out.</li>
            <li>If my husband was in the bathroom with me, I would use it on him as well (at first, against his will).</li>
            <li>Just be sure to use a very small amount because it is potent.</li>
            <li>I finally found a good system for me, a little go&#x27;s a long ways with this stuff, If you have any questions its nice to call and get a person...that means a lot to me...</li>
            <li>Smooth, soft and all done without the harsh exfoliates many people use.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>then the B work really well for me, then at night the resurfacing, and of course the eye.</li>
            <li>I use a wide range of the Cosmetic Skin Solution&#x27;s line of product, but this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>They are gentle on my skin and do not leave any residue.  </li>
            <li>well, for what this cost, i really did expect more than what i got.......not the ammount, but the results.&lt;br /&gt;i have used nearly the entire bottle, and really truly cannot see any difference in the texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li>(gotta get that face exfoliated and ready to absorb</li>
            <li>I like it so much</li>
            <li>I figured out I was using way to much for my face.</li>
            <li>I can really see results.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t see much of a difference form this product.</li>
            <li>(Using it every day is too much for me.  </li>
            <li>not only is the price affordable, but the products are effective, make my skin glow and seems to make me look younger.</li>
            <li>As I have aged my skin began to look as if it had a rough texture and my pores were more noticable even though my skin felt extremely smooth to the touch.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Cosmetic Skin Solutions makes the most effective, budget-friendly skin care products, and if you care about having no sulfates, phthalates, petroleum, parabens, artificial colors or fragrance</li>
            <li>I am sure there is a difference in less than a month with wrinkles</li>
            <li>Highly recommend them.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and this seller.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes with this produc.t.</li>
            <li>When I first started using it, I went through a little rough patch where my skin actually looked a bit worse, but then it started clearing up more and more, and now its completely clear and bright.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product as I getting back into my consistent routine of facials, and was looking for a serum to help maintain that.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say stick with it even if your skin seems to get worse at first, because once you go through that stage, you&#x27;ll love the results.  </li>
            <li>The Cosmetic Solutions product is a good product that may not have the exact ph as the expensive brand, however it is close enough that you will see a difference in your skin.  </li>
            <li>good ,there is a little pain of skin in few seconds after using .</li>
            <li>It was great, but way too expensive to incorporate into my daily routine for life.  </li>
            <li>Combining all the Vitamin C products together have really made a different in my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>I have mature skin.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s still early</li>
            <li>After only a few uses at night, I feel my skin looks more youthful and alive in the AM.  </li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>and I would recommend to those with sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Not harsh.</li>
            <li>serum is silky soft going on and has no detectable odor.</li>
            <li>Applying it sparingly and really rubbing it in has done wonders for my overall skin texture.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and I have no problems with either product.</li>
            <li>But will definitely order these products again and use them for a few more months.</li>
            <li>I can definitely tell a difference if I use it consistently - in fact, because my husband uses it religiously</li>
            <li>I always get compliments on my skin and youthful appearance; not really sure if it&#x27;s due to this product or overall good skin care results.</li>
            <li>I use it  every other day, that is just right for my skin.  </li>
            <li>used to subscribe to this line&#x27;s more expensive predecessor by a different manufacturer, but find all formulas and products by CSS&#x27;s to be entirely just as effective as their more expensive &amp;#34;older second</li>
            <li>I find the smell nauseating, but may just deal with it since the competition&#x27;s product is 3x as expensive and this product is just as effective.</li>
            <li>highly recommend the entire dry, mature skin product line.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use much less than the recommended 5 drops, the consistency is similar to silky water, it spreads very easily and a little goes a long way.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I can really see results.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t see much of a difference form this product.</li>
            <li> (Using it every day is too much for me.  </li>
            <li> not only is the price affordable, but the products are effective, make my skin glow and seems to make me look younger.</li>
            <li> As I have aged my skin began to look as if it had a rough texture and my pores were more noticable even though my skin felt extremely smooth to the touch.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Cosmetic Skin Solutions makes the most effective, budget-friendly skin care products, and if you care about having no sulfates, phthalates, petroleum, parabens, artificial colors or fragrance</li>
            <li> I am sure there is a difference in less than a month with wrinkles</li>
            <li> Highly recommend them.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and this seller.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes with this produc.t.</li>
            <li> When I first started using it, I went through a little rough patch where my skin actually looked a bit worse, but then it started clearing up more and more, and now its completely clear and bright.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product as I getting back into my consistent routine of facials, and was looking for a serum to help maintain that.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say stick with it even if your skin seems to get worse at first, because once you go through that stage, you&#x27;ll love the results.  </li>
            <li> The Cosmetic Solutions product is a good product that may not have the exact ph as the expensive brand, however it is close enough that you will see a difference in your skin.  </li>
            <li> good ,there is a little pain of skin in few seconds after using .</li>
            <li> It was great, but way too expensive to incorporate into my daily routine for life.  </li>
            <li> Combining all the Vitamin C products together have really made a different in my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> I have mature skin.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s still early</li>
            <li> After only a few uses at night, I feel my skin looks more youthful and alive in the AM.  </li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> and I would recommend to those with sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Not harsh.</li>
            <li> serum is silky soft going on and has no detectable odor.</li>
            <li> Applying it sparingly and really rubbing it in has done wonders for my overall skin texture.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and I have no problems with either product.</li>
            <li> But will definitely order these products again and use them for a few more months.</li>
            <li> I can definitely tell a difference if I use it consistently - in fact, because my husband uses it religiously</li>
            <li> I always get compliments on my skin and youthful appearance; not really sure if it&#x27;s due to this product or overall good skin care results.</li>
            <li> I use it  every other day, that is just right for my skin.  </li>
            <li> used to subscribe to this line&#x27;s more expensive predecessor by a different manufacturer, but find all formulas and products by CSS&#x27;s to be entirely just as effective as their more expensive &amp;#34;older second</li>
            <li> I find the smell nauseating, but may just deal with it since the competition&#x27;s product is 3x as expensive and this product is just as effective.</li>
            <li> highly recommend the entire dry, mature skin product line.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use much less than the recommended 5 drops, the consistency is similar to silky water, it spreads very easily and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My skin feels more pliable, smoother, refreshed and all of it with absolutely no redness or silly break</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know what it&#x27;s doing, I can&#x27;t tell that my skin is any different, but I have not noticed any negative effects, so I&#x27;ll continue using it and hope it has the benefits it says is does!</li>
            <li> Pores are getting smaller and the scar are lighter, maybe I have incorporated this to other of its product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only use it every other night with B5 and Day Gel Moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> If your schedule allows, try Cosmetic Skin Solutions Hydra B5 Gel, lastly, to lock all the other goodies in to your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have half a bottle left</li>
            <li> I am not much of a writer</li>
            <li> After a few days, he was using it religiously (2x per day), and I used it sporadically, (maybe 4-5x per week).</li>
            <li> Tried other brands..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing other reviewers use scented products in their homes and have a compromised sense of smell and taste.</li>
            <li> I discovered a few rough patches after a week.</li>
            <li> If I had to whittle down to one product, however, it would be the resurfacing serum.  </li>
            <li> His forehead is smoother and wrinkles are less pronounced.</li>
            <li> It takes a while (I&#x27;d say about a week and a half) to start seeing results, but you will see them,  </li>
            <li> A little goes along way with this product.</li>
            <li> , you can use it a few times a week.</li>
            <li> Recommend especially to those who experience dry skin during cold weather.</li>
            <li> but since I see my face everyday, I am not sure.  </li>
            <li> After a few uses, I noticed my skin produced mini bumps and my skin looked very uneven.  </li>
            <li> I use a very small amount</li>
            <li> O my poor face.  </li>
            <li> sorry that is all for now</li>
            <li> Plus, compared to the price of Skinceuticals you can&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li> Awful!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love the texture of this and it dries well, not leaving my face sticky or oily.  Combining all the Vitamin C products together have really made a different in my skin tone.  I am sure there is a difference in less than a month with wrinkles but since I see my face everyday, I am not sure.  But will definitely order these products again and use them for a few more months.</li>
            <li> I really do love this product, hope it never stops being made.  It feels great on my skin and I use it day and night.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as I getting back into my consistent routine of facials, and was looking for a serum to help maintain that.  I purchased this product after reading the reviews and decided to buy.  After a few uses, I noticed my skin produced mini bumps and my skin looked very uneven.  So, instead of throwing the item away, I now use this serum on my feet.  It helps to restore my entire feet, especially the heel and doesnt cause any adverse effects on my feet.</li>
            <li> I have mature skin.  I take care of my skin and always wear sun production.  This product, Resurfacing Serum, has upped the the appearance of my skin. Smooth, soft and all done without the harsh exfoliates many people use.  This is especially true if you are over 55 years old.  Give this product a couple of months and you&#x27;ll be very pleased.</li>
            <li> I have been using a range of products from the Cosmetic Skin Solutions line for several years now.  I find they are a great value (as compared to other competing lines) and they address a wide range of issues for many skin issues (aging, exfoliation, acne, etc.).  I also find that I enjoy serums much more than creams for my skin type as my skin tends to be a bit oilier and these products seem to take much better than thicker creams.  If I had to whittle down to one product, however, it would be the resurfacing serum.  I use it morning and night and it goes on easily and I really notice that my skin is appearing much better as a result.  I put on after glycolic toner in the evenings and before my moisturizer in the morning.  It&#x27;s an excellent product and well worth the price!  The eye serum is also fantastic!</li>
            <li> This is seriously one of the BEST serums I have ever used! It is definitely a Top product in my book. After the first 3-5 days I could tell a noticeable difference in the texture and brightness of my skin. I do use a separate night, day, and eye cream, this is by no means the only face product that I use. But once I added this into the mix everything changed. I will continue to re-purchase this product, until something else comes along that I think can compete with it! And that will be difficult. :D</li>
            <li> really good on my skin, feels great I really like it.  I am not much of a writer sorry that is all for now</li>
            <li> Did not like it. Did nothing for me!</li>
            <li> After trying a more expensive brand, I found cosmetic skin solutions.  not only is the price affordable, but the products are effective, make my skin glow and seems to make me look younger. I first tried the sample pack, that help to figure out my correct combination. I found the Vitamin C+E,  then the B work really well for me, then at night the resurfacing, and of course the eye. next I will trying their cream.  I strongly recommend Cosmetic Solutions products. They are great and when I had questions and emailed the company, they answered all my questions.&lt;br /&gt;Love their products!  You have to try them.</li>
            <li> Only have had this for a 2 week. I discovered a few rough patches after a week. It seems to have calmed.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t noticed any changes yet. But it&#x27;s still early</li>
            <li> I am really loving this product.  After only a few uses at night, I feel my skin looks more youthful and alive in the AM.  Recommend especially to those who experience dry skin during cold weather.</li>
            <li> I know that everyone compares the CSS Resurfacing Serum to the more expensive brand, and they should.  I used a bottle of the expesive brand recently.  It was great, but way too expensive to incorporate into my daily routine for life.  The Cosmetic Solutions product is a good product that may not have the exact ph as the expensive brand, however it is close enough that you will see a difference in your skin.  It chemically exfoliates with no irritation and adds moisturizer to the skin.  I like the ease and simplicity of using just one to three products in my skin care routine.  I do recommend that everyone use a timed release retinol that is non-irritating because retinol is clinically proven to work.  As I have aged my skin began to look as if it had a rough texture and my pores were more noticable even though my skin felt extremely smooth to the touch.  This product makes my skin look as smooth as it feels!  Try it, you will not be dissappointed.</li>
            <li> I can and others have seen the difference. Tried other brands..finally a product that works and affordable... Very happy here:-) :-) :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing other reviewers use scented products in their homes and have a compromised sense of smell and taste. I don&#x27;t use scents and can smell a very obvious mushroom odor in this serum. I&#x27;m thinking it is from the fermented tea extract. I find the smell nauseating, but may just deal with it since the competition&#x27;s product is 3x as expensive and this product is just as effective. The antioxidant 20 serum made by this company is superior to the competition&#x27;s and comparatively, very inexpensive. I like the brand and wish they would fix the odor problem in the resurfacing serum.</li>
            <li> I use a wide range of the Cosmetic Skin Solution&#x27;s line of product, but this one is my favorite. It delivers.  My skin feels more pliable, smoother, refreshed and all of it with absolutely no redness or silly break outs.&lt;br /&gt;I used to subscribe to this line&#x27;s more expensive predecessor by a different manufacturer, but find all formulas and products by CSS&#x27;s to be entirely just as effective as their more expensive &amp;#34;older second cousins.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the entire dry, mature skin product line.&lt;br /&gt;The CSS&#x27;s company treats its customers to superior products at reasonable prices backed by truly professional customer service.  Orders are processed quickly, packaged well and with care, and delivered on time.&lt;br /&gt;I consider myself a loyal customer now.  The CSS people have earned it.</li>
            <li> I used it in combination with the Ferulic Acid and Vitamin B5 serums and my skin looks 10 years younger. It does have a drying effect so I use it daily until my skin dries out and then I let it rest and stop it. I did notice my skin sagging again and my pores looked huge  when I wasn&#x27;t using it. These products when used together are amazing for my skin.</li>
            <li> In love with this product! I noticed an immediate change in my skins appearance from the second I started using it. Iâ€™m so happy I discovered CSS! I will never go back to using anything else. Great products, great customer service and a FANTASTIC value!!</li>
            <li> I truly LOVE this serum and how it gives my face a wonderful, refreshed look.&lt;br /&gt;Going for the pro size, this an outstanding product and staple in my regime.</li>
            <li> WOW. I love this stuff. It does just I need it to do. My skin looks healthy and even tone. Great product.</li>
            <li> that makes me think that this &amp;#34;is it&amp;#34;, love the bottle, love the feel, and slight exfoliation, still looking for the miracle product....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know what it&#x27;s doing, I can&#x27;t tell that my skin is any different, but I have not noticed any negative effects, so I&#x27;ll continue using it and hope it has the benefits it says is does!</li>
            <li> Great affordable serum comparable to much more expensive brand.</li>
            <li> Awful! Had an allergic reaction to it after a couple of days. Initially, I thought it was my protein powder that I was allergic to  but when I had put the serum on my neck- my neck grew these itchy bumps as well. So then it was all over my cheeks and neck. O my poor face.  I have good but sensative skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using these products for a number of years.  I love them.  My skin is clearer, brighter and fresh looking.  They are gentle on my skin and do not leave any residue.  Highly recommend them.  Plus, compared to the price of Skinceuticals you can&#x27;t go wrong.  Give them try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tami</li>
            <li> well, for what this cost, i really did expect more than what i got.......not the ammount, but the results.&lt;br /&gt;i have used nearly the entire bottle, and really truly cannot see any difference in the texture of my skin.  I am not at all happy with the product</li>
            <li> I use the resurfacing serum after the Vitamin C 20% serum.  The results are excellent.  I had been very pleased with the Vit C serum, but when I added this serum, the improvement was significant.  CSS is also a class act.  I highly recommend this product and this seller.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t exfoliate at all even though it has some really good ingredients, just the re surfacing aspect of this product kind of sucks.</li>
            <li> So luxurious to apply and does exactly what it should. Renews my skin! Gives me a beautiful texture and readies my face for the moisturiser. I apply this at night when not using the Retinol A</li>
            <li> This resurfacing serum contains glycolic acid that helps exfoliation. Pores are getting smaller and the scar are lighter, maybe I have incorporated this to other of its product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is suggested to use twice a day and you need to pay extra attnetion to moisturing and I would recommend to those with sensitive skin, you can use it a few times a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using several different combinations of Cosmetic&#x27;s products for almost two years and have found the Hydra B5 Gel and Vitamin C 20% is giving me excellent results. I use them both morning and evening and I am really pleased. The fine lines under my eyes have diminished and my skin tone is smooth and even.</li>
            <li> This product is very nice and works well.  My skin feels great after just one week and looks bright and smooth.</li>
            <li> This serum is great.  I have been using it for 5 months and my skin continues to look better and better.</li>
            <li> good ,there is a little pain of skin in few seconds after using .</li>
            <li> Works well for me.  I&#x27;m in my eary 60&#x27;s so with more mature skin I only use it every other night with B5 and Day Gel Moisturizer.  Good product.  Not harsh.</li>
            <li> Been using the same bottle for about three months, added to their Vitamin C serum. I always get compliments on my skin and youthful appearance; not really sure if it&#x27;s due to this product or overall good skin care results. Either way, I feel good about doing and using something more than the popular drug store products. I use much less than the recommended 5 drops, the consistency is similar to silky water, it spreads very easily and a little goes a long way.I believe this product is a good value and that it works as advertised.</li>
            <li> #1 is my Clarisonic Pro (gotta get that face exfoliated and ready to absorb products!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Resurfacing Serum comes immediately after cleansing, and wow, I can sure feel the difference!  My skin feels refreshed and pleasantly tightened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum is silky soft going on and has no detectable odor. I like it so much, I just ordered 2 more bottles (just never know when a company might discontinue a product!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: The Resurfacing Serum is my \\&quot;must-have,\\&quot; followed by the Vitamin C and E Serum (gotta get my antioxidant fix, and Vitamin C is also known to have sun-blocking properties). If your schedule allows, try Cosmetic Skin Solutions Hydra B5 Gel, lastly, to lock all the other goodies in to your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cosmetic Skin Solutions makes the most effective, budget-friendly skin care products, and if you care about having no sulfates, phthalates, petroleum, parabens, artificial colors or fragrance (like I do!), you&#x27;ll love these products even more!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes with this produc.t. It felt like I had a sticky residue sitting on top of my skin after I applied the product. I love the Vitamin C serum but this did not work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I was convinced this product wasn&#x27;t working well for me. However based on all the rave reviews and my sister who also uses this product I decided to keep at it. After trail and error I figured out I was using way to much for my face. A little goes along way with this product. I use a very small amount and I make sure to really rub it in. Applying it sparingly and really rubbing it in has done wonders for my overall skin texture. Just be sure to use a very small amount because it is potent.</li>
            <li> I like this product. It&#x27;s working on my face and now I will try it with my Derma Roller to see the results.</li>
            <li> Great product. I can really see results. Fine lines, pores, even milia that wouldn&#x27;t go away for months - all diminishing before my eyes! I&#x27;m two thirds through the first bottle and already ordering another for fear I might run out. Note I use this in the morning. Wash face, use vitamin b stay, then use the CSS C Serum, then this resurfacing serum, then CSS hyaluronic (this might be extraneous!) and then lotion/sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It has helped my skin all around. Definitely recommend! This is the THIRD bottle I&#x27;ve purchased. LOVE IT! GET IT!</li>
            <li> I use Resurfacing Serum 3 days per week and retinol 4 days per week. My skin is sensitive and I have no problems with either product. My skin has never looked better and I&#x27;m not overpaying for high quality, effective skin care. CSS products are the best!</li>
            <li> I dont have overly sensitive skin, but more &amp;#34;resurface&amp;#34; type serums burn and tingle too much for me. This does have some mild sensations but my skin can handle it and I am happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li> I have half a bottle left and I&#x27;m going to give to my mother to see if she has better luck. I have replaced it with a peel 2x a  week .&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference form this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself as a maintenance after my last peel. If my husband was in the bathroom with me, I would use it on him as well (at first, against his will). After a few days, he was using it religiously (2x per day), and I used it sporadically, (maybe 4-5x per week). Yesterday, he informed me that I needed to order more.  I can definitely tell a difference if I use it consistently - in fact, because my husband uses it religiously, I can tell a bigger difference in his skin than mine. His forehead is smoother and wrinkles are less pronounced. After seeing his results, I think I will start using as directed (am and pm)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fair, sensitive skin while his is more olive and not sensitive. Neither of us had any problems.</li>
            <li> I bought this with the Vit C serum and the combination has really helped clean up my skin from a disaster acne breakout while on vacation wearing lots of sunscreen. The combination of serums has helped the acne heal. The spots seem to be fading nicely with this serum.</li>
            <li> It takes a while (I&#x27;d say about a week and a half) to start seeing results, but you will see them,  When I first started using it, I went through a little rough patch where my skin actually looked a bit worse, but then it started clearing up more and more, and now its completely clear and bright.  I&#x27;d say stick with it even if your skin seems to get worse at first, because once you go through that stage, you&#x27;ll love the results.  I use it  every other day, that is just right for my skin.  (Using it every day is too much for me.  You just have to find what works for your skin).</li>
            <li> I love this product, I also use Hydra B5 Gel and Vitamin C + E Serum, Firming Eye Gel, I love them all...I commented as Please &amp; Relieved, My husband is also... I have a lot of creams and gels all over the house...I finally found a good system for me, a little go&#x27;s a long ways with this stuff, If you have any questions its nice to call and get a person...that means a lot to me... hope this helps..</li>
            <li> Already noticing a difference in the texture and appearance of my skin!  Will use this faithfully for more wonderful results!</li>
            <li> So far so good hope it produces radiant. Skin as promised. If it works. I will be ordering mote if it works</li>
