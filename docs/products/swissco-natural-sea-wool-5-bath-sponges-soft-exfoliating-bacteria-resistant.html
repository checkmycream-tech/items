            <li>Sea Wool is a good name for this type of sponge, it looks and feels like wool.  </li>
            <li>Good for bath but not for face.</li>
            <li>the price for the size is good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m mostly scrubbing myself with my finger tips instead of sponge!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like a whole sponge of this wonderful sea wool!</li>
            <li>It works well and feels nice while cleaning.</li>
            <li>It is holding up together nicely, has not fallen apart.</li>
            <li>I would kindly ask that sellers not add additional language to confuse the consumer like &amp;#34;sea wool&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Real Sponges are the best</li>
            <li>, but it&#x27;s my own fault for choosing this one...</li>
            <li>This sponge worked great when I first received it.</li>
            <li>Love this sponge, it&#x27;s great, exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I prefer a bit more abrasiveness.  </li>
            <li>Had to give this a 5 bc I love these sponges.</li>
            <li>I just love it  </li>
            <li>What a great feeling using real sponges in the bath and shower.  </li>
            <li>This would probably best be used as a facial sponge.</li>
            <li>You can be sure of that.  </li>
            <li>Love love love it.</li>
            <li>Lovely sponge.  </li>
            <li>I love how it&#x27;s antibacterial.  </li>
            <li>These sponges are not the greatest and certainly smaller than the five inches they are advertised as being.</li>
            <li>but there are no doubt much better.</li>
            <li>Will get more.</li>
            <li>Overall an excellent product...thank you mother nature!</li>
            <li>(I may time it once to be more scientific).</li>
            <li>Bought for wife and she&#x27;s well pleased with the softness &amp; durability.</li>
            <li>The sponge is a top notch cut of sea sponge.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get any better than this.</li>
            <li>Wonderful sponge, bigger than expected and works great!  </li>
            <li>I really loved the first one I got, but every one after</li>
            <li>Our grandchildren think they are fun to use, our house guests get their own to take home with them, and our family knows their own by its unique shape.</li>
            <li>Great natural sponge!</li>
            <li>This is my first sea wool sponge and I am so glad I got it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely easy to wash off the soup and squeeze the water out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve discovered that good natural sponges (like this one) work better for dishes than the cellulose sponges.  </li>
            <li>It has kept its shape well, and is still going strong.</li>
            <li>It is more than a hand full and well shaped.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, the sponge grows a little after you rinse in water, and it feels marvelous after you soap it up and work up a lather.</li>
            <li>Also makes a thoughtful gift.</li>
            <li>Yet, it still feels great when using body soap and easily rinses out to air dry.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It soaks up water so easily with just a quick pass.</li>
            <li>This is denser than most making it more solid, feels more durable.  </li>
            <li>They are pretty strong, easy to keep clean and don&#x27;t absorb odors.</li>
            <li>This one didn&#x27;t have any grit and was quite clean when it arrived.</li>
            <li>luckily I have a surface that I feel comfortable resting this on</li>
            <li>It is also a good size, even thought it says only 5 inches, it is very large and would easily assume it for anyone wanted to use a Sea Wool sponge.</li>
            <li>Much softer and lots more lather than my wash cloth.</li>
            <li>I really like sea sponges better than bath poufs or washcloths.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not much bigger than my petite woman hands and isn&#x27;t good for all-over cleaning.</li>
            <li>Love this for shower use, so soft, easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Less</li>
            <li>When I was much younger and expecting my first child, nothing was more pleasing that a warm, sudsy  bath just before bed.</li>
            <li>But other than that, they&#x27;re great for showers.</li>
            <li>it fell apart too quickly.</li>
            <li>apart quick</li>
            <li>plus it&#x27;s a bit more manly when compared to a regular loofa...not a lot more, just a bit.</li>
            <li>Their biggest plus is that they have a more solid feel to them than many other sponges, which is good for people who will use these to clean their bodies rather than just the face.</li>
            <li>Very soft and love to bathe with it.</li>
            <li>I am on my fourth one and overall these are the ones I like the best and hold up over a 6 month period pretty well.</li>
            <li>My family uses this item for daily bathing and WE love it!</li>
            <li>Love this natural sponge!</li>
            <li>They clean better, they wring out better, they fit in small spaces and they don&#x27;t get stinky.  </li>
            <li>I thought the price was steep, but it&#x27;s worth every cent.  </li>
            <li>also wish this was a bit more abrasive for scrubbing purposes, because it&#x27;s really soft.</li>
            <li>SO, aside from a quality sponge, it is good to know the people who supply it (Natural Bath &amp; Body supplies Swissco) are conscious of the environment and maintaining a sustainable product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found much better products from Natural Bath and Body on Amazon.</li>
            <li>A pleasure to use and worth the cost.</li>
            <li>but OK so far.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>This item arrived quickly and I like it very much.</li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>This is a great bath sponge and seems like it won&#x27;t fall apart like some more expensive bath sponges have.</li>
            <li>The cut sides constitute large portion of the surface and are fragile, do not keep up through use as good as the natural sponge surface.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably be back for more soon.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s triangular shaped so most of the sponge is a lot smaller than 5 inches.</li>
            <li>I would love to get my money back.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t last more than a week.  </li>
            <li>Got stinky and unsanitary fast!</li>
            <li>Received exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>While I regularly ordered these, better quality control is needed before I order another.</li>
            <li>In addition, the first one I tried molded within a month.  </li>
            <li>My skin was smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soooo soft and feels fabulous on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps a larger size would be better.</li>
            <li>The quality was good but the size of the sponge was not accurate..</li>
            <li>Feels great but smaller than expected</li>
            <li>Today, years later, I once again found the pleasure of the natural sponge oozing fragrant soap and warm water over weary bones.</li>
            <li>First off the sponge arrived really fast and was packed well.</li>
            <li>(i.e. the sponge is not as effective if you are first using it while completely dried).</li>
            <li>When needed I will certainly reorder.</li>
            <li>Being that this is my first sea sponge, I don&#x27;t know if it is normal, so I didn&#x27;t adjust my rating.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used this yet but seems really sturdy and should be for the price of it.</li>
            <li>Go to Whole Foods and pay 8 bucks for a quality sponge.</li>
            <li>AND THESE ARE THE REAL DEAL</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still holding up very well.</li>
            <li>not as much as a loofa, but still sufficient.</li>
            <li>I have noticed though that my bath gels do not foam up as much as with the synthetic sponges.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it is also much too soft.&lt;br /&gt;not comparable in quality to others i have ordered from</li>
            <li>This really works well with shower gel.</li>
            <li>Really lathers you up.</li>
            <li>Much softer than the vegetable loofahs.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to one and all!</li>
            <li>so far- very soft, makes tremendous suds and dries well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much softer than the natural sponges that you get at the paint shop, not as soft as the baby sponges that you get at the pharmacy, but it&#x27;s just right.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I really like this sponge and will get another when this one gets old.</li>
            <li>(I get a new one every 3 months)</li>
            <li>Soaks up water better when the entire sponge has been wet</li>
            <li>It is also very soft.</li>
            <li>This is a very soft bath sponge that looks a lot like the photo.</li>
            <li>Should have spent just a bit more for the larger size but so far happy enough with the 5 inch and looking forward tp replacing it with a larger natural sponge in the distant future.</li>
            <li>After use, our sponges sit on little stainless steel risers (sold as a soap stand from another source), so they dry quickly and stay clean.</li>
            <li>I thought it would have a better texture and be softer on the body, but it sort of has the texture of the usual sponge you use to wash dishes.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s flat on the other side where it was cut, like many sea sponges are.</li>
            <li>Will buy a large sponge next time.</li>
            <li>It was large enough that I cut it into two pieces.</li>
            <li>Have bought these before and they are good sponges but are now smaller than the previous purchase but more expensive.  </li>
            <li>We have soft water.  </li>
            <li>I have had to return one so far</li>
            <li>Like, really soft.</li>
            <li>Exfoliates my skin so well and makes it soft.</li>
            <li>Just say fraecking sponge or natural sponge.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft.</li>
            <li>Have been using natural sponges for a decade.  </li>
            <li>I suppose it&#x27;s the natural nature of the sponge</li>
            <li>Undoubtedly the nicest natural sponge I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>It is soft on the skin, sturdy and uniform in size.</li>
            <li>It was a natural bath sponge that created those suds.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used natural sponges off and on for years.</li>
            <li>I am a spongaholic, trying everything on the market both synthetic and natural.</li>
            <li>Besides, it&#x27;s fun to use one that actually grew in the Mediterranean, comes from Greece and was shipped by a Greek company!</li>
            <li>These last a long time, have a soft feel, and it is one less item that goes into the washer and dryer--plus everyone keeps up with their own sponge instead of going through a stack of wash cloths in a week.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin, so I generally use sea sponges rather than wash cloths.</li>
            <li>This one is too small to fit my hand.</li>
            <li>It is, in fact, a chunk of a larger sponge, which is clearly visible from the side -- it has a (clearly man-made) sharp right angle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another person mentioned that this sponge was soft, but not quite soft enough to use on your face.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just that I am a guy, but the sponge is plenty soft enough for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>barely a handful for</li>
            <li>Softer than a regular sea sponge, but not as soft as a silk sea sponge.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and generates just enough lather...</li>
            <li>this sponge is shorter than 5 inches on its longer side, and barely 3 on its shorter side.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the first sea sponge I have used, and I definitely prefer it to the average loofa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like the sponge, but after purchasing it I found one in TJ Max for half the price.</li>
            <li>, the only reason I rated it down to 4/5, is because the sponge I received, had two large holes through the middle which took up around 10% of the sponge.</li>

            <li> Their biggest plus is that they have a more solid feel to them than many other sponges, which is good for people who will use these to clean their bodies rather than just the face.</li>
            <li> Very soft and love to bathe with it.</li>
            <li> I am on my fourth one and overall these are the ones I like the best and hold up over a 6 month period pretty well.</li>
            <li> My family uses this item for daily bathing and WE love it!</li>
            <li> Love this natural sponge!</li>
            <li> They clean better, they wring out better, they fit in small spaces and they don&#x27;t get stinky.  </li>
            <li> I thought the price was steep, but it&#x27;s worth every cent.  </li>
            <li> also wish this was a bit more abrasive for scrubbing purposes, because it&#x27;s really soft.</li>
            <li> SO, aside from a quality sponge, it is good to know the people who supply it (Natural Bath &amp; Body supplies Swissco) are conscious of the environment and maintaining a sustainable product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found much better products from Natural Bath and Body on Amazon.</li>
            <li> A pleasure to use and worth the cost.</li>
            <li> but OK so far.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> This item arrived quickly and I like it very much.</li>
            <li> just right.</li>
            <li> This is a great bath sponge and seems like it won&#x27;t fall apart like some more expensive bath sponges have.</li>
            <li> The cut sides constitute large portion of the surface and are fragile, do not keep up through use as good as the natural sponge surface.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably be back for more soon.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s triangular shaped so most of the sponge is a lot smaller than 5 inches.</li>
            <li> I would love to get my money back.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t last more than a week.  </li>
            <li> Got stinky and unsanitary fast!</li>
            <li> Received exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> While I regularly ordered these, better quality control is needed before I order another.</li>
            <li> In addition, the first one I tried molded within a month.  </li>
            <li> My skin was smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soooo soft and feels fabulous on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps a larger size would be better.</li>
            <li> The quality was good but the size of the sponge was not accurate..</li>
            <li> Feels great but smaller than expected</li>
            <li> Today, years later, I once again found the pleasure of the natural sponge oozing fragrant soap and warm water over weary bones.</li>
            <li> First off the sponge arrived really fast and was packed well.</li>
            <li> (i.e. the sponge is not as effective if you are first using it while completely dried).</li>
            <li> When needed I will certainly reorder.</li>
            <li> Being that this is my first sea sponge, I don&#x27;t know if it is normal, so I didn&#x27;t adjust my rating.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used this yet but seems really sturdy and should be for the price of it.</li>
            <li> Go to Whole Foods and pay 8 bucks for a quality sponge.</li>
            <li> AND THESE ARE THE REAL DEAL</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still holding up very well.</li>
            <li> not as much as a loofa, but still sufficient.</li>
            <li> I have noticed though that my bath gels do not foam up as much as with the synthetic sponges.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it is also much too soft.&lt;br /&gt;not comparable in quality to others i have ordered from</li>
            <li> This really works well with shower gel.</li>
            <li> Really lathers you up.</li>
            <li> Much softer than the vegetable loofahs.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to one and all!</li>
            <li> so far- very soft, makes tremendous suds and dries well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much softer than the natural sponges that you get at the paint shop, not as soft as the baby sponges that you get at the pharmacy, but it&#x27;s just right.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I really like this sponge and will get another when this one gets old.</li>
            <li> (I get a new one every 3 months)</li>
            <li> Soaks up water better when the entire sponge has been wet</li>
            <li> It is also very soft.</li>
            <li> This is a very soft bath sponge that looks a lot like the photo.</li>
            <li> Should have spent just a bit more for the larger size but so far happy enough with the 5 inch and looking forward tp replacing it with a larger natural sponge in the distant future.</li>
            <li> After use, our sponges sit on little stainless steel risers (sold as a soap stand from another source), so they dry quickly and stay clean.</li>
            <li> I thought it would have a better texture and be softer on the body, but it sort of has the texture of the usual sponge you use to wash dishes.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s flat on the other side where it was cut, like many sea sponges are.</li>
            <li> Will buy a large sponge next time.</li>
            <li> It was large enough that I cut it into two pieces.</li>
            <li> Have bought these before and they are good sponges but are now smaller than the previous purchase but more expensive.  </li>
            <li> We have soft water.  </li>
            <li> I have had to return one so far</li>
            <li> Like, really soft.</li>
            <li> Exfoliates my skin so well and makes it soft.</li>
            <li> Just say fraecking sponge or natural sponge.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft.</li>
            <li> Have been using natural sponges for a decade.  </li>
            <li> I suppose it&#x27;s the natural nature of the sponge</li>
            <li> Undoubtedly the nicest natural sponge I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> It is soft on the skin, sturdy and uniform in size.</li>
            <li> It was a natural bath sponge that created those suds.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used natural sponges off and on for years.</li>
            <li> I am a spongaholic, trying everything on the market both synthetic and natural.</li>
            <li> Besides, it&#x27;s fun to use one that actually grew in the Mediterranean, comes from Greece and was shipped by a Greek company!</li>
            <li> These last a long time, have a soft feel, and it is one less item that goes into the washer and dryer--plus everyone keeps up with their own sponge instead of going through a stack of wash cloths in a week.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, so I generally use sea sponges rather than wash cloths.</li>
            <li> This one is too small to fit my hand.</li>
            <li> It is, in fact, a chunk of a larger sponge, which is clearly visible from the side -- it has a (clearly man-made) sharp right angle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another person mentioned that this sponge was soft, but not quite soft enough to use on your face.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just that I am a guy, but the sponge is plenty soft enough for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> barely a handful for</li>
            <li> Softer than a regular sea sponge, but not as soft as a silk sea sponge.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and generates just enough lather...</li>
            <li> this sponge is shorter than 5 inches on its longer side, and barely 3 on its shorter side.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the first sea sponge I have used, and I definitely prefer it to the average loofa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like the sponge, but after purchasing it I found one in TJ Max for half the price.</li>
            <li> , the only reason I rated it down to 4/5, is because the sponge I received, had two large holes through the middle which took up around 10% of the sponge.</li>
            <li> Also, the price was a little high for what we got.</li>
            <li> It is not only more abrasive than any sponge I have ever purchased, it is at least half the size of any other I have even SEEN.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Re-iterating what someone else mentioned, this sponge is not naturally 5&amp;#34;, it was cut from a larger piece, leaving one side flat, with a completely different texture.</li>
            <li> The last few sponges I have had were a bit softer and I prefer a really soft sponge -  which is the only reason I didn&#x27;t give this 5-stars.</li>
            <li> They are ugly shaped with two flat cut surfaces each, kind of triangular pieces.</li>
            <li> has been smaller than the first one and had a very hard core.</li>
            <li> The sponge is soft but it is smaller than expected and had rips in it, so it probably won&#x27;t last as long as others we&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li> even bother to dry it and return it</li>
            <li> But only after a couple of months, the sponge started to grow black mold.</li>
            <li> I was careful to squeeze all the water out and let it dry after each use.</li>
            <li> I cut it in half to double it.  </li>
            <li> it she saw there were black spots all through&lt;br /&gt;the inner core of the sponge.</li>
            <li> The price unreal, 1/2 of what I expected to pay.</li>
            <li> but I guess that&#x27;s what I get for not reading the description carefully</li>
            <li> It feels rough when you unpackage it</li>
            <li> Shipped when expected.  </li>
            <li> It was wet</li>
            <li> As a result, you will receive a partially round sponge and one side will have a flat surface from where it was cut to size.</li>
            <li> They seem to disintegrate slightly faster than other sea sponges I have used which makes the price not worth it.</li>
            <li> It was much narrower then the length making it difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I thought that since I was paying $12.79 for a sea sponge that that was at least some guarantee that it would be softer and bigger than others.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Off and On&amp;#34; because finding them at a reasonable price has been difficult.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I got what I paid for and I have no idea how this sponge could be so thin and cheap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m less than a week in with it</li>
            <li> I do not like the two sponges I ordered for my kids - these are not full sea sponges as the description and the picture state, but pieces of a sponge.</li>
            <li> The sponge may look small when it arrives, but it expands 3x when wet, so</li>
            <li> I would recommend if you don&#x27;t mind spending a little money.</li>
            <li> What the Flip is sea wool for crying out tears.</li>
            <li> Perfectly round, looks just like the picture.</li>
            <li> I have had it for a few months and use it every night.  </li>
            <li> .., BRING THE PRICE DOWN FOR HEAVEN SAKE!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit small for me, I&#x27;m 6&#x27;0, 210lbs</li>
            <li> same provider.&lt;br /&gt;i am not likely to order one again, nor to recommend buying one.&lt;br /&gt;:(</li>
            <li> I usually purchase these sponges from Crabtree &amp; Evelyn, but when I saw it on amazon for a fraction of the price, I just had to try it.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these expecting them to be similar to artificial types I previously bought at CVS Drugstore years ago.</li>
            <li> It feels so different than the artificial sponge.</li>
            <li> Sadly, this 5&amp;#34; sponge doubled in price and almost shrunk in half (see my photo).</li>
            <li> Not a good buy</li>
            <li> I was sad that this was so small...</li>
            <li> There are worse sponges than these</li>
            <li> Poor marks for Swissco.</li>
            <li> It is insanely overpriced, and poor quality.</li>
            <li> After weeks of use, I&#x27;m still shocked at how absorbent this sponge is.</li>
            <li> but I was disappointed with the lifespan of this product and will not be ordering another again.</li>
            <li> very bad quality.</li>
            <li> I had to throw it out because it was so disgusting.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is the first sea sponge I have used, and I definitely prefer it to the average loofa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Re-iterating what someone else mentioned, this sponge is not naturally 5&amp;#34;, it was cut from a larger piece, leaving one side flat, with a completely different texture. Being that this is my first sea sponge, I don&#x27;t know if it is normal, so I didn&#x27;t adjust my rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another person mentioned that this sponge was soft, but not quite soft enough to use on your face. Maybe it&#x27;s just that I am a guy, but the sponge is plenty soft enough for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-All, the only reason I rated it down to 4/5, is because the sponge I received, had two large holes through the middle which took up around 10% of the sponge.</li>
            <li> Give this item as a gift to my friend. She loves using it and it really soft when wet and soaps up well.</li>
            <li> Feels great but smaller than expected</li>
            <li> This is my first sea wool sponge and I am so glad I got it! Much softer and lots more lather than my wash cloth. These sponges come in  different sizes like 5 inch, 6 inch etc. As a result, you will receive a partially round sponge and one side will have a flat surface from where it was cut to size. Nevertheless, the sponge grows a little after you rinse in water, and it feels marvelous after you soap it up and work up a lather. I&#x27;d like a whole sponge of this wonderful sea wool! Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Purchased it for reasons you could assume. It works well and feels nice while cleaning. It is also a good size, even thought it says only 5 inches, it is very large and would easily assume it for anyone wanted to use a Sea Wool sponge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve discovered that good natural sponges (like this one) work better for dishes than the cellulose sponges.  They clean better, they wring out better, they fit in small spaces and they don&#x27;t get stinky.  I&#x27;ll never go back.</li>
            <li> I prefer a bit more abrasiveness.  It holds a lot of water and soap and takes a lot of water to rinse.  We have soft water.  Great for mopping up before toweling.</li>
            <li> Had to give this a 5 bc I love these sponges. I have had to return one so far bc it fell apart too quickly. I am on my fourth one and overall these are the ones I like the best and hold up over a 6 month period pretty well.</li>
            <li> This is the second sponge I purchased.  I just love it  It feels sooooo  good.  I thought the price was steep, but it&#x27;s worth every cent.  I&#x27;ll probably be back for more soon.  Also makes a thoughtful gift.</li>
            <li> The quality was good but the size of the sponge was not accurate.. It was much narrower then the length making it difficult to use. Nothing ventured nothing gained.</li>
            <li> This sponge is the perfect size. It is also very soft. It is holding up together nicely, has not fallen apart.</li>
            <li> barely a handful for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it once and tossed it.  Someone has to sell a larger, durable sponge.</li>
            <li> This is a very soft bath sponge that looks a lot like the photo. It&#x27;s flat on the other side where it was cut, like many sea sponges are. This one didn&#x27;t have any grit and was quite clean when it arrived. I really like sea sponges better than bath poufs or washcloths. They are pretty strong, easy to keep clean and don&#x27;t absorb odors.</li>
            <li> What a great feeling using real sponges in the bath and shower.  Nothing else like it. The price unreal, 1/2 of what I expected to pay. These are a future reorder and gift item.</li>
            <li> I was sad that this was so small...but I guess that&#x27;s what I get for not reading the description carefully enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also wish this was a bit more abrasive for scrubbing purposes, because it&#x27;s really soft. Like, really soft. If you&#x27;re looking for a scrubby exfoliating sponge, this is not that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase this again if it were bigger. It&#x27;s not much bigger than my petite woman hands and isn&#x27;t good for all-over cleaning. This would probably best be used as a facial sponge.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 5 inches at it&#x27;s longest point. It&#x27;s triangular shaped so most of the sponge is a lot smaller than 5 inches. Last time I buy anything from Swissco.  You can be sure of that.  It&#x27;s not enough to not drop often.  I&#x27;m mostly scrubbing myself with my finger tips instead of sponge!</li>
            <li> This is a great sponge.  It feels rough when you unpackage it but once wet it is extremely soft.  It&#x27;s a great find and lathers well and rinses well.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is a great bath sponge. It&#x27;s much softer than the natural sponges that you get at the paint shop, not as soft as the baby sponges that you get at the pharmacy, but it&#x27;s just right. The size is perfect to fit in your hand.</li>
            <li> Love love love it. Exfoliates my skin so well and makes it soft. And it just feels luxurious.</li>
            <li> I would kindly ask that sellers not add additional language to confuse the consumer like &amp;#34;sea wool&amp;#34;.  Just say fraecking sponge or natural sponge. What the Flip is sea wool for crying out tears.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it! It feels so different than the artificial sponge. It&#x27;s extremely easy to wash off the soup and squeeze the water out. It&#x27;s soft.</li>
            <li> It is smaller than I had anticipated.</li>
            <li> Lovely sponge.  Perfectly round, looks just like the picture.</li>
            <li> Have bought these before and they are good sponges but are now smaller than the previous purchase but more expensive.  The description is not deceiving; I just did not pay attention to the size advertised.  Will buy a large sponge next time.</li>
            <li> I do not like the two sponges I ordered for my kids - these are not full sea sponges as the description and the picture state, but pieces of a sponge. I got two pieces that constitute 2/3 of one sea sponge if you put them together. They are ugly shaped with two flat cut surfaces each, kind of triangular pieces. So the seller just cut one sea sponge into three pieces and sold two of them to me. The cut sides constitute large portion of the surface and are fragile, do not keep up through use as good as the natural sponge surface.</li>
            <li> Great natural sponge!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used this yet but seems really sturdy and should be for the price of it. Definitely a luxury.</li>
            <li> This product arrved MOLDY!!!  STINKY MOLDY.  I bought it for my daugherter&#x27;s stocking, and it stunk up all the stuff in the stocking.  I had to throw it out because it was so disgusting.  I would love to get my money back.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s falling apart after 1 month!!!  Not a good buy</li>
            <li> Have been using natural sponges for a decade.  This is denser than most making it more solid, feels more durable.  Yet, it still feels great when using body soap and easily rinses out to air dry.  It comes tagged with a note of what type of sponge it is and that it is from a sustainable region of the sea.  SO, aside from a quality sponge, it is good to know the people who supply it (Natural Bath &amp; Body supplies Swissco) are conscious of the environment and maintaining a sustainable product.  The last few sponges I have had were a bit softer and I prefer a really soft sponge -  which is the only reason I didn&#x27;t give this 5-stars.</li>
            <li> Got this at bed bath and beyond for 12.99!</li>
            <li> great sponges but the fall apart quick</li>
            <li> Fits well in my hand.  Great price for the quality.  I love how it&#x27;s antibacterial.  I just wring mine out after each use.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, so I generally use sea sponges rather than wash cloths. I thought that since I was paying $12.79 for a sea sponge that that was at least some guarantee that it would be softer and bigger than others. My mistake! It is not only more abrasive than any sponge I have ever purchased, it is at least half the size of any other I have even SEEN. It is, in fact, a chunk of a larger sponge, which is clearly visible from the side -- it has a (clearly man-made) sharp right angle. Do not buy this product. It is insanely overpriced, and poor quality. Go to Whole Foods and pay 8 bucks for a quality sponge.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t last more than a week.  Got stinky and unsanitary fast!</li>
            <li> Perfect. Received exactly what I ordered. I really like this sponge and will get another when this one gets old.</li>
            <li> Sea Wool is a good name for this type of sponge, it looks and feels like wool.  Softer than a regular sea sponge, but not as soft as a silk sea sponge.  Good for bath but not for face.</li>
            <li> These sponges are not the greatest and certainly smaller than the five inches they are advertised as being. They seem to disintegrate slightly faster than other sea sponges I have used which makes the price not worth it. Their biggest plus is that they have a more solid feel to them than many other sponges, which is good for people who will use these to clean their bodies rather than just the face. There are worse sponges than these but there are no doubt much better.</li>
            <li> THEY HAVE NUMEROUS USES AND THESE ARE THE REAL DEAL BUT MY GOD, I&#x27;M STILL LOOKING FOF THE RHINESTONES IN THEM.., BRING THE PRICE DOWN FOR HEAVEN SAKE!!</li>
            <li> Sadly, this 5&amp;#34; sponge doubled in price and almost shrunk in half (see my photo). While I regularly ordered these, better quality control is needed before I order another.</li>
            <li> My family uses this item for daily bathing and WE love it!</li>
            <li> Love this natural sponge! Great price too. Will get more.</li>
            <li> A Sea wool sponge should have a bit of &#x27;scrub&#x27; to it - not to the level of a loofa or Caribbean Grass sponge, but enough to cleanse one&#x27;s skin briskly - and none of the three I received have that.  In addition, the first one I tried molded within a month.  Poor marks for Swissco. I&#x27;ve found much better products from Natural Bath and Body on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This sponge worked great when I first received it. I read the reviews on Amazon and paired it with a Dr Bronners wash. My skin was smooth and soft. But only after a couple of months, the sponge started to grow black mold. I was careful to squeeze all the water out and let it dry after each use. I&#x27;m even the type to squeegee the walls after showering. I suppose it&#x27;s the natural nature of the sponge but I was disappointed with the lifespan of this product and will not be ordering another again.</li>
            <li> Real Sponges are the best</li>
            <li> plus it&#x27;s a bit more manly when compared to a regular loofa...not a lot more, just a bit. This thing works well, though. I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of months now and it&#x27;s still holding up very well. It&#x27;s soft and generates just enough lather...not as much as a loofa, but still sufficient. It&#x27;s a bit small for me, I&#x27;m 6&#x27;0, 210lbs (hey ladies!), but it&#x27;s my own fault for choosing this one...it says &amp;#34;5 inches&amp;#34; in the description. I&#x27;ll be going with a larger one next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave this 4 stars and not 5 is because there isn&#x27;t a string or way to hang this in your shower...luckily I have a surface that I feel comfortable resting this on that doesn&#x27;t gross me out (say, like, the corner of the shower? gross)...your mileage may vary...but if it had a built in string of some sort, it&#x27;d be the perfect shower-mate.</li>
            <li> Undoubtedly the nicest natural sponge I have ever owned.It is soft on the skin, sturdy and uniform in size. A pleasure to use and worth the cost. I have noticed though that my bath gels do not foam up as much as with the synthetic sponges. Overall an excellent product...thank you mother nature!</li>
            <li> After weeks of use, I&#x27;m still shocked at how absorbent this sponge is. I can hold it up to my shower head and not feel a drop for several seconds (I may time it once to be more scientific). This sponge holds a LOT of water. I use it to mop up any water and sand that gets in my kayak while I&#x27;m out paddling. It&#x27;s such a pleasure to use as it does its job so well. Mine hasn&#x27;t shown signs of wear yet but I do try to rinse it out in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It soaks up water so easily with just a quick pass. Soaks up water better when the entire sponge has been wet (i.e. the sponge is not as effective if you are first using it while completely dried).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m indifferent on this sea wool sponge.  I thought it would have a better texture and be softer on the body, but it sort of has the texture of the usual sponge you use to wash dishes.  I cut it in half to double it.  I would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> I really like the sponge, but after purchasing it I found one in TJ Max for half the price. I would recommend if you don&#x27;t mind spending a little money.</li>
            <li> Bought for wife and she&#x27;s well pleased with the softness &amp; durability.Should have spent just a bit more for the larger size but so far happy enough with the 5 inch and looking forward tp replacing it with a larger natural sponge in the distant future.</li>
            <li> When I was much younger and expecting my first child, nothing was more pleasing that a warm, sudsy  bath just before bed. It was a natural bath sponge that created those suds. Today, years later, I once again found the pleasure of the natural sponge oozing fragrant soap and warm water over weary bones.</li>
            <li> this sponge is shorter than 5 inches on its longer side, and barely 3 on its shorter side.&lt;br /&gt;it is also much too soft.&lt;br /&gt;not comparable in quality to others i have ordered from same provider.&lt;br /&gt;i am not likely to order one again, nor to recommend buying one.&lt;br /&gt;:(</li>
            <li> Wow. This really works well with shower gel. Really lathers you up.</li>
            <li> The sponge is soft but it is smaller than expected and had rips in it, so it probably won&#x27;t last as long as others we&#x27;ve used in the past.  Also, the price was a little high for what we got.</li>
            <li> Very soft and love to bathe with it.</li>
            <li> Love this sponge, it&#x27;s great, exactly what I wanted. Best kind of sponge or wash cloth I&#x27;ve ever used. Much softer than the vegetable loofahs.</li>
            <li> I usually purchase these sponges from Crabtree &amp; Evelyn, but when I saw it on amazon for a fraction of the price, I just had to try it. Sadly, I got what I paid for and I have no idea how this sponge could be so thin and cheap.</li>
            <li> Love this for shower use, so soft, easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Less hassle than cloth and dries easy.&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned about mold in sponge but OK so far.</li>
            <li> Wonderful sponge, bigger than expected and works great!  Well worth the money.  Shipped when expected.  Had no problems with this company at all.</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL! USE IT EVERY DAY..</li>
            <li> I love it! It&#x27;s soooo soft and feels fabulous on my skin.  I highly recommend it to one and all!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used natural sponges off and on for years. &amp;#34;Off and On&amp;#34; because finding them at a reasonable price has been difficult. This product is the best sponge I have ever used and the price for the size is good. We use them instead of wash cloths on faces and bodies. After use, our sponges sit on little stainless steel risers (sold as a soap stand from another source), so they dry quickly and stay clean. Our grandchildren think they are fun to use, our house guests get their own to take home with them, and our family knows their own by its unique shape. These last a long time, have a soft feel, and it is one less item that goes into the washer and dryer--plus everyone keeps up with their own sponge instead of going through a stack of wash cloths in a week.</li>
            <li> I am a spongaholic, trying everything on the market both synthetic and natural. This is a great product so far- very soft, makes tremendous suds and dries well. I&#x27;m less than a week in with it so I can&#x27;t touch on it&#x27;d durabilty.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll re-order until it&#x27;s no longer my fav!</li>
            <li> My husband has a tumor that requires chemotherapy and radiation.  His Doctors recomend the sponges for him to wash his face</li>
            <li> This is a great sponge.  I have had it for a few months and use it every night.  It has kept its shape well, and is still going strong.</li>
            <li> This item is on my subscribe and save list. I really loved the first one I got, but every one after (I get a new one every 3 months) has been smaller than the first one and had a very hard core. But other than that, they&#x27;re great for showers.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daugher and when she was&lt;br /&gt;using it she saw there were black spots all through&lt;br /&gt;the inner core of the sponge. It was wet so we&lt;br /&gt;didn&#x27;t even bother to dry it and return it we just&lt;br /&gt;threw it out. very bad quality.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these expecting them to be similar to artificial types I previously bought at CVS Drugstore years ago. This one is too small to fit my hand. It doesn&#x27;t hold my liquid soap well either. Perhaps a larger size would be better. I don&#x27;t recommend these and won&#x27;t buy these again.</li>
            <li> This is a great bath sponge and seems like it won&#x27;t fall apart like some more expensive bath sponges have. Besides, it&#x27;s fun to use one that actually grew in the Mediterranean, comes from Greece and was shipped by a Greek company! Hoorah! The sponge may look small when it arrives, but it expands 3x when wet, so just right.</li>
            <li> First off the sponge arrived really fast and was packed well. The sponge is a top notch cut of sea sponge. It is more than a hand full and well shaped. It doesn&#x27;t get any better than this.</li>
            <li> This item arrived quickly and I like it very much. It was large enough that I cut it into two pieces. What I like best is its softness.When needed I will certainly reorder.</li>
