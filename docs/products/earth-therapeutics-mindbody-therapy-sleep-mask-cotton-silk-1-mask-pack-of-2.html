            <li>It&#x27;s much better than the Lewis &amp; Clark mask, for the reason that the dye does not come off on your bedding like the L&amp;C mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>This mask USED TO be my all time favorite sleep mask.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for this sleep mask for a while and am so glad I found it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering more as presents for friends.</li>
            <li>I was able to get rid of the odor after washing them though.</li>
            <li>but I LOVE lavender</li>
            <li>But all in all I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this mask.</li>
            <li>These work to keep the light out, but I don&#x27;t find sleeping in them very easy.</li>
            <li>I really like this mask, it does a good job of keeping the light out if adjusted right and is cushioned for great comfort.</li>
            <li>Nice and soft on face and does a great job blocking out light.</li>
            <li>It is neither too warm nor too cool when wearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pretty good sleep masks for the price.  </li>
            <li>so you can actually use it as a man lol just kidding, but it is nice.</li>
            <li>(they&#x27;re adjustable), they don&#x27;t move and most importantly - they keep the light out!  </li>
            <li>This mask is very comfortable, and keeps the light out well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light, breathable, comfortable, and the strap stays on well.  </li>

            <li>It keeps all of the light out, it is very comfortable, I never have creases on my face from the mask</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m thrilled to get two more at such a good price.</li>
            <li>,It don&#x27;t keep all the light out,but better then nothing.</li>
            <li>This is a great mask, soft, and comfy.</li>
            <li>but they are well made and comfortable -- much better than hiding your eyes under your arm.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After scouring the internet for a great deal on a sleeping mask that would be both comfortable, and effective at blocking out light, I finally found these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It just had a hint of \\&quot;pleasant new mask\\&quot; but that faded over time.</li>
            <li>was easy..</li>
            <li>They are easily adjustable.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t like them, but also because I think a more moderate rating would get this lost among rating of people who are happy with the item.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Light weight, and easy to put</li>
            <li>/&gt;The elastic band that holds the mask on is easy to adjust and fastens with a piece of Velcro.</li>
            <li>Silk charmeuse is the ideal fabric, neither heavy nor too warm.</li>
            <li>Feels good, and i really like the light lavender scent.</li>
            <li>The silk fabric of this mask is cool and soft, with nice padding and a good shape to block out all the light.</li>
            <li>Other than that love this product!!!</li>
            <li>This fits perfectly to cover my eyes at night and since its dark in color it helps to block out any excess light..</li>
            <li>Service was fine.</li>
            <li>Even better, it came with two, so one can stay in the bedroom and one downstairs for those quick daylight naps....</li>
            <li>This mask is soft, easy to use &amp; blocks a good deal of light.  </li>
            <li>this is by far the best i have used so far.</li>
            <li>Once the light comes through the window, I reach for a mask to block the light.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s blocks out all light , and fits comfortably around my he.ad</li>
            <li>They have changed my life and now I sleep through the night without any light bothering me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, now they can get their light</li>
            <li>It rests comfortably over the eyes and blocks out the light.  </li>
            <li>blocks about 99 % of the light</li>
            <li>I got really really light headed..</li>
            <li>It helps to keep the light out.  </li>
            <li>They clean easily by throwing them in the washer with a load of laundry.</li>
            <li>He said that he can&#x27;t sleep with one but after trying mine he wants one of his own.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using one for several months, and I&#x27;m so happy with it</li>
            <li>For the men just a comfortable mask.</li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t feel comfortable wearing this because the band bothers my head.</li>
            <li>The don&#x27;t block all of the light</li>
            <li>Comfortable around the eyes.  </li>
            <li>I found it quite comfortable.</li>
            <li>They stay put and block out light.</li>
            <li>Some light does seep through the bottom</li>
            <li>In any case, when there&#x27;s too much light in the room, this mask does the trick for me</li>

            <li>It blocks out all the light from windows, alarm clocks, tv and phones.  </li>
            <li>They are adjustable and will fit anyone.  </li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t all too comfortable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this is just a really comfortable, lightweight mask.</li>
            <li>Does a great job at blocking light but is light enough to forget it is there.  </li>
            <li>I have been using a cheap $1 mask given to me in a gift bag.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t block out the light at the bottom by your nose.</li>
            <li>This mask stays on securely, doesn&#x27;t stain fabric, and feels like a pillow for your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so comfortable on my head with the adjustable strap, and the fabric is silky.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experenced on others, which allows me to sleep comfortably in my sides.</li>
            <li>It does not let any light in and unlike others is does not bother my ears.</li>
            <li>Of course said, &amp;#34;no, you keep it and enjoy it&amp;#34;, I can get another one.</li>
            <li>I think it will get the job done, for blocking out light when traveling.</li>
            <li>This one blocks the light and is comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>They fit snugly, but</li>
            <li>It blocks out the light well and is cushioned against my eyes.</li>
            <li>The mask is amazingly comfortable.</li>
            <li>I like how the flaps at the lower portion of the eye mask shade out light from shining in by my nose.  </li>
            <li>I have worked nights for twenty years, sleep days and have been looking for a mask that keeps out the light.  </li>
            <li>block light and not cut the ears..</li>
            <li>has added pouches on the inside that block light from coming in around the nose</li>
            <li>It has a nice silky soft feel and is more padded than others I have used.  </li>
            <li>It can cover the eyes completely and it feels good on the eyes.</li>
            <li>Extremely comfortable--I have found no rival--and they do a great job of blocking light while fitting comfortably around the nose.</li>
            <li>I am able to go right to sleep and stay asleep until I have to hit the snooze button.</li>
            <li>It does a good job of blocking light if you arrange it properly, but it does slip easily if you turn to your side.</li>
            <li>I sleep much better in the morning now that I can block that first light.</li>
            <li>, I highly recommend it, if you are looking for a good sleepmask this is the right one</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not fancy (super silky or padded) but it blocks light and is so light weight that it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all when I sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great eye-masks, totally blocks out light and is comfortable right out of the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well Worth it!</li>
            <li>Also this is a mask that puts significant pressure on the eyes.  </li>
            <li>I originally bought this in a store and was devastated when I lost it and the store no longer carried them.</li>
            <li>I first bought these sleep masks at BB&amp;B (for lots more money).</li>
            <li>Not only do I not wake up with the sun in the morning, but I fall asleep better and sleep more soundly!  </li>
            <li>, it was an easy way to discover if it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>For &amp;#34;doubling&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve found that using a heavier bulkier mask on the outside seems to work more effectively.</li>
            <li>This sleep mask is super comfortable to sleep in.</li>
            <li>Love this it really blocks the light, so I can sleep while my husband reads.</li>
            <li>It keeps light out as it&#x27;s supposed to do, but the strap really cuts into the top of the ear</li>
            <li>The mask if very comfortable, otherwise, and cushions my eyes very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>sleep mask has just the right amount of thickness to it and is easy to use and adjust.</li>
            <li>I have a little more difficulty getting it to block all the light as well as this one, but it could be more attractive for larger faces or folks that are bothered by having something constantly touching their eyes like this one does.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, they are fine and I still gave 4 stars because I&#x27;m sure most people won&#x27;t be as critical as I am being.</li>
            <li>The padding under your eyes really help and for a day sleeper that is huge!</li>
            <li>I bought this because I am light sleeper and the first light or noise I hear will wake me up</li>
            <li>They smell nice, they&#x27;re comfortable and they are not PINK.</li>
            <li>Thick and sofe material make me perfect circumstance when I want to sleep.</li>
            <li>Someone mentioned the aromatherapy smell in their review being too much, however, I quite enjoyed it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now looking to order more, just to have on hand when this one is ready to be replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The silk is nothing like my nice soft silk shirts.</li>
            <li>Mystery as to why they give me a headache, but they&#x27;ve enough good reviews that it can&#x27;t be common.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks :)</li>
            <li>Overall good purchase.</li>
            <li>I really like these, but lacking the contour that many of the others have.</li>
            <li>from all that discomfort stuff, it works and it&#x27;s good enough for now.</li>
            <li>The only con is that in the summer it can get a bit warm and make me sweat, but I sweat easily.  </li>
            <li>smooth silky, very comfortable to wear, covers your eyes completely</li>
            <li>They both said although they had a strong fragrance out of the box, it disappeared pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>The Earth Therapeutics Sleep Mask has worked exceptionally well for me for several years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Secondly, it really  doesn&#x27;t block out the light too well, the light comes in from the bottom  area.</li>
            <li>They wash well - in the sink with mild (ivory) dish detergent</li>
            <li>What I like about this mask is that it is both comfortable and form fitting (goes around the nose to block noise and has a soft fabric that adjusts to the face).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I like it better than the older heavier one.  </li>
            <li>The mask blocks out the light very well, and is well-fitted around the nose, where light likes to seep in...</li>
            <li>The fragrance dissipated quickly.</li>
            <li>Since light pouring through a window wakes me, this product is very appreciated</li>
            <li>I ordered 2 more and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable, even in the heat of the tropics, where I live.</li>
            <li>This smells funny and seems cheaply made.</li>
            <li>I bought this during the heat of a hot summer and it has blocked plenty of the light without leaving me feeling smothered (like the Louis and Clark mask).  </li>
            <li>I just bought two more of these as my other two seem to have walked off on their own.  </li>
            <li>This is the most comfortable sleeping mask I have (its better than my other five, including a memory foam mask).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please be aware that the straps you may get may vary in size!</li>
            <li>I have chronic migraines and this mask is soft and keeps light out easily.</li>
            <li>The adjustable velcro strap is great because the mask isn&#x27;t too tight around my head.</li>
            <li>It has a mild scent right out of the box, but isn&#x27;t noxious.</li>
            <li>mask itself, however is very soft and comfortable over the eyes but the second issues is that the eye pads don&#x27;t quite conform to my eye sockets providing a good seal.</li>
            <li>I have a large, bulky sleep mask that I love, but in the summer or with hot flashes, or if need it in my purse for travel, it is to hot and bulky.  </li>
            <li>The side straps could be a little more comfortable, however, that is the downfall of most masks.</li>
            <li>They also tend not to block the light out very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In light of (haha)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it to me.</li>
            <li>This 2 pack is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>but well worth it.</li>
            <li>I give this product 5 stars because it has an adjustable strap at the back which makes it more comfortable to wear.  </li>
            <li>Besides being comfortable, soft, and free of bad/strong/etc odors?</li>
            <li>you like the really slick-abrasive feeling fabrics like cheap silks or cheap satins, and if you don&#x27;t have any issue with the polyester in these, I can&#x27;t really see a problem with them.</li>
            <li>There are two in the pack, though, which is nice, but it had to go back.</li>
            <li>I really like this sleep mask, and I really want to like it better than I</li>
            <li>I love this soft, silky sleep mask.</li>
            <li>It stores easy, keeps it dark for me, and is soft and works great.</li>
            <li>So I go through these pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>They also said it stays on pretty well during the night and is soft and very comfortable.</li>
            <li>Price is right</li>
            <li>just right and sintch up the elastic</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a minty/lavender scent to it right out of the package, but if you leave them out to air, it goes away almost immediately.</li>
            <li>Most of those reviews are pretty old if you note that.</li>
            <li>They block the light very well and they are very soft and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>They could probably benefit from being a bit larger, but they&#x27;re &#x27;pillowy&#x27;-enough (for lack of a better word) to block out most of the light and fill in the gaps around the edges.</li>
            <li>I bought this mask when I was a new mom and needed to fall asleep quickly while my baby slept - can&#x27;t imagine sleeping without one now!</li>
            <li>Wide strap makes it very comfortable and secure.</li>
            <li>Keeps out the morning light or the light when we wake up at different times.</li>
            <li>There is a pleasant aroma when opening the mask, it goes away after using it a few times.</li>
            <li>Very soft and comfortable although scentless would be preferable.</li>
            <li>Incredibly soft and love the extra little pillowy bit at the bottom; super effective in keeping light out!</li>
            <li>I am able to go right back to sleep.  </li>
            <li>They survive the washing machine just fine, though the lovely smell fades after the first washing, and eventually the elastic stretches out and gets loose to the point where the mask doesn&#x27;t stay on very well and must be replaced.</li>
            <li>Soft material, with ajustable strap lets it fit your face well.</li>
            <li>If you want a soft, cushiony sleep mask that doesn&#x27;t let any light in - this is the answer.</li>
            <li>It does cover and block out light completely for the amount of time it stays on.  </li>
            <li>My bedroom allows far too much light in the morning</li>
            <li>/&gt;In conclusion, the Earth Therapeutics are not any better than generic sleep masks given to you on airlines.</li>
            <li>First, I don&#x27;t like satin on my face.</li>
            <li>I have issues with sleeping and have tried many different types of sleep masks.  </li>
            <li>Like with anything that touches your skin, you should wash this first before you use it in order to remove manufacturing residue.</li>
            <li>i am much happier and well rested!  </li>
            <li>If you want to try them first, go to bed, bath and beyond.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used mine 4x so far while I&#x27;ve napped during the day and it blocks out all light.</li>
            <li>The mask is soft and comfortable and is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this mask, the Lewis N Clark, and the one that wraps around you entire head, but so far this has been the most comfortable.</li>
            <li>I remember paying under $10 for two of them the first time I bought this.</li>
            <li>and I shared the second of the set with my night-shift working daughter, as I felt it might help her get more rest during the day as well.  </li>
            <li>I used it for the first time this morning when the sun came blasting through the window and it didn&#x27;t slide around</li>
            <li>, it helps me fall asleep faster and into a deep sleep, I love it.</li>
            <li>The silky material helps it to not be hot and sweaty.</li>
            <li>So I ordered a whole pack!</li>
            <li>They are smooth and soft and</li>
            <li>The mask is soft and padded and blocks the light exceedingly well.</li>
            <li>wife has previously made some passable eye-covers out of cotton socks that we both can wear -- and I find significantly more comfortable.</li>
            <li>Nothing special, but it is very soft.</li>
            <li>This would probably be fine for most people, but I have trouble already, breathing through my nose when asleep</li>
            <li>It was well made, blocked the light really well, and the materials were so soft.</li>
            <li>When I first got it and wore it, I became very congested within 15-30 min.</li>
            <li>When it is in place, it does keep the room nice and dark</li>
            <li>Ii think this might be too small for a man&#x27;s face--but it is a good product</li>
            <li>It was SUPER soft, and the mask is also adjustable.</li>
            <li>The only thing that should be noted that was not mentioned by the manufacturer is that there is a strong lavender smell on the mask.</li>
            <li>, it is only strong a day or so...</li>
            <li>Large enough to hug your face and block out light.  </li>
            <li>It really helps, especially since my kids like the hall light on at nite</li>
            <li>The blinds in my rental apartment do not block out light very well, and so I&#x27;ve been looking for something that could help since I can&#x27;t install proper drapes.</li>
            <li>A much more cost effective option than buying expensive window treatments to block out the streetlight in my NYC apartment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You get 2 eye masks and they are high quality!</li>
            <li>And with the Amazon ready to ship packaging, opening and using it</li>
            <li>i was looking at the price and was like there is no way for 8 bucks i would like this thing so much, and bought another sleep mask.</li>
            <li>but since that happened i guess it worked since it got light enough</li>
            <li>and sometimes I don&#x27;t sleep very well at night.</li>
            <li>The smell actually wore off after the first two times of using it but the best part is i can nap in the middle of the day and see no light because the way its designed!</li>
            <li>The strap is sturdy enough that it doesn&#x27;t stretch out and lose the snug fit around my head.</li>
            <li>I sleep with a cpap machine, and this mask is flexible enough that I can work it around to work with the cpap mask and still keep the light out.  </li>
            <li>I think everybody can enjoy deep sleep with this.</li>
            <li>It works, but I don&#x27;t use it as much as O thought I would have.</li>
            <li>Comfortable and versatile as for a while my husband (larger head)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really comfy, and doesn&#x27;t feel oppressive or bothersome.</li>
            <li>wear my mask, and it really helps me fall asleep.</li>
            <li>If you wake in the 3 a.m. to 4 a.m. range and lay in bedding watching the clock this mask will really help.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s ready to go again.  </li>
            <li>I buy these for my husband since I like to stay up later than him and the light from my reading lamp or the TV keeps him awake.</li>
            <li>Most of the eye masks out there seem to be some sort of pink</li>
            <li>so they block out light around your nose for total darkness.</li>
            <li>My wife has to get up earlier than I do to get reay for work, so the light blinds me almost everday.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment.</li>
            <li>This mask helps so much.</li>
            <li>It depends on how much you move around I guess.</li>
            <li>Like is said before, these things really work.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had this much sleep since I used this eye mask.</li>
            <li>I sleep on my stomach so it doesn&#x27;t move around to much.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s very picky too.  </li>
            <li>so it will fit properly on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>not too much so</li>
            <li>Thank You so much.  </li>
            <li>Not only do the masks block out light</li>
            <li>The only light that comes through is around the nose, which is always an issue regardless of the product.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable to wear and it allows me to open my eyes inside the mask.  </li>
            <li>very comfy.</li>
            <li>It does go away after a few days and its a nice smell anyway.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made from thick and luxuriously soft material, which is great, but I don&#x27;t like how the thickness translates to pressure on my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I have tried nearly a dozen different sleep masks, and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I work the night shift and it is vital that I get my sleep to be able to function properly.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, these wash well, but make sure the adjustible velcro is securely fixed and completely covering itself so that it doesn&#x27;t snag on other articles of clothing or linens in the wash.</li>
            <li>We ordered this pack of eye masks since we both have light blinds to match with our bedroom colors but have trouble sleeping n on weekends due to the sun shinning so brightly in the room.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also not too lightweight yet I did not get hot or sticky (but I live in a semi-arid climate).</li>
            <li>Love these (an the Heros Extreme Earplugs) for flights or for noisy hotels.</li>
            <li>However, I realized that the straps on all three of them (the one I originally bought and the set of two to replace the one I already had) were all different in lengths.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Thankfully I bought two other brands from Amazon when I got these (Dream Essentials and Lewis N. Clark) and they worked much better for me.</li>
            <li>No other masks feel as soft and smooth as this one; even the Sleep Innovation (Sleep Revolution?)</li>
            <li>I love it and would never think of any other one.  </li>
            <li>At first, like other reviews tell, these smell strong.</li>
            <li>It washes easily in the washer - just hang dry.</li>
            <li>I have used this mask for 2 years and I am just now replacing it with a new one due to the elastic finally stretching out and needing a more snug fit.</li>
            <li>I really like the sleep mask because it has just the right amount of fluff to it for comfort over the eyes, and it completely blocks out the light.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is nice-- not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I find that I sleep much better when it&#x27;s dark</li>
            <li>Even when I go to sleep in the middle of the day, with full sunlight, this mask makes it feel like night.</li>
            <li>The strap gets loose, as could be expected, but otherwise a good product.</li>
            <li>so I decided to get a new one!</li>
            <li>We have skylights in our bedroom, so having lots of light when I want to sleep is unavoidable and a major problem for me since I&#x27;m extremely sensitive to light (even the blue light of the DVD player from the next room is enough to annoy me).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and the adjustable elastic strap isn&#x27;t distracting, plus the extra padding at the bottom makes them truly light blocking.</li>
            <li>This was an issue for me with the older version.  </li>
            <li>and I actually think that contributes to me sleeping more deeply.  </li>
            <li>Lavender smell fades quickly, but nothing that some essential oil won&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li>I leave them out of the package for about a week before I actually sleep with them to let them air out; it helps tremendously.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft and gentle to the face and eyes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft and has little \\&quot;pockets\\&quot; under each eye that help block out light more than a flat mask would.</li>
            <li>I have had several in the past and this is the most comfortable I have worn.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Earth</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would highly reccommend this eye mask...</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m surprised, but I&#x27;m going to have to find something pure cotton.</li>
            <li>The velcro strap is extremely short - I can barely fit it around my head on the loosest possible setting (I don&#x27;t have a large head).</li>
            <li>The wide strap fastens with Velcro, so it is infinitely adjustable, as well as comfortable.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to perfumes but the smell didn&#x27;t bug me too much.</li>
            <li>They wash and wear well, very sturdy, yet they remain soft to the face.</li>
            <li>It is still a shiny and smooth fabric, yet also an uncomfortably rough</li>
            <li>Very silky and soft (I know</li>
            <li>I have tried a few and this one is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Subscribe and save is worthwhile if you like it as they do wear out in a few months.</li>
            <li>worth it for the price especially.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using mine for a few months now and absolutely love</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn them in a room with full sunlight coming it and achieved complete visual darkness.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, it protects the sunlight well, it hasn&#x27;t bled or anything even with perspiration-inducing conditions, and the smell was nice and not overwhelming though it went away in a day or two.  </li>
            <li>It is thick, which makes it somewhat warm over your face.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After many tries with various masks, this one is hands down my favorite.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve read many articles recently on the importance of getting adequate sleep for your mental and physical health.  </li>
            <li>I am not super sensitive to this as I know many are.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m not sure how better to describe it -- it&#x27;s like running your skin over tiny closely spaced wires), fabric that is very hot to wear on your face.</li>
            <li>My head is right next to a window in my bedroom</li>
            <li>Finally found the right one.  </li>
            <li>I like it, but it doesn&#x27;t keep all of the light out, and the bands wear out a little fast.</li>
            <li>I will buy these again when I&#x27;m in the market for new masks.</li>
            <li>and I have to purchase new sets because it will not stay on my face.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I bought this for a friend with a new baby.</li>
            <li>Many of them were uncomfortable and didn&#x27;t block out any light.</li>
            <li>Big enough to block the light, but doesn&#x27;t suffocate either.</li>
            <li>It blocks out light better than any other sleep mask I&#x27;ve tried (and I have tried a few!)</li>
            <li>Very soft.</li>
            <li>After that one wash, the scent was gone, and doesn&#x27;t irrtate my very sensitive</li>
            <li>I had only thought it would help with the light - not entirely sure why it&#x27;s helping me sleep more deeply.  </li>
            <li>Washing them inside those bags not only further protects other items but also better protects lint and such from getting on the sleep masks, which is important because they are close to your eyes.</li>
            <li>The mask is absolutely heavenly on the eyes and face, however, it will move during the night and the elastic is horribly cheap, it loses its shape and twists and no amount of ironing can set it straight again, when the elastic gives way the velcro becomes a nightmare.</li>
            <li>This has the exact opposite intended effect.</li>
            <li>I bought these as a backup to the exact same one my husband uses.  </li>
            <li>These have a little puffy lip on the inside that sits right on top of your eyelid, and therefore keep your eyes closed.  </li>
            <li>These really help block out the light when one stays up later than the other.</li>
            <li>i bought some elastic 1/2&amp;#34; and cut the old band and stapled the new one in its place,</li>
            <li>Usually I just wake up long enough to fix it and surprisingly manage to go right back to sleep.</li>
            <li>It is silk, very soft, and has two little pads around the bottom of the eyes to help block light.  </li>
            <li>Although this seemed like a nice mask, it left dark blue marks all over the pillowcases and sheets.</li>
            <li>Another reason it fits so well, and this makes it different than most masks, is that there is a sort of shoulder pad on the bottom half of the mask.  </li>
            <li>The mask shuts out light but is not took tight but sticks to your face.  </li>
            <li>The fit can be adjusted for comfort, they dont have be on tight to work well</li>
            <li>The band is large and I&#x27;ll have to do something to make it smaller.</li>
            <li>The only issue i had was the smell from this (as relaxing as it is) was hard to get over since my nose is right there to smell how strong it can get..</li>
            <li>no dye running onto your bedding (like the Lewis &amp; Clark mask), no allergens sewn in (lavender, etc.), keeps light out (has little &amp;#34;eye pillows&amp;#34</li>
            <li>This mask blocks out almost 100% of the light in my bedroom(except the little bit around the nose).</li>
            <li>I can still see the little light on the TV and DVD player.&lt;br</li>
            <li>He says these are soft and their fluffy nature allows the mask to hug the contours of his face and block out all the light.</li>
            <li>Tag clearly says polyester.</li>
            <li>I use it every night and its so cozy and keeps the light out.</li>
            <li>I am extremely sensitive to scents, but this mask has no offensive scent.</li>
            <li>the sunlight from the window falls directly onto my face.   </li>
            <li>I have been using these for years, and always get them as the old ones give out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this eyemask to anyone needing deeper sleep with complete darkness.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are soft and comfy.</li>
            <li>But if you have sensitive skin or are sensitive to smells it may be a problem for you.</li>
            <li>The mask is made of silk, and thus very slippery on my face and hair, even though the back elastic is not silk.  </li>
            <li>but I was surprised about a couple of things.</li>
            <li>But for now, it&#x27;s switching one thing that wakes me up early in the morning, for another thing that keeps waking me up throughout the night.</li>
            <li>I like how soft these masks are.</li>
            <li>I travel for business frequently</li>
            <li>Does it&#x27;s job and is soft.  </li>
            <li>They are extremely soft, creating comfort not irratation</li>
            <li>Much to my surprise I actually prefer the $1 mask.</li>
            <li>Soft material.</li>
            <li>The silk is soft against your eyes, and not sweaty-feeling like the cheaper synthetic materials.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve never had the issue before &amp; do not have overly sensitive skin)</li>
            <li>They were soft and served the purpose</li>
            <li>but this one is nice and thick with extra coverage over the eye area.</li>
            <li>The new set I bought, which I returned because of this problem, had the straps way too small to fit around my head.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought several different types of masks to find the right one for me.  </li>
            <li>A little light does come through the bottom, but I find by simply moving it down a bit on my nose the light is blocked out.  </li>
            <li>Actually, the Lewis N Clark is pretty comfortable too, but the dye formulation changed a few years ago and it now stains fabric blue, so this is the undisputed king of sleep masks.</li>
            <li>The ratings here are much higher than on the single mask.</li>
            <li>The elastic stretched on the last one but they&#x27;re cheap enough to replace if that happens.</li>
            <li>When I first got it, it was too fluffy and it was really pressing against my eyes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent product overall.  </li>
            <li>For me, the rough part of the velcro is pretty near my ear.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve felt a little irritation on my ears occasionally but can easily adjust it to relieve that.  </li>
            <li>Well, after the first time using the mask I noticed a very faint enjoyable smell, but it wasn&#x27;t excessive, and was more of a \\&quot;new mask\\&quot; smell.</li>
            <li>So I would highly recommend these to anyone who sleeps with their eyes open!  </li>
            <li>I order a new one so it can be fluffy and fresh</li>
            <li>Buy it if you have any trouble waking up early because of light outside.  </li>
            <li>In the summer the light begins to pour in before 5 AM and, being a light sleeper, I would wake up and have a difficult time getting back to sleep afterwards, which eventually, led me to search for a sleep</li>
            <li>The masks are comfortable, but do take a little getting used to the extra heat.</li>
            <li>In addition, when over the bridge of the nose, the nose pushes the pad out just enough to let a little light in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They give out when the elastic at the back gets too stretchy--I suppose I could just replace that, but what with the Velcro tabs, it&#x27;s just easier to buy a new pair.</li>
            <li>I would definitely buy a new one when this one has been used up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nicely padded to block out light but doesn&#x27;t have the annoying \\&quot;roll\\</li>
            <li>I hate trying more brands when a favorite disappears.</li>
            <li>Nothing major</li>
            <li>Now they&#x27;re edging pretty close to $20 for two and the other sellers seem to be going with it.</li>
            <li>These have little flaps of soft material on the inside, which gives your eyes a little more room.</li>
            <li>In terms of pupil pain and undereye bags, we&#x27;re not sure how these would do for longterm use, but they&#x27;re helpful for occasional naps, so we assume they would do fine.</li>
            <li>Too much light makes it hard for me to fall asleep, but with this it helps me fall asleep</li>
            <li>all the other positive reviews it could just be me being too picky</li>
            <li>I am giving it four, only because I suspect that the problem is just something that I am sensitive to.  </li>
            <li>I barely know I am wearing it.  </li>
            <li>have to give that a try before I completely give these up and go with something different.</li>
            <li>The mask itself covers my eyes completely and is thick enough that I could sleep with a light on and not know it.</li>
            <li>BUT considering I have been using a thin non-adjustable $1 mask I didn&#x27;t have many preconceived notions.</li>
            <li>It has to be pulled down lower on my nose to completely block out the light, which is a bit irritating at first, but once I&#x27;m asleep</li>
            <li>When one of us needs to get rest during daylight hours, we&#x27;ve found these adjustible, large, soft and fluffy masks to be helpful.</li>
            <li>Unlike other eye masks they are light weight enough to not cause me any discomfort while I sleep (I don&#x27;t like how some other masks put pressure on my eyes).</li>
            <li>sleep better with these on, especially since i work late into the night and get up long after daylight.</li>
            <li>There is a definite difference between the higher quality ones like these versus the plain old ones.</li>
            <li>Price wars usually push prices down, but it looks like this item has been put into a race to the top rather than a race to the bottom by the (non-Amazon) sellers.</li>
            <li>And it did smell a little when first opened, but that went away after a day or two.</li>
            <li>I actually forgot that it originally was scented, because I&#x27;ve had it a few months and the smell is long gone, so</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased to have two masks in case one gets lost or dirty.</li>
            <li>The shape contours over my eyes and nose, so it is really truly dark.  </li>
            <li>Have thrown it in the washing machine a few times now (not the dryer) and it has held up pretty well.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that I get a little hot on my face.</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to odors, like I am, I highly recommend washing the masks a few times before using them.</li>
            <li>I have a pretty big head, and I have to go all the way to the end of the velcro on each strap to make it tight enough</li>
            <li>Better than them smelling bad ;-)</li>
            <li>I absolutely wore my previous Earth Therapeutics sleep mask out -</li>
            <li>(in other words, the straps are pretty long!!)  </li>
            <li>I get a little bit of light seeping in down at the bottom, but then again I have an Italian nose which may lift it a bit.  </li>
            <li>The adjustable strap is only slightly adjustable meaning there isn&#x27;t much wiggle room between the two pieces of velcro to make adjustments.   </li>
            <li>however faint or strong, or however natural or chemical that smell might be.</li>

            <li> It keeps the light out while I&#x27;m sleeping, even on a bright day.  </li>
            <li> This has been my favorite and the 2 pack deal allows my husband and I to have our own.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable to wear and the adjustable strap is good for any size head.</li>
            <li> Comfy, light weight, fairly long-lasting, have ordered before, will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> They do a good job of blocking the light.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s very happy they are not pink.</li>
            <li> The mask is also very comfortable and the head strap can be adjusted to your desired tightness.  </li>
            <li> This one is very comfortable,</li>
            <li> They wear it every night and find the mask to be very comfortable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn these in the middle of the afternoon, or with the room light on just to see how great they are at blocking out light, and they are wonderful!</li>
            <li> The mask is very comfortable and adjustable.  </li>
            <li> Very comfortable head strap with velcro adjustment.  </li>
            <li> Adjustable strap, very comfortable.  </li>
            <li> bought the two pack this one fit&#x27;s much better!</li>
            <li> It feels great against my skin for hours, and the elastic band is super comfortable and adjustable.</li>
            <li> They work great, are very soft and not noticeable on the eyes and have a nice design on them.</li>
            <li> The masks are soft and provide very good coverage for my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I can even fit my eye gel coolers into slots in the mask!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re both sleeping better now...</li>
            <li> so glad I found these.</li>
            <li> I bought my sleeping masks because I started working nights at my job and could never manage to sleep more than a couple of hours at a time during the day.</li>
            <li> Once adjusted it stays on most of the time.</li>
            <li> It needs to be more adjustable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really love this eye mask.</li>
            <li> It is lightweight and has a soft filling, which is as light as the best goosedown.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much better than the Lewis &amp; Clark mask, for the reason that the dye does not come off on your bedding like the L&amp;C mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m now ordering a couple of 2-packs to be sure I don&#x27;t run out of this mask.  </li>
            <li> Love the flaps under the eye that keeps mask away from makeup.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> A+, love it.</li>
            <li> Both have informed me that they love it(especially the velgro straps, instead of elastic).  </li>
            <li> I have NEVER sleep better than with this mask.</li>
            <li> and I love the adjustable velcro band.</li>
            <li> , however I love it still :)</li>
            <li> but the do block most of it</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure most people will not notice.</li>
            <li> It conforms to my facial features perfectly!</li>
            <li> I am 100% satisfied with this mask.</li>
            <li> IT BLOCKS OUT ALL LIGHT!</li>
            <li> just the way I like to sleep. :)</li>
            <li> but she said that many products have had that before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found these on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I really love these things.</li>
            <li> I have tried others but like this one the best for completely blocking out light.</li>
            <li> and this one is the best, so I&#x27;m on my 3rd one now in probably 7-10 years.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to upgrade to something better.</li>
            <li> Your mileage may vary. :)</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why some seem scented and some aren&#x27;t, but I am 100% pleased with the masks I received.  </li>
            <li> 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li> My husband and I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> Makes the night more restfull.</li>
            <li> They are great for keeping out lights from the bedroom or street when I&#x27;m ready to sleep.</li>
            <li> Wonderful soft mask to help you block out light.  </li>
            <li> She&#x27;s suggested that maybe she can try taking these apart and using the straps and cotton parts and making better cotton-sock eye-covers.</li>
            <li> Totally satisfied with purchase.  </li>
            <li> They fit nicely on the face and feel soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I travel 50% of the time and love these for air travel and for the hotel.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many brands and find these the best.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li> I am glad that I found this sleep mask.</li>
            <li> I wear a sleep mask every night and these are my favorite.  </li>
            <li> This mask USED TO be my all time favorite sleep mask.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for this sleep mask for a while and am so glad I found it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering more as presents for friends.</li>
            <li> I was able to get rid of the odor after washing them though.</li>
            <li> but I LOVE lavender</li>
            <li> But all in all I love it.  </li>
            <li> I love this mask.</li>
            <li> These work to keep the light out, but I don&#x27;t find sleeping in them very easy.</li>
            <li> I really like this mask, it does a good job of keeping the light out if adjusted right and is cushioned for great comfort.</li>
            <li> Nice and soft on face and does a great job blocking out light.</li>
            <li> It is neither too warm nor too cool when wearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pretty good sleep masks for the price.  </li>
            <li> so you can actually use it as a man lol just kidding, but it is nice.</li>
            <li> (they&#x27;re adjustable), they don&#x27;t move and most importantly - they keep the light out!  </li>
            <li> This mask is very comfortable, and keeps the light out well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light, breathable, comfortable, and the strap stays on well.  </li>
            <li> I have found these masks to be very comfortable and block out the light well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light and comfortable</li>
            <li> It keeps all of the light out, it is very comfortable, I never have creases on my face from the mask</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m thrilled to get two more at such a good price.</li>
            <li> ,It don&#x27;t keep all the light out,but better then nothing.</li>
            <li> This is a great mask, soft, and comfy.</li>
            <li> but they are well made and comfortable -- much better than hiding your eyes under your arm.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After scouring the internet for a great deal on a sleeping mask that would be both comfortable, and effective at blocking out light, I finally found these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It just had a hint of \\&quot;pleasant new mask\\&quot; but that faded over time.</li>
            <li> was easy..</li>
            <li> They are easily adjustable.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t like them, but also because I think a more moderate rating would get this lost among rating of people who are happy with the item.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Light weight, and easy to put</li>
            <li> /&gt;The elastic band that holds the mask on is easy to adjust and fastens with a piece of Velcro.</li>
            <li> Silk charmeuse is the ideal fabric, neither heavy nor too warm.</li>
            <li> Feels good, and i really like the light lavender scent.</li>
            <li> The silk fabric of this mask is cool and soft, with nice padding and a good shape to block out all the light.</li>
            <li> Other than that love this product!!!</li>
            <li> This fits perfectly to cover my eyes at night and since its dark in color it helps to block out any excess light..</li>
            <li> Service was fine.</li>
            <li> Even better, it came with two, so one can stay in the bedroom and one downstairs for those quick daylight naps....</li>
            <li> This mask is soft, easy to use &amp; blocks a good deal of light.  </li>
            <li> this is by far the best i have used so far.</li>
            <li> Once the light comes through the window, I reach for a mask to block the light.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s blocks out all light , and fits comfortably around my he.ad</li>
            <li> They have changed my life and now I sleep through the night without any light bothering me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , now they can get their light</li>
            <li> It rests comfortably over the eyes and blocks out the light.  </li>
            <li> blocks about 99 % of the light</li>
            <li> I got really really light headed..</li>
            <li> It helps to keep the light out.  </li>
            <li> They clean easily by throwing them in the washer with a load of laundry.</li>
            <li> He said that he can&#x27;t sleep with one but after trying mine he wants one of his own.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using one for several months, and I&#x27;m so happy with it</li>
            <li> For the men just a comfortable mask.</li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t feel comfortable wearing this because the band bothers my head.</li>
            <li> The don&#x27;t block all of the light</li>
            <li> Comfortable around the eyes.  </li>
            <li> I found it quite comfortable.</li>
            <li> They stay put and block out light.</li>
            <li> Some light does seep through the bottom</li>
            <li> In any case, when there&#x27;s too much light in the room, this mask does the trick for me</li>
            <li> I gave these five stars because the met all my personal criteria for a great sleeping mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It blocks out all the light from windows, alarm clocks, tv and phones.  </li>
            <li> They are adjustable and will fit anyone.  </li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t all too comfortable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this is just a really comfortable, lightweight mask.</li>
            <li> Does a great job at blocking light but is light enough to forget it is there.  </li>
            <li> I have been using a cheap $1 mask given to me in a gift bag.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t block out the light at the bottom by your nose.</li>
            <li> This mask stays on securely, doesn&#x27;t stain fabric, and feels like a pillow for your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so comfortable on my head with the adjustable strap, and the fabric is silky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experenced on others, which allows me to sleep comfortably in my sides.</li>
            <li> It does not let any light in and unlike others is does not bother my ears.</li>
            <li> Of course said, &amp;#34;no, you keep it and enjoy it&amp;#34;, I can get another one.</li>
            <li> I think it will get the job done, for blocking out light when traveling.</li>
            <li> This one blocks the light and is comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> They fit snugly, but</li>
            <li> It blocks out the light well and is cushioned against my eyes.</li>
            <li> The mask is amazingly comfortable.</li>
            <li> I like how the flaps at the lower portion of the eye mask shade out light from shining in by my nose.  </li>
            <li> I have worked nights for twenty years, sleep days and have been looking for a mask that keeps out the light.  </li>
            <li> block light and not cut the ears..</li>
            <li> has added pouches on the inside that block light from coming in around the nose</li>
            <li> It has a nice silky soft feel and is more padded than others I have used.  </li>
            <li> It can cover the eyes completely and it feels good on the eyes.</li>
            <li> Extremely comfortable--I have found no rival--and they do a great job of blocking light while fitting comfortably around the nose.</li>
            <li> I am able to go right to sleep and stay asleep until I have to hit the snooze button.</li>
            <li> It does a good job of blocking light if you arrange it properly, but it does slip easily if you turn to your side.</li>
            <li> I sleep much better in the morning now that I can block that first light.</li>
            <li> , I highly recommend it, if you are looking for a good sleepmask this is the right one</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not fancy (super silky or padded) but it blocks light and is so light weight that it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all when I sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great eye-masks, totally blocks out light and is comfortable right out of the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well Worth it!</li>
            <li> Also this is a mask that puts significant pressure on the eyes.  </li>
            <li> I originally bought this in a store and was devastated when I lost it and the store no longer carried them.</li>
            <li> I first bought these sleep masks at BB&amp;B (for lots more money).</li>
            <li> Not only do I not wake up with the sun in the morning, but I fall asleep better and sleep more soundly!  </li>
            <li> , it was an easy way to discover if it is worth it.  </li>
            <li> For &amp;#34;doubling&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve found that using a heavier bulkier mask on the outside seems to work more effectively.</li>
            <li> This sleep mask is super comfortable to sleep in.</li>
            <li> Love this it really blocks the light, so I can sleep while my husband reads.</li>
            <li> It keeps light out as it&#x27;s supposed to do, but the strap really cuts into the top of the ear</li>
            <li> The mask if very comfortable, otherwise, and cushions my eyes very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> sleep mask has just the right amount of thickness to it and is easy to use and adjust.</li>
            <li> I have a little more difficulty getting it to block all the light as well as this one, but it could be more attractive for larger faces or folks that are bothered by having something constantly touching their eyes like this one does.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, they are fine and I still gave 4 stars because I&#x27;m sure most people won&#x27;t be as critical as I am being.</li>
            <li> The padding under your eyes really help and for a day sleeper that is huge!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I am light sleeper and the first light or noise I hear will wake me up</li>
            <li> They smell nice, they&#x27;re comfortable and they are not PINK.</li>
            <li> Thick and sofe material make me perfect circumstance when I want to sleep.</li>
            <li> Someone mentioned the aromatherapy smell in their review being too much, however, I quite enjoyed it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now looking to order more, just to have on hand when this one is ready to be replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The silk is nothing like my nice soft silk shirts.</li>
            <li> Mystery as to why they give me a headache, but they&#x27;ve enough good reviews that it can&#x27;t be common.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks :)</li>
            <li> Overall good purchase.</li>
            <li> I really like these, but lacking the contour that many of the others have.</li>
            <li> from all that discomfort stuff, it works and it&#x27;s good enough for now.</li>
            <li> The only con is that in the summer it can get a bit warm and make me sweat, but I sweat easily.  </li>
            <li> smooth silky, very comfortable to wear, covers your eyes completely</li>
            <li> They both said although they had a strong fragrance out of the box, it disappeared pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> The Earth Therapeutics Sleep Mask has worked exceptionally well for me for several years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Secondly, it really  doesn&#x27;t block out the light too well, the light comes in from the bottom  area.</li>
            <li> They wash well - in the sink with mild (ivory) dish detergent</li>
            <li> What I like about this mask is that it is both comfortable and form fitting (goes around the nose to block noise and has a soft fabric that adjusts to the face).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I like it better than the older heavier one.  </li>
            <li> The mask blocks out the light very well, and is well-fitted around the nose, where light likes to seep in...</li>
            <li> The fragrance dissipated quickly.</li>
            <li> Since light pouring through a window wakes me, this product is very appreciated</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 more and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable, even in the heat of the tropics, where I live.</li>
            <li> This smells funny and seems cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I bought this during the heat of a hot summer and it has blocked plenty of the light without leaving me feeling smothered (like the Louis and Clark mask).  </li>
            <li> I just bought two more of these as my other two seem to have walked off on their own.  </li>
            <li> This is the most comfortable sleeping mask I have (its better than my other five, including a memory foam mask).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please be aware that the straps you may get may vary in size!</li>
            <li> I have chronic migraines and this mask is soft and keeps light out easily.</li>
            <li> The adjustable velcro strap is great because the mask isn&#x27;t too tight around my head.</li>
            <li> It has a mild scent right out of the box, but isn&#x27;t noxious.</li>
            <li> mask itself, however is very soft and comfortable over the eyes but the second issues is that the eye pads don&#x27;t quite conform to my eye sockets providing a good seal.</li>
            <li> I have a large, bulky sleep mask that I love, but in the summer or with hot flashes, or if need it in my purse for travel, it is to hot and bulky.  </li>
            <li> The side straps could be a little more comfortable, however, that is the downfall of most masks.</li>
            <li> They also tend not to block the light out very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In light of (haha)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it to me.</li>
            <li> This 2 pack is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> but well worth it.</li>
            <li> I give this product 5 stars because it has an adjustable strap at the back which makes it more comfortable to wear.  </li>
            <li> Besides being comfortable, soft, and free of bad/strong/etc odors?</li>
            <li> you like the really slick-abrasive feeling fabrics like cheap silks or cheap satins, and if you don&#x27;t have any issue with the polyester in these, I can&#x27;t really see a problem with them.</li>
            <li> There are two in the pack, though, which is nice, but it had to go back.</li>
            <li> I really like this sleep mask, and I really want to like it better than I</li>
            <li> I love this soft, silky sleep mask.</li>
            <li> It stores easy, keeps it dark for me, and is soft and works great.</li>
            <li> So I go through these pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> They also said it stays on pretty well during the night and is soft and very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Price is right</li>
            <li> just right and sintch up the elastic</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a minty/lavender scent to it right out of the package, but if you leave them out to air, it goes away almost immediately.</li>
            <li> Most of those reviews are pretty old if you note that.</li>
            <li> They block the light very well and they are very soft and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> They could probably benefit from being a bit larger, but they&#x27;re &#x27;pillowy&#x27;-enough (for lack of a better word) to block out most of the light and fill in the gaps around the edges.</li>
            <li> I bought this mask when I was a new mom and needed to fall asleep quickly while my baby slept - can&#x27;t imagine sleeping without one now!</li>
            <li> Wide strap makes it very comfortable and secure.</li>
            <li> Keeps out the morning light or the light when we wake up at different times.</li>
            <li> There is a pleasant aroma when opening the mask, it goes away after using it a few times.</li>
            <li> Very soft and comfortable although scentless would be preferable.</li>
            <li> Incredibly soft and love the extra little pillowy bit at the bottom; super effective in keeping light out!</li>
            <li> I am able to go right back to sleep.  </li>
            <li> They survive the washing machine just fine, though the lovely smell fades after the first washing, and eventually the elastic stretches out and gets loose to the point where the mask doesn&#x27;t stay on very well and must be replaced.</li>
            <li> Soft material, with ajustable strap lets it fit your face well.</li>
            <li> If you want a soft, cushiony sleep mask that doesn&#x27;t let any light in - this is the answer.</li>
            <li> It does cover and block out light completely for the amount of time it stays on.  </li>
            <li> My bedroom allows far too much light in the morning</li>
            <li> /&gt;In conclusion, the Earth Therapeutics are not any better than generic sleep masks given to you on airlines.</li>
            <li> First, I don&#x27;t like satin on my face.</li>
            <li> I have issues with sleeping and have tried many different types of sleep masks.  </li>
            <li> Like with anything that touches your skin, you should wash this first before you use it in order to remove manufacturing residue.</li>
            <li> i am much happier and well rested!  </li>
            <li> If you want to try them first, go to bed, bath and beyond.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used mine 4x so far while I&#x27;ve napped during the day and it blocks out all light.</li>
            <li> The mask is soft and comfortable and is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this mask, the Lewis N Clark, and the one that wraps around you entire head, but so far this has been the most comfortable.</li>
            <li> I remember paying under $10 for two of them the first time I bought this.</li>
            <li> and I shared the second of the set with my night-shift working daughter, as I felt it might help her get more rest during the day as well.  </li>
            <li> I used it for the first time this morning when the sun came blasting through the window and it didn&#x27;t slide around</li>
            <li> , it helps me fall asleep faster and into a deep sleep, I love it.</li>
            <li> The silky material helps it to not be hot and sweaty.</li>
            <li> So I ordered a whole pack!</li>
            <li> They are smooth and soft and</li>
            <li> The mask is soft and padded and blocks the light exceedingly well.</li>
            <li> wife has previously made some passable eye-covers out of cotton socks that we both can wear -- and I find significantly more comfortable.</li>
            <li> Nothing special, but it is very soft.</li>
            <li> This would probably be fine for most people, but I have trouble already, breathing through my nose when asleep</li>
            <li> It was well made, blocked the light really well, and the materials were so soft.</li>
            <li> When I first got it and wore it, I became very congested within 15-30 min.</li>
            <li> When it is in place, it does keep the room nice and dark</li>
            <li> Ii think this might be too small for a man&#x27;s face--but it is a good product</li>
            <li> It was SUPER soft, and the mask is also adjustable.</li>
            <li> The only thing that should be noted that was not mentioned by the manufacturer is that there is a strong lavender smell on the mask.</li>
            <li> , it is only strong a day or so...</li>
            <li> Large enough to hug your face and block out light.  </li>
            <li> It really helps, especially since my kids like the hall light on at nite</li>
            <li> The blinds in my rental apartment do not block out light very well, and so I&#x27;ve been looking for something that could help since I can&#x27;t install proper drapes.</li>
            <li> A much more cost effective option than buying expensive window treatments to block out the streetlight in my NYC apartment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You get 2 eye masks and they are high quality!</li>
            <li> And with the Amazon ready to ship packaging, opening and using it</li>
            <li> i was looking at the price and was like there is no way for 8 bucks i would like this thing so much, and bought another sleep mask.</li>
            <li> but since that happened i guess it worked since it got light enough</li>
            <li> and sometimes I don&#x27;t sleep very well at night.</li>
            <li> The smell actually wore off after the first two times of using it but the best part is i can nap in the middle of the day and see no light because the way its designed!</li>
            <li> The strap is sturdy enough that it doesn&#x27;t stretch out and lose the snug fit around my head.</li>
            <li> I sleep with a cpap machine, and this mask is flexible enough that I can work it around to work with the cpap mask and still keep the light out.  </li>
            <li> I think everybody can enjoy deep sleep with this.</li>
            <li> It works, but I don&#x27;t use it as much as O thought I would have.</li>
            <li> Comfortable and versatile as for a while my husband (larger head)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really comfy, and doesn&#x27;t feel oppressive or bothersome.</li>
            <li> wear my mask, and it really helps me fall asleep.</li>
            <li> If you wake in the 3 a.m. to 4 a.m. range and lay in bedding watching the clock this mask will really help.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s ready to go again.  </li>
            <li> I buy these for my husband since I like to stay up later than him and the light from my reading lamp or the TV keeps him awake.</li>
            <li> Most of the eye masks out there seem to be some sort of pink</li>
            <li> so they block out light around your nose for total darkness.</li>
            <li> My wife has to get up earlier than I do to get reay for work, so the light blinds me almost everday.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment.</li>
            <li> This mask helps so much.</li>
            <li> It depends on how much you move around I guess.</li>
            <li> Like is said before, these things really work.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this much sleep since I used this eye mask.</li>
            <li> I sleep on my stomach so it doesn&#x27;t move around to much.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s very picky too.  </li>
            <li> so it will fit properly on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> not too much so</li>
            <li> Thank You so much.  </li>
            <li> Not only do the masks block out light</li>
            <li> The only light that comes through is around the nose, which is always an issue regardless of the product.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable to wear and it allows me to open my eyes inside the mask.  </li>
            <li> very comfy.</li>
            <li> It does go away after a few days and its a nice smell anyway.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made from thick and luxuriously soft material, which is great, but I don&#x27;t like how the thickness translates to pressure on my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I have tried nearly a dozen different sleep masks, and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I work the night shift and it is vital that I get my sleep to be able to function properly.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, these wash well, but make sure the adjustible velcro is securely fixed and completely covering itself so that it doesn&#x27;t snag on other articles of clothing or linens in the wash.</li>
            <li> We ordered this pack of eye masks since we both have light blinds to match with our bedroom colors but have trouble sleeping n on weekends due to the sun shinning so brightly in the room.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also not too lightweight yet I did not get hot or sticky (but I live in a semi-arid climate).</li>
            <li> Love these (an the Heros Extreme Earplugs) for flights or for noisy hotels.</li>
            <li> However, I realized that the straps on all three of them (the one I originally bought and the set of two to replace the one I already had) were all different in lengths.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Thankfully I bought two other brands from Amazon when I got these (Dream Essentials and Lewis N. Clark) and they worked much better for me.</li>
            <li> No other masks feel as soft and smooth as this one; even the Sleep Innovation (Sleep Revolution?)</li>
            <li> I love it and would never think of any other one.  </li>
            <li> At first, like other reviews tell, these smell strong.</li>
            <li> It washes easily in the washer - just hang dry.</li>
            <li> I have used this mask for 2 years and I am just now replacing it with a new one due to the elastic finally stretching out and needing a more snug fit.</li>
            <li> I really like the sleep mask because it has just the right amount of fluff to it for comfort over the eyes, and it completely blocks out the light.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is nice-- not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I find that I sleep much better when it&#x27;s dark</li>
            <li> Even when I go to sleep in the middle of the day, with full sunlight, this mask makes it feel like night.</li>
            <li> The strap gets loose, as could be expected, but otherwise a good product.</li>
            <li> so I decided to get a new one!</li>
            <li> We have skylights in our bedroom, so having lots of light when I want to sleep is unavoidable and a major problem for me since I&#x27;m extremely sensitive to light (even the blue light of the DVD player from the next room is enough to annoy me).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and the adjustable elastic strap isn&#x27;t distracting, plus the extra padding at the bottom makes them truly light blocking.</li>
            <li> This was an issue for me with the older version.  </li>
            <li> and I actually think that contributes to me sleeping more deeply.  </li>
            <li> Lavender smell fades quickly, but nothing that some essential oil won&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> I leave them out of the package for about a week before I actually sleep with them to let them air out; it helps tremendously.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft and gentle to the face and eyes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft and has little \\&quot;pockets\\&quot; under each eye that help block out light more than a flat mask would.</li>
            <li> I have had several in the past and this is the most comfortable I have worn.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Earth</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would highly reccommend this eye mask...</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m surprised, but I&#x27;m going to have to find something pure cotton.</li>
            <li> The velcro strap is extremely short - I can barely fit it around my head on the loosest possible setting (I don&#x27;t have a large head).</li>
            <li> The wide strap fastens with Velcro, so it is infinitely adjustable, as well as comfortable.</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to perfumes but the smell didn&#x27;t bug me too much.</li>
            <li> They wash and wear well, very sturdy, yet they remain soft to the face.</li>
            <li> It is still a shiny and smooth fabric, yet also an uncomfortably rough</li>
            <li> Very silky and soft (I know</li>
            <li> I have tried a few and this one is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Subscribe and save is worthwhile if you like it as they do wear out in a few months.</li>
            <li> worth it for the price especially.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using mine for a few months now and absolutely love</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn them in a room with full sunlight coming it and achieved complete visual darkness.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, it protects the sunlight well, it hasn&#x27;t bled or anything even with perspiration-inducing conditions, and the smell was nice and not overwhelming though it went away in a day or two.  </li>
            <li> It is thick, which makes it somewhat warm over your face.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After many tries with various masks, this one is hands down my favorite.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve read many articles recently on the importance of getting adequate sleep for your mental and physical health.  </li>
            <li> I am not super sensitive to this as I know many are.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m not sure how better to describe it -- it&#x27;s like running your skin over tiny closely spaced wires), fabric that is very hot to wear on your face.</li>
            <li> My head is right next to a window in my bedroom</li>
            <li> Finally found the right one.  </li>
            <li> I like it, but it doesn&#x27;t keep all of the light out, and the bands wear out a little fast.</li>
            <li> I will buy these again when I&#x27;m in the market for new masks.</li>
            <li> and I have to purchase new sets because it will not stay on my face.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend with a new baby.</li>
            <li> Many of them were uncomfortable and didn&#x27;t block out any light.</li>
            <li> Big enough to block the light, but doesn&#x27;t suffocate either.</li>
            <li> It blocks out light better than any other sleep mask I&#x27;ve tried (and I have tried a few!)</li>
            <li> Very soft.</li>
            <li> After that one wash, the scent was gone, and doesn&#x27;t irrtate my very sensitive</li>
            <li> I had only thought it would help with the light - not entirely sure why it&#x27;s helping me sleep more deeply.  </li>
            <li> Washing them inside those bags not only further protects other items but also better protects lint and such from getting on the sleep masks, which is important because they are close to your eyes.</li>
            <li> The mask is absolutely heavenly on the eyes and face, however, it will move during the night and the elastic is horribly cheap, it loses its shape and twists and no amount of ironing can set it straight again, when the elastic gives way the velcro becomes a nightmare.</li>
            <li> This has the exact opposite intended effect.</li>
            <li> I bought these as a backup to the exact same one my husband uses.  </li>
            <li> These have a little puffy lip on the inside that sits right on top of your eyelid, and therefore keep your eyes closed.  </li>
            <li> These really help block out the light when one stays up later than the other.</li>
            <li> i bought some elastic 1/2&amp;#34; and cut the old band and stapled the new one in its place,</li>
            <li> Usually I just wake up long enough to fix it and surprisingly manage to go right back to sleep.</li>
            <li> It is silk, very soft, and has two little pads around the bottom of the eyes to help block light.  </li>
            <li> Although this seemed like a nice mask, it left dark blue marks all over the pillowcases and sheets.</li>
            <li> Another reason it fits so well, and this makes it different than most masks, is that there is a sort of shoulder pad on the bottom half of the mask.  </li>
            <li> The mask shuts out light but is not took tight but sticks to your face.  </li>
            <li> The fit can be adjusted for comfort, they dont have be on tight to work well</li>
            <li> The band is large and I&#x27;ll have to do something to make it smaller.</li>
            <li> The only issue i had was the smell from this (as relaxing as it is) was hard to get over since my nose is right there to smell how strong it can get..</li>
            <li> no dye running onto your bedding (like the Lewis &amp; Clark mask), no allergens sewn in (lavender, etc.), keeps light out (has little &amp;#34;eye pillows&amp;#34</li>
            <li> This mask blocks out almost 100% of the light in my bedroom(except the little bit around the nose).</li>
            <li> I can still see the little light on the TV and DVD player.&lt;br</li>
            <li> He says these are soft and their fluffy nature allows the mask to hug the contours of his face and block out all the light.</li>
            <li> Tag clearly says polyester.</li>
            <li> I use it every night and its so cozy and keeps the light out.</li>
            <li> I am extremely sensitive to scents, but this mask has no offensive scent.</li>
            <li> the sunlight from the window falls directly onto my face.   </li>
            <li> I have been using these for years, and always get them as the old ones give out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this eyemask to anyone needing deeper sleep with complete darkness.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are soft and comfy.</li>
            <li> But if you have sensitive skin or are sensitive to smells it may be a problem for you.</li>
            <li> The mask is made of silk, and thus very slippery on my face and hair, even though the back elastic is not silk.  </li>
            <li> but I was surprised about a couple of things.</li>
            <li> But for now, it&#x27;s switching one thing that wakes me up early in the morning, for another thing that keeps waking me up throughout the night.</li>
            <li> I like how soft these masks are.</li>
            <li> I travel for business frequently</li>
            <li> Does it&#x27;s job and is soft.  </li>
            <li> They are extremely soft, creating comfort not irratation</li>
            <li> Much to my surprise I actually prefer the $1 mask.</li>
            <li> Soft material.</li>
            <li> The silk is soft against your eyes, and not sweaty-feeling like the cheaper synthetic materials.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve never had the issue before &amp; do not have overly sensitive skin)</li>
            <li> They were soft and served the purpose</li>
            <li> but this one is nice and thick with extra coverage over the eye area.</li>
            <li> The new set I bought, which I returned because of this problem, had the straps way too small to fit around my head.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought several different types of masks to find the right one for me.  </li>
            <li> A little light does come through the bottom, but I find by simply moving it down a bit on my nose the light is blocked out.  </li>
            <li> Actually, the Lewis N Clark is pretty comfortable too, but the dye formulation changed a few years ago and it now stains fabric blue, so this is the undisputed king of sleep masks.</li>
            <li> The ratings here are much higher than on the single mask.</li>
            <li> The elastic stretched on the last one but they&#x27;re cheap enough to replace if that happens.</li>
            <li> When I first got it, it was too fluffy and it was really pressing against my eyes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent product overall.  </li>
            <li> For me, the rough part of the velcro is pretty near my ear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve felt a little irritation on my ears occasionally but can easily adjust it to relieve that.  </li>
            <li> Well, after the first time using the mask I noticed a very faint enjoyable smell, but it wasn&#x27;t excessive, and was more of a \\&quot;new mask\\&quot; smell.</li>
            <li> So I would highly recommend these to anyone who sleeps with their eyes open!  </li>
            <li> I order a new one so it can be fluffy and fresh</li>
            <li> Buy it if you have any trouble waking up early because of light outside.  </li>
            <li> In the summer the light begins to pour in before 5 AM and, being a light sleeper, I would wake up and have a difficult time getting back to sleep afterwards, which eventually, led me to search for a sleep</li>
            <li> The masks are comfortable, but do take a little getting used to the extra heat.</li>
            <li> In addition, when over the bridge of the nose, the nose pushes the pad out just enough to let a little light in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They give out when the elastic at the back gets too stretchy--I suppose I could just replace that, but what with the Velcro tabs, it&#x27;s just easier to buy a new pair.</li>
            <li> I would definitely buy a new one when this one has been used up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nicely padded to block out light but doesn&#x27;t have the annoying \\&quot;roll\\</li>
            <li> I hate trying more brands when a favorite disappears.</li>
            <li> Nothing major</li>
            <li> Now they&#x27;re edging pretty close to $20 for two and the other sellers seem to be going with it.</li>
            <li> These have little flaps of soft material on the inside, which gives your eyes a little more room.</li>
            <li> In terms of pupil pain and undereye bags, we&#x27;re not sure how these would do for longterm use, but they&#x27;re helpful for occasional naps, so we assume they would do fine.</li>
            <li> Too much light makes it hard for me to fall asleep, but with this it helps me fall asleep</li>
            <li> all the other positive reviews it could just be me being too picky</li>
            <li> I am giving it four, only because I suspect that the problem is just something that I am sensitive to.  </li>
            <li> I barely know I am wearing it.  </li>
            <li> have to give that a try before I completely give these up and go with something different.</li>
            <li> The mask itself covers my eyes completely and is thick enough that I could sleep with a light on and not know it.</li>
            <li> BUT considering I have been using a thin non-adjustable $1 mask I didn&#x27;t have many preconceived notions.</li>
            <li> It has to be pulled down lower on my nose to completely block out the light, which is a bit irritating at first, but once I&#x27;m asleep</li>
            <li> When one of us needs to get rest during daylight hours, we&#x27;ve found these adjustible, large, soft and fluffy masks to be helpful.</li>
            <li> Unlike other eye masks they are light weight enough to not cause me any discomfort while I sleep (I don&#x27;t like how some other masks put pressure on my eyes).</li>
            <li> sleep better with these on, especially since i work late into the night and get up long after daylight.</li>
            <li> There is a definite difference between the higher quality ones like these versus the plain old ones.</li>
            <li> Price wars usually push prices down, but it looks like this item has been put into a race to the top rather than a race to the bottom by the (non-Amazon) sellers.</li>
            <li> And it did smell a little when first opened, but that went away after a day or two.</li>
            <li> I actually forgot that it originally was scented, because I&#x27;ve had it a few months and the smell is long gone, so</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very pleased to have two masks in case one gets lost or dirty.</li>
            <li> The shape contours over my eyes and nose, so it is really truly dark.  </li>
            <li> Have thrown it in the washing machine a few times now (not the dryer) and it has held up pretty well.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that I get a little hot on my face.</li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to odors, like I am, I highly recommend washing the masks a few times before using them.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty big head, and I have to go all the way to the end of the velcro on each strap to make it tight enough</li>
            <li> Better than them smelling bad ;-)</li>
            <li> I absolutely wore my previous Earth Therapeutics sleep mask out -</li>
            <li> (in other words, the straps are pretty long!!)  </li>
            <li> I get a little bit of light seeping in down at the bottom, but then again I have an Italian nose which may lift it a bit.  </li>
            <li> The adjustable strap is only slightly adjustable meaning there isn&#x27;t much wiggle room between the two pieces of velcro to make adjustments.   </li>
            <li> however faint or strong, or however natural or chemical that smell might be.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft on the face with just the right pressure, the strapping can be positioned awkward but doesn&#x27;t interfere much with my sleep.</li>
            <li> When I put this sleeping mask on its so dark you can&#x27;t see anything it takes getting use to, but it&#x27;s very soft against your skin with the cotton, and silk texture material.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would recommend washing the mask in a gentle cycle and in a net laundry bag, usually used for lingerie or fragile fabrics.</li>
            <li> But these masks really don&#x27;t smell strong or bad at all, and I especially appreciate that</li>
            <li> Secondly, I have several generic sleep masks from American Airlines that will be used as a comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Earth Therapeutics sleep mask keep slipping off my face as I twist and turn.</li>
            <li> It is made of soft silk charmeuse in a dark color.</li>
            <li> Soft and dark, just the way I like it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Everything is soft &amp; dark underneath these babies...</li>
            <li> These are soft and dark.</li>
            <li> The pad is flat and faces are not.</li>
            <li> They last a long time.</li>
            <li> The only problem with the elastic band is that over time it becomes stretched out, but thankfully the Velcro will stick anywhere on the elastic</li>
            <li> When new, these have a strong, unpleasant odor.  </li>
            <li> Idk, writing this I knocked it down from 4 to 3, just because given the price you can get slightly less soft and maybe a little less light blocking products for a heck of a lot cheaper.  </li>
            <li> The new item scent which comes when the pack is opened disappears in a few hours, so do not worry about it.    </li>
            <li> Most other brands are usually very small and tight.  </li>
            <li> They last a very long time but eventually, as with all things, they wear out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve hand-washed it numerous times now, then let it air dry</li>
            <li> Unless you have them completely overlapping (ie as small as possible) or have short hair, your hair will get stuck in the velcro.  </li>
            <li> It does slide to the side or off my head occasionally, but I prefer to keep the band loose.  </li>
            <li> The eye-hook fastener was at first annoying, but once the adjustment was just right for my head I had no trouble sleeping with it</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re soft and silky, the headband is adjustable, and there are these little folds around the nose area that you pop out</li>
            <li> They are soft and very dark.  </li>
            <li> This mask makes it much easier to catch some zzz&#x27;s in the late morning even with the summer sun.    </li>
            <li> The adjustable velcro-elastic band holds the mask securely in place without being uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> The elastic band does get stretched out after a while</li>
            <li> : Silk charmeuse has long been used for luxury lingerie and can be washed.  </li>
            <li> The straps dig into the tops of the crevice of my ears as the edges are not particularly soft.</li>
            <li> I found this mask dug into my eyes, even if I attached the velcro straps as wide apart as possible.  </li>
            <li> I have a big head, and big fluffy hair, and this mask simply isn&#x27;t for that set up.  </li>
            <li> The elastic wears after a short while, but in my opinion that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> Not only is the material thick and soft, but the strap on the back is adjustable!</li>
            <li> Second, it pushes down on your eyes because there are no cupped pockets for you to open your eyes.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the velcro strap curls slightly at the back of my head.</li>
            <li> It does not take long to dry when hung.</li>
            <li> I was going to give the other extra one you get in the pack to a girlfriend</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this brand of sleep masks for several years now and won&#x27;t use any other brand.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have said, you will definitely have to get rid of the fragrance before you can use it.</li>
            <li> other, molded one seems a bit bigger but sits off your eyes, if that sensation would bother you.  </li>
            <li> I let it air dry by a window</li>
            <li> I hand wash in Woolite and hang to dry.</li>
            <li> and we hand them on plastic hangers to dry.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that the elastic bands lose elasticity within a few months or with wash, and the mask would slip off my face in the middle of the night.</li>
            <li> My oldest one of these is at least 8 years old, and the elastic is just starting to go after lots of use and machine washings.  </li>
            <li> I have been tempted by some of the more expensive fancy eye masks, but this works--why waste money?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Velcro is fine but it only wraps so far, so once the elastic gets weak, the Velcro is useless.</li>
            <li> The only way I could keep this from slipping off was to tighten the strap, which caused some pressure on my eyes due to</li>
            <li> They last a long time, even through several washes in the washing machine (not sure if you&#x27;re supposed to hand wash</li>
            <li> I have to wear the strap a bit loose</li>
            <li> and they get too loose around my head.</li>
            <li> bought a new one recently as a back-up and was disappointed to find it scented, especially since I use it mainly for my migraines!</li>
            <li> Other masks I have tried are hard and uncomfortable or soft and let light in.</li>
            <li> The strap was a little big after awhile</li>
            <li> The strap could be a little different -  </li>
            <li> It is a little big</li>
            <li> ; that fill the gap around your nose), has a wide elastic/velcro adjustable band.  </li>
            <li> and I have trouble going back to sleep.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t have pink fur around the edge</li>
            <li> There are absolutely no gaps.</li>
            <li> The only reason they need replacing every few years or so is that the elastic stretches out</li>
            <li> The scent is only on for a few hours.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s to be expected with all masks.</li>
            <li> I was given one as a gift a few years ago, and when it was time to replace, never gave a thought about trying a different sleep mask.</li>
            <li> The strap is fairly wide elastic and has a velcro fastener.</li>
            <li> As the title states it does what it was expected.  </li>
            <li> the quality is not great at all plus it kind of uncomfortable to sleep with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m certainly not happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The adjustable head strap is a plus and it is flat elastic instead of the round that cuts into your head.</li>
            <li> These do all of them but cut into where the ears are fixed, but not so bad you can&#x27;t accommodate for it by pulling the strap higher.  </li>
            <li> and it actually faded after the first couple nights to my disappointment</li>
            <li> Only slight problems if you are a heavy sleeper, it may slip off, but has a velcro closure so you can tighten if needed.</li>
            <li> I can just get this small enough for my head.  </li>
            <li> other downside is the velcro straps themselves.  </li>
            <li> There is no odor like one other posted</li>
            <li> I see from other reviews that some of these masks arrive scented like lavender.</li>
            <li> have not noticed any scent on the ones that I received, and I checked because of the other reviewers comments.  </li>
            <li> This mask is comfy and can feel a bit uncomfortable at first because of the padding underneath, but you get used to it.</li>
            <li> The velcro is really sharp, so when I loosen the velcro strap, the &amp;#34;barbs&amp;#34; of the velcro tear at my pillow, damaging the fabric.</li>
            <li> Very rough material that has not softened with use.  </li>
            <li> I find that the mask resting directly against my eyes, actually makes the strap pull it uncomfortably against my eyeballs.  </li>
            <li> It blocks out light well, and isn&#x27;t too annoying on the back of the head.</li>
            <li> With the velcro used as tight as it will go, the mask is very loose on my head, I hae an average sized head.</li>
            <li> I like these masks a lot, but I found the elastic has stretched a lot over the past year</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re supposed to have a &#x27;calming&#x27; smell, but honestly it is just sickening.  </li>
            <li> I imagine this will be an issue down the road.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s almost impossible for me to get a full 8 hours of sleep.</li>
            <li> A little complaint that I has was I had to add to the velcro strap in back, but that is because of my humongous head.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t want to have to pay a lot of money for black out shades.</li>
            <li> It has a slight lavender scent, which is supposed to help one sleep.</li>
            <li> It has a slightly puffed thickness to it, which I like.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposed to be a lavendar scent, but it&#x27;s just odd.</li>
            <li> up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take note, there is a slight lavender scent to the product.</li>
            <li> inside of the mask is black, so it blocks out</li>
            <li> Like previously mentioned, this product arrives smelling like lavender</li>
            <li> It helps if I set it just a little down my nose.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The mask comes scented with lavender &amp; a few other herbs to help you relax &amp; wears off in a few days.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too tight, any looser</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t make it too tight.</li>
            <li> It fits my face and stays in place quite well without having the band on tightly.  </li>
            <li> They are too tight on the eyes.  </li>
            <li> So I have to sleep with these with the mask on really tight to prevent the velcro-barbs from damaging the pillows.</li>
            <li> Also, it is not too tight and has adjustable elastic bands to suit everybody.</li>
            <li> I stopped wearing it for a little while</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does take a little bit of getting used to, just to the feel of something on your face and around your head.  </li>
            <li> It could be a little tighter.  </li>
            <li> My husband must have gotten a little sweaty and the mask is not colorfast.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like having little hairs rub all over my face.</li>
            <li> I only have a very small part of velcro holding because my head is small.</li>
            <li> mask has very long straps that don&#x27;t adjust very small.  </li>
            <li> Works as described, but it did need a break in period of a few days.</li>
            <li> I have trouble sleeping during the day.  </li>
            <li> so I can be awake on the few nights that I work.  </li>
            <li> I have trouble sleeping with lights around me and with the sun coming up at around five-ish</li>
            <li> This takes no time at all - a few swooshes through the soapy water and a rinse</li>
            <li> I dried them in the dryer, and they held up well.</li>
            <li> I have rewashed mine a few times and still does the job.</li>
            <li> I am a \\&quot;tummy sleeper\\&quot;, and this mask is so soft that it doesn&#x27;t feel uncomfortable against my pillow.  </li>
            <li> It manages to block the light without gaping, and manages to keep from pressing on my eyes without any of the annoying padding or buldging cups</li>
            <li> and I want absolutely no light beaming through my eyelids.</li>
            <li> and they get dried out.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my face</li>
            <li> It did take a few nights sleep for me to get used to something resting on my face</li>
            <li> I got it a few years ago for me and my husband and every year</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I will buy these again, they are slippery, they dont stay on and sometimes they hold too tight and press onto your eyes and when you wake up your eyes are all hurting....</li>
            <li> This item does come with a very strong fragrance that is very nasty.</li>
            <li> Sleep tight!</li>
            <li> No light comes in much and the smell isn&#x27;t bad at all to me.</li>
            <li> I have tried at least half a dozen kinds--foam, silk, etc.  </li>
            <li> I have been using these sleep masks for 5 years, they usually make it about a year before I have to replace them.</li>
            <li> There are small pouches on the inside (outer corners).</li>
            <li> , I personally find these uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they recently changed the material that the material is rougher and smells rather synthetic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if what I received through this site was a knock-off...?</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s usually time to replace it at that point anyway.</li>
            <li> No light gets in!  </li>
            <li> It is very fluffy and feels like a pillow for your eyes.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say the product is necessarily bad, but I certainly do not like it and am not pleased with the disparity between the description and the actual product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While</li>
            <li> only complaint is the weird eye flaps on the side that goes against your face.</li>
            <li> This eye mask is not very soft and the strap that holds it in place is uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> and I can hardly tell when it&#x27;s morning.  </li>
            <li> Not as hard on your hair and when you take it off no need to redo hair and eye makeup.  </li>
            <li> and at least now the mask is usable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would put it in a lingerie bag on delicate cycle in my washer, but I would NEVER put it in the dryer.  </li>
            <li> Even when it&#x27;s very loose, it still feels uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crazy enough in here without the flood of data coming through the senses.</li>
            <li> The only issue is that the elastic band that holds it on your head feels like it is cutting into my ears.</li>
            <li> Mine did not, but there was a faint smell from the manufacturing process (dyes, anti-bacterial chemicals, all of the other unsavory things that go into mass manufacturing).</li>
            <li> Even after trying to make it smaller it still feels uncomfortable on the face!  </li>
            <li> It has a velcro attachment in the back of the head that is very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> For less than six dollars per mask you really can&#x27;t go wrong giving this mask a try.</li>
            <li> I have a room where the sun comes in every morning, and it makes it difficult for me to sleep in a little on the weekends if I want.     </li>
            <li> but i had to give then only 3 stars because the elastic band goes bad around 2 to 3 months.</li>
            <li> I have purchased masks in the past that are very thin</li>
            <li> This Earth Therapeutics mask is very thick and does have a scent to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too crazy about the little pockets inside the mask that go over your eyes.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a little awkward to sleep with the strap above/</li>
            <li> - this just makes it that much worse.    </li>
            <li> The thin head band hurts the tops of my ears, I wake up sore as hell.  </li>
            <li> It is some what padded which I find unnecessary since I don&#x27;t like any pressure on my cornea at all.</li>
            <li> I hate this eye mask for several reasons.</li>
            <li> Frustrating.</li>
            <li> The elastic to start is a little painful on my ears.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed that I wasted my money on these.</li>
            <li> I am, unfortunately, a night owl.</li>
            <li> This just leaves me with another useless set of eye covers that my wife can&#x27;t use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m skeptical and am considering returning these.</li>
            <li> The biggest issue is that they are extremely uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> They do have a really weird, chemical smell to them.  </li>
            <li> But, it wasn&#x27;t painful, just MILDLY uncomfortable, and did not deter me at all from a restful nights sleep.</li>
            <li> Yea it stinks out of the package.</li>
            <li> I soaked it overnight to get the smell out, which is like artificial lavender or something.</li>
            <li> The scent disappeared within a couple of days, and I didn&#x27;t find it unpleasant because I like lavender.  </li>
            <li> I just hate that if I am not wearing my sleep cap the Velcro gets caught in my hair.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s certainly annoying.</li>
            <li> Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve got these awful flaps on the inside (the side that goes on your FACE) that push against your eyeballs.</li>
            <li> It feels terrible, and I could never sleep wearing this.</li>
            <li> It sounds awful and</li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>
            <li> They smelled terrible.</li>

            <li> I have chronic migraines and this mask is soft and keeps light out easily. I never have luck keeping masks on my face correctly or when moving around but when you have a migraine you don&#x27;t move your head! I can even fit my eye gel coolers into slots in the mask! Very comfortable too!</li>
            <li> My two teen sons share a room, but have different schedules. These really help block out the light when one stays up later than the other. They both said although they had a strong fragrance out of the box, it disappeared pretty quickly. They also said it stays on pretty well during the night and is soft and very comfortable. They&#x27;re both sleeping better now... so glad I found these.</li>
            <li> Works as described, but it did need a break in period of a few days. When I first got it, it was too fluffy and it was really pressing against my eyes. After a day under the mattress, it was perfect. And it did smell a little when first opened, but that went away after a day or two. Great value.</li>
            <li> Once the light comes through the window, I reach for a mask to block the light.  I have tried a few and this one is my favorite.  It has a nice silky soft feel and is more padded than others I have used.  The elastic band does get stretched out after a while so I do like to replace it periodically.  This is a great price for two.</li>
            <li> The mask is absolutely heavenly on the eyes and face, however, it will move during the night and the elastic is horribly cheap, it loses its shape and twists and no amount of ironing can set it straight again, when the elastic gives way the velcro becomes a nightmare.</li>
            <li> I bought my sleeping masks because I started working nights at my job and could never manage to sleep more than a couple of hours at a time during the day. The light that comes thru my bedroom window is so bright and I didn&#x27;t want to have to pay a lot of money for black out shades. The sleeping mask was a perfect solution. It&#x27;s blocks out all light , and fits comfortably around my he.ad</li>
            <li> You get 2 eye masks and they are high quality!</li>
            <li> The price was great and they arrived quickly. The masks are comfortable, but do take a little getting used to the extra heat. They have changed my life and now I sleep through the night without any light bothering me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ken&lt;br /&gt;Webmaster&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> I love this product! This mask is very comfortable, and keeps the light out well. Only slight problems if you are a heavy sleeper, it may slip off, but has a velcro closure so you can tighten if needed. Also the velcro may get stuck in your hair. Otherwise, I dont fall asleep without it. It really helps, especially since my kids like the hall light on at nite and I dont, now they can get their light and I can fall asleep! Even better, it came with two, so one can stay in the bedroom and one downstairs for those quick daylight naps....</li>
            <li> Bought this cause I have trouble sleeping during the day.  Too much light makes it hard for me to fall asleep, but with this it helps me fall asleep so I can be awake on the few nights that I work.  Soft material, with ajustable strap lets it fit your face well.</li>
            <li> This eye pillow is the best!  It rests comfortably over the eyes and blocks out the light.  I use it every night! I would definately recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have been using sleep masks on and off over the years. Many of them were uncomfortable and didn&#x27;t block out any light. I&#x27;ve recently begun working night shift and needed a mask for sleep during the day. This mask does an excellent job of blocking out the light. It has to be pulled down lower on my nose to completely block out the light, which is a bit irritating at first, but once I&#x27;m asleep I don&#x27;t notice it.   I am extremely sensitive to scents, but this mask has no offensive scent.</li>
            <li> This sleep mask was so effective, In my bedroom the sunlight from the window falls directly onto my face.   This mask has helped me a lot in getting a good sleep.     It has to be experienced to know how comfortable the sleep gets with a sleep mask.     The new item scent which comes when the pack is opened disappears in a few hours, so do not worry about it.    And with the Amazon ready to ship packaging, opening and using it was easy..</li>
            <li> I just want to say this product is amazing the sleep levels are out of this world !  If you are to work at night and sleep during the day this is definitely the product for you . IF you are a person having a time sleeping period, this is the product for you. When I put this sleeping mask on its so dark you can&#x27;t see anything it takes getting use to, but it&#x27;s very soft against your skin with the cotton, and silk texture material. The mask at times put you in such a deep sleep you often don&#x27;t know what time or day it is in a good way! So that all being said, if you have some where to go or be. Invest in a good alarm clock to wake you from the true meaning of sleeping like a baby!!                                        P.S. Buy this Mask, Great Value, Well Worth it!</li>
            <li> I have a large, bulky sleep mask that I love, but in the summer or with hot flashes, or if need it in my purse for travel, it is to hot and bulky.  At those times this works great.  It stores easy, keeps it dark for me, and is soft and works great.</li>
            <li> as described, arrived promptly.  It is almost too big. I only have a very small part of velcro holding because my head is small. 7 1/8&amp;#34; hat size.</li>
            <li> I am giving it four, only because I suspect that the problem is just something that I am sensitive to.  I find that the mask resting directly against my eyes, actually makes the strap pull it uncomfortably against my eyeballs.  It isn&#x27;t too tight, any looser and it would fall off.  It helps if I set it just a little down my nose.  This would probably be fine for most people, but I have trouble already, breathing through my nose when asleep - this just makes it that much worse.    That said, I do like having a mask and for the price, it was an easy way to discover if it is worth it.  I have trouble sleeping with lights around me and with the sun coming up at around five-ish, I needed to do something.</li>
            <li> This eye mask is not very soft and the strap that holds it in place is uncomfortable.  I have to wear the strap a bit loose so the mask eventually falls off.  When it is in place, it does keep the room nice and dark but I would not recommend this item.</li>
            <li> This is a good sleep mask. It has a mild scent right out of the box, but isn&#x27;t noxious. After some use the smell goes away. The mask is washable which extends its life. It blocks out light well, and isn&#x27;t too annoying on the back of the head. Once adjusted it stays on most of the time. They seem to last me about 3 months if I wash it occasionally. Subscribe and save is worthwhile if you like it as they do wear out in a few months.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for years, and always get them as the old ones give out. They give out when the elastic at the back gets too stretchy--I suppose I could just replace that, but what with the Velcro tabs, it&#x27;s just easier to buy a new pair. Extremely comfortable--I have found no rival--and they do a great job of blocking light while fitting comfortably around the nose. I tuck my earplugs in the convenient slots in the front so everything is there when I need it. Love these (an the Heros Extreme Earplugs) for flights or for noisy hotels. Just thinking about it makes me drowsy.</li>
            <li> I have a room where the sun comes in every morning, and it makes it difficult for me to sleep in a little on the weekends if I want.     Pros -   The mask does a great job of blocking out most light.  My head is right next to a window in my bedroom and I can hardly tell when it&#x27;s morning.  The silk is a nice as well.   Getting two of them works for me as well.    Cons -   The adjustable strap is only slightly adjustable meaning there isn&#x27;t much wiggle room between the two pieces of velcro to make adjustments.   It sometimes comes off at night because of this.  When I first got it and wore it, I became very congested within 15-30 min. I would put it back into the pouch it came in every morning, and I every night when I&#x27;d put it on I&#x27;d become congested again within 30 min. I stopped wearing it for a little while then one morning it was so bright in my room and I decided I didn&#x27;t care and put it on. This time, though it had been sitting on my nightstand instead of in the pouch, and presto, no congestion. I have left it out ever since and have had no problems.    Overall, I&#x27;d suggest this product for the price. There&#x27;s a lot of things that could be improved, but like I said, for the price (and 2 of them) it&#x27;s worth it to me.</li>
            <li> I have neighbors who think bright porch lights are best on 3 sides.  This mask is soft, easy to use &amp; blocks a good deal of light.  I&#x27;m not too crazy about the little pockets inside the mask that go over your eyes.  The pattern is celestial, which is one of my favorites.  I keep the 2nd mask put away for a spare.  I&#x27;d recommend this eyemask to anyone needing deeper sleep with complete darkness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask comes scented with lavender &amp; a few other herbs to help you relax &amp; wears off in a few days.  This 2 pack is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> When new, these have a strong, unpleasant odor.  It stuck around after I let the mask air for a couple days.  I rinsed the mask in water and it was still there!  I let it air dry by a window and at least now the mask is usable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mask has very long straps that don&#x27;t adjust very small.  I can just get this small enough for my head.  It needs to be more adjustable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wonder too, why Amazon doesn&#x27;t combine reviews for all versions of this product.  The reviews and star rating vary from the listing for one mask versus two masks.  The ratings here are much higher than on the single mask.</li>
            <li> this is by far the best i have used so far. i was looking at the price and was like there is no way for 8 bucks i would like this thing so much, and bought another sleep mask. this one stays on my head all night and day. blocks about 99 % of the light</li>
            <li> This fits perfectly to cover my eyes at night and since its dark in color it helps to block out any excess light.. The only issue i had was the smell from this (as relaxing as it is) was hard to get over since my nose is right there to smell how strong it can get.. I got really really light headed.. but since that happened i guess it worked since it got light enough that I fell asleep.. If that makes sense.. but now the smell has faded after a couple uses so Its all good :-D</li>
            <li> It helps to keep the light out.  I just hate that if I am not wearing my sleep cap the Velcro gets caught in my hair.</li>
            <li> I absolutely wore my previous Earth Therapeutics sleep mask out - it was downright embarrassing to put it on if anyone was around. I was thankful to find this supplier with the 2-pack of the masks.  I am set now for quite a while. If you want a soft, cushiony sleep mask that doesn&#x27;t let any light in - this is the answer.</li>
            <li> These are the best sleep masks I have ever found. They are soft and comfy. They are easily adjustable. Over time they will lose their elasticity, but everything wears out. I have been using these sleep masks for 5 years, they usually make it about a year before I have to replace them. They clean easily by throwing them in the washer with a load of laundry.</li>
            <li> I really love this eye mask. I have had several in the past and this is the most comfortable I have worn. When I was going to order mine I asked my boyfriend if he wanted one too. He said that he can&#x27;t sleep with one but after trying mine he wants one of his own. I was going to give the other extra one you get in the pack to a girlfriend but he is going to use it now.     I especially love it because I am 7 months pregnant and sometimes I don&#x27;t sleep very well at night. This mask makes it much easier to catch some zzz&#x27;s in the late morning even with the summer sun.    The only thing that should be noted that was not mentioned by the manufacturer is that there is a strong lavender smell on the mask. It does go away after a few days and its a nice smell anyway. But if you have sensitive skin or are sensitive to smells it may be a problem for you. You could always buy it and let it air out for a while before using it.</li>
            <li> This sleep mask work well. It keeps the light out while I&#x27;m sleeping, even on a bright day.  The mask is also very comfortable and the head strap can be adjusted to your desired tightness.  Good job Earth Therapeutics.</li>
            <li> Since light pouring through a window wakes me, this product is very appreciated and I make good use of them. Service was fine.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful sleep mask. It has a light, soothing scent and perfectly blocks out any light. I have purchased masks in the past that are very thin but this one is nice and thick with extra coverage over the eye area.</li>
            <li> Wide strap makes it very comfortable and secure. Nice and soft on face and does a great job blocking out light. Also delivered on time and in good condition.</li>
            <li> I am, unfortunately, a night owl. When squirrels wake me up at 5:30 AM (I sleep with windows open), I simply don this mask and back to sleep I go. It even works when I want to take an afternoon nap in a room with no blinds.  The Earth Therapeutics Sleep Mask has worked exceptionally well for me for several years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about this mask: 1) It is made of soft silk charmeuse in a dark color. Silk charmeuse is the ideal fabric, neither heavy nor too warm. This is a luxury fiber.  2) It has a soft, wide elastic, adjustable with velcro. 3) It is lightweight and has a soft filling, which is as light as the best goosedown. I barely know I am wearing it.  4) The shape contours over my eyes and nose, so it is really truly dark.  5) Another reason it fits so well, and this makes it different than most masks, is that there is a sort of shoulder pad on the bottom half of the mask.  This contours the mask to the face perfectly.  5) It has a slight lavender scent, which is supposed to help one sleep. However, if you don&#x27;t like or can&#x27;t tolerate the scent, it dissipates in a matter of weeks. The scent will also wash away.  6) It is neither too warm nor too cool when wearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Care: Silk charmeuse has long been used for luxury lingerie and can be washed.  I hand wash in Woolite and hang to dry. This takes no time at all - a few swooshes through the soapy water and a rinse and that&#x27;s it.  I would put it in a lingerie bag on delicate cycle in my washer, but I would NEVER put it in the dryer.  This might cause lumpiness in the filling as well as causing different materials to react differently to heat. It does not take long to dry when hung.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve got these awful flaps on the inside (the side that goes on your FACE) that push against your eyeballs. This has the exact opposite intended effect. They kept us up, so we threw them away.</li>
            <li> I got the first one in 2010 and loved it!!! I used it every night! The strap was a little big after awhile so i just tied it into a knot! It was still in good condition too the band just streched out a bit more so I decided to get a new one! bought the two pack this one fit&#x27;s much better! This time once it starts to stretch i&#x27;m going to sew the star tighter! Other than that love this product!!!</li>
            <li> Buy it if you have any trouble waking up early because of light outside.  It is great.  Very soft.</li>
            <li> The smell actually wore off after the first two times of using it but the best part is i can nap in the middle of the day and see no light because the way its designed! The padding under your eyes really help and for a day sleeper that is huge!</li>
            <li> The thin head band hurts the tops of my ears, I wake up sore as hell.  Also this is a mask that puts significant pressure on the eyes.  Some people like that, but it drives me nuts.</li>
            <li> I really like the sleep mask because it has just the right amount of fluff to it for comfort over the eyes, and it completely blocks out the light.  The strap is sturdy enough that it doesn&#x27;t stretch out and lose the snug fit around my head.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Earth Therapeutic sleep mask. It&#x27;s nicely padded to block out light but doesn&#x27;t have the annoying \\&quot;roll\\&quot; that some sleep masks do. The adjustable velcro-elastic band holds the mask securely in place without being uncomfortable. The width of the elastic is such that it doesn&#x27;t leave a \\&quot;notch\\&quot; in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this brand of sleep masks for several years now and won&#x27;t use any other brand. In fact, I now keep one by the bed and one in my overnight kit. I can&#x27;t sleep without them now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much better than the Lewis &amp; Clark mask, for the reason that the dye does not come off on your bedding like the L&amp;C mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After many tries with various masks, this one is hands down my favorite. This one is very comfortable, no dye running onto your bedding (like the Lewis &amp; Clark mask), no allergens sewn in (lavender, etc.), keeps light out (has little &amp;#34;eye pillows&amp;#34; that fill the gap around your nose), has a wide elastic/velcro adjustable band.  I sleep with a cpap machine, and this mask is flexible enough that I can work it around to work with the cpap mask and still keep the light out.  I&#x27;ve been using one for several months, and I&#x27;m so happy with it, I&#x27;m now ordering a couple of 2-packs to be sure I don&#x27;t run out of this mask.  I hate trying more brands when a favorite disappears.</li>
            <li> I had this mask for several years and it has been a lifesaver on planes and in airports. Also great when trying to sleep in the daytime. The last one is just wearing out after 3 years of constant wear. I ordered 2 more and highly recommend. Love the flaps under the eye that keeps mask away from makeup. A bit more expensive than some but well worth it. The adjustable head strap is a plus and it is flat elastic instead of the round that cuts into your head. Not as hard on your hair and when you take it off no need to redo hair and eye makeup.  For the men just a comfortable mask. Don&#x27;t hesitate. I love this product.</li>
            <li> Best eyemask I&#x27;ve ever seen or used. Bought it for planes, ended up using it nightly at home! A+, love it.</li>
            <li> This mask is not scented with lavender or anything else.  It is however, fairly comfortable, warm without being too warm, excellent at light blocking, and not hideous or kinky looking.</li>
            <li> This product did not work as well as the cheaper ones I had gotten during  airline flights.  It is thick, which makes it somewhat warm over your face.  I don&#x27;t know if I could use it in the summer.  Secondly, it really  doesn&#x27;t block out the light too well, the light comes in from the bottom  area.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for two people in my family for Christmas.  Both have informed me that they love it(especially the velgro straps, instead of elastic).  They wear it every night and find the mask to be very comfortable.</li>
            <li> It can cover the eyes completely and it feels good on the eyes. However, I don&#x27;t feel comfortable wearing this because the band bothers my head. It feels terrible, and I could never sleep wearing this. I didn&#x27;t make it too tight. Even when it&#x27;s very loose, it still feels uncomfortable. I kinda regret buying 2.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s just me though.</li>
            <li> worth it for the price especially. 14 more words required so im just going to type type type type type!</li>
            <li> It is so comportable and practical item.   Thick and sofe material make me perfect circumstance when I want to sleep. I think everybody can enjoy deep sleep with this.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I am light sleeper and the first light or noise I hear will wake me up and I have trouble going back to sleep. I have NEVER sleep better than with this mask. It stays on great and I love the adjustable velcro band. Someone mentioned the aromatherapy smell in their review being too much, however, I quite enjoyed it and it actually faded after the first couple nights to my disappointment, however I love it still :)</li>
            <li> The mask is made of silk, and thus very slippery on my face and hair, even though the back elastic is not silk.  It slides off my eyes several times in a night. It does cover and block out light completely for the amount of time it stays on.  Unlike another reviewer mine has no scent.</li>
            <li> My bedroom allows far too much light in the morning so I sought out a sleep mask. I figured all of them would do what seems like a simple task but I was surprised about a couple of things. The  bands that wrap around the back of your head are made of what I can only describe as standard Velcro strips of an elastic nature. The straps dig into the tops of the crevice of my ears as the edges are not particularly soft. It wakes me up regularly from the discomfort&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask itself, however is very soft and comfortable over the eyes but the second issues is that the eye pads don&#x27;t quite conform to my eye sockets providing a good seal. The pad is flat and faces are not. In addition, when over the bridge of the nose, the nose pushes the pad out just enough to let a little light in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, they are fine and I still gave 4 stars because I&#x27;m sure most people won&#x27;t be as critical as I am being. My critical review is based on the fact I wanted and need total darkness. The don&#x27;t block all of the light but the do block most of it and I&#x27;m sure most people will not notice. Perhaps I need to invest in blackout curtains.</li>
            <li> Good sleep mask with adjustable strap. Big enough to block the light, but doesn&#x27;t suffocate either. Smelled like some aromatherapy scent when I opened it, but that went away in one day. There are small pouches on the inside (outer corners). I wonder if that is where you are supposed to put smell good stuff for aromatherapy?</li>
            <li> This product is as advertised and meets or exceeds expectations. I would recomend this product to a friend or family member.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent product overall.  Comfortable around the eyes.  I bought this set of two to replace the one I already had.  However, I realized that the straps on all three of them (the one I originally bought and the set of two to replace the one I already had) were all different in lengths.  The new set I bought, which I returned because of this problem, had the straps way too small to fit around my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please be aware that the straps you may get may vary in size!</li>
            <li> The blinds in my rental apartment do not block out light very well, and so I&#x27;ve been looking for something that could help since I can&#x27;t install proper drapes. These work to keep the light out, but I don&#x27;t find sleeping in them very easy. I&#x27;m hoping I&#x27;ll get used to them in time. But for now, it&#x27;s switching one thing that wakes me up early in the morning, for another thing that keeps waking me up throughout the night. Sigh.</li>
            <li> I bought this Jan. 2010 and have been using it on and off. This item does come with a very strong fragrance that is very nasty. As other reviewers have said, you will definitely have to get rid of the fragrance before you can use it. Secondly, I have several generic sleep masks from American Airlines that will be used as a comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Earth Therapeutics sleep mask keep slipping off my face as I twist and turn. It is some what padded which I find unnecessary since I don&#x27;t like any pressure on my cornea at all. The only way I could keep this from slipping off was to tighten the strap, which caused some pressure on my eyes due to it being padded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The American Airlines branded sleeping masks are made of cotton and never slip off. They are not padded but I don&#x27;t want them to be. They cover my eyes without putting any pressure on my cornea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, the Earth Therapeutics are not any better than generic sleep masks given to you on airlines. If you travel and need some sleeping masks, just get the ones that your airlines offer.</li>
            <li> arrived on time and in good condition. The eye doctor recommended I use one of these. I found it quite comfortable.</li>
            <li> I like how soft these masks are. I would caution you: they do have an odor. If you are sensitive to odors, like I am, I highly recommend washing the masks a few times before using them. I got them on laundry day, so I just put them in with each wash I ran (there were four loads), and they came out non-smelly. I dried them in the dryer, and they held up well. I will buy these again when I&#x27;m in the market for new masks.</li>
            <li> I found this mask dug into my eyes, even if I attached the velcro straps as wide apart as possible.  I could literally feel the tug across the mask, over my eyes, inline with the straps.  I have a big head, and big fluffy hair, and this mask simply isn&#x27;t for that set up.  I returned them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other downside is the velcro straps themselves.  Unless you have them completely overlapping (ie as small as possible) or have short hair, your hair will get stuck in the velcro.  It sounds awful and it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully I bought two other brands from Amazon when I got these (Dream Essentials and Lewis N. Clark) and they worked much better for me.</li>
            <li> I hate this eye mask for several reasons. First, I don&#x27;t like satin on my face. I didn&#x27;t know this until I bought this eye mask. It sticks to my face cream and doesn&#x27;t let the skin breathe. Second, it pushes down on your eyes because there are no cupped pockets for you to open your eyes. Third, the Velcro from the back of the strap sticks to my pillow and is ruining my pillow case. I recommend getting one that is cotton and allows you to open your eyes.</li>
            <li> It works, but I don&#x27;t use it as much as O thought I would have. But it definitely works well.</li>
            <li> I travel for business frequently and so I have tried a lot of sleep masks. This beats them all, even the $25 super-contoured fancy variety. Most synthetic sleep masks feel uncomfortable against my skin, some even sweaty. They also tend not to block the light out very well. The silk fabric of this mask is cool and soft, with nice padding and a good shape to block out all the light. It feels great against my skin for hours, and the elastic band is super comfortable and adjustable. I originally bought this in a store and was devastated when I lost it and the store no longer carried them. Now I&#x27;m thrilled to get two more at such a good price.</li>
            <li> I work graves and this eyemask works perfectly for blocking out light.  It&#x27;s very light, breathable, comfortable, and the strap stays on well.  There is no odor like one other posted and it doesn&#x27;t have pink fur around the edge so you can actually use it as a man lol just kidding, but it is nice.</li>
            <li> I give this product 5 stars because it has an adjustable strap at the back which makes it more comfortable to wear.  It is wide over the eyes and soft to wear. It conforms to my facial features perfectly!</li>
            <li> I have used this mask for around 5 years.  I bought several different types of masks to find the right one for me.  This one is it!  It is silk, very soft, and has two little pads around the bottom of the eyes to help block light.  The strap is velcro so it can be adjusted to any size.  I am 100% satisfied with this mask.</li>
            <li> Soft and dark, just the way I like it.</li>
            <li> First, how could I not love a product that comes in double?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After scouring the internet for a great deal on a sleeping mask that would be both comfortable, and effective at blocking out light, I finally found these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I got the masks, I used one that night. It was SUPER soft, and the mask is also adjustable. I did notice some issues with the velcro, as it could get some hair caught in it if you adjust the mask and expose the velcro. But, it wasn&#x27;t painful, just MILDLY uncomfortable, and did not deter me at all from a restful nights sleep. The mask if very comfortable, otherwise, and cushions my eyes very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people talked about an odor coming from the mask. Well, after the first time using the mask I noticed a very faint enjoyable smell, but it wasn&#x27;t excessive, and was more of a \\&quot;new mask\\&quot; smell. It didn&#x27;t smell like a chemical, nor did it smell like they doused it in scent. It just had a hint of \\&quot;pleasant new mask\\&quot; but that faded over time. Definitely not a problem! Although I say it&#x27;s \\&quot;odorless\\&quot; I guess that&#x27;s an oxymoron, since everything that exists has an odor to it... however faint or strong, or however natural or chemical that smell might be. But these masks really don&#x27;t smell strong or bad at all, and I especially appreciate that since I have asthma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the best part of all? Besides being comfortable, soft, and free of bad/strong/etc odors? IT BLOCKS OUT ALL LIGHT! I&#x27;ve worn these in the middle of the afternoon, or with the room light on just to see how great they are at blocking out light, and they are wonderful! There are absolutely no gaps. Heck, I could sleep with my eyes open and the lights on if I wanted to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything is soft &amp; dark underneath these babies... just the way I like to sleep. :)</li>
            <li> I have found these masks to be very comfortable and block out the light well. A much more cost effective option than buying expensive window treatments to block out the streetlight in my NYC apartment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the weird eye flaps on the side that goes against your face. I suppose they are intended to prevent light leakage, but have been slightly irritating my skin since I started using a Retinol product.</li>
            <li> Never used a mask before,so it takes getting used to,It don&#x27;t keep all the light out,but better then nothing.</li>
            <li> This smells funny and seems cheaply made. It has a velcro attachment in the back of the head that is very uncomfortable. I do not recommend, would not buy again and I hope this helps someone.</li>
            <li> We bought this months back and my girlfriend still loves it. The elastic band wears out after a while but she said that many products have had that before. Something one has to stick with?</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand for years . They last a long time. So happy to have found them on amazon</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made from thick and luxuriously soft material, which is great, but I don&#x27;t like how the thickness translates to pressure on my eyes.  It does a good job of blocking light if you arrange it properly, but it does slip easily if you turn to your side.</li>
            <li> I love this! It&#x27;s very soft and gentle to the face and eyes. I would definitely buy a new one when this one has been used up.</li>
            <li> I have issues with sleeping and have tried many different types of sleep masks.  This has been my favorite and the 2 pack deal allows my husband and I to have our own.  The mask shuts out light but is not took tight but sticks to your face.  Comfortable and versatile as for a while my husband (larger head) and I were sharing one with no problem</li>
            <li> I first bought these sleep masks at BB&amp;B (for lots more money). I have tried at least half a dozen kinds--foam, silk, etc.  These have little flaps of soft material on the inside, which gives your eyes a little more room. The wide strap fastens with Velcro, so it is infinitely adjustable, as well as comfortable. They stay put and block out light. The fragrance is nice-- not overwhelming. I&#x27;m so glad I found these on Amazon. You get two for this price--a good deal.  Update: These are still good and you can&#x27;t beat the price, but Alaska Bear sleep masks are better.</li>
            <li> Pretty good sleep masks for the price.  Does it&#x27;s job and is soft.  Not the best I&#x27;ve ever had but does a pretty good job.  Some light does seep through the bottom</li>
            <li> I will always go with this brand.  Not only is the material thick and soft, but the strap on the back is adjustable!</li>
            <li> These are soft and dark. The band is large and I&#x27;ll have to do something to make it smaller.</li>
            <li> I see from other reviews that some of these masks arrive scented like lavender. Mine did not, but there was a faint smell from the manufacturing process (dyes, anti-bacterial chemicals, all of the other unsavory things that go into mass manufacturing). Like with anything that touches your skin, you should wash this first before you use it in order to remove manufacturing residue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these sleep masks for almost ten years now. They last a long time, even through several washes in the washing machine (not sure if you&#x27;re supposed to hand wash but I just throw them in every so often). Unlike other eye masks they are light weight enough to not cause me any discomfort while I sleep (I don&#x27;t like how some other masks put pressure on my eyes). The only reason they need replacing every few years or so is that the elastic stretches out and they get too loose around my head. I cannot sleep without an eye mask, and this is my number one choice.</li>
            <li> I really love these things. I got one for myself and my husband stole it. I ended up getting one for him and also for my mother-in-law. We&#x27;re all happy with them.</li>
            <li> i have never slept so well in my life!  i had already been using earplugs and recently added this sleep mask to my arsenal and have been sleeping like a rock.  i am much happier and well rested!  life-changing!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not the question for me. I use the mask when I meditate. It helps to filter out some of the outside distractions bombarding my inner world. It&#x27;s crazy enough in here without the flood of data coming through the senses. Yes, I use ear plugs too!</li>
            <li> I received these masks as a Christmas gift.  I find that I sleep much better when it&#x27;s dark and I thought I&#x27;d give this brand of mask a try.    The scent disappeared within a couple of days, and I didn&#x27;t find it unpleasant because I like lavender.  The mask is very comfortable and adjustable.  A little light does come through the bottom, but I find by simply moving it down a bit on my nose the light is blocked out.  It also seems to help my sinuses when I do that.  In any case, when there&#x27;s too much light in the room, this mask does the trick for me and I&#x27;m very pleased to have two masks in case one gets lost or dirty.</li>
            <li> This is the only sleep mask I can find that has an adjustable strap.  Most other brands are usually very small and tight.  Well made and cushy feel on face.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Works great except for one thing, the strap is streching out.  With the velcro used as tight as it will go, the mask is very loose on my head, I hae an average sized head.</li>
            <li> I gave these five stars because the met all my personal criteria for a great sleeping mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- They are extremely soft, creating comfort not irratation&lt;br /&gt;- The fit can be adjusted for comfort, they dont have be on tight to work well&lt;br /&gt;- It blocks 100% of the light, they fit great on my face maybe they won&#x27;t fit perfectly on your but my girlfriend also uses them and her head is smaller than mine and they work just as well for her.&lt;br /&gt;- Other masks I have tried are hard and uncomfortable or soft and let light in.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t sleep without it. It&#x27;s great for blocking light, and very comfortable, too. However, although the packages says it&#x27;s cotton and silk, the label on the mask says it&#x27;s polyester!!! A case of misleading advertising? Also, it&#x27;s hand-washable.</li>
            <li> This is the best purchase I have made for a good night sleep!  It blocks out all the light from windows, alarm clocks, tv and phones.  You never knew you needed them until you use them!  They are adjustable and will fit anyone.  I wear it every night.  Purchased the two pack so I can have one downstairs for when I take a nap after work.  It is daylight and you would never know it!  I will not be without them ever again.</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 masks.  These work so well that I lost one to my husband, and he wears it every night because I often stay up later than he does.  The masks are soft and provide very good coverage for my eyes.  The eye-hook fastener was at first annoying, but once the adjustment was just right for my head I had no trouble sleeping with it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend washing the mask in a gentle cycle and in a net laundry bag, usually used for lingerie or fragile fabrics.</li>
            <li> very nice for daytime naps!</li>
            <li> If you want to try them first, go to bed, bath and beyond. The strap gets loose, as could be expected, but otherwise a good product.</li>
            <li> This is the only mask I&#x27;ll use! I have tried others but like this one the best for completely blocking out light.It&#x27;s comfortable to wear and the adjustable strap is good for any size head.</li>
            <li> The scent is only on for a few hours. Nonetheless it is a good product. I have rewashed mine a few times and still does the job. The only issue is that the elastic band that holds it on your head feels like it is cutting into my ears.</li>
            <li> The elastic to start is a little painful on my ears. Nothing major but it&#x27;s certainly annoying. And the mask has some pillows that go under your eyes. They aren&#x27;t all too comfortable. Price is right and I would recommend them to a friend for the price. Smelled good for all of one or two days then no smell at all. Better than them smelling bad ;-)</li>
            <li> This mask blocks out almost 100% of the light in my bedroom(except the little bit around the nose). It&#x27;s really comfy, and doesn&#x27;t feel oppressive or bothersome. I actually forgot that it originally was scented, because I&#x27;ve had it a few months and the smell is long gone, so don&#x27;t worry about the smell bothering you if the idea of lavender puts you off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear my mask, and it really helps me fall asleep. Of course, I&#x27;ll mention that almost every night by the time I wake up the mask has come off. I&#x27;ve never had another sleep mask, so I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s to be expected with all masks. I know I tend to move around a lot when I sleep, so if you do too, be forewarned that the mask will not necessarily stay put all night. It does have a nice adjustable stretchy strap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is just a really comfortable, lightweight mask. Even when I go to sleep in the middle of the day, with full sunlight, this mask makes it feel like night. I plan on taking it on airplanes too.</li>
            <li> and this one is the best, so I&#x27;m on my 3rd one now in probably 7-10 years.  It&#x27;s soft and the adjustable elastic strap isn&#x27;t distracting, plus the extra padding at the bottom makes them truly light blocking.</li>
            <li> Does a great job at blocking light but is light enough to forget it is there.  Also works great over my cpap mask!-</li>
            <li> I bought this 2-pack for me and my wife about a month ago. I&#x27;ve used mine 4x so far while I&#x27;ve napped during the day and it blocks out all light. The adjustable velcro strap is great because the mask isn&#x27;t too tight around my head. The mask is soft and comfortable and is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> This is a necessary item for me because I work NOC shifts. There is a definite difference between the higher quality ones like these versus the plain old ones. The pressure on the face/eyes is greatly reduced, making sleeping so much more comfortable. Light coverage is almost perfect. With a package of 2, you&#x27;ll be fully loaded for quite some time.</li>
            <li> I have been using a cheap $1 mask given to me in a gift bag. I wanted to upgrade to something better. Much to my surprise I actually prefer the $1 mask. This Earth Therapeutics mask is very thick and does have a scent to it. I am sensitive to perfumes but the smell didn&#x27;t bug me too much. What did bother me was:&lt;br /&gt;1. It doesn&#x27;t block out the light at the bottom by your nose. Frustrating. I can still see the little light on the TV and DVD player.&lt;br /&gt;2. It moves around on your head and is sometimes up in my hair when I wake up. Frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;3. You can&#x27;t open your eyes while wearing it ... It mashes into my eyes and is ..... frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;4. When I turn over to sleep on my side I have to readjust the mask to cover my eyes again. I already said it .. frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In light of (haha) all the other positive reviews it could just be me being too picky BUT considering I have been using a thin non-adjustable $1 mask I didn&#x27;t have many preconceived notions. Your mileage may vary. :)</li>
            <li> I have bought quite a number of these and as our bedroom is very bright in the morning we need something reliable and comfortable to block everything out. So both me and my husband use them. We had tried others but these last longer and are adjustable. They wash well - in the sink with mild (ivory) dish detergent and we hand them on plastic hangers to dry. Eventually the elastic does give out and stretches.</li>
            <li> If you wake in the 3 a.m. to 4 a.m. range and lay in bedding watching the clock this mask will really help.  I keep it close to my bed and if I wake up I put it on.  I am able to go right back to sleep.  This mask has a nice silk fabric that feels great on your eyes.  Sleep tight!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this mask, the Lewis N Clark, and the one that wraps around you entire head, but so far this has been the most comfortable. Actually, the Lewis N Clark is pretty comfortable too, but the dye formulation changed a few years ago and it now stains fabric blue, so this is the undisputed king of sleep masks. No other masks feel as soft and smooth as this one; even the Sleep Innovation (Sleep Revolution?) $25 one that doesn&#x27;t use an elastic band falls short, especially since it tends to slip around a lot on my (male) head. This mask stays on securely, doesn&#x27;t stain fabric, and feels like a pillow for your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the sellers of these masks have jacked up the price quite a bit. I remember paying under $10 for two of them the first time I bought this. Now they&#x27;re edging pretty close to $20 for two and the other sellers seem to be going with it. Price wars usually push prices down, but it looks like this item has been put into a race to the top rather than a race to the bottom by the (non-Amazon) sellers.</li>
            <li> This sleep mask is very comfortable and effective in blocking out lights. The only downside is that the elastic bands lose elasticity within a few months or with wash, and the mask would slip off my face in the middle of the night. So I go through these pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for what I need. It&#x27;s not fancy (super silky or padded) but it blocks light and is so light weight that it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all when I sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my 2nd one of these masks. The elastic stretched on the last one but they&#x27;re cheap enough to replace if that happens.</li>
            <li> This is a great mask, soft, and comfy. The only thing is that I get a little hot on my face. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am an RN who works the night shift, 7pm to 7am and this is the best, most comfortable sleep mask I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s incredibly designed to block out the light so that I may sleep during the day. Love this product. Have used it for years. Just keep replenishing my home stock. They wash and wear well, very sturdy, yet they remain soft to the face.</li>
            <li> Yea it stinks out of the package. Smells of plastic and fabric just air it out a day before. Cant sleep without it</li>
            <li> This is the most comfortable sleeping mask I have (its better than my other five, including a memory foam mask). There is a pleasant aroma when opening the mask, it goes away after using it a few times. What I like about this mask is that it is both comfortable and form fitting (goes around the nose to block noise and has a soft fabric that adjusts to the face).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that doubling sleeping masks tends to produce the best darkening effect as well as a cupping of the face. For &amp;#34;doubling&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve found that using a heavier bulkier mask on the outside seems to work more effectively.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable, and does a great job of blocking the light. I wear these when my wife is watching TV, and they do a great job,  Nothing too fancy, and just what i was looking for.</li>
            <li> A favorite! I was given one as a gift a few years ago, and when it was time to replace, never gave a thought about trying a different sleep mask. Incredibly soft and love the extra little pillowy bit at the bottom; super effective in keeping light out!</li>
            <li> I had been looking for this sleep mask for years, and finally found it!! It&#x27;s so comfortable on my head with the adjustable strap, and the fabric is silky. Great product!</li>
            <li> My bedroom faces the east and has an uncovered half-moon window above the one with blinds.  In the summer the light begins to pour in before 5 AM and, being a light sleeper, I would wake up and have a difficult time getting back to sleep afterwards, which eventually, led me to search for a sleep mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased these masks and another, molded one that came with earplugs.  This is my very favorite and I shared the second of the set with my night-shift working daughter, as I felt it might help her get more rest during the day as well.  I&#x27;ve been using mine for a few months now and absolutely love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does take a little bit of getting used to, just to the feel of something on your face and around your head.  I&#x27;ve felt a little irritation on my ears occasionally but can easily adjust it to relieve that.  It fits my face and stays in place quite well without having the band on tightly.  I am a \\&quot;tummy sleeper\\&quot;, and this mask is so soft that it doesn&#x27;t feel uncomfortable against my pillow.  It&#x27;s just wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not noticed any scent on the ones that I received, and I checked because of the other reviewers comments.  I&#x27;ve hand-washed it numerous times now, then let it air dry and it&#x27;s ready to go again.  If anything, it&#x27;s just become softer but has not shown any signs of wear beyond that.  I&#x27;m now looking to order more, just to have on hand when this one is ready to be replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other, molded one seems a bit bigger but sits off your eyes, if that sensation would bother you.  I have a little more difficulty getting it to block all the light as well as this one, but it could be more attractive for larger faces or folks that are bothered by having something constantly touching their eyes like this one does.  Just my thoughts on that. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read many articles recently on the importance of getting adequate sleep for your mental and physical health.  If you are looking at sleep masks, you&#x27;re probably wanting to improve your rest for some reason.  I&#x27;d recommend you give this mask a try.  I don&#x27;t understand why some seem scented and some aren&#x27;t, but I am 100% pleased with the masks I received.  Most of those reviews are pretty old if you note that.</li>
            <li> I had sleep mask before, and I purchased it based on reviews. the quality is not great at all plus it kind of uncomfortable to sleep with.</li>
            <li> I buy these for my husband since I like to stay up later than him and the light from my reading lamp or the TV keeps him awake. He tried a number of eye masks but he likes these ones the best. They smell nice, they&#x27;re comfortable and they are not PINK. He&#x27;s very happy they are not pink. Most of the eye masks out there seem to be some sort of pink but these are definitely manly enough for him. He refused to wear \\&quot;frufru\\&quot; eye masks. They last a very long time but eventually, as with all things, they wear out. That makes this two pack is a great deal! They survive the washing machine just fine, though the lovely smell fades after the first washing, and eventually the elastic stretches out and gets loose to the point where the mask doesn&#x27;t stay on very well and must be replaced. He says these are soft and their fluffy nature allows the mask to hug the contours of his face and block out all the light.</li>
            <li> The strap is fairly wide elastic and has a velcro fastener. For me, the rough part of the velcro is pretty near my ear. I will cut off the supplied elastic and sew on two thinner pieces. The fabric feels good and the product is nice and light. It has a slightly puffed thickness to it, which I like. I soaked it overnight to get the smell out, which is like artificial lavender or something.</li>
            <li> Yes, this eye mask can block all the lights if you adjust it propely.    But it is not that comfort. Also, it will move around when I sleep.</li>
            <li> These are the perfect eyeshades. They&#x27;re soft and silky, the headband is adjustable, and there are these little folds around the nose area that you pop out so they block out light around your nose for total darkness. 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have tried nearly a dozen different sleep masks, and this is my favorite. It manages to block the light without gaping, and manages to keep from pressing on my eyes without any of the annoying padding or buldging cups I&#x27;ve experenced on others, which allows me to sleep comfortably in my sides. The material has remained silky after years of use. I also like the adjustable velcro strap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a new one recently as a back-up and was disappointed to find it scented, especially since I use it mainly for my migraines! However, with nothing to lose, I put it through my washing machine on \\&quot;cold\\&quot; and air-dried it. After that one wash, the scent was gone, and doesn&#x27;t irrtate my very sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You cannot beat this mask for comfort and effectiveness, especially for this price. still, give yourself enough time before needing it to throw it through the washing machine.</li>
            <li> My husband and I LOVE this product. Keeps out the morning light or the light when we wake up at different times. Makes the night more restfull. Would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> I like these masks a lot, but I found the elastic has stretched a lot over the past year or so I&#x27;ve owned them, so they aren&#x27;t as snug as they used to be. It would be nice if there was a longer Velcro piece to accommodate stretching. They are great for keeping out lights from the bedroom or street when I&#x27;m ready to sleep.</li>
            <li> Ii think this might be too small for a man&#x27;s face--but it is a good product and I like it better than the older heavier one.  I used it for the first time this morning when the sun came blasting through the window and it didn&#x27;t slide around and I got back to sleep.  It could be a little tighter.  This was an issue for me with the older version.  It&#x27;s also not too lightweight yet I did not get hot or sticky (but I live in a semi-arid climate).</li>
            <li> GREAT mask, I love how it is designed to not let any light in around your eyes!</li>
            <li> Wonderful soft mask to help you block out light.  It&#x27;s like a sleep fairy, once it goes on, I fall asleep.  Great for airplanes, Hotels and camping.</li>
            <li> Every once in a while, you may need to rest in the daytime because of work, illness, stress, a death in the family, getting sleep calibrated after a stay in the hospital or maybe even a flu or headache. When one of us needs to get rest during daylight hours, we&#x27;ve found these adjustible, large, soft and fluffy masks to be helpful. These come in an affordable 2-pack, which is great for spouses or roommates. At first, like other reviews tell, these smell strong. It&#x27;s supposed to be a lavendar scent, but it&#x27;s just odd. Fortunately, these wash well, but make sure the adjustible velcro is securely fixed and completely covering itself so that it doesn&#x27;t snag on other articles of clothing or linens in the wash. We also put them in a laundry bag purchased in grocery stores, drugstores, linen stores or, best of all, from your beloved Amazon. Washing them inside those bags not only further protects other items but also better protects lint and such from getting on the sleep masks, which is important because they are close to your eyes. In terms of pupil pain and undereye bags, we&#x27;re not sure how these would do for longterm use, but they&#x27;re helpful for occasional naps, so we assume they would do fine.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say the product is necessarily bad, but I certainly do not like it and am not pleased with the disparity between the description and the actual product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the amazon page says these eye-covers are made of cotton and silk, the product packaging and tags both indicate the product is cotton, silk, AND polyester. I would not have bought these had I known this as my wife reacts to polyester. This just leaves me with another useless set of eye covers that my wife can&#x27;t use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I personally find these uncomfortable. The silk is nothing like my nice soft silk shirts. It is still a shiny and smooth fabric, yet also an uncomfortably rough (I&#x27;m not sure how better to describe it -- it&#x27;s like running your skin over tiny closely spaced wires), fabric that is very hot to wear on your face. Furthermore, I found that I got a headache both times I tried wearing these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife has previously made some passable eye-covers out of cotton socks that we both can wear -- and I find significantly more comfortable. She&#x27;s suggested that maybe she can try taking these apart and using the straps and cotton parts and making better cotton-sock eye-covers. I&#x27;m skeptical and am considering returning these. I&#x27;m certainly not happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like the really slick-abrasive feeling fabrics like cheap silks or cheap satins, and if you don&#x27;t have any issue with the polyester in these, I can&#x27;t really see a problem with them. They could probably benefit from being a bit larger, but they&#x27;re &#x27;pillowy&#x27;-enough (for lack of a better word) to block out most of the light and fill in the gaps around the edges. Mystery as to why they give me a headache, but they&#x27;ve enough good reviews that it can&#x27;t be common.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving them 2 stars because I think the description is misleading and I don&#x27;t like them, but also because I think a more moderate rating would get this lost among rating of people who are happy with the item. I always read some of the reviews and I wish I&#x27;d seen a review like this before purchasing.</li>
            <li> This mask is perfect of someone wanting to block out light when they sleep. I lay on my side when I sleep which faces the bath room door.  My wife has to get up earlier than I do to get reay for work, so the light blinds me almost everday. Enter the mas to the rescue.  I love it and would never think of any other one.  A little complaint that I has was I had to add to the velcro strap in back, but that is because of my humongous head.  I can not wear any ball caps of any kind to give you and idea!  You&#x27;ll love it if you are an insomniac like me!</li>
            <li> Tag clearly says polyester. There are two in the pack, though, which is nice, but it had to go back.</li>
            <li> This mask has greatly increased the quality of my sleep. It&#x27;s very soft and has little \\&quot;pockets\\&quot; under each eye that help block out light more than a flat mask would. The adjustable head strap is also a big plus. Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended. Quality product. Works as described. Fair price. Fast shipment. Totally satisfied with purchase.  Would purchase again. Thanks :)</li>
            <li> Very soft and comfortable although scentless would be preferable. It is very fluffy and feels like a pillow for your eyes. Headband works great and is adjustable.</li>
            <li> I love this mask! I work nights and it&#x27;s almost impossible for me to get a full 8 hours of sleep. This mask helps so much. I am able to go right to sleep and stay asleep until I have to hit the snooze button. It&#x27;s very light and comfortable so you won&#x27;t even know it&#x27;s there.</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness- this thing feels like a pillow on your eyes!  So comforting and comfortable!!  Definitely recommended</li>
            <li> I use this occasionally when I go to sleep and I want absolutely no light beaming through my eyelids. This mask is comfy and can feel a bit uncomfortable at first because of the padding underneath, but you get used to it. Don&#x27;t expect it to stay on all night either. Sometimes it does stay on and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t. It depends on how much you move around I guess.</li>
            <li> Like is said before, these things really work. They fit nicely on the face and feel soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sleep better with these on, especially since i work late into the night and get up long after daylight.</li>
            <li> This sleep mask is super comfortable to sleep in. I use it every night and its so cozy and keeps the light out.</li>
            <li> Great eye-masks, totally blocks out light and is comfortable right out of the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my third purchase of this product, and I will be buying them again! My last set lasted about 6 months, and I only had to replace them because the dog tore them up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take note, there is a slight lavender scent to the product. I would not recommend this if you have any sort of allergy or irritability to lavender.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to the synthetic material on these! It itches my eyes. I&#x27;m never allergic to anything so I&#x27;m surprised, but I&#x27;m going to have to find something pure cotton.</li>
            <li> I use the Earth Therapeutics Sleep Mask every night.  Sleeping with a sleep mask is wonderful.  I find this brand works well for me and I recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I travel 50% of the time and love these for air travel and for the hotel.  They are soft and very dark.  I have tried many brands and find these the best.&lt;br /&gt;Like all eye masks, you will get lines sometimes on your face if you sleep on your side.</li>
            <li> They are too tight on the eyes.  Even after trying to make it smaller it still feels uncomfortable on the face!  Won&#x27;t buy this again</li>
            <li> As the title states it does what it was expected.  I get a little bit of light seeping in down at the bottom, but then again I have an Italian nose which may lift it a bit.  The elastic wears after a short while, but in my opinion that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> Works great for me working night shift and keeping the sun out of my eyes to sleep during the day</li>
            <li> great two for one deal. however there is no adjustment strap in case the elastic loosens. I imagine this will be an issue down the road.</li>
            <li> Nice flaps on inside bottom. Soft material. Strap shifts some during night but its not an issue. I would by again at this price.</li>
            <li> Great product. Came with two mask. It does not let any light in and unlike others is does not bother my ears.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable, even in the heat of the tropics, where I live. I sleep much better in the morning now that I can block that first light.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this much sleep since I used this eye mask. It&#x27;s soft on the face with just the right pressure, the strapping can be positioned awkward but doesn&#x27;t interfere much with my sleep. I sleep on my stomach so it doesn&#x27;t move around to much. No light comes in much and the smell isn&#x27;t bad at all to me. I sleep with it alllllll the time , it helps me fall asleep faster and into a deep sleep, I love it.</li>
            <li> I bought these as a backup to the exact same one my husband uses.  He loves it and I&#x27;ve heard no complaints.  He&#x27;s very picky too.  They block the light very well and they are very soft and comfortable.  The silky material helps it to not be hot and sweaty.</li>
            <li> I bought this mask when I was a new mom and needed to fall asleep quickly while my baby slept - can&#x27;t imagine sleeping without one now!</li>
            <li> I had never worn a sleep mask until I received one of these several years ago as a gift. But when my son and daughter in law came to visit me, my son thought it was his and accidently took it as he had an identical one. When they got back home to Washinton state, my daughter-in-law called and asked if I wanteed her to send it back. Of course said, &amp;#34;no, you keep it and enjoy it&amp;#34;, I can get another one. I looked for over a year and never came across this brand until here! So I ordered a whole pack! I kept two and gave the others as gifts! Thank you! Thank you! These are the best!&lt;br /&gt;N in Vegas</li>
            <li> I am glad that I found this sleep mask. I have 4 of them so I can change them every 2 to 3 days. They work great!</li>
            <li> I really like this sleep mask, and I really want to like it better than I do.&lt;br /&gt;The problem is, the elastic stretches out very easily and I have to purchase new sets because it will not stay on my face.&lt;br /&gt;For me it&#x27;s too big to start with, and then stretches out more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have thought about sewing the elastic together so it will fit properly on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Will have to give that a try before I completely give these up and go with something different.</li>
            <li> I think it will get the job done, for blocking out light when traveling. But, the package only contained one mask, not two as advertised.</li>
            <li> Comfy, light weight, fairly long-lasting, have ordered before, will be ordering again. also, price beats anything we can find in local stores.</li>
            <li> Someone mentioned fragrance in the review but I didn&#x27;t notice a scent. Have thrown it in the washing machine a few times now (not the dryer) and it has held up pretty well. Totally does the trick.</li>
            <li> Had masks from the corner pharmacy. Terrible. This one blocks the light and is comfortable to wear. Oh yes, I use the velcro straps on the last i/4 inch and they hold. And you get two in a package.    Will buy again when these wear out.</li>
            <li> Although this seemed like a nice mask, it left dark blue marks all over the pillowcases and sheets. My husband must have gotten a little sweaty and the mask is not colorfast. It went into the garbage.</li>
            <li> I wear a sleep mask every night and these are my favorite.  They fit snugly, but not too much so (they&#x27;re adjustable), they don&#x27;t move and most importantly - they keep the light out!  I have tried several different types and styles of masks and these are the ones I come back to.  My oldest one of these is at least 8 years old, and the elastic is just starting to go after lots of use and machine washings.  That&#x27;s pretty good!  The only con is that in the summer it can get a bit warm and make me sweat, but I sweat easily.  Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> This mask USED TO be my all time favorite sleep mask. It was well made, blocked the light really well, and the materials were so soft. Unfortunately, they recently changed the material that the material is rougher and smells rather synthetic.</li>
            <li> I really like this mask, it does a good job of keeping the light out if adjusted right and is cushioned for great comfort. I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars though because the elastic on the head band weakens over a relatively short period of time and I have to sew it to adjust it. The Velcro is fine but it only wraps so far, so once the elastic gets weak, the Velcro is useless. But I still buy these as they are the best at creating the greatest darkness. I&#x27;ve worn them in a room with full sunlight coming it and achieved complete visual darkness.</li>
            <li> Price is for 2.  Delivered on time.  Very comfortable head strap with velcro adjustment.  I will definately buy this item again.</li>
            <li> Thank You so much.  Not only do the masks block out light but they are well made and comfortable -- much better than hiding your eyes under your arm.</li>
            <li> smooth silky, very comfortable to wear, covers your eyes completely, I highly recommend it, if you are looking for a good sleepmask this is the right one</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for this sleep mask for a while and am so glad I found it. The silk is soft against your eyes, and not sweaty-feeling like the cheaper synthetic materials. It washes easily in the washer - just hang dry. The mask blocks out the light very well, and is well-fitted around the nose, where light likes to seep in... I travel a lot for work and this mask does the trick, on the plane or in hotels...or at home!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought several of these and have given some as gifts. It blocks out the light well and is cushioned against my eyes. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the velcro strap curls slightly at the back of my head. Not a big deal but just thought I would mention it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend with a new baby. She loooooved it! Helped her get some needed rest. She said her husband used it a couple of time too!</li>
            <li> We ordered this pack of eye masks since we both have light blinds to match with our bedroom colors but have trouble sleeping n on weekends due to the sun shinning so brightly in the room. They work great, are very soft and not noticeable on the eyes and have a nice design on them. Overall good purchase.</li>
            <li> Love this it really blocks the light, so I can sleep while my husband reads.</li>
            <li> The mask is amazingly comfortable. It blocks out light better than any other sleep mask I&#x27;ve tried (and I have tried a few!) The side straps could be a little more comfortable, however, that is the downfall of most masks. I&#x27;m ordering more as presents for friends.</li>
            <li> I really like these, but lacking the contour that many of the others have. The fragrance dissipated quickly. They do a good job of blocking the light. I am not super sensitive to this as I know many are. If you are, I would recommend these. They stay on well.</li>
            <li> I like it, but it doesn&#x27;t keep all of the light out, and the bands wear out a little fast. Feels good, and i really like the light lavender scent.</li>
            <li> This sleep mask works great.&lt;br /&gt;Light weight, and easy to put on.&lt;br /&gt;The adjustable strap ensures it always stays put.&lt;br /&gt;The inside of the mask is black, so it blocks out all light.&lt;br /&gt;Helps you get a great nights sleep.</li>
            <li> Very rough material that has not softened with use.  Also caused the skin around my eyes to break out (I&#x27;ve never had the issue before &amp; do not have overly sensitive skin)</li>
            <li> I work graveyard so I need these to help me to fall asleep and not wake up since one of the walls is about 80% windows and a glass door. I am not sure if I will buy these again, they are slippery, they dont stay on and sometimes they hold too tight and press onto your eyes and when you wake up your eyes are all hurting....Oh well you get what you paid for...</li>
            <li> It keeps light out as it&#x27;s supposed to do, but the strap really cuts into the top of the ear and it&#x27;s a little awkward to sleep with the strap above/pressed up against your ears. The velcro is really sharp, so when I loosen the velcro strap, the &amp;#34;barbs&amp;#34; of the velcro tear at my pillow, damaging the fabric. So I have to sleep with these with the mask on really tight to prevent the velcro-barbs from damaging the pillows. I&#x27;ve tried putting tape over it but it falls off because I toss-and-turn a lot.&lt;br /&gt;Aside from all that discomfort stuff, it works and it&#x27;s good enough for now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased these masks before from another retailer and loved them. I&#x27;m not sure if what I received through this site was a knock-off...? I ordered this set from Amazon in January and only recently actually opened the pack. They smelled terrible. I was able to get rid of the odor after washing them though. The biggest issue is that they are extremely uncomfortable. The velcro strap is extremely short - I can barely fit it around my head on the loosest possible setting (I don&#x27;t have a large head). And the fibers in the filling keep working their way through the inside of the mask and itch my face all night. It&#x27;s like having little hairs rub all over my face. I&#x27;m really disappointed that I wasted my money on these.</li>
            <li> Just as promised.  They are smooth and soft and&lt;br /&gt;cant help but promote food sleep.  We shall wear&lt;br /&gt;them in good health.</li>
            <li> I love this soft, silky sleep mask. Adjustable too, I also bought one for my husband and he loves it too!</li>
            <li> We have skylights in our bedroom, so having lots of light when I want to sleep is unavoidable and a major problem for me since I&#x27;m extremely sensitive to light (even the blue light of the DVD player from the next room is enough to annoy me).  I am sleeping so much better with this mask!  Not only do I not wake up with the sun in the morning, but I fall asleep better and sleep more soundly!  I had only thought it would help with the light - not entirely sure why it&#x27;s helping me sleep more deeply.  I know some reviews didn&#x27;t like the &#x27;bumps&#x27; over the eyes and I was definitely nervous about that, but they haven&#x27;t bothered me at all and I actually think that contributes to me sleeping more deeply.  It does slide to the side or off my head occasionally, but I prefer to keep the band loose.  Usually I just wake up long enough to fix it and surprisingly manage to go right back to sleep.</li>
            <li> Like previously mentioned, this product arrives smelling like lavender but it doesn&#x27;t last longer than a day or two. Personally I didn&#x27;t mind because I&#x27;d rather it be scentless anyway. I didn&#x27;t experience any allergic reactions, and neither did the person who is using the second mask from the pack of 2. The mask is soft and padded and blocks the light exceedingly well. Also, it is not too tight and has adjustable elastic bands to suit everybody. The only light that comes through is around the nose, which is always an issue regardless of the product. I&#x27;ve tried plenty of different sleep masks, though, and this is definitely one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> Great sleep mask and wonderful that it comes in a two pack.  I&#x27;m using one and put one in the drawer by our guest bed.  I like how the flaps at the lower portion of the eye mask shade out light from shining in by my nose.  I like the relative thinness of the mask.  I bought this during the heat of a hot summer and it has blocked plenty of the light without leaving me feeling smothered (like the Louis and Clark mask).  I also like the fact that the adjustable strap uses a velcro closure.</li>
            <li> Great Sleep Mask.  I have worked nights for twenty years, sleep days and have been looking for a mask that keeps out the light.  Finally found the right one.  Adjustable strap, very comfortable.  Soothing aroma.  I am sold</li>
            <li> So, I compulsively went through a bunch of the amazon options and read a ton of reviews and this is the one I ended up gambling with.  It&#x27;s soft, it protects the sunlight well, it hasn&#x27;t bled or anything even with perspiration-inducing conditions, and the smell was nice and not overwhelming though it went away in a day or two.  The con - it hurts the top of my ears!  Like, cuts into them so i find myself waking and adjusting it up.  For such a simple thing you&#x27;d think a product existed that&#x27;d stay on the face block light and not cut the ears.. thats all I ask.  These do all of them but cut into where the ears are fixed, but not so bad you can&#x27;t accommodate for it by pulling the strap higher.  I guess.  Idk, writing this I knocked it down from 4 to 3, just because given the price you can get slightly less soft and maybe a little less light blocking products for a heck of a lot cheaper.  So there you go.</li>
            <li> Lavender smell fades quickly, but nothing that some essential oil won&#x27;t fix. Good sleeping mask. Nothing special, but it is very soft. Still using it after about 3 years of owning it.</li>
            <li> I have to sleep with a sleep mask on every night because I sleep with my eyes open and they get dried out. These have a little puffy lip on the inside that sits right on top of your eyelid, and therefore keep your eyes closed.  So I would highly recommend these to anyone who sleeps with their eyes open!  They do have a really weird, chemical smell to them.  They&#x27;re supposed to have a &#x27;calming&#x27; smell, but honestly it is just sickening.  I leave them out of the package for about a week before I actually sleep with them to let them air out; it helps tremendously. Once you get rid of the smell, they&#x27;re great.  Also, the elastic does stretch after a while, but it does that on any sleep mask and it&#x27;s usually time to replace it at that point anyway.</li>
            <li> I work the night shift and it is vital that I get my sleep to be able to function properly.  These sleep masks are perfect!  No light gets in!  It is comfortable to wear and it allows me to open my eyes inside the mask.  I wake up and am left with no lines on my face from wearing this sleep mask.  I just bought two more of these as my other two seem to have walked off on their own.  I will not be without this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this mask for 2 years and I am just now replacing it with a new one due to the elastic finally stretching out and needing a more snug fit. For less than six dollars per mask you really can&#x27;t go wrong giving this mask a try. I have been tempted by some of the more expensive fancy eye masks, but this works--why waste money?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The elastic band that holds the mask on is easy to adjust and fastens with a piece of Velcro. The only problem with the elastic band is that over time it becomes stretched out, but thankfully the Velcro will stick anywhere on the elastic so it can be pulled tighter and tighter. I have never had any problems with the Velcro coming undone in the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sleep mask has just the right amount of thickness to it and is easy to use and adjust. The mask itself covers my eyes completely and is thick enough that I could sleep with a light on and not know it. I do have to put it on my face just right and sintch up the elastic so it&#x27;s fairly snug but it does a good job of blocking the light. It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my face and I don&#x27;t feel smothered. It did take a few nights sleep for me to get used to something resting on my face but now it is a trigger for me that it&#x27;s time to fall asleep.</li>
            <li> This is the best eye mask ever.  I got it a few years ago for me and my husband and every year I order a new one so it can be fluffy and fresh (I wear make-up to bed sometimes).  YES this eye mask does smell like lavender, it is only strong a day or so...but I LOVE lavender and it calms me...so perfect!!!  I would highly reccommend this eye mask...my husband can&#x27;t travel away from home without it!</li>
            <li> these are the best fitting .and very comfy. has added pouches on the inside that block light from coming in around the nose but i had to give then only 3 stars because the elastic band goes bad around 2 to 3 months. looses its stretch. i bought some elastic 1/2&amp;#34; and cut the old band and stapled the new one in its place,</li>
            <li> Very silky and soft (I know my fabrics and this product IS made of silk and cotton,  perhaps the padding is polyester).  Large enough to hug your face and block out light.  The strap could be a little different -  I have a pretty big head, and I have to go all the way to the end of the velcro on each strap to make it tight enough (in other words, the straps are pretty long!!)  But all in all I love it.  Just what I was wanting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a minty/lavender scent to it right out of the package, but if you leave them out to air, it goes away almost immediately.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these for an overseas trip. They were soft and served the purpose but I don&#x27;t give out 5 stars unless there is something that stands out.</li>
            <li> I love this mask. It keeps all of the light out, it is very comfortable, I never have creases on my face from the mask and I don&#x27;t have to worry about it pinching me. It is a little big but I just safety pinned it smaller.</li>
