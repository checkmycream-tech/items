            <li>I found it on Amazon and am getting those compliments again even though I am quite a bit older!!!  </li>
            <li>BUT WELL WORTH IT.</li>
            <li>It would be a rare thing for me to not find what I want with Amazon.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own simply because it&#x27;s quite &amp;#34;frosty&amp;#34; but for those who like that</li>
            <li>With barely a click or two of my mouse, my favorite lipstick is now being delivered within a matter of days right to my front door.</li>

            <li>Amazon never fails to amaze me at the variety of items you have.  </li>
            <li>Exactly the product that was desired, a discontinued product.  </li>
            <li>; Now if the company would put their smart cap on.........</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere reasonably priced til</li>
            <li>next time I need this product it will be available.</li>

            <li>It is a fabulous lipstick to use alone or especially to (mute)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this product to brighten and tone up darker, duller colors of which I have a drawer full - it does do that, but like most older lipsticks - especially &amp;#34;frosts&amp;#34; it does dry somewhat, which is why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars -</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to find a new color lipstick or makeup just to replace it with something I had to settled for.........</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying Cover Girl Continuous Color Lipstick, Natural Frost for years.</li>

            <li> It has become increasingly difficult to find this particular lipstick in my local stores.</li>
            <li> Then I decided to check Amazon and of course as usual</li>
            <li> My product (five lipsticks) are fine, however the shipping charges were outrageous.  </li>
            <li> At least tell us what color and formula is the cloested to this color ? ? ?</li>
            <li> Why is it so expensive from other CoverGirl lipsticks in the stores?</li>

            <li> It is exactly what I wanted, only wish I could have bought more. Let me know if you have more of this item</li>
            <li> I wish we could still get this lipstick in stores.  It&#x27;s the perfect color for almost everybody. Covergirl is a good product.</li>
            <li> I would like for you to make this same colour again.  It is my favourite and have looked everywhere for a similiar colour and cant find one.</li>
            <li> Glad you had this out of stock lipstick.  It is my favorite color.  So sorry CG took it off the marker but happy that I was able to guy all you had.</li>
            <li> My color!  Couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere reasonably priced til this site. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I was crestfallen when I discovered by favorite lipstick had been discontinued by Cover Girl. How happy I was to learn you had some in stock. I ordered five tubes, but probably should&#x27;ve ordered 10 or 20!    Thank you for your services!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying Cover Girl Continuous Color Lipstick, Natural Frost for years. It has become increasingly difficult to find this particular lipstick in my local stores. I feared it was being discontinued. As a last resort I turned to the internet. Thankfully, Amazon.com came to the rescue. With barely a click or two of my mouse, my favorite lipstick is now being delivered within a matter of days right to my front door. How fabulous is that!</li>
            <li> Well I have worn this color for years and years and then they I thought discontinued it. Then I decided to check Amazon and of course as usual I should have checked Amazon first cause you had it!!  Amazon never fails to amaze me at the variety of items you have.  It would be a rare thing for me to not find what I want with Amazon.  Love the Amazon.com.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I found this item by searching on  the internet for this color and brand. The service as very good. I received the items today</li>
            <li> wish these weren&#x27;t being discontinued</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lipstick and and greatly disappointed the color is no longer available.</li>
            <li> Been using this since 1963. My rule is &amp;#34;DO NOT FIX IT IF IT IS NOT BROKEN&amp;#34; Now if the company would put their smart cap on.........</li>
            <li> Happy you had my color.  This product is great.  Hope next time I need this product it will be available.</li>
            <li> This is one of c/c&#x27;s best colors and i do not understand why it was discontinued...what is so special i think, it goes with any skin tone regardless of your age or any skin tone disorders.  For someone over 67 this color works with everything. why cover girl did this get discontinued. At least tell us what color and formula is the cloested to this color ? ? ?</li>
            <li> I wore this lipstick in the 80&amp;#34;s and always received compliments. I found it on Amazon and am getting those compliments again even though I am quite a bit older!!!  Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> I could not believe that I found this discontinued product on Amazon. I had look everywhere for this item. I have used the product for years and had no idea that it&lt;br /&gt;would be discontinued. It is a fabulous lipstick to use alone or especially to (mute)&lt;br /&gt;a lipstick that is too bright. All I can say is that I find this to be a great reward for me&lt;br /&gt;to be able to buy something that I thought was gone for good!!!!</li>
            <li> Exactly the product that was desired, a discontinued product.  I see now the person who offered the product is now doing business under a different name.</li>
            <li> I rated GoverGirl five stars because they carry products that are good quality and in stock.  I don&#x27;t have to find a new color lipstick or makeup just to replace it with something I had to settled for.........</li>

            <li> Color is a little different than the Natural Frost I have used for years.  The texture is good but&lt;br /&gt;it is not as good a color as Natural Frost!</li>
