    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>That was excellent!</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it yet but am impressed with the amount of designs,</li>
            <li>My mom was happy about that.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great way to test out an area</li>
            <li>Excellent product and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to get more and keep designing,!!  </li>
            <li>you do NOT have an allergic reaction, I would suggest that the gel itself is very effective.  </li>
            <li>The color of the tattoo came out good</li>
            <li>That is good for people who swim a lot.  </li>
            <li>Good directions included</li>
            <li>otherwise, effective.</li>
            <li>I wish I had the recipe to make my own.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>It was very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>This jagua gel is the best that I have come across so far!  </li>
            <li>It was easy to use and stayed on for over a week every time!</li>
            <li>It comes with more jagua than you think.  </li>
            <li>Love this product because it stains well</li>
            <li>Some more instructions would have been helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>the way, I found a better version of this product elsewhere that doesn&#x27;t cost the earth in shipping, expedited or not.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the safest and has way better results.</li>
            <li>I ordered some more from Earth Henna.</li>
            <li>you think you want a tattoo, but aren&#x27;t sure.</li>
            <li>the main product lol</li>
            <li>The ink stays a long time, and people were impressed with it.</li>
            <li>However, if you are not worried about doing very detailed work, or if you are using a stencil, it should be fine.  </li>
            <li>Other than that this product works great!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s easy to apply, and we used the hectographic paper included in the kit to transfer outlines on the skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say the color was strong for about 6-7 days before it started to fade off my foot.</li>
            <li>It works amazing and does exactly what it promises.  </li>
            <li>everything looks super easy to use.</li>
            <li>I had a significant allergic reaction to it.</li>
            <li>We left the gel on for a good five to six hours before removing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary</li>
            <li>The feet and the hands are where it showed up the darkest and most like a real tattoo.</li>
            <li>My only critique would be for there to be more transfer paper!</li>
            <li>The metal dispenser tip that is supplied worked very well at outlines that could then be filled in.  </li>
            <li>I had so much fun  </li>
            <li>It was fun to use.</li>
            <li>I will most certainly be buying from this company when I need a new bottle.</li>
            <li>It became very dark as desired over one day, and stayed very dark for two more days - great!  </li>
            <li>Jagua, I think, is a little better than henna because it seems to be more resistant to water and clorine.  </li>
            <li>A nice navy blue pattern was very clear.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and my girlfriend went first</li>
            <li>After taking the gel off, I saw many tiny dotted areas of the design where the stain didn&#x27;t seem to \\&quot;take.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>It looked like a poorly filled in old tattoo.</li>
            <li>It is still not that true shade that is needed for a realistic large tattoo</li>
            <li>On all of our skin tones, the gel left an amazing, blue/black stain that really looks like a realistic tattoo.  </li>
            <li>she used the stencil which is small tattoo and which  came out good</li>
            <li>cool idea and great for small tattoo designs especially with the stencils</li>
            <li>and it is easy and simple to use.  </li>
            <li>Lol&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;am pretty much sleeved with real tattoos.</li>
            <li>We put a large design on the chest, arms and backs of hands.  </li>
            <li>if people who know nothing about tattoos, they believed them to be \\&quot;real.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;This is a fun product  that works and Much better than toxic \\&quot;black henna.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>but I would say it is fine for a smaller temp tat.</li>
            <li>I wanted to get a real tatoo</li>
            <li>and my daughters (very tan).  </li>
            <li>Ha ha, it is really like</li>
            <li>I bought this for a Halloween outfit that required a full back tattoo.</li>
            <li>The jagua is natural, looks real, and is a cheaper alternative to a real tattoo.</li>
            <li>do not have any other allergies that I know of and have used natural (brown) henna on my skin many times without problems.  </li>
            <li>then the ink sheet fell on the tile in the bathroom and got wet (without me realizing it for a day) and now I have a huge purple spot on the tile.</li>
            <li>So if you are wanting to do this for an event or something, paint it on the day before and be sure to peel the dried gel off after about 2-4 hours-it needs oxygen to darken.</li>
            <li>On the fourth day, high friction areas on hands started to wear, and then it all went downhill very quickly over the next day.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised how effective it was based on other reviewers&#x27; comments about it only leaving a faded bluish tint to the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The designs were cute, and the gel wasn&#x27;t messy at all!</li>
            <li>We were surprised when we peeled the gel off, and the design was gone!</li>
            <li>I would not describe my skin as overly sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have had no reaction to the paste .</li>
            <li>We had fun painting each other.</li>
            <li>It faded a bit faster than we liked, but would use it again for a temporary dramatic look.</li>
            <li>Buy regular, natural henna.</li>
            <li>not black (navy Blue)  </li>
            <li>its a dark blue no where near black its very navy blue and you can see the glob strokes and it truly looks like a faded sharpie  in fact use a sharpie much cheeper</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty much as pale as one can get without being albino, even then I could give an albino a run for their money.</li>
            <li>well its easy to apply and use!&lt;br /&gt;just not happy with the way the jell took to anyones skin i used in on a few people and just didnt take very well</li>
    </ol>

            <li> well its easy to apply and use!&lt;br /&gt;just not happy with the way the jell took to anyones skin i used in on a few people and just didnt take very well</li>
            <li> The brown henna which I normally use lasts longer,  but some of my customers at my henna shop want the blue black color of the jagua.</li>
            <li> so i was sooo excited when i found a (supposedly black) temperary tattoo kit and from the very few vids i found it looked great.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe it was me, but the design didn&#x27;t last as long as I thought it would.  </li>
            <li> The designs lasted at least ten days (and lots of time in the pool) without much fading.  </li>
            <li> looked like a semi dark grey after done not black</li>
            <li> mostky from little old ladies, if you can believe that.</li>
            <li> Those dots are where small red sores/blisters subsequently developed.  </li>
            <li> The ink stays for a long time.</li>
            <li> It took me a long time to try and figure out the stencil.</li>
            <li> When removed there was a slight stain but barely anything.</li>
            <li> There is still a faded little outline left now 16 days later.</li>
            <li> I give this a poor rating because of the customer service and shipping time/charges, not for the product itself, which worked okay, although the pages and pages of poorly drawn designs weren&#x27;t strictly necessary.</li>
            <li> Its a navy blue on pale skin.</li>
            <li> The gel is difficult to work with at first, as it is a bit clumpy.  </li>
            <li> used this to create small feminine stars and dots next to my eye along my temple area, yes on my face.  </li>
            <li> Other reviews are correct, this will not turn out black.</li>
            <li> My skin is still inflamed where the ink was applied and this is at least ten days after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t show up as dark on the shoulders.</li>
            <li> On a darker skin tone this could come close to looking black.</li>
            <li> It lasted a little over a week.</li>
            <li> so when drawing it comes out in globs not smooth.  </li>
            <li> The stencils that come with it are a little small.</li>
            <li> I used it on myself (very pale skin)</li>
            <li> the next day i did a half sleeve tribal tattoo design needless to say this is a much larger tattoo design when done looks HORRIBLE  </li>
            <li> Not a good look!</li>
            <li> it turns like an ugly brownish color and you cant paint it on thin.</li>
            <li> I tested this product before hand and it turned a horrible shade of dark gray/blue...</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T waste your $$!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It looks TERRIBLE when done.</li>

            <li> well its easy to apply and use!&lt;br /&gt;just not happy with the way the jell took to anyones skin i used in on a few people and just didnt take very well&lt;br /&gt;HOW ever the overall everything else was usefull just not the main product lol</li>
            <li> I bought and used this product. I received it just 3-4 days after the order was sent.  The color of the tattoo came out good but it lasted only about 8-9 days, not 15 days. The brown henna which I normally use lasts longer,  but some of my customers at my henna shop want the blue black color of the jagua. I am still looking for jagua which will last 15 days on the hands and feet area.</li>
            <li> This jagua gel is the best that I have come across so far!  It works amazing and does exactly what it promises.  I had so much fun  designing on all my friends and family members.  It comes with more jagua than you think.  It almost seems like it will never run out.  Jagua, I think, is a little better than henna because it seems to be more resistant to water and clorine.  That is good for people who swim a lot.  I can&#x27;t wait to get more and keep designing,!!  - A henna and jagua designer</li>
            <li> I wanted to get a real tatoo but my daughter wouldn&#x27;t let me so I tried this product. It was fun to use.</li>
            <li> It looks TERRIBLE when done. The color reminds me of the look of a faded sharpie marker. Not a good look! DON&#x27;T waste your $$!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought two of these kits for my daughter &amp; she loves them. She uses it on everybody from her grandmother to her friends. The ink stays for a long time. Excellent product and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> A tattoo without the pain and healing process! The jagua is natural, looks real, and is a cheaper alternative to a real tattoo. You can also experiment if you are considering a tattoo. I will most certainly be buying from this company when I need a new bottle.</li>
            <li> so i was sooo excited when i found a (supposedly black) temperary tattoo kit and from the very few vids i found it looked great.&lt;br /&gt;i ordered it and my girlfriend went first she used the stencil which is small tattoo and which  came out good looked like a semi dark grey after done not black really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;then the next day i did a half sleeve tribal tattoo design needless to say this is a much larger tattoo design when done looks HORRIBLE  its a dark blue no where near black its very navy blue and you can see the glob strokes and it truly looks like a faded sharpie  in fact use a sharpie much cheeper same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so the pros and cons are&lt;br /&gt;PROS  cool idea and great for small tattoo designs especially with the stencils&lt;br /&gt;CONS  not black (navy Blue)  tip gets clogged with oil from skin so when drawing it comes out in globs not smooth.  you can see the strokes in the design if its a fill in tattoo.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and two days later it was already at my door! It was easy to use and stayed on for over a week every time! My only critique would be for there to be more transfer paper! Other than that this product works great!</li>
            <li> Maybe it was me, but the design didn&#x27;t last as long as I thought it would.  It lasted a little over a week. My mom was happy about that.</li>
            <li> Love this product because it stains well and it is easy and simple to use.  Will buy again in the future!</li>
            <li> I give this a poor rating because of the customer service and shipping time/charges, not for the product itself, which worked okay, although the pages and pages of poorly drawn designs weren&#x27;t strictly necessary. Some more instructions would have been helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this for a gift and so chose expedited shipping, which stated this would arrive within four business days. When the item didn&#x27;t turn up, I emailed the seller. The item arrived in FIVE business days, which isn&#x27;t what I paid for, as that meant it came after the weekend. I notified the seller of this as well. It took them three weeks to respond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I found a better version of this product elsewhere that doesn&#x27;t cost the earth in shipping, expedited or not.</li>
            <li> This product should be used with caution.  I had a significant allergic reaction to it. After taking the gel off, I saw many tiny dotted areas of the design where the stain didn&#x27;t seem to \\&quot;take.\\&quot;  Those dots are where small red sores/blisters subsequently developed.  The gel did not itch or burn at any time during application. My skin is still inflamed where the ink was applied and this is at least ten days after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not have any other allergies that I know of and have used natural (brown) henna on my skin many times without problems.  I would not describe my skin as overly sensitive.  If you use this product, do a patch test first!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do NOT have an allergic reaction, I would suggest that the gel itself is very effective.  I used it on myself (very pale skin) and my daughters (very tan).  On all of our skin tones, the gel left an amazing, blue/black stain that really looks like a realistic tattoo.  I was surprised how effective it was based on other reviewers&#x27; comments about it only leaving a faded bluish tint to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to apply, and we used the hectographic paper included in the kit to transfer outlines on the skin.  (It&#x27;s just like how tattoo shops use paper to transfer designs onto the skin before they start the actual tattoo.  There are several tutorials online to find out how to use the paper, by the way.)  The designs lasted at least ten days (and lots of time in the pool) without much fading.  We left the gel on for a good five to six hours before removing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: Allergic reactions can be severe, even on those who don&#x27;t have skin problems, so do a patch test:  otherwise, effective.</li>
            <li> The designs were cute, and the gel wasn&#x27;t messy at all! Very easy to use. The ink stays a long time, and people were impressed with it.</li>
            <li> The gel is difficult to work with at first, as it is a bit clumpy.  However, if you are not worried about doing very detailed work, or if you are using a stencil, it should be fine.  The metal dispenser tip that is supplied worked very well at outlines that could then be filled in.  We put a large design on the chest, arms and backs of hands.  It became very dark as desired over one day, and stayed very dark for two more days - great!  On the fourth day, high friction areas on hands started to wear, and then it all went downhill very quickly over the next day.  It faded a bit faster than we liked, but would use it again for a temporary dramatic look.</li>
            <li> Other reviews are correct, this will not turn out black. Its a navy blue on pale skin. I&#x27;m pretty much as pale as one can get without being albino, even then I could give an albino a run for their money. On a darker skin tone this could come close to looking black. The blue shade was not a problem for me at all.  I have sensitive skin and have had no reaction to the paste . I allowed the paste 2.5 hours to sit on my skin. When removed there was a slight stain but barely anything. This is stated in the directions that after the paste is removed you will not automatically see the finished effect. Three hours later, Bam! A nice navy blue pattern was very clear.&lt;br /&gt;I used this to create small feminine stars and dots next to my eye along my temple area, yes on my face.  I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments on it. mostky from little old ladies, if you can believe that. Lol&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;am pretty much sleeved with real tattoos. So anyone who knows tattoos can see these stars aren&#x27;t \\&quot;real.\\&quot; For the vast number if people who know nothing about tattoos, they believed them to be \\&quot;real.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;This is a fun product  that works and Much better than toxic \\&quot;black henna.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It looked like I got a permanent marker and drew all over myself. I was totally unsatisfied. Buy regular, natural henna. It&#x27;s the safest and has way better results.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a Labor Day Camping trip with a group of friends. We had fun painting each other. We were surprised when we peeled the gel off, and the design was gone! Ha ha, it is really like the package says-it develops over time. Don&#x27;t worry it comes back.  So if you are wanting to do this for an event or something, paint it on the day before and be sure to peel the dried gel off after about 2-4 hours-it needs oxygen to darken. The feet and the hands are where it showed up the darkest and most like a real tattoo. It didn&#x27;t show up as dark on the shoulders. The stencils that come with it are a little small. I ordered some more from Earth Henna. It&#x27;s a great way to test out an area you think you want a tattoo, but aren&#x27;t sure. I&#x27;d say the color was strong for about 6-7 days before it started to fade off my foot. There is still a faded little outline left now 16 days later. Yes I will buy this again!</li>
            <li> it turns like an ugly brownish color and you cant paint it on thin. It took me a long time to try and figure out the stencil. I just ended up throwing it in my bathroom...  then the ink sheet fell on the tile in the bathroom and got wet (without me realizing it for a day) and now I have a huge purple spot on the tile.</li>
            <li> Ordered this n 2 days later I had them in hand. That was excellent! Haven&#x27;t used it yet but am impressed with the amount of designs, the transfer paper n everything looks super easy to use. I wish I had the recipe to make my own.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter and I. Will post once the tattoo developes! It was very easy to apply. Good directions included</li>
            <li> After applying the Jaqua Tattoo on my body, my skin started itching and it swelled up.  I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a Halloween outfit that required a full back tattoo. I tested this product before hand and it turned a horrible shade of dark gray/blue...It looked like a poorly filled in old tattoo. I contacted customer service who promptly replaced the product for me. It is still not that true shade that is needed for a realistic large tattoo but I would say it is fine for a smaller temp tat. I gave it four stars because the customer service rocks.</li>
