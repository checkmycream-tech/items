            <li>They love them!</li>
            <li>I LOVE these make up brushes!  </li>
            <li>My girlfriends love and and so do I!</li>
            <li>I have even bought more for Christmas presents!</li>
            <li>Great makeup brush set for a super price!</li>
            <li>(so you don&#x27;t end up with eyeshadow all over your face), and apply it amazingly.</li>
            <li>set contains a nice assortment of brushes.</li>
            <li>Brushes felt and looked good and the case was cute.</li>
            <li>Well, I honestly can&#x27;t see any reason not to give it five stars.</li>
            <li>Got here on time, everything was as it should be, nice case that it came in, &amp; even came with cleaning instructions.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been wanting a nice set of makeup brushes for quite a while.  </li>
            <li>But then I thought it&#x27;ll be nice to give it a try, so I did.</li>
            <li>The variety of brushes is nice.</li>
            <li>Bought this as a gift for my daughter and she loved the huge selection of brushes and the nice looking case that it came in.</li>
            <li>friends assured me that the receiver of my makeup brush gift will be pleased to pull out these makeup brushes around her girlfriends ... and that both she (and I!) will be pleased with the results of her makeup.  </li>
            <li>... maybe my MANY research efforts will be appropriately rewarded!</li>
            <li>daughter, who is much more experienced with make up application, suggested that I purchase the brushes with the hope that I would enjoy and experiment with make up a bit more.</li>
            <li>Nice insert with instructions on caring for the brushes and also more tips and instructions in followup email from the seller.</li>
            <li>At first, i didn&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll work as great as drugstore brushes and wasn&#x27;t about to get them.</li>
            <li>Nice variety of brushes, pretty good quality.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m totally sure it&#x27;s VERY important ...</li>
            <li>One of my favorite types of brushes is a foundation brush, and the foundation brush in this set distributes liquid foundation evenly.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are so soft and feel incredible on my face.</li>
            <li>I had no idea there would be so many choices on colors and brushes</li>
            <li>She pulled on the brush hair to make sure they wouldn’t fall out like the ones she has, and they didn’t.</li>
            <li>And yes, they&#x27;re MUCH better than the applicators that come with the makeup.</li>
            <li>and when I used the brushes this morning, they held my makeup nicely and felt smooth on my face.  </li>
            <li>I also enjoyed using the brushes...</li>
            <li>In this case, it MAY be possible that daughter knew best!</li>
            <li>The brushes started shedding, when I put my powder foundation on I had a couple hairs on my face which was okay</li>
            <li>I just picked them off, but now so many hairs are falling off that they&#x27;re all over my face</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d get a better set.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love these brushes.</li>
            <li>Great quality and very durable.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>These definitely aren&#x27;t the best brushes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Really glad that I ordered these brushes.</li>
            <li>I love the feel of these brushes.</li>
            <li>but you get way more of them</li>
            <li>and i feel they&#x27;re better quality.</li>
            <li>(At this point, I&#x27;ve learned more about makeup brushes than I ever wanted to know!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned more about makeup brushes than I ever cared to know!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the &amp;#34;smaller&amp;#34; brushes are better if they have &amp;#34;synthetic&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I bought these so that my daughter could have her own nice set of brushes, but I like them so much that I am also using them!  </li>
            <li>maybe something about picking up the makeup more efficiently from the makeup container ... and applying it more smoothly and evenly onto a face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Well</li>
            <li>They are also very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>Full disclosure: I received a free sample in return for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know whats more important than that</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft, don&#x27;t shed, and work great.</li>
            <li>I washed it and its as good as new :)</li>
            <li>At first I was happy except for the strong smell they had when I first opened them</li>
            <li>Good variety provided at a decent price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay full price.</li>
            <li>The manufacturer even told me 3 stars would be fine.</li>
            <li>Now is fine.</li>
            <li>And these brushes are easy and comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This set gives you a lot of variety, plus a super cute carrying case.</li>
            <li>This was a gift for my 25 year old daughter and when she first opened it, she thought I was giving her a cute, alligator clutch purse lol.</li>
            <li>Overall, great product.</li>
            <li>when I cleaned them, which is fantastic.</li>
            <li>There were instructions on how to clean them to get rid of the strong smell they had.  </li>
            <li>friends happily suggested several things for me to consider before buying a set of makeup brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>of the brushes has something that looks to me like an oval-shaped smooth foam pad, with a pointed tip.  </li>
            <li>These brushes  fit in my hand nicely and makeup goes on much smoother.  </li>
            <li>Turns out, I absolutely love this set, the price is right  </li>
            <li>company actually sent me an email and it had a great ebook explaining each brushes use and how to clean them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She loved the variety - good selection without being excessive.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth every penny!</li>
            <li>As the product description says, the case is sturdy and it should clean up easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i have some expensive brushes, but honestly for my use, these are perfect and I have 15 instead of 1 for the price!</li>
            <li>the brushes HAVE to be in a nice and attractive case, and look &amp;#34;classy&amp;#34; enough for an &amp;#34;evening out,&amp;#34; AND be comfortable enough for an &amp;#34;evening</li>
            <li>other thing I really like is the covers so the brushes keep their shape and the carrying case is awesome.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had these brushes for about a year now, and they are still as full as when I got them.  </li>
            <li>But this set is SO COOL.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a complete, nice set.</li>
            <li>Fifteen brushes all in one place with cover&#x27;s for each brush to keep them nice at a fraction of the cost of some major brands.</li>
            <li>hairs because they allow for more control to get exactly the right amount of makeup in just the right place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They come with a nice description (instructions, etc.), which I almost missed, since it came via email, so be sure to look at your confirmation email carefully!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re low on cash and willing to take the risk this might be a good set for you</li>
            <li>set is sophisticated looking with black matte brush handles that are a nice weight.  </li>
            <li>And these brushes can be cleaned with just a bit of mild soap and water ... but be sure and hold them in a &amp;#34;downward&amp;#34; direction so that the old makeup and soap and water run OFF of the brush ... and not INTO the brush and the handle.  </li>
            <li>These brushes are excellent for everyday uses, and definitely beats those really cheap brushes.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I loved how many different brushes came and especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the investment for yourself and your friends and family.</li>
            <li>only pro I can give it is, the pouch it came with was nice.</li>
            <li>you need a very travel friendly brush set, this one won&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li>; smell).&lt;br /&gt;They are somewhat smooth and not rough and the makeup applies evenly--- The only item I would suggest not using is the eyeliner brush- if you use gel eyeliner spend the money on a good one.</li>
            <li>right? ..</li>
            <li>I Think i made a right choice in purchasing these MU brushes.</li>
            <li>The problem is this - the second I unwrapped the package I was hit with a very strong chemical smell - which I thought could be from glue or lacquer.</li>
            <li>I love the elegant black case and the fact that it has a magnetic closure.</li>
            <li>it really IS super soft - which I guess is important ...</li>
            <li>Plus the accessorie clutch they come in is super cute, I wish the brush holders inside were removable so that I could use it as a regular clutch!</li>
            <li>So she was super happy with her present, and she thought it was pretty funny that I would surprise her with something that only girls know how to buy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I actually &amp;#34;brushed&amp;#34; the large &amp;#34;fluffy&amp;#34; brush on my own face ...</li>
            <li>The first thing I do before I use brushes is wash them.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I filled a small bowl with warm water and some of my shampoo (Herbal Essences).  </li>
            <li>Loves these brushes and the ebooks that come with are very helpful!</li>
            <li>A second soak yielded even more dye.</li>
            <li>There is a chemical/plastic type smell that is off putting when you first take it out of the bag, but if you let it air out for a day</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and don&#x27;t shed; they apply the eye shadows precisely.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I cleaned the brushes the first day I got them and one broke.</li>
            <li>clean your brushes prior to use and clean the case to decrease the &amp;#34;plastic&amp;#34</li>
            <li>As far as the variety and texture of the brushes, I agree with the previous reviews - to the touch they feel great.</li>
            <li>Love the flat brush for enhancing lash line and the choice of liner brushes.</li>
            <li>First of all, I wouldn&#x27;t like it nearly as much if not for the croc-skin cosmetic case.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These brushes are in a glossy black case, each of the 15 brushes in its own brush holding slot, with a flap that goes over the tops of the brushes.  </li>
            <li>The different sized brushes make it easy to do eye makeup, and the face brushes blend make up very well.</li>
            <li>and they come in a handy little case.  </li>
            <li>really like the brushes for eye shadows.  </li>
            <li>It is very slender and portable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t think I will be traveling with the brushes in the case unless I want my whole suit case to smell of chemicals.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>have only used them one and so far they are OK.  </li>
            <li>Makes me feel so professional to have the right tool for every job.</li>
            <li>but nothing major, and for the price it&#x27;s SO worth it.</li>
            <li>brushes are soft, however there was a lot of fallout on the eye shadow blending brush during its first use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I expected the quality to be lower because of the low price, but the brush fibers are of a good quality and the brushes are tough, yet easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Decent brushes for a makeup beginner.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m starting to regret not spending the extra money to get a better set.</li>
            <li>Sometimes foundation brushes can be too stiff or too soft which affects application, but this one does a nice job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li>I am passionate about makeup, and I (fortunately) already have a variety of professional brushes that cost me from $30 to $60 EACH!</li>
            <li>I ended up having to buy new brushes for those items from Sephora.  </li>
            <li>They are very soft and apply makeup evenly.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are well protected and so soft!</li>
            <li>I decided to wash the brushes before I put them near my eyes (or anyone else&#x27;s!)</li>
            <li>I will keep soaking them until the water remains clear - or the brushes fall apart - before I put them anywhere near my eyes!</li>
            <li>When you get these, be prepared to air them out for a few days (and then clean them, like you should with all new brushes anyway)</li>
            <li>There are plenty of sizes and shapes of brushes for every conceivable use.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with this set.</li>
            <li>or so it goes almost completely away.</li>
            <li>They are really soft and stayed in shape after cleaning.</li>
            <li>It get&#x27;s old buying a brush here and there.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Apparently, makeup brushes, at least the better quality brushes, can also be cleaned.  </li>
            <li>There are a few that I don&#x27;t reach for, but thats standard in most sets like this.</li>
            <li>At 49 years old, I actually had no idea that using the right brush could make such a difference with the end product.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for new brushes!</li>
            <li>I have no idea whatsoever in the world what that particular brush could possibly be used for ...</li>
            <li>And they have big, &amp;#34;fluffy,&amp;#34; and very soft bristles that feel soft on the face.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to believe that 15 regular size brushes come in a case that is very slim when closed, which makes it very easy to take anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She liked the design because she said a lot of the really expensive brushes are on the classy side too.</li>
            <li>They are all very soft except for the facial powder brush, which is a little rougher, it holds and applys the powder very very well.</li>
            <li>she opened the present, she was so surprised that I got her something like that.</li>
            <li>But I was intrigued by the description of this set - especially the availability of \\&quot;natural hair\\&quot; brushes at this price.</li>
            <li>The brushes are used everyday from basic makeup to full glamour makeup.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews of some others that all had loose hair problems, I decided to take my chances on this set because the design looked streamlined, and came in a cool black case.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very slim and lays flat when closed.  </li>
            <li>I was in desperate need of a new set of makeup brushes and I LOVE these.  </li>
            <li>the entire kit is that the little plastic protectors over the smaller brushes are basically useless, there&#x27;s not a chance that you will be able to put them back on after they come off for the first use.</li>
            <li>I usually need something more dense and a little softer, but these do the job!</li>

            <li> I think what&#x27;s most impressive about this makeup brush set is its portability.  </li>
            <li> I love the make up brush case, the fact that it looks so sleek and could pass for a purse is awesome.</li>

            <li> Gave them as a gift to my sister whom is in cosmetology, and she loved them.</li>

            <li> My girlfriends love and and so do I!</li>
            <li> I have even bought more for Christmas presents!</li>
            <li> Great makeup brush set for a super price!</li>
            <li> (so you don&#x27;t end up with eyeshadow all over your face), and apply it amazingly.</li>
            <li> set contains a nice assortment of brushes.</li>
            <li> Brushes felt and looked good and the case was cute.</li>
            <li> Well, I honestly can&#x27;t see any reason not to give it five stars.</li>
            <li> Got here on time, everything was as it should be, nice case that it came in, &amp; even came with cleaning instructions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been wanting a nice set of makeup brushes for quite a while.  </li>
            <li> But then I thought it&#x27;ll be nice to give it a try, so I did.</li>
            <li> The variety of brushes is nice.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my daughter and she loved the huge selection of brushes and the nice looking case that it came in.</li>
            <li> friends assured me that the receiver of my makeup brush gift will be pleased to pull out these makeup brushes around her girlfriends ... and that both she (and I!) will be pleased with the results of her makeup.  </li>
            <li> ... maybe my MANY research efforts will be appropriately rewarded!</li>
            <li> daughter, who is much more experienced with make up application, suggested that I purchase the brushes with the hope that I would enjoy and experiment with make up a bit more.</li>
            <li> Nice insert with instructions on caring for the brushes and also more tips and instructions in followup email from the seller.</li>
            <li> At first, i didn&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll work as great as drugstore brushes and wasn&#x27;t about to get them.</li>
            <li> Nice variety of brushes, pretty good quality.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m totally sure it&#x27;s VERY important ...</li>
            <li> One of my favorite types of brushes is a foundation brush, and the foundation brush in this set distributes liquid foundation evenly.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are so soft and feel incredible on my face.</li>
            <li> I had no idea there would be so many choices on colors and brushes</li>
            <li> She pulled on the brush hair to make sure they wouldn’t fall out like the ones she has, and they didn’t.</li>
            <li> And yes, they&#x27;re MUCH better than the applicators that come with the makeup.</li>
            <li> and when I used the brushes this morning, they held my makeup nicely and felt smooth on my face.  </li>
            <li> I also enjoyed using the brushes...</li>
            <li> In this case, it MAY be possible that daughter knew best!</li>
            <li> The brushes started shedding, when I put my powder foundation on I had a couple hairs on my face which was okay</li>
            <li> I just picked them off, but now so many hairs are falling off that they&#x27;re all over my face</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d get a better set.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these brushes.</li>
            <li> Great quality and very durable.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> These definitely aren&#x27;t the best brushes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Really glad that I ordered these brushes.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of these brushes.</li>
            <li> but you get way more of them</li>
            <li> and i feel they&#x27;re better quality.</li>
            <li> (At this point, I&#x27;ve learned more about makeup brushes than I ever wanted to know!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned more about makeup brushes than I ever cared to know!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the &amp;#34;smaller&amp;#34; brushes are better if they have &amp;#34;synthetic&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I bought these so that my daughter could have her own nice set of brushes, but I like them so much that I am also using them!  </li>
            <li> maybe something about picking up the makeup more efficiently from the makeup container ... and applying it more smoothly and evenly onto a face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Well</li>
            <li> They are also very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> Full disclosure: I received a free sample in return for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know whats more important than that</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft, don&#x27;t shed, and work great.</li>
            <li> I washed it and its as good as new :)</li>
            <li> At first I was happy except for the strong smell they had when I first opened them</li>
            <li> Good variety provided at a decent price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay full price.</li>
            <li> The manufacturer even told me 3 stars would be fine.</li>
            <li> Now is fine.</li>
            <li> And these brushes are easy and comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This set gives you a lot of variety, plus a super cute carrying case.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my 25 year old daughter and when she first opened it, she thought I was giving her a cute, alligator clutch purse lol.</li>
            <li> Overall, great product.</li>
            <li> when I cleaned them, which is fantastic.</li>
            <li> There were instructions on how to clean them to get rid of the strong smell they had.  </li>
            <li> friends happily suggested several things for me to consider before buying a set of makeup brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> of the brushes has something that looks to me like an oval-shaped smooth foam pad, with a pointed tip.  </li>
            <li> These brushes  fit in my hand nicely and makeup goes on much smoother.  </li>
            <li> Turns out, I absolutely love this set, the price is right  </li>
            <li> company actually sent me an email and it had a great ebook explaining each brushes use and how to clean them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She loved the variety - good selection without being excessive.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth every penny!</li>
            <li> As the product description says, the case is sturdy and it should clean up easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i have some expensive brushes, but honestly for my use, these are perfect and I have 15 instead of 1 for the price!</li>
            <li> the brushes HAVE to be in a nice and attractive case, and look &amp;#34;classy&amp;#34; enough for an &amp;#34;evening out,&amp;#34; AND be comfortable enough for an &amp;#34;evening</li>
            <li> other thing I really like is the covers so the brushes keep their shape and the carrying case is awesome.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these brushes for about a year now, and they are still as full as when I got them.  </li>
            <li> But this set is SO COOL.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a complete, nice set.</li>
            <li> Fifteen brushes all in one place with cover&#x27;s for each brush to keep them nice at a fraction of the cost of some major brands.</li>
            <li> hairs because they allow for more control to get exactly the right amount of makeup in just the right place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They come with a nice description (instructions, etc.), which I almost missed, since it came via email, so be sure to look at your confirmation email carefully!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re low on cash and willing to take the risk this might be a good set for you</li>
            <li> set is sophisticated looking with black matte brush handles that are a nice weight.  </li>
            <li> And these brushes can be cleaned with just a bit of mild soap and water ... but be sure and hold them in a &amp;#34;downward&amp;#34; direction so that the old makeup and soap and water run OFF of the brush ... and not INTO the brush and the handle.  </li>
            <li> These brushes are excellent for everyday uses, and definitely beats those really cheap brushes.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I loved how many different brushes came and especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the investment for yourself and your friends and family.</li>
            <li> only pro I can give it is, the pouch it came with was nice.</li>
            <li> you need a very travel friendly brush set, this one won&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li> ; smell).&lt;br /&gt;They are somewhat smooth and not rough and the makeup applies evenly--- The only item I would suggest not using is the eyeliner brush- if you use gel eyeliner spend the money on a good one.</li>
            <li> right? ..</li>
            <li> I Think i made a right choice in purchasing these MU brushes.</li>
            <li> The problem is this - the second I unwrapped the package I was hit with a very strong chemical smell - which I thought could be from glue or lacquer.</li>
            <li> I love the elegant black case and the fact that it has a magnetic closure.</li>
            <li> it really IS super soft - which I guess is important ...</li>
            <li> Plus the accessorie clutch they come in is super cute, I wish the brush holders inside were removable so that I could use it as a regular clutch!</li>
            <li> So she was super happy with her present, and she thought it was pretty funny that I would surprise her with something that only girls know how to buy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I actually &amp;#34;brushed&amp;#34; the large &amp;#34;fluffy&amp;#34; brush on my own face ...</li>
            <li> The first thing I do before I use brushes is wash them.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I filled a small bowl with warm water and some of my shampoo (Herbal Essences).  </li>
            <li> Loves these brushes and the ebooks that come with are very helpful!</li>
            <li> A second soak yielded even more dye.</li>
            <li> There is a chemical/plastic type smell that is off putting when you first take it out of the bag, but if you let it air out for a day</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and don&#x27;t shed; they apply the eye shadows precisely.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I cleaned the brushes the first day I got them and one broke.</li>
            <li> clean your brushes prior to use and clean the case to decrease the &amp;#34;plastic&amp;#34</li>
            <li> As far as the variety and texture of the brushes, I agree with the previous reviews - to the touch they feel great.</li>
            <li> Love the flat brush for enhancing lash line and the choice of liner brushes.</li>
            <li> First of all, I wouldn&#x27;t like it nearly as much if not for the croc-skin cosmetic case.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These brushes are in a glossy black case, each of the 15 brushes in its own brush holding slot, with a flap that goes over the tops of the brushes.  </li>
            <li> The different sized brushes make it easy to do eye makeup, and the face brushes blend make up very well.</li>
            <li> and they come in a handy little case.  </li>
            <li> really like the brushes for eye shadows.  </li>
            <li> It is very slender and portable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t think I will be traveling with the brushes in the case unless I want my whole suit case to smell of chemicals.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> have only used them one and so far they are OK.  </li>
            <li> Makes me feel so professional to have the right tool for every job.</li>
            <li> but nothing major, and for the price it&#x27;s SO worth it.</li>
            <li> brushes are soft, however there was a lot of fallout on the eye shadow blending brush during its first use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I expected the quality to be lower because of the low price, but the brush fibers are of a good quality and the brushes are tough, yet easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Decent brushes for a makeup beginner.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to regret not spending the extra money to get a better set.</li>
            <li> Sometimes foundation brushes can be too stiff or too soft which affects application, but this one does a nice job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li> I am passionate about makeup, and I (fortunately) already have a variety of professional brushes that cost me from $30 to $60 EACH!</li>
            <li> I ended up having to buy new brushes for those items from Sephora.  </li>
            <li> They are very soft and apply makeup evenly.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are well protected and so soft!</li>
            <li> I decided to wash the brushes before I put them near my eyes (or anyone else&#x27;s!)</li>
            <li> I will keep soaking them until the water remains clear - or the brushes fall apart - before I put them anywhere near my eyes!</li>
            <li> When you get these, be prepared to air them out for a few days (and then clean them, like you should with all new brushes anyway)</li>
            <li> There are plenty of sizes and shapes of brushes for every conceivable use.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with this set.</li>
            <li> or so it goes almost completely away.</li>
            <li> They are really soft and stayed in shape after cleaning.</li>
            <li> It get&#x27;s old buying a brush here and there.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Apparently, makeup brushes, at least the better quality brushes, can also be cleaned.  </li>
            <li> There are a few that I don&#x27;t reach for, but thats standard in most sets like this.</li>
            <li> At 49 years old, I actually had no idea that using the right brush could make such a difference with the end product.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for new brushes!</li>
            <li> I have no idea whatsoever in the world what that particular brush could possibly be used for ...</li>
            <li> And they have big, &amp;#34;fluffy,&amp;#34; and very soft bristles that feel soft on the face.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to believe that 15 regular size brushes come in a case that is very slim when closed, which makes it very easy to take anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She liked the design because she said a lot of the really expensive brushes are on the classy side too.</li>
            <li> They are all very soft except for the facial powder brush, which is a little rougher, it holds and applys the powder very very well.</li>
            <li> she opened the present, she was so surprised that I got her something like that.</li>
            <li> But I was intrigued by the description of this set - especially the availability of \\&quot;natural hair\\&quot; brushes at this price.</li>
            <li> The brushes are used everyday from basic makeup to full glamour makeup.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews of some others that all had loose hair problems, I decided to take my chances on this set because the design looked streamlined, and came in a cool black case.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very slim and lays flat when closed.  </li>
            <li> I was in desperate need of a new set of makeup brushes and I LOVE these.  </li>
            <li> the entire kit is that the little plastic protectors over the smaller brushes are basically useless, there&#x27;s not a chance that you will be able to put them back on after they come off for the first use.</li>
            <li> I usually need something more dense and a little softer, but these do the job!</li>
            <li> I dipped the brushes into the water, gently rubbed them against my palm, rinsed them and then set them down to dry on a paper towel.  </li>
            <li> After a gentle cold water rinse, I dabbed the brushes with a clean white towel.</li>
            <li> apparently it&#x27;s NOT the same brush!), and even a mascara comb.  </li>
            <li> Then the case folds roughly into thirds and is held shut with a magnet, which is (apparently!)</li>
            <li> A week later, the black painting on one completely chipped off.</li>
            <li> It looks classy enough to go in a purse or briefcase, but practical enough for everyday use.</li>
            <li> The carrying case  is like a slim flat purse.  </li>
            <li> First, the bowl of water turned dark green after swished the brushes around in it.  </li>
            <li> Love the feel of the wooden handles, they feel and work like really expensive brushes!</li>
            <li> My blush/bronzer brush sheds a little, about one hair each time I&#x27;ve used it so far.</li>
            <li> Not only are they soft, but they perform well for an amateur like</li>
            <li> The reviews all seemed to like the quality of the brushes, and I figured she could always return it with the long guarantee if she didn’t like them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got this brush set for my teenage daughter and she likes the bigger brushes rather than the eye brushes because the smaller ones are stiff, don&#x27;t pick up product, and don&#x27;t blend correctly.</li>
            <li> Apparently, these \\&quot;natural\\&quot; hairs were dyed to look black.</li>
            <li> I truly had little experience with using the proper make up brushes for specific purposes.</li>
            <li> After purchasing a few different sets I finally found the ones I will stick with.  </li>
            <li> Second, when they dried, they left green/black marks underneath them on the paper</li>
            <li> I have spent most of my life having no more than three basic makeup brushes because they were always so expensive</li>
            <li> but none of the brush hairs came loose</li>
            <li> It sounded pretty bad, so I decided to get her something she could really use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The black dye used on these brushes kept coming off especially the powder and the blush brush.  </li>
            <li> The brushes came carefully and individually wrapped in a black case.  </li>
            <li> I figured I would NOT use these brushes in any type of wet application</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be too worried about it getting wet.</li>
            <li> Occasionally I&#x27;ll have a few hairs fall out</li>
            <li> I noticed with other brushes</li>
            <li> All the eye brushes work extremely well, they pick up the make up, hold it in place</li>
            <li> but I like the brushes other than that.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not hideously ugly, like cheap things often are.</li>
            <li> The face, blush, and foundation brushes are worthless, but the others are ok.</li>
            <li> I see absolutely no reason whatsoever (!!)</li>
            <li> The next morning, the solution was infused with a dark forest green dye that was so thick that it obscured the brushes.</li>
            <li> Brushes gave off black powder, which stained skin.</li>
            <li> When attempting to wash, coal black liquid stained sink, and hands.</li>
            <li> still bleaching to remove black.</li>
            <li> less &amp;#34;breakable&amp;#34; than a snap or buckle.  </li>
            <li> I would always have little black hairs on my face after using them.  </li>
            <li> These brushes come in a black little carrying case that is equivalent to a black little purse.</li>
            <li> ordered for my teen, she hasn&#x27;t complained therefore she loves it!</li>
            <li> Wish handles were a little bit longer</li>
            <li> They had little to no bristles coming out</li>
            <li> And even after washing them, they still leave little hairs on my face if I apply a powder.</li>
            <li> It has been a few months and they are still shedding.  </li>
            <li> Whatever you need, this set has them all so you don&#x27;t have to waste your time looking through your makeup stash for anything...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble with my brushes falling apart or irritating my skin because the hairs are so rough</li>
            <li> I usually just use whatever applicator comes with the blush or eye shadow or whatever.</li>
            <li> they have that glue smell that some brushes have, but it does go away after a few days!</li>
            <li> (Seriously, I wonder where some of those companies find their purple and lime green paisley fabric to make their stuff out of.)</li>
            <li> The liquid foundation brush is so difficult to clean practically impossible.</li>
            <li> The hair was hard and pricked my skin whenever I use it.</li>
            <li> The bag does have a smell that is hard to get rid of.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I don’t use the makeup brushes myself, I can’t say if this set is a 5 star all the way around, but it definitely is at least a 4 judging from her reactions and the fact that she told me she loves using them.</li>
            <li> for needing 15 brushes (seriously??) to apply makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I saw faint green stains on the towel, so I decided to soak the brushes overnight in a dilute cleaning solution.</li>
            <li> not ideal</li>
            <li> The soap and water kept running a dirty grey, it was rather disgusting.  </li>
            <li> I was about to chicken out and get her something else when I saw these.</li>
            <li> It was also shedding like crazy; I had pieces of the hair stuck on my face every time I used it.</li>
            <li> Sheds like crazy</li>
            <li> You can never find them and buying them separately can get expensive!  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> The foundation brush also isn&#x27;t bad.  </li>
            <li> Dangerous item!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The powder and blush brush, however, are horrible.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Brushes are a great value for the price . Very nice set :)</li>
            <li> I think what&#x27;s most impressive about this makeup brush set is its portability.  It&#x27;s hard to believe that 15 regular size brushes come in a case that is very slim when closed, which makes it very easy to take anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set contains a nice assortment of brushes. One of my favorite types of brushes is a foundation brush, and the foundation brush in this set distributes liquid foundation evenly.  Sometimes foundation brushes can be too stiff or too soft which affects application, but this one does a nice job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the brushes for eye shadows.  Not only are they soft, but they perform well for an amateur like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set is sophisticated looking with black matte brush handles that are a nice weight.  As the product description says, the case is sturdy and it should clean up easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need a very travel friendly brush set, this one won&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li> Beautiful set, great quality and has a wonderful variety of brushes!</li>
            <li> The first thing I do before I use brushes is wash them.  The black dye used on these brushes kept coming off especially the powder and the blush brush.  The soap and water kept running a dirty grey, it was rather disgusting.  I washed them 3 times.  By the third wash the water was clearer so I stopped.  I figured I would NOT use these brushes in any type of wet application and I would be ok.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are soft, however there was a lot of fallout on the eye shadow blending brush during its first use.&lt;br /&gt;I have only used them one and so far they are OK.  I paid under $7.00 for the set so with that I got a great deal despite the issues the brushes have.  I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay full price.</li>
            <li> These are GREAT for the price!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m no make-up artist.  I don&#x27;t need make-up artist quality tools.  Also, I don&#x27;t want to pay for make-up artist quality tools.  I was very pleased with the quality of the brushes for the price.  Sometimes a hair will fall out here or there.  I&#x27;ve had these brushes for about a year now, and they are still as full as when I got them.  I use them daily.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely manner. Brushes felt and looked good and the case was cute. Good starter brush set.</li>
            <li> Great make up brush set, soft, good quality, and good price!!!!</li>
            <li> LOVE these brushes! This set gives you a lot of variety, plus a super cute carrying case. The brushes are so soft and feel incredible on my face. They are also very easy to use and clean. I definitely recommend these brushes!</li>
            <li> My daughters do competition dance. These are great brushes and for the price it not a big deal if some get &amp;#34;misplaced&amp;#34; during competition road trips.</li>
            <li> Decent brushes for a makeup beginner.  Good variety provided at a decent price. I usually need something more dense and a little softer, but these do the job!</li>
            <li> I bought these so that my daughter could have her own nice set of brushes, but I like them so much that I am also using them!  They work and feel great, and they came with a really nice case.  I also received some helpful emails from the company about how to best use them.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I received this set as a Christmas gift from my hubby. I am very happy with it. I just wished they had a description pamphlet or description on the  wand.</li>
            <li> Gave them as a gift to my sister whom is in cosmetology, and she loved them.</li>
            <li> I ordered this makeup brush set for my girlfriends birthday because I knew she would never expect me to buy her something like this. I heard her talking to her best friend about her makeup brushes shedding hair. It sounded pretty bad, so I decided to get her something she could really use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her best friend told me that I could find a good set on Amazon but didn’t tell me which one to order. I had no idea there would be so many choices on colors and brushes I was about to chicken out and get her something else when I saw these. After reading the reviews of some others that all had loose hair problems, I decided to take my chances on this set because the design looked streamlined, and came in a cool black case. The reviews all seemed to like the quality of the brushes, and I figured she could always return it with the long guarantee if she didn’t like them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When she opened the present, she was so surprised that I got her something like that. She liked the design because she said a lot of the really expensive brushes are on the classy side too. She pulled on the brush hair to make sure they wouldn’t fall out like the ones she has, and they didn’t. So she was super happy with her present, and she thought it was pretty funny that I would surprise her with something that only girls know how to buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I don’t use the makeup brushes myself, I can’t say if this set is a 5 star all the way around, but it definitely is at least a 4 judging from her reactions and the fact that she told me she loves using them.</li>
            <li> I got two sets of these make up brushes for a Christmas present for my daughters.  They love them! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Full disclosure: I received a free sample in return for my honest opinion. The manufacturer even told me 3 stars would be fine. Well, I honestly can&#x27;t see any reason not to give it five stars. I have spent most of my life having no more than three basic makeup brushes because they were always so expensive and I was always losing them or dropping them in the commode. I usually just use whatever applicator comes with the blush or eye shadow or whatever. But this set is SO COOL. First of all, I wouldn&#x27;t like it nearly as much if not for the croc-skin cosmetic case. It keeps everything organized and together and it&#x27;s not hideously ugly, like cheap things often are. (Seriously, I wonder where some of those companies find their purple and lime green paisley fabric to make their stuff out of.) This is not leather, of course, but that&#x27;s good. I&#x27;d be too worried about it getting wet. It looks classy enough to go in a purse or briefcase, but practical enough for everyday use. There are plenty of sizes and shapes of brushes for every conceivable use. I cannot imagine what else one would need. Makes me feel so professional to have the right tool for every job. And yes, they&#x27;re MUCH better than the applicators that come with the makeup. The bristles don&#x27;t fall out and the handles are substantial.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these make up brushes!  After purchasing a few different sets I finally found the ones I will stick with.  The thing I like the best is the feel of the brushes on your face.  They are very soft and apply makeup evenly.  I noticed with other brushes I would always have little black hairs on my face after using them.  This is not the case with Dazzler Beauty brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing I really like is the covers so the brushes keep their shape and the carrying case is awesome.  It is very slender and portable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This company actually sent me an email and it had a great ebook explaining each brushes use and how to clean them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchase on Amazon quite a bit and I am very impressed with this product and the customer service from this company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lisa</li>
            <li> I received these brushes two days ago and immediately went to wash them so I could start using them.  I filled a small bowl with warm water and some of my shampoo (Herbal Essences).  I dipped the brushes into the water, gently rubbed them against my palm, rinsed them and then set them down to dry on a paper towel.  First, the bowl of water turned dark green after swished the brushes around in it.  Second, when they dried, they left green/black marks underneath them on the paper towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its not ideal but none of the brush hairs came loose and when I used the brushes this morning, they held my makeup nicely and felt smooth on my face.  I would still recommend but that dye issue should probably be addressed.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t a set of Bobbi Brown brushes but they also do not cost over $100! I was pleasantly surprised with this set. You can not beat the price and they actually work quite well. The company will send you a private email message prior to receiving them with instructions on how to prep your brushes--- follow those directions because I feel it will make a difference (ie. clean your brushes prior to use and clean the case to decrease the &amp;#34;plastic&amp;#34; smell).&lt;br /&gt;They are somewhat smooth and not rough and the makeup applies evenly--- The only item I would suggest not using is the eyeliner brush- if you use gel eyeliner spend the money on a good one.</li>
            <li> Great makeup brush set for a super price! Bought this as a gift for my daughter and she loved the huge selection of brushes and the nice looking case that it came in. I would highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li> I love the make up brush case, the fact that it looks so sleek and could pass for a purse is awesome. I also enjoyed using the brushes... Except for when applying my liquid foundation, I ended up using a sponge to even it out, also there was some greenish blue pigment on the brushes after cleaning.</li>
            <li> ordered for my teen, she hasn&#x27;t complained therefore she loves it! don&#x27;t know whats more important than that right? ..</li>
            <li> Brushes gave off black powder, which stained skin.When attempting to wash, coal black liquid stained sink, and hands. still bleaching to remove black. Dangerous item!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Loves these brushes and the ebooks that come with are very helpful!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my 25 year old daughter and when she first opened it, she thought I was giving her a cute, alligator clutch purse lol. The brushes are well protected and so soft! She loved the variety - good selection without being excessive.</li>
            <li> I truly had little experience with using the proper make up brushes for specific purposes. At 49 years old, I actually had no idea that using the right brush could make such a difference with the end product. Who knew?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter, who is much more experienced with make up application, suggested that I purchase the brushes with the hope that I would enjoy and experiment with make up a bit more. She was right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the help of the manual/ guidelines emailed with the purchase, I&#x27;m experimenting with various techniques and looks. In most cases, mother knows best. In this case, it MAY be possible that daughter knew best!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I loved how many different brushes came and especially for the price. I&#x27;m starting to regret not spending the extra money to get a better set. At first I was happy except for the strong smell they had when I first opened them but I figured that it would go away. The brushes started shedding, when I put my powder foundation on I had a couple hairs on my face which was okay I just picked them off, but now so many hairs are falling off that they&#x27;re all over my face it takes me longer to take the hairs off than to actually put the makeup on! The liquid foundation brush is so difficult to clean practically impossible. If you&#x27;re low on cash and willing to take the risk this might be a good set for you but if you have the money or can wait until you have it I&#x27;d get a better set.</li>
            <li> Got here on time, everything was as it should be, nice case that it came in, &amp; even came with cleaning instructions. Fantastic, very happy.</li>
            <li> I am impressed with the eye brushes.  The foundation brush also isn&#x27;t bad.  The powder and blush brush, however, are horrible.  It has been a few months and they are still shedding.  They have been washed and used and washed again and I can&#x27;t get them to stop.  I ended up having to buy new brushes for those items from Sephora.  I was very impressed with the e-book that came with them to help you figure out what brush is what though.</li>
            <li> Loved this make up brush set but that said it was smelly of chemicals. I did wash the brushes as suggested and the smell did come out after a while but it has not come out of the case... so I don&#x27;t think I will be traveling with the brushes in the case unless I want my whole suit case to smell of chemicals.</li>
            <li> I am passionate about makeup, and I (fortunately) already have a variety of professional brushes that cost me from $30 to $60 EACH! But I was intrigued by the description of this set - especially the availability of \\&quot;natural hair\\&quot; brushes at this price. As far as the variety and texture of the brushes, I agree with the previous reviews - to the touch they feel great. The problem is this - the second I unwrapped the package I was hit with a very strong chemical smell - which I thought could be from glue or lacquer. I decided to wash the brushes before I put them near my eyes (or anyone else&#x27;s!) I diluted a dab of brush cleaner in my palm and twirled the brushes. After a gentle cold water rinse, I dabbed the brushes with a clean white towel. I saw faint green stains on the towel, so I decided to soak the brushes overnight in a dilute cleaning solution. The next morning, the solution was infused with a dark forest green dye that was so thick that it obscured the brushes. A second soak yielded even more dye. Apparently, these \\&quot;natural\\&quot; hairs were dyed to look black. I will keep soaking them until the water remains clear - or the brushes fall apart - before I put them anywhere near my eyes!</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft, don&#x27;t shed, and work great. They come with a nice description (instructions, etc.), which I almost missed, since it came via email, so be sure to look at your confirmation email carefully! Overall, great product.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these brushes. Great quality and very durable. My daughter got liquid foundation all over the largest brush. I washed it and its as good as new :)</li>
            <li> Works great. Wish handles were a little bit longer but that&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> Very nice set of brushes.</li>
            <li> When you get these, be prepared to air them out for a few days (and then clean them, like you should with all new brushes anyway) they have that glue smell that some brushes have, but it does go away after a few days! These are pretty good quality brushes and are priced at a great price as well too! There are a few that I don&#x27;t reach for, but thats standard in most sets like this. They had little to no bristles coming out when I cleaned them, which is fantastic. I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for new brushes!</li>
            <li> I adore these brushes. They are all very soft except for the facial powder brush, which is a little rougher, it holds and applys the powder very very well. Occasionally I&#x27;ll have a few hairs fall out but nothing major, and for the price it&#x27;s SO worth it. Plus the accessorie clutch they come in is super cute, I wish the brush holders inside were removable so that I could use it as a regular clutch!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Great brushes.</li>
            <li> All the eye brushes work extremely well, they pick up the make up, hold it in place (so you don&#x27;t end up with eyeshadow all over your face), and apply it amazingly. There is a chemical/plastic type smell that is off putting when you first take it out of the bag, but if you let it air out for a day or so it goes almost completely away. My blush/bronzer brush sheds a little, about one hair each time I&#x27;ve used it so far. Only issue I have it the entire kit is that the little plastic protectors over the smaller brushes are basically useless, there&#x27;s not a chance that you will be able to put them back on after they come off for the first use.</li>
            <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t beat these brushes. They are really soft and stayed in shape after cleaning.</li>
            <li> Beautiful set of makeup brushes. These brushes come in a black little carrying case that is equivalent to a black little purse. My girlfriends love and and so do I! I have even bought more for Christmas presents! Definitely worth the investment for yourself and your friends and family.</li>
            <li> As a MUA i wanted something affordable and very good quality! I Think i made a right choice in purchasing these MU brushes.</li>
            <li> When I received this brush set, I immediately felt pampered.  I&#x27;d been wanting a nice set of makeup brushes for quite a while.  It get&#x27;s old buying a brush here and there.  You can never find them and buying them separately can get expensive!  I love the elegant black case and the fact that it has a magnetic closure. Fifteen brushes all in one place with cover&#x27;s for each brush to keep them nice at a fraction of the cost of some major brands. It&#x27;s very slim and lays flat when closed.  These brushes  fit in my hand nicely and makeup goes on much smoother.  I can tell a big difference in how my makeup looks too. Nice insert with instructions on caring for the brushes and also more tips and instructions in followup email from the seller. Great quality and a great price.  You can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> The brushes came carefully and individually wrapped in a black case.  There were instructions on how to clean them to get rid of the strong smell they had.  The brushes are soft and don&#x27;t shed; they apply the eye shadows precisely.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> These definitely aren&#x27;t the best brushes I&#x27;ve used. The face, blush, and foundation brushes are worthless, but the others are ok.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great buy! I have used all the eye brushes and have had good results with all. They hold product and distribute it well on eyelid.  Love the flat brush for enhancing lash line and the choice of liner brushes. I had no issue with washing nor with shedding.  A separate care guide is emailed so that you no how to care for brushes. i have some expensive brushes, but honestly for my use, these are perfect and I have 15 instead of 1 for the price!</li>
            <li> I got this brush set for my teenage daughter and she likes the bigger brushes rather than the eye brushes because the smaller ones are stiff, don&#x27;t pick up product, and don&#x27;t blend correctly. She and I do not recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li> Really glad that I ordered these brushes. The different sized brushes make it easy to do eye makeup, and the face brushes blend make up very well. I expected the quality to be lower because of the low price, but the brush fibers are of a good quality and the brushes are tough, yet easy to clean. I&#x27;ll definitely be recommending these to my friends</li>
            <li> At first, i didn&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll work as great as drugstore brushes and wasn&#x27;t about to get them. But then I thought it&#x27;ll be nice to give it a try, so I did. Turns out, I absolutely love this set, the price is right  the shipping is great. These brushes are excellent for everyday uses, and definitely beats those really cheap brushes. But i guess it&#x27;s up to the person to test it out.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the reviews but now I wonder if the reviewers got the same item I got. The hair was hard and pricked my skin whenever I use it. It was also shedding like crazy; I had pieces of the hair stuck on my face every time I used it. I&#x27;m returning it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only pro I can give it is, the pouch it came with was nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a complete, nice set. It had for some time the smell of plastic... Now is fine.</li>
            <li> Great price and great quality!</li>
            <li> Great brushes set and great service. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love the feel of these brushes. The only thing I wish it had a way to identify what each brush is for.  For instance for lips, for cheeks, brow etc. but otherwise, for the price and the quantities, it is great.</li>
            <li> I loved the brushes! I would definetely recommend and i will buy for me too cause it was for a friend.</li>
            <li> The bag does have a smell that is hard to get rid of. I cleaned the brushes the first day I got them and one broke. The brushes come with a smell, but wore off after  some soaking. A week later, the black painting on one completely chipped off. The spooly brush is disoriented.</li>
            <li> The variety of brushes is nice. I also like the carrying case. But I thought the brushes would be softer than they turned out to be. And even after washing them, they still leave little hairs on my face if I apply a powder. I&#x27;ll keep using them, but I&#x27;m looking elsewhere for softer powder brushes.</li>
            <li> I got these for my wife. As a gift, she thought they were beautifully packaged. The carrying case  is like a slim flat purse.  Then she noticed the quality and softness of the brushes. The brushes are used everyday from basic makeup to full glamour makeup. I recommend them as a gift for your wife or anyone else in your life you wish to impress.</li>
            <li> Nice variety of brushes, pretty good quality.</li>
            <li> Sheds like crazy but I like the brushes other than that.</li>
            <li> Great brushes! They cost about the same as the E.L.F. brushes but you get way more of them and i feel they&#x27;re better quality. Love the feel of the wooden handles, they feel and work like really expensive brushes! Great set, will be giving away one of these for christmas! :)</li>
            <li> I was in desperate need of a new set of makeup brushes and I LOVE these.  Whatever you need, this set has them all so you don&#x27;t have to waste your time looking through your makeup stash for anything...and they come in a handy little case.  I&#x27;ve always had trouble with my brushes falling apart or irritating my skin because the hairs are so rough but with these, I don&#x27;t worry about that at all.  I am amazed.  Definitely worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I know nothing of makeup brushes, so I immediately consulted my female friends about them before buying this set as a gift.  (At this point, I&#x27;ve learned more about makeup brushes than I ever wanted to know!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friends happily suggested several things for me to consider before buying a set of makeup brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, straightaway ... I see absolutely no reason whatsoever (!!) for needing 15 brushes (seriously??) to apply makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, my friends patiently explained that different brushes are used to apply different types of makeup to different parts of the face.  They explained that &amp;#34;larger&amp;#34; brushes are for applying makeup to the face area, and are &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; if they have &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; hairs.  And they have big, &amp;#34;fluffy,&amp;#34; and very soft bristles that feel soft on the face.  I have to admit ... that when nobody was looking ... I actually &amp;#34;brushed&amp;#34; the large &amp;#34;fluffy&amp;#34; brush on my own face ... it really IS super soft - which I guess is important ... maybe something about picking up the makeup more efficiently from the makeup container ... and applying it more smoothly and evenly onto a face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Well ... I WARNED you ... I&#x27;ve learned more about makeup brushes than I ever cared to know!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the &amp;#34;smaller&amp;#34; brushes are better if they have &amp;#34;synthetic&amp;#34; hairs because they allow for more control to get exactly the right amount of makeup in just the right place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the brushes has something that looks to me like an oval-shaped smooth foam pad, with a pointed tip.  I have no idea whatsoever in the world what that particular brush could possibly be used for ... but I&#x27;m totally sure it&#x27;s VERY important ... for something!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I&#x27;m in WAY over my head ... here!  But THESE makeup brushes are the &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; brushes ... with the &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; brush hairs and brush bristles and brush foam tips!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My patient friends also explained to me that somewhere in this set of 15 makeup brushes, would be the CORRECT brush for all parts of the face, including the face, lips, eyes (eye shadow AND eyebrows ... apparently it&#x27;s NOT the same brush!), and even a mascara comb.  And these brushes are easy and comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently, makeup brushes, at least the better quality brushes, can also be cleaned.  (who knew?)  And these brushes can be cleaned with just a bit of mild soap and water ... but be sure and hold them in a &amp;#34;downward&amp;#34; direction so that the old makeup and soap and water run OFF of the brush ... and not INTO the brush and the handle.  (THIS part I could have figured out by myself ... it&#x27;s just like a paintbrush, right?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND (if all of that wasn&#x27;t enough!) ... the brushes HAVE to be in a nice and attractive case, and look &amp;#34;classy&amp;#34; enough for an &amp;#34;evening out,&amp;#34; AND be comfortable enough for an &amp;#34;evening in.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are in a glossy black case, each of the 15 brushes in its own brush holding slot, with a flap that goes over the tops of the brushes.  Then the case folds roughly into thirds and is held shut with a magnet, which is (apparently!) less &amp;#34;breakable&amp;#34; than a snap or buckle.  And the magnet closure creates a totally &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34; surface on the outside of the case opposite the magnet ... so as not to get caught on anything like clothes or purses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friends assured me that the receiver of my makeup brush gift will be pleased to pull out these makeup brushes around her girlfriends ... and that both she (and I!) will be pleased with the results of her makeup.  And I figure that (IF she doesn&#x27;t read this review!) ... maybe my MANY research efforts will be appropriately rewarded!</li>
