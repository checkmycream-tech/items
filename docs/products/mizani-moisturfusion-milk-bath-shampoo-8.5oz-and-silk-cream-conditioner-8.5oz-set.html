            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and i think the supreme mask by mizani is a better choice.</li>

            <li>I also received it quickly and it had free gifts!!</li>
            <li>It was a great price and I am a new found user now.</li>
            <li>I just switched to Mizani sensitive scalp relaxer (which is also a great product) and my stylist advised to try the Mizani milk bath shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li>Very happy with the product üòÉ, but thought it would smell a little better üëç.</li>
            <li>The first time I used the shampoo it was like magic!</li>

            <li>This product is definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>But either way, the products makes my hair look shiny, and smell clean.</li>
            <li>I purchased it due to the great reviews, but after trying it myself I will never purchase it again.</li>

            <li>My hair the first month using it was soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I was lucky to catch this set on sale for only $10</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Mizani products and after using them for three yhing to a different product, I went back to Mizani and my hair is healthy and continuously growing.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair not only smooth and soft but SO far (And its early!)</li>

            <li>I must first admit that I haven&#x27;t actually purchased this product on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a transitioning to natural with 3C to 4B hair and this Moisturfusion set worked wonders for my hair!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used in my life, I recommend  anyone with thick coarse hair to try this product , you will not be disappointed  worth every penny and more.</li>

            <li>oh my goodness my hair has never been this soft and moisturized for  as far as I can remember.  </li>
            <li>If I go natural</li>

            <li>If you are a woman who is of mixed decent</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m African American with curly hair that tends to get very dry in response to many other products.</li>

            <li> My african american hair is very dry and damaged from relaxers and heat damage.</li>
            <li> I entend to stay with Mizani as long as my hair ir relaxed.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re Af-Am with dry hair, I would recommend trying this product as it has been a life saver for me!</li>
            <li> My hair was instantly softer, easier to manage and less brittle.</li>
            <li> but my hair felt very dry afterwards.</li>
            <li> My hair was very dry and brittle</li>
            <li> I am African and braid my hair a lot , the last time I took off my braids my long thick hair was gone and</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner tame my long and frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> Due to your hair texture, you may end up using half the bottle on one wash.</li>
            <li> Mizani really needs to step their game up or lower their prices!</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, frizzy &amp; coarse hair.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and was heavily packaged with no spills.</li>
            <li> I now just see a few string here and there...the norm.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll save a few dollars by purchasing the shampoo and conditioner together because a single purchase of each can be expensive.</li>
            <li> BABY IS BALD NO MORE!!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the $10 sale is off</li>
            <li> but it smells weird.</li>
            <li> It has dried my hair out extremely bad and caused really bad scalp itch/dandruff.</li>
            <li> Give it a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really like these two products!!!  Made my hair the softest and felt more healthy.  I will be ordering them again.  Thanks Mizani.</li>
            <li> Great product.. Fast shipping..thank you</li>
            <li> I used the shampoo and conditioner with the Mizani Butter Rich Hairdress and it works great. My african american hair is very dry and damaged from relaxers and heat damage. I&#x27;m gonna use this for awhile.</li>
            <li> Mizani really needs to step their game up or lower their prices! Because it&#x27;s not worth it. I&#x27;m just happy i got a package deal and not brought everything separately. I like the smell but my hair felt very dry afterwards. I&#x27;ll just stick to my ORS conditioner, it&#x27;s much better. Maybe someone with finer hair would like it, idk.</li>
            <li> Just now trying this product and I love it! It leaves my hair not only smooth and soft but SO far (And its early!) it doesnt seem to be falling out as much. Only time will really tell but Im excited!</li>
            <li> this product is exactly what I wanted and the price was great!! I also received it quickly and it had free gifts!!</li>
            <li> I must first admit that I haven&#x27;t actually purchased this product on Amazon. It&#x27;s available at the Hair Cuttery where I get my hair styled. I was lucky to catch this set on sale for only $10 and I swear by it. I&#x27;m African American with curly hair that tends to get very dry in response to many other products. Since I started using Mizani, my hair has been so noticeably soft and I refuse to put anything else in it because I am so in love with this texture. Unfortunately, the $10 sale is off so I&#x27;m hunting around on the net for a price cheaper than the $28 that it&#x27;s currently being sold for at the Hair Cuttery. No luck yet. If you&#x27;re Af-Am with dry hair, I would recommend trying this product as it has been a life saver for me!</li>
            <li> Very good moisture product.</li>
            <li> Again totally satisfied with all Mizani purchases.</li>
            <li> Love this product, my hair always is soft and shiney.</li>
            <li> Great Products for my hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a transitioning to natural with 3C to 4B hair and this Moisturfusion set worked wonders for my hair! It was suggested to me by my hair stylist who specializes in silk presses and she says its great for all types of hair! Give it a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> If you are a woman who is of mixed decent then I would suggest this product. It is not heavy nor does it oversud like some other products. I do wish that it would come in a medium size bottle. Due to your hair texture, you may end up using half the bottle on one wash. The product arrived on time and was heavily packaged with no spills. It was a great price and I am a new found user now.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product üòÉ, but thought it would smell a little better üëç. Still very happy with the outcome</li>
            <li> This moisturfusion line is wonderful. I absolutely love the smell of the products. I use the conditioner mostly. Love it. I plan to buy it again when I run out. I only wish the shampoo was sulfate free so I could use it regularly. Other than that it is incredible.</li>
            <li> Smells like cheap perfume</li>
            <li> It did not mousturize my hair as I had hoped and I didn&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner tame my long and frizzy hair.  Also, they seem to be gentler than others I&#x27;ve used. It leaves my hair feeling silky and smelling great!  I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Decided to switch product lines to improve the texture of my hair. My natural hair is wavy but this product gives me the added silkness and smells good. Will be purchasing the entire line for better results.</li>
            <li> Great service and great product!</li>
            <li> Awesome product, leaves hair feeling and looking healthier. This product is definitely worth the money! I would definitely by this again!!</li>
            <li> Ive tried all of mizani&#x27;s shampoos and this is one of my favorites. I personally like the botanifying shampoo better by mizani but it smells weird. With this i still get the non-stripping cleanse of the botanifying but with a good smell. As for the conditioner, it is what it says it is, silk cream. I tried it but I will only be repurchasing the shampoo for my clarifying shampoo. It is a good conditioner but i have my HG products and i think the supreme mask by mizani is a better choice.</li>
            <li> I have completely falling in love with these products.  They smell like heaven and make my hair so soft.  Fan for life!</li>
            <li> Great for Afro American hair</li>
            <li> I give this product an exceeding  5 . Just to give you a background  of how impressed  I was with this shampoo  and conditioner,  I am African and braid my hair a lot , the last time I took off my braids my long thick hair was gone and my hair  was badly  damaged that I decided to Google good products for African hair and &amp;#34;Mizani &amp;#34; was on the top list , I relaxed my hair with mizani  cut off my split  ends and I bought every Mizani product from shampoo  to moisturizes  and all the products  in between. Yesterday  was my first  time using this shampoo  and conditioner , oh my goodness my hair has never been this soft and moisturized for  as far as I can remember.  It&#x27;s the best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used in my life, I recommend  anyone with thick coarse hair to try this product , you will not be disappointed  worth every penny and more.</li>
            <li> quick shipment - love the product.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and curly, the conditioner makes my hair so easy to manage and comb thru , used for about a month now, so far so good</li>
            <li> Very nice product.  A little goes a long way.  The shampoo lathers well and I don&#x27;t think I even need a second application most times, but we&#x27;ve been &amp;#34;conditioned&amp;#34; pardon the pun...to shampoo twice!  Conspiracy to sell more product, lol.  The conditioner is great and effective even for the quicky conditioner in the shower for a couple of minutes.  Deep conditioning under the dryer makes the hair softer.  But either way, the products makes my hair look shiny, and smell clean.</li>
            <li> Mizani is always great.</li>
            <li> I just switched to Mizani sensitive scalp relaxer (which is also a great product) and my stylist advised to try the Mizani milk bath shampoo/conditioner. Let&#x27;s just say it&#x27;s worth every penny. This product left my hair smelling great, shiny, no build up, and full of body. You&#x27;ll save a few dollars by purchasing the shampoo and conditioner together because a single purchase of each can be expensive. The conditioner can also be used as a deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this shampoo and conditioner!!!! These two products, along with Affirm&#x27;s 5 in 1 Reconstructor [[ASIN:B000VS8VZM Avlon Affirm 5 in 1 Reconstructor 16 oz]]saved my hair. Before using these three products, my hair was coming out by the handfuls with follicles attached. My hair was in the sink, on the floor, in my brushes, combs. I was literally going bald. No joke, I had a bald spot in the crown of my head. I tried everything. Carol&#x27;s Daughter Monoi line, weekly shampoos and deep conditionings, protein treatments, vitamins. If it promised to stop my shedding and breakage, I tried it. One day while searching Youtube for help I came across this product. The stylist said that if the Affirm 5 in 1 Reconstructor did not stop your shedding and breakage, you need to see a doctor ASAP. The stylist said that the reconstructor should be used along with the Mizani Milk Bath Shampoo and Silk Cream Conditioner. I bought all three products. I use the Affirm 5 in 1 Reconstructor after each relaxing and then every following 4 weeks (my hair is extremely fine and requires relaxing every 2 to 3 months). In between reconstructing treaments, I wash my hair once a week (shampoo three times) and deep condition it ( cover with plastic cap and sit under a hooded dryer for 15 minutes). BABY IS BALD NO MORE!!! My hair is no longer breaking and shedding and my bald spot is gone. I now just see a few string here and there...the norm. So if you want growing, strong, soft, shiny, full of body, shedding and breakage free hair...buy this product. I wish you the best</li>
            <li> I have been using the Mizani moisture fusion for about 2 months now. My hair the first month using it was soft and manageable. I have very thick, frizzy &amp; coarse hair. I had to stop using it just recently. It has dried my hair out extremely bad and caused really bad scalp itch/dandruff. I purchased it due to the great reviews, but after trying it myself I will never purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This makes your hair so soft and feels so clean you can still smell it after you&lt;br /&gt;wash and set your hair. I would order more for sure.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years. It&#x27;s the best! Makes my hair soooo soft! Love it! Will be continuing to purchase this.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of hair products but the Mizani Moisturfusion is by far my favorite. I have a lot of hair and haven&#x27;t had a perm in over 3 years ,so washing my hair is hassle. Once I washed out the conditioner, I could already feel the difference in my hair. After using this system my hair it felt completely different, it is soft, light wight, shinny, it felt to healthy like I went to a salon lol. I definitely recommend these products and Mizani in general.</li>
            <li> Another great purchase, my hair is silky soft and full of body and it smell great.</li>
            <li> Smells good and leaves your hair feeling soft and moisturrized. I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Mizani products and after using them for three yhing to a different product, I went back to Mizani and my hair is healthy and continuously growing. I entend to stay with Mizani as long as my hair ir relaxed. If I go natural I&#x27;ll probably use their product as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitley recommend their entire hair care line. I use Butter Blend Sensitive scalp relaxer.</li>
            <li> The first time I used the shampoo it was like magic! My hair was very dry and brittle which was why I was looking for a good moisturizing shampoo &amp; conditioner. But while I was washing and conditioning my hair w/ these products I could instantly feel the difference. My hair was instantly softer, easier to manage and less brittle. The more I use it the more my hair texture improves.</li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT TO MOISTURIZE BLONDE HIGHLIGHTED HAIR !!</li>
            <li> Received the Mizani products as promised. It was cheaper to order online than retail salon.  Thanks  Katherine  Abbit  Houston, Texas</li>
