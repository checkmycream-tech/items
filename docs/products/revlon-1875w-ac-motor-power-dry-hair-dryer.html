            <li>Love it!!!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing and does not damage your hair!!!</li>
            <li>Great hairdryer!</li>
            <li>; air it emits is tepid, at best.</li>
            <li>It has a nice weight to it and it dries my hair!</li>
            <li>It feels good in my hand and the buttons stay on the setting you want.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s effective, but doesn&#x27;t damage hair</li>
            <li>Although I don&#x27;t use the diffusor, it is a nice benefit for people who want to preserve their curls.  </li>
            <li>For me, I like to use the dryer for blowouts and have been able to get amazing salon looks in between my vists.  </li>
            <li>Love Love Love this blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>So glad I ordered this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone many years without a hair dryer</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE LOVE this dryer.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have enough hair to use this product, but my girlfriend has been very happy with this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been told that it somehow magically makes her hair softer.</li>
            <li>So far so good, dries and styles my hair nicely ...</li>
            <li>Love the power of this drier, it reduces the drying time tremendously and leaves my hair silky smooth!</li>
            <li>-Buttons for settings are easily bumped during use&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to hold and control</li>
            <li>The HOT setting is actually warm.  </li>
            <li>My hair has never been this silky and smooth from blow drying alone.  </li>
            <li>I use this much more than I thought I would and am very glad to have gotten this for a quick dry and style before heading out for a night out.</li>
            <li>while switches to cool air.</li>
            <li>It feels like the warm setting on most other dryers.</li>
            <li>but as my hair is long, I felt it was a good time to get a replacement from years ago.  </li>
            <li>For 5 months, this dryer worked great - although it is SO heavy.  </li>
            <li>I have had other hair dryers (not Revlon) which have lasted in good shape for years.  </li>
            <li>On the hot setting the temp keeps fluctuating from hot air to cool air and</li>
            <li>and it also dries my hair very fast.  </li>
            <li>Now I know I have to race to get as many strands in as possible while it&#x27;s still hot or  stop the process for a minute</li>
            <li>Pros- Hot setting is &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34;, but too hot.</li>
            <li>The two heads do exactly what I need them to do.</li>
            <li>better motor would last longer....</li>
            <li>Pretty color though.</li>
            <li>It does not get hot.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t get hot at all.</li>
            <li>High setting emits a lot of air flow, so hair dries quickly</li>
            <li>Pretty much every other drugstore brand hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever used is better than this one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very nervous about using it because I&#x27;m wondering if it is overheating and will cause a fire or burn up.  </li>
            <li>Not nearly enough to deliver a smooth blow out.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>the bursts of cool air last way longer than the hot bursts of air.</li>
            <li>Not only does it have a beautiful soft touch finish, it dried my hair really fast.  </li>
            <li>and I really like that it has a very soft texture.</li>
            <li>Every time I turn it on, I can see the coil get brightly orange n smell hot, but the fan fails to come on unless I hit it.</li>
            <li>The low setting on this thing is so powerful it tangles my hair into knots.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to anyone who is dissatisfied with their current blow dryer.</li>
            <li>I have very thick/wavy hair &amp; it can take me 30 - 45 minutes to blow dry my shoulder length hair.  </li>
            <li>--it is slower than my old dryer, which I have gone back to.  </li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;Hot&amp;#34; setting on this dryer was merely Luke Warm.  </li>
            <li>The review in our local paper raved about how much faster this would dry your hair, which is why I bought it.  </li>
            <li>If you only want a hair dryer to get your hair dry fast, maybe this is for you.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty heavy dryer.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty heavy, too.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I purchased this hair dryer on Feb. 8, 2015.  Just the other day (in May) while I was using it, the handle covering started to crack and melt in my hands.  I&#x27;m not sure why this happened. It was on the highest setting which I have use before. I turned it off and waited and turned it on again.  The melting and cracking seemed to stop. I&#x27;m very nervous about using it because I&#x27;m wondering if it is overheating and will cause a fire or burn up.  Not happy with this and I can&#x27;t return it.  I might check with Revlon to see if they can help. I have had other hair dryers (not Revlon) which have lasted in good shape for years.  Not happy.</li>
            <li> The hairdryer arrived packaged well in two days. It has a nice weight to it and it dries my hair! I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this blow dryer.  My hair has never been this silky and smooth from blow drying alone.  So glad I ordered this product.  I would highly recommend to anyone who is dissatisfied with their current blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I usually buy the more expensive, professional brands. Was low on money when my last dryer died on me so I thought I&#x27;d give this one a try. Horrible! On the hot setting the temp keeps fluctuating from hot air to cool air and the bursts of cool air last way longer than the hot bursts of air. Took me a while to figure out why my hair wasn&#x27;t straightening and looked frizzy. Now I know I have to race to get as many strands in as possible while it&#x27;s still hot or  stop the process for a minute while switches to cool air. Such a pain! It has added an additional 10 minutes to straightening/drying my hair. It&#x27;s the worst.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone many years without a hair dryer but as my hair is long, I felt it was a good time to get a replacement from years ago.  I use this much more than I thought I would and am very glad to have gotten this for a quick dry and style before heading out for a night out.</li>
            <li> Pros- Hot setting is &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34;, but too hot. It&#x27;s effective, but doesn&#x27;t damage hair&lt;br /&gt;  High setting emits a lot of air flow, so hair dries quickly&lt;br /&gt;Cons-Buttons for settings are easily bumped during use&lt;br /&gt;  Biggest con is the weight. This is a pretty heavy dryer.  4lbs on my bathroom scale! If you have long or thick hair, be prepared to have tired wrists and arms!</li>
            <li> It is quite heavy in my opinion</li>
            <li> The diffuser attachment is pretty cheesy but works decently enough - though I wouldn&#x27;t imagine a woman with thick hair would have any luck with it. The cold blast feature is actually one of the first on any dryer I&#x27;ve owned that was actually cold and set the style so bonus points for that.</li>
            <li> My hair has been softer than ever with the help of this blow dryer. The two heads do exactly what I need them to do. Great value!</li>
            <li> I have very thick/wavy hair &amp; it can take me 30 - 45 minutes to blow dry my shoulder length hair.  So I need a hair dryer that has enough heat to blow out my frizz.  The box said that it cut down drying time by 50%, but I was hoping for about 25%.  It actually took longer to blow dry my hair &amp; the results were unimpressive.  The &amp;#34;Hot&amp;#34; setting on this dryer was merely Luke Warm.  Not nearly enough to deliver a smooth blow out.  This dryer went back the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you have thick/wavy hair like I do, skip this dryer &amp; look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer because I thought it would dry my thick hair faster than my old one.  The HOT setting is actually warm.  It is pretty heavy, too.  I am going to try and take mine back to the store where I bought it from and exchange for another one.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Wife says it is too heavy. Well, she is the one who uses it. Slower to dry her hair.&lt;br /&gt;I bought the lighter weight unit again, even though it may malfunction again down the road. I thought&lt;br /&gt;the better motor would last longer....probably would.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!!! It&#x27;s amazing and does not damage your hair!!!</li>
            <li> So far so good, dries and styles my hair nicely ... Easy to hold and control</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this dryer.  Not only does it have a beautiful soft touch finish, it dried my hair really fast.  Although I don&#x27;t use the diffusor, it is a nice benefit for people who want to preserve their curls.  For me, I like to use the dryer for blowouts and have been able to get amazing salon looks in between my vists.  I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Every time I turn it on, I can see the coil get brightly orange n smell hot, but the fan fails to come on unless I hit it. Terrible.  Fire hazard. Garbage.  Pretty color though. That&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have enough hair to use this product, but my girlfriend has been very happy with this hair dryer. I&#x27;ve been told that it somehow magically makes her hair softer.</li>
            <li> Love the power of this drier, it reduces the drying time tremendously and leaves my hair silky smooth! Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer about 6 months ago.  My previous hair dryer shorted out and sparked in my face...scary.  I thought that wrapping the cord around it when storing was the problem, so I purchased this one bc of the little plastic thing at the base to hang it by - that kept me from wrapping the cord around it.  For 5 months, this dryer worked great - although it is SO heavy.  I had no issues until all of a sudden it started shorting out.  I&#x27;d be using it, it would shut off and back on depending on the angle I was holding it.  I even started smelling a very odd &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; smell so I became scared to use it as I didn&#x27;t want another spark in my face or worse yet - a fire.  Its gone into the trash and after another bad Revlon hair dryer experience, I&#x27;m avoiding this brand altogether now.</li>
            <li> I have very coarse and frizzy hair and this is the only dryer that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair frizzy and it also dries my hair very fast.  I was a little hesitant to buy it because I read on some of the reviews that it might be too heavy, but I did not find this to be a problem at all and I really like that it has a very soft texture.</li>
            <li> The review in our local paper raved about how much faster this would dry your hair, which is why I bought it.  It turned out not to be ttrue--it is slower than my old dryer, which I have gone back to.  Also, it is very heavy for something which you have to hold over your  head with one hand.</li>
            <li> Great hairdryer! It brings the heat but doesn&#x27;t fuzz up my hair. It feels good in my hand and the buttons stay on the setting you want.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed in this hair dryer. It does not get hot. The &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; air it emits is tepid, at best. I will be throwing it away. It doesn&#x27;t even heat up enough to curl my bangs over a roller brush!</li>
            <li> I absolutely hate this thing. If you only want a hair dryer to get your hair dry fast, maybe this is for you. But I need one that I can use to style my hair. The low setting on this thing is so powerful it tangles my hair into knots. It also doesn&#x27;t get hot at all. It feels like the warm setting on most other dryers. Pretty much every other drugstore brand hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever used is better than this one.</li>
