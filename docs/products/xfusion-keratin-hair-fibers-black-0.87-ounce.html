            <li>Great product, highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Product didn&#x27;t stay more then</li>
            <li>Need to improve the spray nozzle to disperse the keratin fibers more easily an evenly, sometimes it comes out in clumps</li>
            <li>Works just as described, been using it successfully now for several months I am very pleased with FUSION, where ya been all my life?</li>
            <li>Time and time again, my pillow and couch have come out clean!  </li>
            <li>What a lucky break for me!  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>This is such a great product.</li>
            <li>Excellent for covering up bald spots, however, if you use anything with oil in it with this product on your hair, it can be a bit messy.</li>
            <li>Good product, works great and you don&#x27;t waste as much as others!</li>
            <li>an I wish I could tell the ladies I see in the street that have the bold spots</li>
            <li>Really liked the product.would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li>Good price compared to other fibers.</li>
            <li>An excellent product that really does cover thin spots and does it well.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it proclaims.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, either A, pray it doesn&#x27;t rain or B, have an umbrella handy.  </li>
            <li>it seems to work so far so good but for type of product the price should be 20 buck or less</li>
            <li>It stays in place far, far, far better than the others.  </li>
            <li>I looked in the mirror, and it still looked very passable.  </li>
            <li>It really made a difference</li>
            <li>While there is some degree of truth to that for all the products, they start to look very unnatural, the more wet your hair gets.  </li>
            <li>but it is much better than the other products in its class.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe that amount of high ratings this product received.</li>
            <li>Finally, it does seem to go on your head a little more precisely than the other products.  </li>
            <li>It does a nice job of covering thin spots though so I put up with it.</li>
            <li>Will go back to my old JR product.</li>
            <li>On hot days if you are sweating it will run down your face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried 4 different topical thickeners to this point, and this one tops them all by far!  </li>
            <li>When doing my front hairline, I can usually get it right on the first try with XFusion, rather than taking several tries to get a natural look with the other products, which saves me time in the mornings.  </li>
            <li>Does not move in wind - but will put a light coat of black dust in your bathroom, nothing a Costco wipe does not clean up with easy!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> Products doesn&#x27;t last for long like it stated in description.</li>
            <li> - my hair is black and this makes me finally look like I have full hair - NO MORE scalp!  </li>
            <li> Also, no big open spot on the back of my head where all the fiber rubbed off (that was a problem with other products)!  </li>
            <li> Blends with hair naurally as compared some other similar products which produce obvious clumping of the powder.</li>
            <li> Also, all of these products claim to stay in place when your head gets wet, and only wash off with soap.  </li>
            <li> I definitely wouldn&#x27;t have been embarrassed to be seen in public with a wet head, like I would be with the other products.  </li>
            <li> One of the things that annoys me about the other topical fibers, is that they rub off on your pillow when you sleep at night (or the couch, when you lean your head against it, etc).  </li>
            <li> None of these products will ever get a 5 star rating from me, because they have their flaws, including making a mess in your bathroom, and XFusion is no different in that one regard...</li>
            <li> Product gets runny and messy when starting to sweat.</li>
            <li> I came inside from shoveling snow, with a soaking wet head.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Not full coverage and the fix it spray does not really keep the fibers adhered to hair follicles/scalp.</li>
            <li> Also tried Jonathan root touch up, that was sticky and messy.</li>
            <li> it is not too heavy.</li>
            <li> May be hard to match all black hair colors; works as directed.</li>
            <li> I just started using it and not sure if it will thickens hair</li>
            <li> The cap of the bottle is so hard to take off that I can never use the attachment I bought.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I hate about it is that when area gets a little sweaty, it&#x27;s gets runny and messy</li>
            <li> I did not get thick hair after chemo.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend, is also less expensive.  </li>
            <li> I got Thin thin thin hair</li>
            <li> horrible.</li>

            <li> greatest product ever made!!  I am a cancer survivor...I did not get thick hair after chemo.  I got Thin thin thin hair - my hair is black and this makes me finally look like I have full hair - NO MORE scalp!  Does not move in wind - but will put a light coat of black dust in your bathroom, nothing a Costco wipe does not clean up with easy!&lt;br /&gt;I will NEVER be without this product!!</li>
            <li> The cap of the bottle is so hard to take off that I can never use the attachment I bought.  Other than that, the product is great.</li>
            <li> Great product....Bought this bottle thinking it was the bigger one......</li>
            <li> Love this product &amp; the quick delivery &amp; great price from this seller!</li>

            <li> Fantastic product. Works just as advertised</li>
            <li> Good price compared to other fibers. May be hard to match all black hair colors; works as directed.</li>
            <li> works just like Topik but lower price.&lt;br /&gt; it seems to work so far so good but for type of product the price should be 20 buck or less</li>
            <li> This is such a great product. It does exactly what it proclaims. Until the day comes for hair growth or Bosely I will be using this product</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a year now. On hot days if you are sweating it will run down your face. if you rub your hands through your hair you will get the color on your fingers and in your nails. It does a nice job of covering thin spots though so I put up with it.</li>
            <li> It works as claimed. it is not too heavy. Blends with hair naurally as compared some other similar products which produce obvious clumping of the powder.</li>
            <li> Works like magic- covers your scalp if you&#x27;re losing hair and no one can even tell. On the other hand, either A, pray it doesn&#x27;t rain or B, have an umbrella handy.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> It was excellent  I would recommend  and have told people that I know&lt;br /&gt;With the same problem also my beautician.</li>
            <li> Excellent for covering up bald spots, however, if you use anything with oil in it with this product on your hair, it can be a bit messy.</li>
            <li> Products doesn&#x27;t last for long like it stated in description. I want to send the unused bottles</li>
            <li> An excellent product that really does cover thin spots and does it well.</li>
            <li> Good product. The product delivers the wxact results as described in the product description. I would recommend this product and give 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Good product, works great and you don&#x27;t waste as much as others!</li>
            <li> Not full coverage and the fix it spray does not really keep the fibers adhered to hair follicles/scalp. Will go back to my old JR product.</li>
            <li> Need to improve the spray nozzle to disperse the keratin fibers more easily an evenly, sometimes it comes out in clumps</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and looks great! I would recommend it to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;^^&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this product again and again</li>
            <li> I just started using it and not sure if it will thickens hair but it sure fill in the bald spots nicely.  The only thing I hate about it is that when area gets a little sweaty, it&#x27;s gets runny and messy</li>
            <li> AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME!</li>
            <li> Great product, highly recommended! The effect is natural and perfect for concealing thinning hair. I use it after every shampoo and stays on until the next wash.</li>
            <li> I love it i have been telling all my friends an I wish I could tell the ladies I see in the street that have the bold spots but I can not I wish they all could find out is the best for me</li>
            <li> Loved it.  Will definitely reorder again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this simply because everyone seemed to be out of Organin in my color at the time.  What a lucky break for me!  I&#x27;ve tried 4 different topical thickeners to this point, and this one tops them all by far!  It stays in place far, far, far better than the others.  One of the things that annoys me about the other topical fibers, is that they rub off on your pillow when you sleep at night (or the couch, when you lean your head against it, etc).  This one does not!  It&#x27;s amazing!  I woke up in the morning, and no pile of fiber on my pillow!  Also, no big open spot on the back of my head where all the fiber rubbed off (that was a problem with other products)!  Time and time again, my pillow and couch have come out clean!  Also, all of these products claim to stay in place when your head gets wet, and only wash off with soap.  While there is some degree of truth to that for all the products, they start to look very unnatural, the more wet your hair gets.  XFusion, while not completely perfect in this regard, is much better than the others.  I came inside from shoveling snow, with a soaking wet head.  I looked in the mirror, and it still looked very passable.  I definitely wouldn&#x27;t have been embarrassed to be seen in public with a wet head, like I would be with the other products.  Finally, it does seem to go on your head a little more precisely than the other products.  When doing my front hairline, I can usually get it right on the first try with XFusion, rather than taking several tries to get a natural look with the other products, which saves me time in the mornings.  None of these products will ever get a 5 star rating from me, because they have their flaws, including making a mess in your bathroom, and XFusion is no different in that one regard...but it is much better than the other products in its class.  I will never go back.  I&#x27;m an XFusion user from here on out!</li>
            <li> Product didn&#x27;t stay more then a couple of hours before I noticed it was gone. To its defense I did not use the holding spray but I did order one and waiting for delivery. I will update my review once I get the holding spray.</li>
            <li> Great value, the large size.  Works just as described, been using it successfully now for several months I am very pleased with FUSION, where ya been all my life?</li>
            <li> Really liked the product.would definitely purchase again. It really made a difference</li>
            <li> This is the best brand that I tried, it really covers up your bald spots.</li>
            <li> Great product for thining hair areas and discrete bald spot</li>
            <li> This is truly a great hair filler...use it after each wash and set and am always satisfied with the job it does.</li>
