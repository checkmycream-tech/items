            <li>Great soap container,</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>They’re attractive</li>
            <li>The case itself is very nice</li>
            <li>Very nice product,</li>
            <li>These are a VERY nice product.  </li>
            <li>A class act, and the best soap dishes, that hold my pine tar soap, and shikaki shampoo bar, and you can close it securely without a rubber band!</li>
            <li>, I put my favorite soap inside and wrap them together -- this will make a great gifts!</li>
            <li>Constructed fairly but don&#x27;t drop the soap</li>
            <li>They are sturdy and of good make, but what had me sold on them was the claim that there would be no leakage.</li>
            <li>The bright colors are nice.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>I bought 48 of these in a variety of colors and am VERY pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a girl or don&#x27;t care about that kind of stuff, go ahead.</li>
            <li>I have been through a lot of soap holders and these are by far the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li>They seem very secure and sturdy.</li>
            <li>i used many for going to the gym.</li>
            <li>I love that these cases snap to close.</li>
            <li>They are better quality and won&#x27;t break</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to worry about them cracking during travel because they can withstand a lot of weight on top of them.</li>
            <li>Granted, they&#x27;re very well made and attractive, but I&#x27;m not that concerned with the aesthetics of a travel soap dish.</li>
            <li>These were way better than I thought they would be.</li>
            <li>I like using a soap bar when i travel because it travels better.</li>
            <li>I am extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li>but this is much better.  </li>
            <li>If you use regular soap, and travel with your own, a great thing to have.</li>
            <li>Snaps closed wonderfully and consistently, ridges work well, good plastic.  </li>
            <li>They are also easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cases easily hold full-sized soap bars.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise the case seems fine and does what its intended to do.</li>
            <li>The have plenty of space to fit a bar a soap.</li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>I love it, and the price is right.</li>
            <li>Great at keeping my soaps dry.</li>
            <li>i would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants a good quality travel soap dish</li>
            <li>, I got a bright pink one, although, again, I wasn&#x27;t offered any options when I placed the order.....</li>
            <li>The seller reaaly needs to provide the right information</li>
            <li>, they’re functional and they’re made right here in the USA.  </li>
            <li>I paid extra money to get a better box than the 99 cent</li>
            <li>So I am not hugely disappointed, but the seller should fix the listing to say its for only one case.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far mine hasn&#x27;t cracked, snapped at the hinge, or fallen apart!</li>
            <li>They are very sturdy, I&#x27;ve dropped them several times with no issues and they don&#x27;t leak.</li>
            <li>I ordered these soap cases because they looked solid, not the kind that would pop open at any time or break from staying in my bag, unfortunately I didn&#x27;t even open the box.</li>

            <li> A little hard to open but other than that no known issues.</li>
            <li> made soapboxes that would have worked for a few weeks before requiring replacement</li>
            <li> I was expecting to receive them, or at least one of them, I planned to use just a few anyway.</li>
            <li> This is now a hard to find object.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is now a hard to find object. I love it, and the price is right. If you use regular soap, and travel with your own, a great thing to have.</li>
            <li> this soap dish is great for traveling. it doesn&#x27;t break after falling in the shower. i used many for going to the gym. this is the fist one i&#x27;ve used that stays in one piece even if it falls after 3 times! i would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants a good quality travel soap dish</li>
            <li> I ordered these soap cases because they looked solid, not the kind that would pop open at any time or break from staying in my bag, unfortunately I didn&#x27;t even open the box. The picture displays two cases of each of the colors, green, blue and transparent. I was expecting to receive them, or at least one of them, I planned to use just a few anyway. The box I got had 2 pink, 2 yellow, 1 black and 1 tranparent case. I have no use for a pink case, nor do I like yellow, and wouldn&#x27;t have bought it had I known these were the colors. If you&#x27;re a girl or don&#x27;t care about that kind of stuff, go ahead. I even tried complaining about the wrong picture, but got no feedback.</li>
            <li> Snaps closed wonderfully and consistently, ridges work well, good plastic.  My only problem is what to do with the other 5.</li>
            <li> The packaging said these would last a lifetime.  But when each slid out of the soap nook in my shower, and fell to the floor, it cracked and broke apart.  So now I have one left and I keep it on the floor.  I paid extra money to get a better box than the 99 cent-er they had in Walgreens.  Big mistake.</li>
            <li> I love that these cases snap to close. They seem very secure and sturdy. I received two pink, one clear, one black, and two green cases. Now I just have to figure out what to do with the extra four!</li>
            <li> so far so good. these travel cases for soap are doing the job. Just a bit still opening and closing the case. no big deal.</li>
            <li> I only received one Soap Case, the listing said it was a pack of 6.  I really only wanted one but picked this one since it was actually cheaper for the pack of 6 then other listings for just a single case.  So I am not hugely disappointed, but the seller should fix the listing to say its for only one case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise the case seems fine and does what its intended to do.</li>
            <li> Great at keeping my soaps dry.</li>
            <li> Constructed fairly but don&#x27;t drop the soap ha ha wasn&#x27;t a laughing matter but unfortunately the case slipped out my hands hit the ground and broke the rightside where snaps it close i instead purchased three soap containers at CVS cant go wrong with 1.37 a piece and. They are better quality and won&#x27;t break</li>
            <li> It sais that there a pack of 6, however I got only one case. The seller reaaly needs to provide the right information, this is the reason I am giving it a 3. The case itself is very nice, I got a bright pink one, although, again, I wasn&#x27;t offered any options when I placed the order.....Confusing...</li>
            <li> I only received 3 of these, contacted the vendor, and they responded immediately!  They explained the shipment error, and promised delivery, and ten dollars off on my next Amazon purchase from their company!  A class act, and the best soap dishes, that hold my pine tar soap, and shikaki shampoo bar, and you can close it securely without a rubber band!</li>
            <li> I bought a pack of these for living in the dorms my freshman year in college. They are great if you have to carry your soap to the shower or are traveling. They are very sturdy, I&#x27;ve dropped them several times with no issues and they don&#x27;t leak. I&#x27;ve had them in luggage and backpacks and no soap has ever leaked out. You don&#x27;t have to worry about them cracking during travel because they can withstand a lot of weight on top of them. They are also easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR - If you need travel cases for soap or just need a container for carrying to/leaving in the shower, buy these.</li>
            <li> Very nice product, but I would have preferred to buy them individually. Also, they seem rather expensive. Granted, they&#x27;re very well made and attractive, but I&#x27;m not that concerned with the aesthetics of a travel soap dish.</li>
            <li> Great soap container, but it&#x27;s pink and NOT a six pack - just one container.</li>
            <li> These were not too bad, got six different colors. A little hard to open but other than that no known issues.</li>
            <li> These were way better than I thought they would be. I like using a soap bar when i travel because it travels better. I have been through a lot of soap holders and these are by far the best I have ever used. They do everything a soap container should do. The have plenty of space to fit a bar a soap. They snap closed and stay closed. So far mine hasn&#x27;t cracked, snapped at the hinge, or fallen apart!</li>
            <li> Great product. .this is my second time ordering radius items...I am extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li> Contrary to what is advertized, these cases do indeed leak. They are sturdy and of good make, but what had me sold on them was the claim that there would be no leakage. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> We got these to take to campgrounds to carry our soap to the shower.  The bright colors are nice.  The cases easily hold full-sized soap bars.  The latching system keeps them from popping open in luggage (no rubberbands needed to hold these closed).  They seem to be water-tight; we had no soap residue leaking out into other luggage.  Because they are water-tight, there are no drain holes.  We would bring them back to camp, open them up and drain off the water, then leave them open for a bit to air out before putting them away.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> very good quality soap case, I put my favorite soap inside and wrap them together -- this will make a great gifts!</li>
            <li> These are a VERY nice product.  They’re attractive, they’re functional and they’re made right here in the USA.  I could have shopped cheaper locally and purchased some Chinese made soapboxes that would have worked for a few weeks before requiring replacement but this is much better.  I bought 48 of these in a variety of colors and am VERY pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Fragile hinges, not for long term use.</li>
    </ol>
