            <li>It has been my favorite powder of life, and I can&#x27;t find a good replacement.</li>
            <li>was very pleased with it since I can&#x27;t kind it in stores anymore :)</li>

            <li>Pretty good I jut don&#x27;t have much experience with makeup.</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite pressed powder.</li>
            <li>wow it&#x27;s a very light color</li>
            <li>It actually looked really nice on my skin, but I consistently had acne flare ups whenever I used this powder.  </li>
            <li>Love this powder - same price, almost twice as much content as their current product, and a higher quality than the product that is currently available in the store...</li>
            <li>You end up holding a compact that feels really large in your hand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased Maybelline Dream Matte Pressed Powder a few times, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be back for more.</li>
            <li>I got oily in the middle of the day, I got excited and blotted this all over my oily spots.</li>
            <li>Nothing special or different about it</li>
            <li>This pressed face powder is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used, including very expensive brands.</li>
            <li>It is comparable to high end powders.</li>
            <li>when you replace the puff, you have to squeeze the new puff in</li>
            <li>One of the few affordable finely ground powders.</li>
            <li>You snap up the clear lid to access the powder</li>
            <li>So far, I see no setteling in lines or caking, even with a mid-day reapplication.</li>
            <li>It dried up the oil and made my face look fresh and matte!</li>
            <li>I do usually have to blot my face in the middle of the day, but I would have to blot more than once</li>
            <li>This powder does keep my face matte and offers moderate coverage.</li>
            <li>I guess the powder is fine but the compact is the most annoying thing I&#x27;ve ever had to force myself to use.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin, and this keeps my face shine-free longer than any other powder.</li>

            <li> This is a wonderful pressed powder that gives me a shine-free but not chalky look that lasts all day. I use it on top of primer, foundation and blush. So far, I see no setteling in lines or caking, even with a mid-day reapplication. I&#x27;ve purchased Maybelline Dream Matte Pressed Powder a few times, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be back for more. Definitely recommended!</li>
            <li> I guess the powder is fine but the compact is the most annoying thing I&#x27;ve ever had to force myself to use. You snap up the clear lid to access the powder then you have to twist the entire bottom off to the side to access the puff and mirror. You end up holding a compact that feels really large in your hand. I want a compact to just open--not expand upward and outward so it&#x27;s not \\&quot;hand-held\\&quot; anymore. What a pain.....  Oh, and the puff and its compartment are slightly smaller than a \\&quot;normal\\&quot; size so when you replace the puff, you have to squeeze the new puff in and it&#x27;s wrinkled up and makes it slightly difficult to slide the bottom closed. VERY annoying packaging! (I tried to post a video but literally couldn&#x27;t open it with one hand in order to film it so I posted a photo of it expanded open.)</li>
            <li> Pretty good I jut don&#x27;t have much experience with makeup. It was too pale for me but once I put it on it wasn&#x27;t that noticeable. Wish it was fuller coverage.</li>
            <li> nice product, doesn&#x27;t keep me matte all day. I&#x27;d recommend it if you want a matte finish but don&#x27;t mind blotting and reapplying.</li>
            <li> This pressed face powder is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used, including very expensive brands. It feels smooth, and gives a nice, matte appearance without looking cakey. And it lasts all day. I can understand why the make up companies keep changing their packaging, but cannot understand why they keep changing their products and colors. This is a great product and was discontinued for ? reason.</li>
            <li> Love this!!! It works amazing and keeps me matte all day without touch ups, and doesn&#x27;t get cakey at all!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m heartbroken that this is discontinued.  It has been my favorite powder of life, and I can&#x27;t find a good replacement. It provides great coverage and  sets my make up to last all day with NO shine.  Maybelline, please bring it back!</li>
            <li> So happy that I was able to get this on line since it was discontinued.  Love this powder.  Exactly as I expected.</li>
            <li> Love this. Keeps me matte throughout the day. I have oily skin so I just keep this in my purse and anytime I need to touch  up this is great. It is comparable to high end powders. It doesn&#x27;t make your foundation look cakey. It is very finely milled so you can apply it as many times as you want.</li>
            <li> This powder does keep my face matte and offers moderate coverage. The packaging is very awkward though, since the top swivels out to reveal the puff and mirror. I just end up discarding the puff and using a makeup brush to apply it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to blot just the oil from my t-zone so I went to Ulta and saw the Dream Wonder powder. I quickly researched it and saw reviews say that the new one was horrible and that THIS product was the one I should buy. I put that powder back and bought this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got oily in the middle of the day, I got excited and blotted this all over my oily spots. It dried up the oil and made my face look fresh and matte! It did not look cakey and I even put some on the rest of my face. I love the silkly finish to this product and am really sad they discontinued this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy more when I am out!</li>
            <li> Since I was a little confused, but chances it anyways this shade is Cream (Light 4-5).&lt;br /&gt;I was very pleased with it since I can&#x27;t kind it in stores anymore :)</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite pressed powder. I have very oily skin, and this keeps my face shine-free longer than any other powder. I do usually have to blot my face in the middle of the day, but I would have to blot more than once if I were to use a different powder.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to trying this product but was slightly disappointed.  Nothing special or different about it</li>
            <li> It actually looked really nice on my skin, but I consistently had acne flare ups whenever I used this powder.  I threw it away before I used it up and will not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I am very happy, thank you, good quality.I love your brand.</li>
            <li> Love this powder - same price, almost twice as much content as their current product, and a higher quality than the product that is currently available in the store...A shame Maybelline no longer markets this product!</li>
            <li> Wish it was still made.  One of the few affordable finely ground powders.</li>
            <li> It looks nothing like the picture wow it&#x27;s a very light color and I looked like a ghost.</li>
