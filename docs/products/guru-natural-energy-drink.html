    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is the best i have seen in a while.</li>
            <li>Awesome energy drink.</li>
            <li>But I thought this was the perfect serving size,</li>
            <li>Otherwise it&#x27;s a good drink!</li>
            <li>this drink tastes great and gives me the drive to get stuff done without worrying about packing on the additional calories and weight.  </li>
            <li>Guru 2.0 is great</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a  good diet soda alternative, but it does have some caffeine.</li>
            <li>I get a good energy kick from these, and if I had to describe the taste it would be melted gummy bears.  </li>
            <li>Signed up to auto ship and the discount makes it even better :o)</li>
            <li>Thank you for finally coming out with an energy drink that tastes excellent and is good for you as well.</li>
            <li>They help keep my head clear and have a great taste (and help me stay awake at my desk after lunch!)  </li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite and one of the best energy drinks out there; however, pricing has sobered me up.</li>
            <li>This is hands-down my favorite energy drink, and I cannot find it in stores in Hawaii.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>These are my favorite energy drinks.</li>
            <li>I love the taste but have switched to herba mate canned drinks instead.</li>
            <li>Natural ingredients, great taste, refreshing energy boost.</li>
            <li>The taste is good and it really does give energy, but wish it did not have Echinacea.  </li>
            <li>The quality is great and you don&#x27;t have to worry about all the side effects Red Bull or Monster have (being mostly synthetic anyway) like the headaches or crashes after, it wont happen here.</li>
            <li>The true bonus is there are no crashes or withdrawal symptoms.</li>
            <li>makes red bull taste good.</li>
            <li>Still gives a good kick as long as you don&#x27;t drink it everyday!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Kroger rarely has it on the shelf</li>
            <li>If you are not a coffee drinker but need a pick me up, this product will do just that, and it is more natural.</li>
            <li>If you have one of these stores nearby it might be worth checking out.</li>
            <li>Really like this as it is natural and not expensive AND sugar free !!</li>
            <li>right to the trash...</li>
            <li>I down one of these, and I am good to go for the rest of the days.</li>
            <li>The taste is like liquid gummi bears at first and gradually lessens as you get used to it.</li>
            <li>I foolishly order these without trying one first.</li>
            <li>but this one is bigger and more tasty.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, I don&#x27;t have to worry about all the artificial additives that most energy drinks have in them!</li>
            <li>Awesome taste and healthier choice(better sweeteners) than the other big name low carb/sugar energy drinks.</li>
            <li>Around 2:00 in the afternoon I start really dragging at work.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much cheaper by the case here on Amazon than at the stores.</li>
            <li>drinking two of the 8.4 is a bit too much.</li>
            <li>I like this because it&#x27;s way more truly natural than Red Bull.</li>
            <li>Coffee and a good multivitamin do the trick for far far less money.</li>
            <li>so i made sure to stock up and wait for it to drop down to a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Overall not bad being sugar-free and low-cal.</li>
            <li>As an additional bonus I like the use of Stevia as opposed to any artificial sweeteners, and I feel like it&#x27;s a great alternative to sugar free Red Bulls.</li>
            <li>I could even make it more than a few sips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sambazon Diet tastes better but has less caffeine and less other good stuff.</li>
            <li>Tastes great, a little fruity, with few calories.</li>
            <li>Perfect amount of energy and kick without all of the artificial junk found in the big name energy drinks.</li>
            <li>and now I feel better both mentally and physically.</li>
            <li>Gotta say, i have tried many other energy drinks both regular and sugar-free.</li>
            <li>Not sure why this size isn&#x27;t available anymore.</li>
            <li>much!&lt;br /&gt;I found this product (12oz) at my local Whole Foods for $2 a can often and even under 2 per can recently.</li>
            <li>[[VIDEOID:29289921]][[ASIN:B000LZDLZ0 GURU Lite Energy Drink, 100% Natural, 8.3 Fluid Ounce Can (Pack of 24)]]</li>
            <li>; in it, because that usually means it&#x27;s NOT a natural flavor but a chemical created in a lab to taste like something natural and mask the true flavor of the drink itself.)</li>

            <li> This is hands-down my favorite energy drink, and I cannot find it in stores in Hawaii. Around 2:00 in the afternoon I start really dragging at work. I down one of these, and I am good to go for the rest of the days. A cup of coffee won&#x27;t do that.  I like the ingredients; nothing scary in it.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:29289921]][[ASIN:B000LZDLZ0 GURU Lite Energy Drink, 100% Natural, 8.3 Fluid Ounce Can (Pack of 24)]] [...]</li>
            <li> I am a full-time graduate student who needs energy boosts at optimal times throughout the day. As a low calorie (just 15 calories!) and low carb drink (4 grams) this drink tastes great and gives me the drive to get stuff done without worrying about packing on the additional calories and weight.  A \\&quot;must buy\\&quot; for anyone who consumes energy drinks! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Gotta say, i have tried many other energy drinks both regular and sugar-free. This is the best i have seen in a while. The taste is like liquid gummi bears at first and gradually lessens as you get used to it. The only problem is that since i have been drinking this for a while, i do get a small crash if i forget to drink my daily ration of this stuff. Overall not bad being sugar-free and low-cal. It is getting a bit pricey so i made sure to stock up and wait for it to drop down to a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Natural ingredients, great taste, refreshing energy boost. No noticeable crash. It&#x27;s much cheaper by the case here on Amazon than at the stores.</li>
            <li> Awesome energy drink. The quality is great and you don&#x27;t have to worry about all the side effects Red Bull or Monster have (being mostly synthetic anyway) like the headaches or crashes after, it wont happen here. Thank you for finally coming out with an energy drink that tastes excellent and is good for you as well. Give it a try you wont regret it</li>
            <li> What happened to the Guru Lite with Stevia.  It was in a blue can and my husband preferred that over the red.  Also the price keeps rising and we are looking at some other drinks.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Perfect amount of energy and kick without all of the artificial junk found in the big name energy drinks.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite energy drinks. I have replaced my daily red bull with these and now I feel better both mentally and physically. No need for artificial ingredients!!</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite and one of the best energy drinks out there; however, pricing has sobered me up. Coffee and a good multivitamin do the trick for far far less money.</li>
            <li> Tastes great, a little fruity, with few calories. It&#x27;s a  good diet soda alternative, but it does have some caffeine.</li>
            <li> I have never drank coffee but in the last 2-3 years I&#x27;ve required a little pick me up in the AM and this does the trick without the artificial ingredients and sugar of other energy drinks. The true bonus is there are no crashes or withdrawal symptoms.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been drinking Guru Lites for about a year now.  They help keep my head clear and have a great taste (and help me stay awake at my desk after lunch!)  Most importantly, I don&#x27;t have to worry about all the artificial additives that most energy drinks have in them!</li>
            <li> Have used this product for over 5 years every day prior to exercise or going on a Combat mission in Iraq or Afghanistan. The healthiest energy drink I have found.</li>
            <li> The taste is good and it really does give energy, but wish it did not have Echinacea.  If you take Echinacea every day, your body will become immune to it and it won&#x27;t work if you need to take the Echinacea later, to prevent an illness.</li>
            <li> Not sure why this size isn&#x27;t available anymore. But I thought this was the perfect serving size, drinking two of the 8.4 is a bit too much.</li>
            <li> I am frustrated that I have been drinking these since 2009 and the price changes daily. From 38$-62$ per case. Kroger rarely has it on the shelf and I drink it daily. It&#x27;s crazy that prices can fluctuate that much. I love the taste but have switched to herba mate canned drinks instead.</li>
            <li> Really like this as it is natural and not expensive AND sugar free !! Signed up to auto ship and the discount makes it even better :o)</li>
            <li> I like this because it&#x27;s way more truly natural than Red Bull.( However it bugs me there are &amp;#34;natural flavors&amp;#34; in it, because that usually means it&#x27;s NOT a natural flavor but a chemical created in a lab to taste like something natural and mask the true flavor of the drink itself.) Otherwise it&#x27;s a good drink!</li>
            <li> I get a good energy kick from these, and if I had to describe the taste it would be melted gummy bears.  I&#x27;ve given them to friends and coworkers and the majority seem to like the taste as well, however it is of course subjective.  As an additional bonus I like the use of Stevia as opposed to any artificial sweeteners, and I feel like it&#x27;s a great alternative to sugar free Red Bulls.</li>
            <li> If you are not a coffee drinker but need a pick me up, this product will do just that, and it is more natural.</li>
            <li> I foolishly order these without trying one first. (i was looking for an energy drink without taurine). painfully bad. makes red bull taste good. I could even make it more than a few sips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YUCK.. right to the trash...&lt;br /&gt;but if you like the taste.. go for it.</li>
            <li> I was a Monster/Red Bull drinker for years until I found GURU and Sambazon. Guru 2.0 is great but this one is bigger and more tasty. Maybe a little less organic but still quality ingredients. Sambazon Diet tastes better but has less caffeine and less other good stuff.</li>
            <li> Awesome taste and healthier choice(better sweeteners) than the other big name low carb/sugar energy drinks. Still gives a good kick as long as you don&#x27;t drink it everyday!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;edit: the price on here fluctuates way too much!&lt;br /&gt;I found this product (12oz) at my local Whole Foods for $2 a can often and even under 2 per can recently. If you have one of these stores nearby it might be worth checking out.</li>
