            <li>I have been using this product for a month and The Alter Ego Garlic Mask Hot Oil Treatment leaves my hair soft and  manageable without breakage.</li>
            <li>This jar would last me probably 8 months around 36 uses and possibly even more.</li>

            <li>I highly recommend this Garlic Mask Treatment/Conditioner.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend &amp; I have recommended to friends&amp; family.</li>
            <li>but, I was expecting a little more from this conditioner.</li>
            <li>My hair feels better after a deep moisture treatment (I use Eden bodyworks jojoba monoi all natural deep conditioner).</li>
            <li>It has a nice consistency which is creamy and not too thick.</li>
            <li>i mean even if you bought a cheap product at 10-12oz at $10 each , three of those will make the price of this product at around the same quantity but this one has a better quality so do the math.i will repurchase it again</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve  used this conditioner for years but decided I wanted to  try something new.</li>
            <li>My Dominican Stylist of 5 years and consistent use of the same products deserve all the credit!  </li>
            <li>This conditioner actually stopped my hair breakage after the first use.  </li>
            <li>Hot oil and deep condition in one.  </li>
            <li>I use it sparingly on my scalp and smooth it down to my ends adding a bit of water.</li>
            <li>After a month, it has stopped shedding completely.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a conditioner that makes your hair feel so soft and a de tangler.</li>
            <li>I am 22 years old</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and manageable, but does not leave it spongy like some conditioners do.</li>
            <li>My hair feels so soft and manageable when I use this product.</li>
            <li>It makes my 4c hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Purchased this about six weeks ago and all I can say is WOW.  </li>
            <li>I bought this conditioner to use it on my daughters hair which is naturally curly and frizzy.  </li>
            <li>- her hair is soft, manegeable and soooo shiny.  </li>
            <li>My shedding and breakage hasn&#x27;t improved and I have used it twice so far.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You get it all from these products for the hair: Vitamins, shine, silky, soft hair.</li>
            <li>: my shedding COMPLETELY stopped.</li>
            <li>It stops shedding &amp; your hair is so soft.  </li>
            <li>I have definitely noticed significantly less shedding and overall better feeling scalp..not as dry and tight as before with more moisture</li>
            <li>This product has met my expectations and I highly recommend this product to people who uses chemicals such as relaxers, perms, and colors.</li>
            <li>and I will definately purchase this conditoner again due to it giving my African American 4a, b, c  shoulder length fine hair, moisture, shine, volume and softness.</li>
            <li>I must say that prior to application, I conditioned my hair with a concoction that I made that consisted of a mix of Silicon Mix, Baba de Caracol, pure liquid protein, Jamaican black castor oil, and about 10 drops of therapeutic grade garlic oil (all obtained right here on Amazon) and let it sit in my hair for about 3-4 minutes prior to applying the Alter Ego.</li>
            <li>When I transitioned from natural hair back to relaxed hair, I began to experience hair fall also; so my mom recommended it to me.  </li>
            <li>I am recently natural and I have been using this stuff for years (especially when permed).</li>
            <li>I have been a long time user of this product but it smelled completely off!</li>
            <li>I usually mix with other deep treatments &amp; sit for like an hour or so with my hot head or under the dryer (not since I got my hot head).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this mask for years and it has kept my hair very thick, shiny and strong.</li>
            <li>Just using a little amount of the treatment covers much.</li>

            <li> Hot oil and deep condition in one.  </li>
            <li> I use it sparingly on my scalp and smooth it down to my ends adding a bit of water.</li>
            <li> After a month, it has stopped shedding completely.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a conditioner that makes your hair feel so soft and a de tangler.</li>
            <li> I am 22 years old</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and manageable, but does not leave it spongy like some conditioners do.</li>
            <li> My hair feels so soft and manageable when I use this product.</li>
            <li> It makes my 4c hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Purchased this about six weeks ago and all I can say is WOW.  </li>
            <li> I bought this conditioner to use it on my daughters hair which is naturally curly and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> - her hair is soft, manegeable and soooo shiny.  </li>
            <li> My shedding and breakage hasn&#x27;t improved and I have used it twice so far.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You get it all from these products for the hair: Vitamins, shine, silky, soft hair.</li>
            <li> : my shedding COMPLETELY stopped.</li>
            <li> It stops shedding &amp; your hair is so soft.  </li>
            <li> I have definitely noticed significantly less shedding and overall better feeling scalp..not as dry and tight as before with more moisture</li>
            <li> This product has met my expectations and I highly recommend this product to people who uses chemicals such as relaxers, perms, and colors.</li>
            <li> and I will definately purchase this conditoner again due to it giving my African American 4a, b, c  shoulder length fine hair, moisture, shine, volume and softness.</li>
            <li> I must say that prior to application, I conditioned my hair with a concoction that I made that consisted of a mix of Silicon Mix, Baba de Caracol, pure liquid protein, Jamaican black castor oil, and about 10 drops of therapeutic grade garlic oil (all obtained right here on Amazon) and let it sit in my hair for about 3-4 minutes prior to applying the Alter Ego.</li>
            <li> When I transitioned from natural hair back to relaxed hair, I began to experience hair fall also; so my mom recommended it to me.  </li>
            <li> I am recently natural and I have been using this stuff for years (especially when permed).</li>
            <li> I have been a long time user of this product but it smelled completely off!</li>
            <li> I usually mix with other deep treatments &amp; sit for like an hour or so with my hot head or under the dryer (not since I got my hot head).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mask for years and it has kept my hair very thick, shiny and strong.</li>
            <li> Just using a little amount of the treatment covers much.</li>
            <li> a doing a dry deep conditioner or regular condiitoning, this product just melts my hair.</li>
            <li> I use it bi-weekly and my shedding has decreased tremendously.</li>
            <li> It seems expensive, but the container is huge.</li>
            <li> I will buy this every time as long as I can find this.</li>
            <li> This is an extremely large-jar which will last quite some time.</li>
            <li> Hair is so dry, brittle and lifeless,</li>
            <li> I have dry transitioning hair</li>
            <li> , hopefully the combo will have my hair very long and luxurious!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t moisturize my hair at all, it felt very dry after rinsing.</li>
            <li> I purchased it for my daughter, who has a very dry hair.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this conditioner to anyone who is having trouble with their hair.</li>
            <li> may find it expensive, but it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Item is exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> I will be a lifelong user.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day as a conditioner.</li>
            <li> You can leave it in all night for extreme conditioning.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone experiencing breakage due to overprocessing.</li>
            <li> I recommend this not as a cure-all but as an agent working together with other agents to control hair loss.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t think its too expensive if you look at how much product  the container has.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair silky and not weighed down.  </li>
            <li> Everytime I used it less hair came out</li>
            <li> I have significantly less shedding after a month of using this product 2x a week.</li>
            <li> almost half of the jar leacked through.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I AM SHEDDING LESS.</li>
            <li> Less shedding.</li>
            <li> It does not smell like garlic, but like products my hair dresser used when I was in high school (1990-1994), yes I know random.  </li>
            <li> It is expensive but I will definitely repurchase again.</li>
            <li> HAIR IS SLOWLY REPAIRING ITSELF.</li>
            <li> It made my thick 4b hair manageable.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> Not only it didn&#x27;t do what was promised, my hair got so much worse that it is scary!</li>
            <li> I was ill and malnutritioned in and out the hospital for a few months and my hair would not stop falling out.</li>
            <li> I finally broke down and paid for it and it is terrible.  </li>
            <li> I was really skeptical about buying this</li>
            <li> usually don&#x27;t post my reviews although I read lots of reviews before buying, but I feel I HAVE to post this review so you would not experience shockingly horrifying results!</li>
            <li> and I make a mad dash for my \\&quot;Alter Ego Garlic Mask\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Does not have an unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Does not smell bad at all.</li>
            <li> This product is ABSOLUTELY  TERRIBLE!</li>
            <li> Result was horrifying!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> After a month, it has stopped shedding completely. I use it every other day as a conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!!! I have been searching for a conditioner that makes your hair feel so soft and a de tangler. I will buy this every time as long as I can find this. It also was delivered on time...Good Stuff!!! And it doesn&#x27;t smell like garlic.</li>
            <li> I purchased to help with postpartum shedding.  Didn&#x27;t really find it helped any, but it did make my hair very soft.  It&#x27;s a good deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> I use this as my co-wash! It&#x27;s rich and creamy and smells awesome.  It leaves my hair silky and not weighed down.  Amazing!</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone I have long and healthy hair because of this product</li>
            <li> Bought this back in December because I saw a recommendation for it on a hair loss blog. I was ill and malnutritioned in and out the hospital for a few months and my hair would not stop falling out. I didn&#x27;t really know what to do.. I am 22 years old so it was too soon to think about any drugs on my scalp. I gave this a shot and honestly my scalp and hair health has gone from 0 to 100. I use it once a week after I wash my hair. So since December that has only been like 10 times. I have not been using anything new, haven&#x27;t changed my diet, so I am sure it is this helping me. I would cry washing my hair which is to the middle of my back and watching it fall into the drain. Everytime I used it less hair came out and today there was only 3 strands in the sink. I will never use anything else. If you don&#x27;t believe me get it and try it for yourself. It may seem expensive but this jar is huge and like I said I used it 10 times and if I smooth the top over neatly it looks unused. This jar would last me probably 8 months around 36 uses and possibly even more. I use it sparingly on my scalp and smooth it down to my ends adding a bit of water.</li>
            <li> Best hair treatment.  Will Definitely re order</li>
            <li> I purchased this because my hair was shedding eay more than normal. I have significantly less shedding after a month of using this product 2x a week. It seems expensive, but the container is huge. Good value, great product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this mask for years and am consistently pleased and my hair is so healthy.  I get compliments daily on my hair...My Dominican Stylist of 5 years and consistent use of the same products deserve all the credit!  I highly recommend this Garlic Mask Treatment/Conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have been a long time user of this product but it smelled completely off! I don&#x27;t know if the formula changed or if i received a unauthentic item</li>
            <li> Awesome conditioner.. my daughter told me about this conditioner and I have to say it makes my hair feel so soft and full.  I definitely recommend this conditioner to anyone who is having trouble with their hair.</li>
            <li> Why pay top $$ at salon when you can buy this product and do it at home.  I apply in shower and wear a shower cap while it sits in my hair for 1/2 to 1 hour.  You can leave it in all night for extreme conditioning.  Works wonderfully. This is an extremely large-jar which will last quite some time.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product. My grandmother has used this product for years. When my mother began to experience hair  fall, she gave her some to try out. My mom loved it! When I transitioned from natural hair back to relaxed hair, I began to experience hair fall also; so my mom recommended it to me.  I love this!  It makes my hair soft and manageable, but does not leave it spongy like some conditioners do. I use it in conjunction with my Mizani regiment and it works well those products. Ii is a bit pricey, but it lasts forever if you have short or medium length hair.  Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> This product is ABSOLUTELY  TERRIBLE! Not only it didn&#x27;t do what was promised, my hair got so much worse that it is scary! I used it only twice, the first time I kept it for 45 min, because some reviews were saying the longer the better, the result would&#x27;ve been better from a $3 conditioner from Wal-Mart, second time I tried it warm, because it is a &amp;#34;hot oil treatment &amp;#34; and some reviews were saying results are better when heated. Result was horrifying! Hair is so dry, brittle and lifeless, that I was about to throw this jar in trash, but will see if Amazon will take it back, just because it is not too cheap.&lt;br /&gt;The package came damadged and almost half of the jar leacked through.&lt;br /&gt;I usually don&#x27;t post my reviews although I read lots of reviews before buying, but I feel I HAVE to post this review so you would not experience shockingly horrifying results!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product! My hair feels so soft and manageable when I use this product. I use it bi-weekly and my shedding has decreased tremendously. And yes, you can even detangle with this! I&#x27;m sold!</li>
            <li> I read reviews on this conditioner and have been interested for a while. I finally broke down and paid for it and it is terrible.  It didn&#x27;t moisturize my hair at all, it felt very dry after rinsing. It may work for others but unfortunately not for me.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It makes my 4c hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best conditioner ever!</li>
            <li> Purchased this about six weeks ago and all I can say is WOW.  I use it as a weekly deep conditioner along with a moisturizing conditioner and it has changed my hair for the better. The portions of my 4B hair that was drier and coarser are softer, smoother, silkier.  I forgot that I initially purchased it to help with shedding because it was so good! Even better is that my shedding has been significantly reduced too.</li>
            <li> Used this product to help with a hair shedding problem. One application made a big difference!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite conditioners, leaves hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I HAVE A SCALP DERMATITIS! AFTER USING THIS PRODUCT AFTER A DAY I CAN TELL A HUGE DIFFERENCE! I AM NO LONGER ITCHY AS MUCH AS I WAS BEFORE.MY HAIR IS SLOWLY REPAIRING ITSELF. I AM SHEDDING LESS. I CANT WAIT TO KEEP USING IT. IT MAKES YOUR HAIR VERY MANAGEABLE AFTER YRS OF DEALING WITH THIS. PRODUCT IS A HEAVEN SENT GIFT I BELIEVE LOL</li>
            <li> I love love this product and now use it as my only condition !!!!!!!!!!!! And smells amazing and Mack my hair silky and so soft and smooth I love it</li>
            <li> Love this product, or those of you scared to try it because of the garlic on the container, it does not smell like garlic, it actually has a pleasant smell. when my hair was thinning it helped.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mask for years and it has kept my hair very thick, shiny and strong. I have kinky/coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I have chosen this product because I read garlic stops hair breakage. I have been using this product for a month and The Alter Ego Garlic Mask Hot Oil Treatment leaves my hair soft and  manageable without breakage. The 33.8 oz. is a nice size for the price. I place it from the root to the end of my hair. Just using a little amount of the treatment covers much. This product has met my expectations and I highly recommend this product to people who uses chemicals such as relaxers, perms, and colors.</li>
            <li> Excellent product that is used by my Dominican stylist.  I noticed the difference immediately.  It thickened my hair.  It lasted 6 months while using once a week.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It made my thick 4b hair manageable.  I was able to run my fingers right through it after I used it.  Does not have an unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> works well. the container is huge. Nice treatment. Does not smell bad at all.</li>
            <li> Was just OK. Didn&#x27;t do anything special for my relaxed hair. My hair feels better after a deep moisture treatment (I use Eden bodyworks jojoba monoi all natural deep conditioner). Will try to moisture treat after and see how it works</li>
            <li> I purchased it for my daughter, who has a very dry hair. The change has been notorious; her hair looks and feels silky, healthy, beautifu! I recommend this product</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner. If I was stranded on an island I&#x27;d like to take this with me. I even use it as a leave in.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it makes your hair feel really soft and very manageable. I am a product junky and I will definately purchase this conditoner again due to it giving my African American 4a, b, c  shoulder length fine hair, moisture, shine, volume and softness. Plus, it smells really nice and my hair feels great after I leave it in for 30 minutes, rinse and air dry, and leave natural or flat ironed.</li>
            <li> I am recently natural and I have been using this stuff for years (especially when permed). It has a great smell &amp; provide good slip. I dont know how to describe it overall but I find that it helps my hair &amp; decreases dryness, split ends. Overall it improves the quality of my hair &amp; moiturizes my hair.  I usually mix with other deep treatments &amp; sit for like an hour or so with my hot head or under the dryer (not since I got my hot head).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some may find it expensive, but it is worth every penny. I Love this stuff. Cheapest I have ever found this size container. You will not be dissapointed.</li>
            <li> I bought this conditioner to use it on my daughters hair which is naturally curly and frizzy.  I could tell the difference right away when I used this on her hair for the first time - her hair is soft, manegeable and soooo shiny.  I am using it on my own hair too and I absolutely love it.  BTW, the conditioner doesnt smell like garlic at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but, I was expecting a little more from this conditioner. I have thick hair so I need to use a lot to cover my hair and scalp. My shedding and breakage hasn&#x27;t improved and I have used it twice so far. I won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li> A++++ Seller :)  Item is exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> I use it to deep condition my hair as part of my hair care regimen. It prevents shedding and leaves my hair supple and easy to comb through</li>
            <li> They say it&#x27;s great for shedding and it sure is.I&#x27;ve been using this Mask for years.I love it.I can&#x27;t do without it.My relaxed color treated hair sheds every winter and I make a mad dash for my \\&quot;Alter Ego Garlic Mask\\&quot;.It smells great and nothing like garlic.I use it with and without heat.With heat I keep it on for 15min.Without heat it stays in my hair for 5 or 10 min.This is great stuff!I&#x27;m so glad they invented this.I also recently purchased the shampoo which is also great.I can&#x27;t express how much I absolutely love this product.My hair would be so much thinner without it.My hair grows when I&#x27;m using it.It does what it says.It&#x27;s safe for color treated hair.It has a nice consistency which is creamy and not too thick.It smells lovely.And it&#x27;s worth every penny because it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> I use this about 1x per week. I will put it on my hair, put a shower cap on and sleep with it on.  The next day after I wash it, it feels really great, although I haven&#x27;t really seen an improvement in my hair overall.</li>
            <li> This conditioner actually stopped my hair breakage after the first use.  I would recommend this product to anyone experiencing breakage due to overprocessing.</li>
            <li> Alter Ego products are the best hand down.&lt;br /&gt;You get it all from these products for the hair: Vitamins, shine, silky, soft hair.</li>
            <li> I have definitely noticed significantly less shedding and overall better feeling scalp..not as dry and tight as before with more moisture</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Love this product.</li>
            <li> i just purchase this today and used it for the first time.my hair didn&#x27;t shred as it normally do so im sure with continue usage the shredding will stop. i don&#x27;t think its too expensive if you look at how much product  the container has. i mean even if you bought a cheap product at 10-12oz at $10 each , three of those will make the price of this product at around the same quantity but this one has a better quality so do the math.i will repurchase it again</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Hot oil and deep condition in one.  Makes hair very soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> Now, THIS.....is an excellent conditioner. GREAT slip, very moisturizing and the best part of all: my shedding COMPLETELY stopped. I have been having an issue with shedding for months and it has caused significant breakage to my hair, but I believe that I have finally found a product that delivers what it promises! I must say that prior to application, I conditioned my hair with a concoction that I made that consisted of a mix of Silicon Mix, Baba de Caracol, pure liquid protein, Jamaican black castor oil, and about 10 drops of therapeutic grade garlic oil (all obtained right here on Amazon) and let it sit in my hair for about 3-4 minutes prior to applying the Alter Ego. I then covered my hair with a plastic cap and did some things around the house for about an hour before rinsing. My hair was super easy to detangle and again, since blowing and flat ironing my hair...NO SHEDDING! I just purchased the Revitalizing Lotion and it came today, hopefully the combo will have my hair very long and luxurious!</li>
            <li> This is the best deep conditioner in the world!!! It stops shedding &amp; your hair is so soft.  It does not smell like garlic, but like products my hair dresser used when I was in high school (1990-1994), yes I know random.  LOL.  I highly recommend &amp; I have recommended to friends&amp; family.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve  used this conditioner for years but decided I wanted to  try something new. Well, if it ain&#x27;t  broke don&#x27;t fix it.  My hair is healthy and shine with this conditioner.</li>
            <li> OMG!!! I was really skeptical about buying this but I am glad I bought it and in the bigger container! It has stopped my shedding completely!!! I have been shedding for months and nothing seemed to work and I came across this and thought it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try!! It has a great slip to it as well!! It is expensive but I will definitely repurchase again. I am a very happy customer:)</li>
            <li> I have dry transitioning hair and i can not get enough of this product.  WHen applied to my hair whether im a doing a dry deep conditioner or regular condiitoning, this product just melts my hair. It is so soft to the touch,the slip is incredible. I will be a lifelong user.</li>
            <li> Although my wife did experience reduced hair loss, it was not as good as we anticipated, but it is better than any other product we have found on the market. I recommend this not as a cure-all but as an agent working together with other agents to control hair loss.</li>
            <li> Really helped stop my shedding problem after having a baby.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost two years now sand it works very well on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It works for me!</li>
            <li> Love it! Less shedding.</li>
            <li> Great product and it works!</li>
