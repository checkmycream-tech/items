            <li>Panasonic from Japan, product that trust :)</li>
            <li>I bought this hair drier thinking that it was made in Japan, but after receiving it, found out that it is just like most of the Panasonic products are, made in Thailand.</li>
            <li>It was my first time using it and loved it.</li>
            <li>The ability to adjust the barrel size is very useful if I want to get more volume.</li>
            <li>I was seeking for a product that can let my hair root stand and easy to use.</li>
            <li>just tried this product, it is so easy to use and styling so well.</li>
            <li>Shipment takes a bit long but very good product</li>
            <li>and it was fine.  </li>
            <li>This dryer is not as powerful as most</li>
            <li>So after a good nearly 10 years, the Tescom retired itself and I needed a replacement.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, this performs much better than the conair hot brush.</li>
            <li>I think it will work better for naturally straight and fine hair.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer IS powerful, but you have to make sure you set it for the right voltage</li>
            <li>It is also extremely gentle for our fine</li>
            <li>But, it is totally worth the money and the wait.</li>
            <li>and it is plenty powerful.  </li>
            <li>This product is definitely worth purchasing.</li>
            <li>Since I always need to use a straightener after blow drying, I was looking for a product that would dry my hair nicely before I need to use the straightener.</li>
            <li>I love this powerful, yet simple to use hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Panasonic in Japan makes great quality products so after a little searching and looking through reviews I ordered this model - mainly because of the adjustable styling brush</li>
            <li>Anyway, I was worried at first because the packaging and most of the instructions are in Japanese.  </li>
            <li>there is a portion in English, so be sure to read that part so that you can use this tool</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t feel too hot or blow too forcefully.</li>
            <li>Dried hair in good time</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is way better than the one I&#x27;d had for so long</li>
            <li>I was pleased that it shipped to quickly, shipped one hour after I ordered it and arrive in less than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>But, heat generating devices are usually pretty high wattage...meaning you&#x27;d need some pretty hefty transformers to do the job.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair a little frizzy but it is light and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>This product is very durable, it shows on the design.</li>
            <li>and arrived very promptly and packaged very well.</li>

            <li>I do not want it straight.</li>
            <li>It is fairly quiet and light in weight, the power cord swirvels so it doesn&#x27;t get tangled during use.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it !</li>
            <li>I have fine shoulder length hair and it did not take an hour to dry, as another reviewer stated.  </li>

            <li>That had been the best hair dryer I had owned, and the American market doesn&#x27;t have any (nothing of the same quality at least) as the one I&#x27;d had.</li>
            <li>plus with this particular model is that you don&#x27;t need a power converter--just switch between 100/120 and 200/240 depending on where your location is in the world.</li>
            <li>My hair requires constant care because I have no natural curl and have very fine hair.</li>
            <li>Being an Indian girl, I have very frizzy and untamed naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>Great for styling my bangs and giving my layers a little bit of body and slight curl at the ends.</li>
            <li>It is quiet and easy to use but heat is not enough.</li>
            <li>being said, you could use a transformer for such devices if you really must have them.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft and shiny, not dried out or frizzy.</li>
            <li>I really need one of these that goes from 1/4-1 inch barrel as I have very short layered hair</li>

            <li>She mentioned to me that she wanted to get one of those old hair dryers we had when I was a kid--one of these Panasonic hair dryers from Taiwan.</li>

            <li>Not hot enough or powerful enough to dry, or style, my fine hair.</li>
            <li>I am excited to use this and try to figure out the round brush too.</li>
            <li>If it works on my unique hair, I can only imagine how the results would be for someone who has straighter and less frizzier hair than myself.</li>
            <li>This dryer does wonders to gently blow dry my hair and not cause tangles.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I could not use my Conair Infiniti pro hot brush when I travel to other country.</li>
            <li>My wife was looking for a high quality hair dryer for a long time.</li>
            <li>I dried most of my hair and then used this upside down to give my hair some lift and bounce, which it did.  </li>
            <li>I bought a Tescom hair dryer almost 10 years ago from a Japanese chain that is locally owned where I live, very similar to this one except without the extra styling attachment.</li>
            <li>Before buying it for her, I noted that many reviewer said it worked for them and they had thick dark hair.</li>
            <li>I think you could get away with using just this dryer and a little serum (depending on how naturally straight your hair is).</li>

            <li> Before i bought this product, I used to use a round hair brush and blow dry my hair in order to let my root stand, but it takes so much effort.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> as if I flat ironed it).  </li>
            <li> They are easy to use with the blower/brush combo and prevents your hair from blowing in the wrong direction.</li>
            <li> electrical system is roughly the same as the US&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> My mom was looking around for a new hair dryer but kept on finding products that never satisfied.</li>
            <li> I do keep using it every other day and use a regular curling iron in between to redo my hair.</li>
            <li> There were also reviews of people saying it was way under powered and wouldn&#x27;t dry their hair.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t blow my hair dry.</li>
            <li> (Of course, I didn&#x27;t attempt to dry my hair</li>
            <li> I wrap my hair in a towel and do other things for a while before attempting to blow dry.)  </li>
            <li> I tried to find a way to let the know but didn&#x27;t because the writing was Asian l will continue to try to order the round attachment</li>
            <li> when it is dripping wet either.  </li>
            <li> Look at all your other hair dyers and electrical appliances.</li>
            <li> There may be other brands; just look for hair straightening dryer or something like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> every other curling hair dryer I have used.</li>
            <li> I used the regular brush to dry my hair, as I&#x27;m not sure how to use the round brush yet.  </li>
            <li> I would give this a try if you are someone who likes the look of their hair when it is blow dried and/or flat ironed but with what seems much less damage.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, wavy hair and this dries and styles it in half the time.  </li>
            <li> My expert opinion is I would stay away from using any appliance that generates heat...such as a hairdryer (as previously mentioned) or a kotatsu or a boiler for tea water...unless you know what you are doing!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why the wide range of reviews.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife who has thin blonde hair.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t get the round attachment brush</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to ladies who hate having to try and style their hair with a traditional blow dryer and a round brush.</li>
            <li> But, the hairdryer my wife received was too weak and took over an hour to dry her shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> They usually say 120V or 125V.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I waste my money on it!</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and this one doesn&#x27;t work with me, not hot at all! 👎</li>
            <li> It came with two attachments, one for straightening and one for curl (adjustable from 25 - 40cm), the bristles feel a bit hard for me.</li>
            <li> If your hair is thick and curly like mine, this will not give you the heat you need for straightening it.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;d hate to have to get a voltage converter for something that is everyday use).</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I bought this because I could not use my Conair Infiniti pro hot brush when I travel to other country. Fortunately, this performs much better than the conair hot brush. Aside from providing me a good styled-hair, my hair also shines better after using this. This product is very durable, it shows on the design. I&#x27;ve been using this regularly for three months now.</li>
            <li> Without this hair dryer, I wii be in trouble.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using  this  same type of  hair dryer  by panasonic since my college year about 30years.</li>
            <li> It took about 2-3 weeks to receive this product. But, it is totally worth the money and the wait. It is by far, the best and easiest hair dryer I have used. I don&#x27;t like spending a lot of time doing my hair, but I do love salon results, this product will give you both!, I am extremely happy with it. This hair dryer IS powerful, but you have to make sure you set it for the right voltage (the instructions explain how, it&#x27;s really simple).</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom, she loves it!! and arrived very promptly and packaged very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why the wide range of reviews. I bought this for my wife who has thin blonde hair. Before buying it for her, I noted that many reviewer said it worked for them and they had thick dark hair. There were also reviews of people saying it was way under powered and wouldn&#x27;t dry their hair. So I can&#x27;t figure out whether the quality varies from hairdryer to hairdryer or if the raving reviews are bogus. But, the hairdryer my wife received was too weak and took over an hour to dry her shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> Not hot enough or powerful enough to dry, or style, my fine hair.</li>
            <li> The power is much weaker than I thougt. I can&#x27;t blow my hair dry.</li>
            <li> Great hairdryer but I didn&#x27;t get the round attachment brush and I wanted that. I tried to find a way to let the know but didn&#x27;t because the writing was Asian l will continue to try to order the round attachment</li>
            <li> I like this kind of hairdrier. It leaves my hair a little frizzy but it is light and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> This thing had sparks coming out of it, so I called Panasonic and they said that these were made for use in Japan. They say 100Volts on them. Look at all your other hair dyers and electrical appliances. They usually say 120V or 125V.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve copied and pasted this from a blog where someone asked if you can use Japanese appliances in the U.S.: &amp;#34;Can you use Japanse appliances in the US?&lt;br /&gt;I am an electrical engineer. My expert opinion is I would stay away from using any appliance that generates heat...such as a hairdryer (as previously mentioned) or a kotatsu or a boiler for tea water...unless you know what you are doing!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Japan&#x27;s electrical system is roughly the same as the US&#x27;s. However, the US&#x27;s voltage is 120Vac RMS (60Hz)while Japan&#x27;s is 100Vac RMS (50 or 60Hz depending on region).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, any heat generating device from Japan that is used in the US will get 20% hotter than it&#x27;s design intended. The risk is damage to the device and/or fire...or injury of a person. Please be careful!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, you could use a transformer for such devices if you really must have them. But, heat generating devices are usually pretty high wattage...meaning you&#x27;d need some pretty hefty transformers to do the job.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We do have another of these dryers that&#x27;s a slightly different model that hasn&#x27;t sparked, but knowing what I know now, I wouldn&#x27;t buy another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve put a link below to a similar dryer that&#x27;s Conair brand that we&#x27;ve bought before and which is what I&#x27;m replacing this unit with. There may be other brands; just look for hair straightening dryer or something like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ME2YWG/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1</li>
            <li> This dryer is not as powerful as most but that is a good thing. Leaves my hair soft and shiny, not dried out or frizzy.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a device to take with me to Europe and after reading the reviews I chose this one.  It is a nice size and combines a curling iron and hair dryer.  Have used it once and it is plenty powerful.  Will continue to use it when I return from my trip.  I was pleased that it shipped to quickly, shipped one hour after I ordered it and arrive in less than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I was actually looking for something else when I stumbled upon this and thought &amp;#34;why not&amp;#34;.  I am very pleased with this purchase.  I have fine shoulder length hair and it did not take an hour to dry, as another reviewer stated.  (Of course, I didn&#x27;t attempt to dry my hair when it is dripping wet either.  I wrap my hair in a towel and do other things for a while before attempting to blow dry.)  Anyway, I was worried at first because the packaging and most of the instructions are in Japanese.  But I used it on the lower voltage and it was fine.  I used the regular brush to dry my hair, as I&#x27;m not sure how to use the round brush yet.  I dried most of my hair and then used this upside down to give my hair some lift and bounce, which it did.  Also, my hair does not look frizzy, like it does at times when using a regular blow dryer (I believe because sometimes a regular blow dryer both damages and tends to tangle your hair).  My hair actually looks shiny as well as smooth (as if I flat ironed it).  I would give this a try if you are someone who likes the look of their hair when it is blow dried and/or flat ironed but with what seems much less damage.  I think you could get away with using just this dryer and a little serum (depending on how naturally straight your hair is). I am excited to use this and try to figure out the round brush too.</li>
            <li> I really need one of these that goes from 1/4-1 inch barrel as I have very short layered hair I need to and volume and height to and turn curlers to soft waves.  I do not want it straight.</li>
            <li> If your hair is thick and curly like mine, this will not give you the heat you need for straightening it. It is quiet and easy to use but heat is not enough. It does not have options of speed or degrees of heat. I think it will work better for naturally straight and fine hair.</li>
            <li> The dryer is light and good for traveling. If you need to travel a lot, this product is good for the dual voltage.</li>
            <li> Great product that i have searched for many years....good power &amp; dual voltage</li>
            <li> My wife was looking for a high quality hair dryer for a long time. Finally, we found what she was looking for. Panasonic from Japan, product that trust :)</li>
            <li> It works great and is worth the price. Only thing is I wish the curling brush could get fatter.</li>
            <li> Best hair dryer/styler I have ever had.  I have thick, coarse, wavy hair and this dries and styles it in half the time.  I&#x27;ll use a blow dryer on my roots, then use this.</li>
            <li> I was seeking for a product that can let my hair root stand and easy to use. That is the one. Before i bought this product, I used to use a round hair brush and blow dry my hair in order to let my root stand, but it takes so much effort.&lt;br /&gt;I just tried this product, it is so easy to use and styling so well. It wroth the price.</li>
            <li> Shipment takes a bit long but very good product</li>
            <li> Nice , small  and effect</li>
            <li> There is nothing like these hair dryers in the USA. My mom was looking around for a new hair dryer but kept on finding products that never satisfied. She mentioned to me that she wanted to get one of those old hair dryers we had when I was a kid--one of these Panasonic hair dryers from Taiwan. I got this and it is just like the ones we had back then. They are easy to use with the blower/brush combo and prevents your hair from blowing in the wrong direction. There are two modes that are \\&quot;blow\\&quot; and \\&quot;set\\&quot;. It is also extremely gentle for our fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A plus with this particular model is that you don&#x27;t need a power converter--just switch between 100/120 and 200/240 depending on where your location is in the world. The manual that comes with this product is mostly in Japanese--but! there is a portion in English, so be sure to read that part so that you can use this tool properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One downside... the price. I wish it was more affordable because this is really a great product.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair drier thinking that it was made in Japan, but after receiving it, found out that it is just like most of the Panasonic products are, made in Thailand. I like that this is dual voltage, great for travel between US (110 v) and Hong Kong (220 v). It came with two attachments, one for straightening and one for curl (adjustable from 25 - 40cm), the bristles feel a bit hard for me. I have very fine hair, this product dries my hair in about 10 minutes (in US with 110 v), I haven&#x27;t tried this in Hong Kong with 220v yet, I will find out and update the review. It is fairly quiet and light in weight, the power cord swirvels so it doesn&#x27;t get tangled during use.</li>
            <li> Works great... Better than advertised! I would/have recomended this product to others and it works like a dream on my daughters hair too!</li>
            <li> I like the curling hair dryer and am getting used to using it. My hair requires constant care because I have no natural curl and have very fine hair. I think a person with some natural wave or curl and thicker hair than mine would find this a marvelous curling hair dryer. I do keep using it every other day and use a regular curling iron in between to redo my hair. This curling hair dryer by far beats every other curling hair dryer I have used.</li>
            <li> It was my first time using it and loved it.</li>
            <li> I have only used it once but it was quiet. Didn&#x27;t feel too hot or blow too forcefully. I still had to use a curling iron briefly to curl short hair which slipped through. Dried hair in good time (I have a bob). I liked the reviews it got and was from Japan. Took  a while to figure out some pictures which were not explained on the English page. I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> To the people who think this is underpowered, you need to set it to 120v.&lt;br /&gt;Mine started working after that.</li>
            <li> Being an Indian girl, I have very frizzy and untamed naturally curly hair. This dryer does wonders to gently blow dry my hair and not cause tangles. The plastic bristles are perfect for my hair. The ability to adjust the barrel size is very useful if I want to get more volume. Since I always need to use a straightener after blow drying, I was looking for a product that would dry my hair nicely before I need to use the straightener. This is that product. I have had it for a year now and it still impresses me each time I use it. If it works on my unique hair, I can only imagine how the results would be for someone who has straighter and less frizzier hair than myself. This product is definitely worth purchasing.</li>
            <li> Works really great I didn&#x27;t expect that! Love it!!! I highly recommend it !</li>
            <li> I waste my money on it! I have thin hair and this one doesn&#x27;t work with me, not hot at all! 👎</li>
            <li> I bought a Tescom hair dryer almost 10 years ago from a Japanese chain that is locally owned where I live, very similar to this one except without the extra styling attachment. That had been the best hair dryer I had owned, and the American market doesn&#x27;t have any (nothing of the same quality at least) as the one I&#x27;d had. So after a good nearly 10 years, the Tescom retired itself and I needed a replacement. I did a search for the same brand and several Panasonics came up. Panasonic in Japan makes great quality products so after a little searching and looking through reviews I ordered this model - mainly because of the adjustable styling brush AND it was dual voltage (I&#x27;d hate to have to get a voltage converter for something that is everyday use). This hair dryer is way better than the one I&#x27;d had for so long and I love it! Great for styling my bangs and giving my layers a little bit of body and slight curl at the ends. I would highly recommend this product to ladies who hate having to try and style their hair with a traditional blow dryer and a round brush.</li>
            <li> I love this powerful, yet simple to use hair dryer. It gives me a great look with not so much effort!</li>
