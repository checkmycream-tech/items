    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It seems to be the best non-prescription cream on the market to help with the itching</li>
            <li>Good luck!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It worked best when I also rubbed a good amount well into my hands at night and then slept with cotton gloves in addition to using it during the day.</li>
            <li>I use this in compination with Psoriasin and its great.  </li>
            <li>This works great on my friends Psoriasis.  </li>
            <li>That said I have fairly severe psoriasis</li>
            <li>Good luck</li>
            <li>and you should see good improvment, but i haven&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff and saw results from using this even when my prescription medicine my dermatologist gave me didn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li>Diet and keeping in good health are very important.</li>
            <li>TriDerma Psoriasis Control does a good job of controlling it if I make sure to get a tube containing 3% salicylic acid (which this item is described as having).</li>
            <li>I am thrilled.  </li>
            <li>Both are sold by Baar, which has their own site, and also sells through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>has struggled to find an effective treatment..until we discovered this one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;She cannot believe how effectively this cleared up her skin.</li>
            <li>I  use this to help control my psoriasis and feel it is more effective than the TriDerma ointment.  </li>
            <li>WalMart and Walgreens used to carry it, and it was way cheaper, but I&#x27;m glad to find it online since it&#x27;s not in town anymore.</li>
            <li>I just ordered 2 more tubes.</li>
            <li>and hopefully you will have better treatment.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok for redness and itch.but not</li>
            <li>I guess it could be ok to use to give your skin a break from the Rx meds.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products to relieve the itch, scales &amp; redness.  </li>
            <li>the redness is gone and the flakes are 75% better than they were.  </li>
            <li>After a day my hand was noticeably better.</li>
            <li>Think I will use a q-tip to more precisely put it where I want</li>
            <li>Works fast too and feels good when you put it on does not smell either.  </li>
            <li>Helps reduce the itching, redness, and continued application will heal the spots quickly.</li>
            <li>Maybe it helps mild psoriasis</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it...</li>
            <li>The product is ok, I haven&#x27;t really noticed any major change.</li>
            <li>This product has made my hands smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>Works very well!      </li>
            <li>It took a while to heal all the way (2 weeks) but what a relief to have it heal after many months of trying different things with no effect.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing and if you have stubborn patches of psoriasis that won&#x27;t go away with other products, I would give this one a try.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok for cheap and helpful for little bit my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll come back and update to see the long term results, but I thought I&#x27;d let you good people know that it might be worth a try.  </li>
            <li>I find an over the counter lotion does a better job of controlling the dry, flaking, irritated skin.</li>
            <li>Does not work very well when I have applied it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use it as much since when I apply it, it tends to leave my hair greasy.</li>
            <li>I have not noticed any real improvment.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable to put on, has no odor, and one tube was enough.</li>
            <li>Working as intended, was skeptical but it shows good promise!</li>
            <li>To spend 20 dollars for the product; that including shipping and handling, and not seeing any improvment is very dissapointing, especially when you were excited to get some relief and have your skin clear.</li>
            <li>On the packet it says it can be used for that particular skin condition</li>
            <li>But even just using it during the day and after getting hands wet made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I have used it everyday, atleast twice a day or more.</li>
            <li>It can control a sudden flare-up, too, if you get to it right away.  </li>
            <li>For several hours in fact.&lt;br /&gt; I used my fingers first on my scalp with this.  </li>
            <li>At first the scales came off and by day 5 of daily use (1-2</li>
            <li>If anything, it may gradually remove some scales, but my skin is still very pink and looks more inflammed and the spots haven&#x27;t diminshed or gotten any smaller.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work to clear the scaling but it didn&#x27;t make my psoriasis any worse.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also do not let up when you start to see improvements, keep applying frequently.</li>
            <li>They have a complete starter kit for psoriasis, as well.  </li>
            <li>I tried several products and lotions without success, and many of them hurt to put on the areas of broken skin.</li>
            <li>When red spots first appeared, my medical intuitive said that it was caused by an acidic system.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a white cream that spreads on clear.</li>
            <li>but it apparently it is a miracle cream.</li>
            <li>Now that the summer is pretty much here, i am let down that this product is not what i expected.</li>
            <li>It also says it is suppose to be fast active</li>
            <li>Not oily exactly, umm heavy</li>
            <li>I had the most control with Psoriasin shampoo which I used for both my scalp and my body, but suddenly the company stopped making Psoriasin shampoo and the other Psoriasin products are not effective in helping me control any of my psoriasis problems.</li>

            <li> I have really bad psoriasis.  I am skeptical of non-prescription claims, but my massage therapist used it one session on a spot on my ankle, and I was convinced.  You can only use the current prescription meds for so long without causing other problems.  I had lots of recurrence with just the prescription meds, but when I use this as a supplement the plaques stay gone longer.  It can control a sudden flare-up, too, if you get to it right away.  I&#x27;m very pleased with it.  WalMart and Walgreens used to carry it, and it was way cheaper, but I&#x27;m glad to find it online since it&#x27;s not in town anymore.</li>
            <li> I  use this to help control my psoriasis and feel it is more effective than the TriDerma ointment.  I also use the TriDerma shampoo which is helpful too.  I had the most control with Psoriasin shampoo which I used for both my scalp and my body, but suddenly the company stopped making Psoriasin shampoo and the other Psoriasin products are not effective in helping me control any of my psoriasis problems.</li>
            <li> Working as intended, was skeptical but it shows good promise!</li>
            <li> I have Parkinson&#x27;s Disease associated seborrhoeic dermatitis (the two conditions often go together). TriDerma Psoriasis Control does a good job of controlling it if I make sure to get a tube containing 3% salicylic acid (which this item is described as having). I once bought the same product at a discount store but it contained only 2.5% salicylic acid. It hardly worked at all.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and if you have stubborn patches of psoriasis that won&#x27;t go away with other products, I would give this one a try. I saw small improvements after just two-three applications and significant improvements after just a few days. Helps reduce the itching, redness, and continued application will heal the spots quickly. The packaging says that you can apply it up to four times a day. I would suggest doing this for the quickest results. Also do not let up when you start to see improvements, keep applying frequently. I love this stuff and saw results from using this even when my prescription medicine my dermatologist gave me didn&#x27;t! I&#x27;ve already gotten my roommate to go out and buy some and will continue to sing this product&#x27;s praises. I&#x27;ve never felt the need to review a product in my life but this did it, I had to let people know so it can help them too!</li>
            <li> I have had psoriasis for over ten years and have tried everything.  Either they are way too expensive or takes forever to work.  I use this in compination with Psoriasin and its great.  Works fast too and feels good when you put it on does not smell either.  Awemsome stuff!!!</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis on the palms of my hands.  Nothing i tried would relieve the itching, cracking or bleeding.  This product has made my hands smooth and soft.  I am thrilled.  I just ordered 2 more tubes.</li>
            <li> I tried this for a week instead of my clobetasol and it just did not work as well.  That said I have fairly severe psoriasis that when I&#x27;m broke out nothing but shots work.    Good luck and hopefully you will have better treatment.</li>
            <li> This product stops the itching, flaking and raised skin problems.  Works very well!      When red spots first appeared, my medical intuitive said that it was caused by an acidic system.  As it progressed, I thought it seemed to be toxins.  I looked at photos of skin problems, and decided it looked like psoriasis.  I then researched the cause of psoriasis.  Of course, I got no good answers from mainstream channels, but found that Edgar Cayce had stated that it was caused by acidity, which causes intestinal leakage, thus toxins in the system coming out through the skin.  My intuitive had also been telling me that I had digestive issues.  The diagnoses were in agreement.  In addition to medicinal teas I took, following Cayce&#x27;s advice, I added tea made from American saffron and also slippery elm powder.  Both are sold by Baar, which has their own site, and also sells through Amazon.  They have a complete starter kit for psoriasis, as well.  The cream they sell is 2% salicylic acid, while TriDerma is 3%.  You may want the lesser on delicate eye and temple areas.  Not sure about that, but that&#x27;s my route.  Good luck!</li>
            <li> Doc says I have an allergy on my scalp.  Actually it was on my scalp, eyelids and ears. Started on my eyelids.  I had never even heard of such a thing. He gave me rx for anti itch.  It works.  But doesn&#x27;t solve the problem.&lt;br /&gt;Been trying different shampoo and conditioners for itchy scalp, and thought while I was at it, I would try this too.&lt;br /&gt;It does stop the itching.  At least temporarily. For several hours in fact.&lt;br /&gt; I used my fingers first on my scalp with this.  Won&#x27;t do that again.  Think I will use a q-tip to more precisely put it where I want it.&lt;br /&gt;I could feel later, it was in my hair.  Not oily exactly, umm heavy I guess??  On skin- can&#x27;t even tell it&#x27;s there.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a white cream that spreads on clear. Not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s worth it...</li>
            <li> This product is the only thing that seems to help keep my&lt;br /&gt;husband Psoriasis  in control as he can&#x27;t take the medication.&lt;br /&gt;The stores around here no longer carry the product.</li>
            <li> Does not work very well when I have applied it. I find an over the counter lotion does a better job of controlling the dry, flaking, irritated skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok for redness and itch.but not improved.&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s ok for cheap and helpful for little bit my skin.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the TriDerma Psoriasis control didn&#x27;t do anything for me so I am still looking for a non-prescription way to help my skin. It didn&#x27;t make my skin worse, so I guess it could be ok to use to give your skin a break from the Rx meds.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work to clear the scaling but it didn&#x27;t make my psoriasis any worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No awful scent, no greasy mess and no improvement.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother who has Psoriasis on her hands.&lt;br /&gt;She has struggled to find an effective treatment..until we discovered this one.&lt;br /&gt;She cannot believe how effectively this cleared up her skin. You do have to keep using it (it isn&#x27;t a cure) but it apparently it is a miracle cream.</li>
            <li> I have a patch of psoriasis that showed up a few months back on on my ankle.  I have tried so many products to relieve the itch, scales &amp; redness.  Nothing is working so I tried this product.  It helps with the itch for a little while but does not seem to be clearing up the problem.  I am applying the product throughout the day as well.  Maybe it helps mild psoriasis but it does not help my psoriasis.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use it as much since when I apply it, it tends to leave my hair greasy. The product is ok, I haven&#x27;t really noticed any major change.</li>
            <li> This med did not give me the relief  that the Triderma Eczema and psoriasis combination cream I used last winter did.</li>
            <li> I recieved this item on tuesday, today is Saturday. I have used it everyday, atleast twice a day or more. I have not noticed any real improvment. If anything, it may gradually remove some scales, but my skin is still very pink and looks more inflammed and the spots haven&#x27;t diminshed or gotten any smaller. I am not sure how long it it suppose to take to start working, but the bottle is pretty small, so it seems if it actually worked you would run out of it before your skin would heal. It also says it is suppose to be fast active and you should see good improvment, but i haven&#x27;t. To spend 20 dollars for the product; that including shipping and handling, and not seeing any improvment is very dissapointing, especially when you were excited to get some relief and have your skin clear. Now that the summer is pretty much here, i am let down that this product is not what i expected.</li>
            <li> I order this for my wife who has psoriasis. It seems to be the best non-prescription cream on the market to help with the itching and it keeps the skin on her hands looking half way decently.</li>
            <li> Psoriasis and Eczema are two skin conditions that can be difficult to control. Diet and keeping in good health are very important. This product was recommended by our dermatologist. It is not greasy and it does help. Of course, nothing cures this skin condition but products such as this keep it under control.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to say I love it, even though it&#x27;s not perfect for the scalp (it is a lotion so, it&#x27;s rather cumbersome to apply and makes the hair in that area thick from the lotion).  I use this for my daughter who has seborrheic dermatitis (so I can&#x27;t testify that it works for psorasis, sorry).  On the packet it says it can be used for that particular skin condition so I gave it a try.  My daughter&#x27;s scalp was thick with flakes, red with sores (from her picking at it).  I&#x27;ve tried tea tree oil, jojoba oil, antibiotics, antifungal prescriptions and creams, Selsun Blue, Zinc shampoos and this is the ONLY thing that has help her.  At first the scales came off and by day 5 of daily use (1-2 x&#x27;s a day) the redness is gone and the flakes are 75% better than they were.  I&#x27;ll come back and update to see the long term results, but I thought I&#x27;d let you good people know that it might be worth a try.  It&#x27;s salycitic acid 3% with anti-inflammatory ingredients.</li>
            <li> I had a very bad scaling, swelling and breaking of skin on several fingers. I tried several products and lotions without success, and many of them hurt to put on the areas of broken skin. This product actually worked. It is comfortable to put on, has no odor, and one tube was enough. After a day my hand was noticeably better. It took a while to heal all the way (2 weeks) but what a relief to have it heal after many months of trying different things with no effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked best when I also rubbed a good amount well into my hands at night and then slept with cotton gloves in addition to using it during the day. But even just using it during the day and after getting hands wet made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> This works great on my friends Psoriasis.  Takes care of the itch and helps with the healing.</li>
