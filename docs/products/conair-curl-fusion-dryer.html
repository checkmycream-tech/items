            <li>I really am impressed with this dryer.  </li>
            <li>EXCELLENT EXCELLENT EXCELLENT</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this product</li>
            <li>It is perfect for my hair type.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a very good hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for my wavy hair, has plenty of power, great price.</li>
            <li>i have this dryer and loved it!  </li>
            <li>This one dries my hair beautifully; the attachment allows for the curls to come out without being blown out.  </li>
            <li>After some searching, I found this one and it is a great replacement.</li>
            <li>The design is great for curly hair because it doesn&#x27;t blow your hair all over the place, which can separate curls and cause frizz.  </li>
            <li>A great product.</li>
            <li>Great price and would recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Very happy this dryer type still available from somewhere.</li>
            <li>The circular airflow superior even to diffused pistol types.</li>
            <li>It seemed like a good idea</li>
            <li>This feels good in your hand and it has a cooling button to use at the end to set the hair.</li>
            <li>Using fusion dryer makes my curls look great which I love.</li>
            <li>I just love it!</li>
            <li>I have wavy curly fine hair and this is the prefect way for me to get a great style without any frizz.  </li>
            <li>This dryer effectively \\&quot;drys\\</li>
            <li>I needed an additional dryer and thought this model might work since so many reviews were good.  </li>
            <li>the Cool Shot feature is a good idea</li>
            <li>I was looking for something more portable for travel.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I just love  this one.</li>
            <li>but I am satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>I like this one better than something with an attachment that keeps falling off.</li>
            <li>Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>I have fine, wavy hair that curls mostly at the ends.  </li>
            <li>Had original \\&quot;Curly-Top\\&quot; from Gillette many years ago.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>The dryer just isn&#x27;t very hot and the \\&quot;HI\\&quot; setting is more like a breeze.  </li>
            <li>i had this blow dryer for like 5 years, it was my favorite blow dryer ever, the heating element finally gave out and i had to replace it, i am not as happy with the blow dryer i just bought, although it is the same brand; its just not as effective.</li>
            <li>You must use it on low and make sure you scrunch as much hair together onto the diffuser to get a great curl.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not disappointed in any way</li>
            <li>and I read so many positive reviews...</li>
            <li>&quot; my curls in 5-10 minutes (every good curly haired person should know it&#x27;s a cardinal sin to dry your curls</li>
            <li>I have short curly hair and this is just perfect to dry it.  </li>
            <li>If you want a normal hair dryer, this is fine.  </li>
            <li>The trick is to aim the warm air upwards through your curls, not at your scalp, and to not hols the dryer in one section for too long.</li>
            <li>The less concentrated flow of air is a good thing, but my hair is still frizzy.</li>
            <li>although this one isn&#x27;t as hot)</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t try to use the pixiecurl method of drying with it as the holes are too large.</li>
            <li>I have  curly hair and was having a hard time finding one with a really good diffuser.  </li>
            <li>really makes a difference...</li>
            <li>and it was really blowing.  </li>
            <li>, doesent&#x27; fry my hair with too much heat.  </li>
            <li>This one gently drys my curls without adding frizz.</li>
            <li>I have wavy, thin hair and this gives me great curls.  </li>
            <li>This dryer really dries my hair a lot faster.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve found this one to work really well.  </li>
            <li>It may be good for that wavy beachy look but it made my hair a big mess</li>
            <li>It was my new hairstylist who suggested I get a diffuser like she used, and after much investigation, this is the one I chose.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hot enough but not too hot.  </li>
            <li>Also, it seems to run pretty hot overall, even on Lo setting.  </li>
            <li>It does not leave as much of the natural curl as I would like</li>
            <li>Gentle drying action.</li>
            <li>My hair dries just as fast, but it doesn&#x27;t move the hair all around, and the curls just naturally form into ringlets.</li>
            <li>but it was very old, and not working well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still working exactly the same as when I bought it.</li>
            <li>Wow was I ever surprised!  </li>
            <li>Then I did the same with my real diffuser</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just due to the fact that there&#x27;s no nozzle and you&#x27;re holding the core of it right up to your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does dry fast and lots of volume.</li>
            <li>Having limited experience with hair dryers, I can&#x27;t really make any comparisons.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair that curls well using a traditional diffuser attachment on my hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>and I could barely feel the air.  </li>
            <li>I recently cut about six inches off my hair, and the dryer continues to work well with my new short &#x27;do.</li>
            <li>The only way I could see this product being useful is if you have waves and need a very diffuser that hardly moves your hair to keep the curl (similar to the ones in the hair salon..</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that due to the nature of the dryer, it is very easy for hair to get fall in the heating coils and make the burning smell.  </li>
            <li>This really helps keep friz down and keep the curl without having to use tons of product on your hair.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely naturally curly hair and use this to dry my hair every morning.  </li>
            <li>It’s not fabulous, but for a packable, totable dryer, it does a much better than average job on my hair without frying it or blowing it all over the place like the dryers they have in some locker rooms, and I’m really not worried about anything happening to it.</li>

            <li> I really am impressed with this dryer.  I have wavy curly fine hair and this is the prefect way for me to get a great style without any frizz.  I have used anti-frizz products of all kinds and this dryer really makes a difference... I would recommend it</li>
            <li> This is not a diffuser, don&#x27;t be fooled.  It does not diffuse the air blowing from the dryer.  I have naturally curly hair that curls well using a traditional diffuser attachment on my hair dryer.  I was looking for something more portable for travel.  This is not it.  I held it 6\\&quot; from my face to feel the air and it was really blowing.  Then I did the same with my real diffuser and I could barely feel the air.  That is how it should be.  Curly girls want the heat not the blowing.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  It&#x27;s very heavy too.</li>
            <li> I have extremely naturally curly hair and use this to dry my hair every morning.  This really helps keep friz down and keep the curl without having to use tons of product on your hair.  This is my second one as the last one I had just died out after five years of use!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with this product.  The dryer just isn&#x27;t very hot and the \\&quot;HI\\&quot; setting is more like a breeze.  The only way I could see this product being useful is if you have waves and need a very diffuser that hardly moves your hair to keep the curl (similar to the ones in the hair salon.. although this one isn&#x27;t as hot)</li>
            <li> I have short curly hair and this is just perfect to dry it.  Doesn&#x27;t take too long, doesent&#x27; fry my hair with too much heat.  I love it.  I used to have a dryer similar to this but it was very old, and not working well.  After some searching, I found this one and it is a great replacement.</li>
            <li> I have  curly hair and was having a hard time finding one with a really good diffuser.  I just love  this one.</li>
            <li> Works well without totally blowing any wave out of my short hair.  The &amp;#34;fingers&amp;#34; were always hard to put on and keep on, and eventually broke.</li>
            <li> I received this hair dryer for Christmas after I complained about how long it took for my hair to dry naturally and regular blowdryers (even with a diffuser/finger attachment) only made my hair frizz! This one gently drys my curls without adding frizz. I use the finger attachment for volume and added curl definition. The trick is to aim the warm air upwards through your curls, not at your scalp, and to not hols the dryer in one section for too long. This dryer effectively \\&quot;drys\\&quot; my curls in 5-10 minutes (every good curly haired person should know it&#x27;s a cardinal sin to dry your curls all the way through!)    I recently cut about six inches off my hair, and the dryer continues to work well with my new short &#x27;do. My only complaint is that due to the nature of the dryer, it is very easy for hair to get fall in the heating coils and make the burning smell.  However, it is not too bad and does not happen every time you use the dryer. Try this one - you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> My biggest problem is the diffuser on this dryer and there isn&#x27;t another diffuser you can get for it. It left my hair limp and dull looking. I found this dryer to be a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have fine, wavy hair that curls mostly at the ends.  I use a traditional diffuser--you know, the cup attachment you stick on a blow dryer--and it makes my wavy hair curl all the way to the roots.  I needed an additional dryer and thought this model might work since so many reviews were good.  Maybe it works if you have truly curly hair and not fine wavy hair.  For me, just just dried my hair straight.  But it&#x27;s a very good hair dryer.  If you want a normal hair dryer, this is fine.  It&#x27;s hot enough but not too hot.  It&#x27;s lightweight and compact.</li>
            <li> I purachased this due to the price and because the diffuser which came with my dryer broke.  Wow was I ever surprised!  I have wavy, thin hair and this gives me great curls.  I use much less product now to keep the frizz down.  I will never buy another dryer again!  A few reviews I read said that it blew too much air.  You must use it on low and make sure you scrunch as much hair together onto the diffuser to get a great curl.  EXCELLENT EXCELLENT EXCELLENT and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> i have this dryer and loved it!  This one dries my hair beautifully; the attachment allows for the curls to come out without being blown out.  No frizz is created and my hair isn&#x27;t overdried.  the Cool Shot feature is a good idea but i hardly use it. I&#x27;m very happy with this product</li>
            <li> This dryer really dries my hair a lot faster. It does not leave as much of the natural curl as I would like but I am satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> Very happy this dryer type still available from somewhere. Had original \\&quot;Curly-Top\\&quot; from Gillette many years ago. Sadly the Conair update was discontinued--too soon. It is perfect for my hair type. The circular airflow superior even to diffused pistol types. Gentle drying action.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t do it. It seemed like a good idea and I read so many positive reviews...didn&#x27;t work out for me. The less concentrated flow of air is a good thing, but my hair is still frizzy. The attachment with fingers is useless- unless you are looking for more frizz than you get without it. The fingers are too short and too close together to help at all. Try something else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a hair dryer girl.  I&#x27;ve always avoided heat appliances.  But I needed something for those days when I have to run out of the house before my hair can air dry.  I have frizzy curly hair that cannot be styled when it&#x27;s wet or it&#x27;ll frizz out.  This hair dryer does the job.  I&#x27;m not sure how it compares to other hair dryers, since I haven&#x27;t used very many.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lack of a long nozzle makes it easier to maneuver and keeps it lightweight.  The design is great for curly hair because it doesn&#x27;t blow your hair all over the place, which can separate curls and cause frizz.  The cold shot isn&#x27;t very noticeable.  I seem to remember other dryers having a cold shot where you could actually feel the coolness.  With this dryer, cold shot more just reduces the heat, if you see what I mean.  Also, it seems to run pretty hot overall, even on Lo setting.  I asked my sister, who uses a hair dryer all the time, and she said it did seem to be hotter than she was used to, but not a big deal.  Maybe it&#x27;s just due to the fact that there&#x27;s no nozzle and you&#x27;re holding the core of it right up to your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, for the price, this dryer does what it needs to do.  I&#x27;m not disappointed in any way and I would order it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: March 5, 2014 - I still have this hair dryer. It&#x27;s still working exactly the same as when I bought it. I use it about once a week, sometimes twice. I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve had it for SIX years now! Knock on wood.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length naturaly curly hair, and blow dryers have always left me frizzy. It was my new hairstylist who suggested I get a diffuser like she used, and after much investigation, this is the one I chose. I just love it! My hair dries just as fast, but it doesn&#x27;t move the hair all around, and the curls just naturally form into ringlets. I like this one better than something with an attachment that keeps falling off. This feels good in your hand and it has a cooling button to use at the end to set the hair. A great product.</li>
            <li> Having limited experience with hair dryers, I can&#x27;t really make any comparisons.  However, I&#x27;ve found this one to work really well.  I always use it with an attachment on the lower heat setting, which works well for scrunching my curly hair as it drys.</li>
            <li> This is not a diffuser! It blows may hair all over the place. It may be good for that wavy beachy look but it made my hair a big mess and my curls vanished. It does dry fast and lots of volume.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my wavy hair, has plenty of power, great price. Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> i had this blow dryer for like 5 years, it was my favorite blow dryer ever, the heating element finally gave out and i had to replace it, i am not as happy with the blow dryer i just bought, although it is the same brand; its just not as effective.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Using fusion dryer makes my curls look great which I love. Great price and would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have a  Conair Curl Fusion Ionic Pancake Styler which I take to the pool. It’s not fabulous, but for a packable, totable dryer, it does a much better than average job on my hair without frying it or blowing it all over the place like the dryers they have in some locker rooms, and I’m really not worried about anything happening to it. I wouldn&#x27;t try to use the pixiecurl method of drying with it as the holes are too large.</li>
