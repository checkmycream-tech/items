            <li>Have used Paul Mitchell products for many years and this is a great value and leaves my hair healthy.</li>
            <li>Before using this product, my hair didn’t really need help but its “Paul Mitchell”, it’s supposed to be one of the best product.</li>
            <li>So it’s popular.</li>
            <li>, my hair get splits ends and frizzy very easy, this product helps me to control that and reduce the damage from the heat.</li>
            <li>i love paul mitchell product and i am glad i found it on amazon.  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>this was not an authentic product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>Best conditioner for dry hair.</li>
            <li>this shampoo and conditioner makes my hair feel so smooth and healthy.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft, tangle free, shiny, and it smells good.</li>
            <li>Will continue to buy in larger quantity because it is much more cost effective.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the bottle came full, but I can&#x27;t prove it.</li>
            <li>I love Paul Mitchell products and I am sure this will last quite awhile.</li>
            <li>I was so excited use it at first</li>
            <li>I would totally recommend this shampoo and condition for an kind of hair type..</li>
            <li>The local salons carry the brand, but not the moisture kind.</li>
            <li>I love paul mitchell and with my sensitive scalp, it works wonders.</li>
            <li>but this shampoo &amp; conditioner make my hair soft and easy to untangle and gives it a greate shine.</li>
            <li>You can use it everyday and it leaves your hair very shiny and manageable and the price is really great too.  </li>
            <li>although Im pretty sure they use a bunch of accounts with different names to scam a bunch of people.  </li>
            <li>is satisfied, just need to put sticker with color to distinguish them in bathroom when looking on them from above))</li>
            <li>I actually just had four stylist admiring how healthy my hair was.  </li>
            <li>It smells funny and doesn&#x27;t moisturize at all.</li>
            <li>and when I did after a month, my hair felt dry, static, and it was breaking.</li>
            <li>Seems to be the real product, tho.</li>
            <li>I stopped using it and went back to my old shampoo and conditioner and my hair is fine again.</li>
            <li>i have had extremely thick and frizzy hair all my life and this set is amazing...</li>
            <li>We live in a dry climate and when I wash my hair regularly, this shampoo helps to maintain a healthy moisture balance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame this is fulfilled by Amazon too, do yourself a favor and spend the extra money on the real deal at ulta or a salon.</li>
            <li>Especially for older people whose hair has become drier.</li>
            <li>I use these as daily shampoo/conditioner, I live on a very dry hot place</li>
            <li>but the conditioner is so thick you can&#x27;t easily squeeze it from the container.</li>
            <li>I have always loved Paul Mitchell products, they stand behind their products!!</li>
            <li>it makes my hair silky soft and a lot less frizzy than it normally is after a shower.</li>

            <li> Have been using Paul Mitchell products for years and will continue to do so.  From time to time, I try other shampoos but always have Paul Mitchell around and go back to it.  We live in a dry climate and when I wash my hair regularly, this shampoo helps to maintain a healthy moisture balance.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. i love paul mitchell product and i am glad i found it on amazon.  it saves me a trip to the store!</li>
            <li> I have been using these products for over 3 years and it&#x27;s the best, I have frizzie hair that tends to dry but this shampoo &amp; conditioner make my hair soft and easy to untangle and gives it a greate shine.</li>
            <li> I love Paul Mitchell! Great product!!</li>
            <li> ...I have ordered thes products twicw and they work great...I would totally recommend this shampoo and condition for an kind of hair type..</li>
            <li> No matter how thoroughly I rinse off my hair/face/eyes after using this shampoo, it still burns my eyes. The conditioner does perform well. But subjectively this product combo just seems too \\&quot;chemical-y\\&quot; for my liking, so I&#x27;ll try something else when this runs out...or maybe before this runs out...</li>
            <li> Have used Paul Mitchell products for many years and this is a great value and leaves my hair healthy. No allergic reaction or sticky residue. I  have other Paul Mitchell product to purchase but this order will restock my supply for quite some time.  Will continue to buy in larger quantity because it is much more cost effective.</li>
            <li> This is a fake product.. DO NOT BUY FROM TK HEALTH AND BEAUTY although Im pretty sure they use a bunch of accounts with different names to scam a bunch of people.  It is not genuine Paul Mitchell. I have been buying this for years and this is for a fact a bad knock off. Different solution, different bad smell, awful stuff that made my hair dry too. It&#x27;s a shame this is fulfilled by Amazon too, do yourself a favor and spend the extra money on the real deal at ulta or a salon. Fake product, never buying again and is going back!!! So disappointed I got scammed!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I would recommend buying a pump, since the larger bottles are a bit unwieldy.</li>
            <li> excellent high end stuff for good price.&lt;br /&gt;wife is satisfied, just need to put sticker with color to distinguish them in bathroom when looking on them from above))</li>
            <li> This is a great value  As described and shipped. I love Paul Mitchell products and I am sure this will last quite awhile.</li>
            <li> Have used it for years. Best conditioner for dry hair.</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo that does not build up or give me dandruff. The local salons carry the brand, but not the moisture kind. SO HAPPY to have found it!</li>
            <li> I use these as daily shampoo/conditioner, I live on a very dry hot place, my hair get splits ends and frizzy very easy, this product helps me to control that and reduce the damage from the heat.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  Especially for older people whose hair has become drier.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo, I have very thick and long hair and I feel like this shampoo has actually helped moisturize my hair like it said it would.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  You can use it everyday and it leaves your hair very shiny and manageable and the price is really great too.  I bought it at beauty shop and they no longer carry it and it was cheaper at Amazon also so I loved that too. I have always loved Paul Mitchell products, they stand behind their products!!</li>
            <li> Make my hair so hard don&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li> Best to purchase from a Paul Mitchell Salon- this was not an authentic product. Made my hair dry and brittle and smelled like dish soap. It was promptly returned.</li>
            <li> this shampoo and conditioner makes my hair feel so smooth and healthy.  I actually just had four stylist admiring how healthy my hair was.  They were in shock when I told them I color it every month and flat iron it daily.  They said &amp;#34;You must use amazing shampoo and conditioner....&amp;#34;  The only downside is this is hard to find on Amazon Prime.  I don&#x27;t feel like waiting 3-5 days or paying 8.00 shipping when I can make a trip to a local salon and get them.  If they were on Prime, I would defiantly buy here because it saves me a trip!</li>
            <li> i have had extremely thick and frizzy hair all my life and this set is amazing...no more friz. i order this once a month!!! great product!!!</li>
            <li> This arrived perfectly. No leakage from the spout. I love paul mitchell and with my sensitive scalp, it works wonders. Will be buying in the future whenever i need.</li>
            <li> The shampoo I recieved was in a Paul Mitchell bottle but it definetly isn&#x27;t paul mitchell shampoo or conditioner. It smells funny and doesn&#x27;t moisturize at all.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the bottle came full, but I can&#x27;t prove it. Seems to be the real product, tho. Oh well.</li>
            <li> I hate giving this product even one star. The shampoo and conditioner is not real Paul Mitchell. Buyer beware!!!</li>
            <li> This product was given to me for Christmas. I was so excited use it at first and when I did after a month, my hair felt dry, static, and it was breaking. This product promise that it would strengthen and moisturize and it will protect it from the sun and also it’s good for colored treated hair. I did what it tells me do in the direction. The shampoo says to apply small amount, massage, and rinse, then follow with the matching conditioner. Before using this product, my hair didn’t really need help but its “Paul Mitchell”, it’s supposed to be one of the best product. They use this in salons. So it’s popular. It’s expensive. Now that I’ve used it. I think people are just paying for the brand name and not the quality of the product. Money spent is not worth it. It’s a waste of time. I think they need to better their products and keep their promises about what it will do for their hair so everyone can be happy with result. It damaged my hair and made my scalp really dry and itchy. Now it’s going to take a while for me to get the result back as I had before trying this product. I stopped using it and went back to my old shampoo and conditioner and my hair is fine again. Don’t get fooled by expensive products that promises you for better result. This product doesn’t even deserve a star from me. They should have a zero star option. Never again will I use any products from Paul Mitchell. They can keep their product and I’ll keep my money.</li>
            <li> I searched for and bought these as a pairing. I thought I was replicating a Paul Mitchell product I found and used in the Mariott Courtyard Hotels. They were not only not the same but the conditioner is so thick you can&#x27;t easily squeeze it from the container. Out of frustration, I will discard them</li>
            <li> I love this product! it makes my hair silky soft and a lot less frizzy than it normally is after a shower. I put all my trust into Paul Mitchell and bought this and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> Awesome excellent product wonderful shipping</li>
            <li> This Paul Mitchell Moisturizer Duo is the best. It makes my hair soft, tangle free, shiny, and it smells good. Must have!</li>
