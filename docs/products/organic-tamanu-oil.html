            <li>The Tamanu Oil was quite effective in curing the toe nail fungus that I was struggling with for years.</li>
            <li>I originally heard that Tamanu Oil was a great thing to have around for insect bites.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too cheap and amazing not to!</li>

            <li>So far it is working great!</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to Tamanu oil by an oil cleansing method blog and started doing research and found this slice of nature with great reveiws.</li>
            <li>Using this oil all over my face is super!!</li>
            <li>It helps a lot with itching and works a lot better than creams I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It seems to absorb into my skin a bit better and mixes well with the argan oil I also purchased from Slice of Nature.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;d like to know more about the healing properties of this oil, it&#x27;s history and process of extracting the oil</li>
            <li>you&#x27;d like to know more about the healing properties of this oil, it&#x27;s history and process of extracting the oil</li>
            <li>I find it useful for much more good effects.</li>
            <li>The results are great and I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I am able to apply makeup.</li>
            <li>I did some more research and tried jojoba oil and emu oil.</li>
            <li>I have consulted the doctor about it but his medicines never got them better.</li>
            <li>I am very much satisfied with its outcome</li>
            <li>I was able to see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>If you could make sure not to wear socks or shoes, like move to the Bahamas, it might work.  </li>
            <li>and I am glad I bought this.</li>
            <li>I dont know why more people dont know about tamanu oil.</li>
            <li>Surely recommended for its speedy results.</li>
            <li>Tamanu oil has many applications.</li>
            <li>I am just looking forward to know more of its effects in the days to come.</li>
            <li>did some research and found that it has many uses beyond insect</li>
            <li>It helps a lot with itching and works a lot better than creams I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>more before it runs out of stock.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face a bit shiny, but I don&#x27;t mind that any since I can dab off any excess after most of it absorbs.</li>
            <li>For about a year I kept the POD mostly at bay using tea tree oil, but it was always still visible and flared up often.</li>
            <li>My face is so incredible clear and scars are disappearing.</li>
            <li>My skin feels more plump, radiant, even toned, and healthy since using it.</li>
            <li>I love using it</li>
            <li>but the fragrance is overwhelming and the applicator problem is a deterrent.</li>
            <li>Glad we did.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I burnt my arm on the oven top</li>
            <li>This is great stuff, and if your or someone you know has an acne or foot fungus, I highly reccomend this product, it&#x27;s wondrful.</li>
            <li>I will order again from this company because they offer a superior product, have an honest business ethic and seem to sincerely believe in providing a natural product in it&#x27;s purest form.</li>
            <li>I will order again from this company because they offer a superior product, have an honest business ethic and seem to sincerely believe in providing a natural product in it&#x27;s purest form.</li>
            <li>but this stuff is really effective for a full spectrum of skin-related maladies.  </li>
            <li>It works quickly and effectively.</li>
            <li>this is the most important thing to do when healing anything any parts of the body or soul.</li>
            <li>Good luck to all humans that wants to be cure naturally!Google 13 bloodlines and read to find out who is killing the world!They don&#x27;t care</li>
            <li>Not bad at all!</li>
            <li>It is wonderful mixed with argan and rosehip for the rest of my face; just one-two drops of each under my face cream and my skin is protected well from the elements and looks fresh and dewy all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>since I seem to always be getting bitten by something and have strong reactions to bites, I decided to order it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The smell is strong , but it fades after about a hour.</li>
            <li>The quality is amazing and shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>Nice Oil -- VERY FAST SHIPPING &amp; SECURELY PACKAGED.</li>
            <li>That \\&quot;new\\&quot; design works fine.</li>
            <li>The dark spots have improved hugely!!!!</li>
            <li>Love for its price and effective action.</li>
            <li>This is truly a miracle oil, so economical and so much better than any department store goo</li>
            <li>This is truly a miracle oil, so economical and so much better than any department store goo</li>
            <li>If I get a pimple, I can massage a bit of Tamanu oil on and by next day, it has diminished greatly.</li>
            <li>I use it to help decrease the appearance of my stretch marks on my legs and it makes my skin feel really smooth and supple.</li>
            <li>Also, the folks that own the company are very responsive to customer concerns.</li>
            <li>Overall it is great and fast effective oil over psoriasis.</li>
            <li>Omg love this product stops itching right away.</li>
            <li>Then for lotions i will used 100% coconut butter or coconut oil, used what lotion is best for you and try to avoid chemicals soaps and lotions!Stay with drinking lots of water and 100% real fruit juice or veg juice all day long.</li>
            <li>They also sent me a new bottle that had a top with a plastic squeeze top.</li>
            <li>It looks so much better and feels very hydrated when I wake up in the morning!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m quite familiar with its characteristics; this oil seems to be significantly subpar.  </li>
            <li>While slice of nature was not my first choice I am glad  I purchased</li>
            <li>The smell of the oil is strong, but the results are worth it.</li>
            <li>you look on some of the various websites about tamanu oil, it is quite fascinating how the oil is extracted.</li>

            <li>, I love that it soaks in so fast with no oily feeling.</li>
            <li>Great for eczema and other skin conditions.</li>
            <li>the blister was gone the next day), toenail fungus, skin infections - there are so many more things this oil can be used for.</li>
            <li>The pharmacies are the biggest killers in the world that allowed to sell chemical drugs!I know cure for many things, but the doctors will tell you there is no cure for many things, which is a big lie!Edgar Casey cure people</li>
            <li>When I put it on, it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t make my face feel greasy.</li>
            <li>I have a scratch that needs to heal quickly</li>
            <li>Love it so far!!</li>
            <li>and it really gives my skin a smooth and rich feeling</li>
            <li>This Tamanu oil promotes the formation of new tissue and also wound healing and assists the growth of healthy skin.</li>
            <li>and my skin regenerated so fast!!</li>
            <li>This feels great, however the smell is a little &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I figured it was worth a try, since it could be bacterial.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, and the skin feels so soft after you use it.</li>
            <li>It absorbs fairly well than I expected.</li>
            <li>and I hope to see his good hands back very soon.</li>
            <li>The price was definitely worth the quality.</li>
            <li>After many cycles of antibiotics and the side-effects of that, I went completely natural in my beauty routine.</li>
            <li>Blemishes on my sons face started getting better in about 3 days time and are now almost completely gone.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t seem to be making my problem any worse, which is also awesome.</li>
            <li>The dropper really comes in handy when using the oil, no messy spills and you can apply just  the right amount of oil .Like  </li>
            <li>A really awesome thing that doesn&#x60;t change its effectiveness even when mixed with other oils.</li>
            <li>but I stopped using it right away after that.</li>
            <li>well packed and got here in right on time.  </li>
            <li>The scent is strong, but fresh, more like I’m in a green forest, I find it so cool and calming.</li>
            <li>My skin is too oily and sensitive and because of that it gets easily irritated.</li>
            <li>I am very happy and usually don&#x27;t turn to sucj natural remedies for skin marks but HIGHLY</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve also studied more about the many uses of this oil: eczema, psoriasis, blisters (I put some on a small blister that arose on my lip -</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more from them when I get over.</li>
            <li>The scarring is starting to get better, but taking a bit longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For more than a year I had this infection and finally someone told me to try this oil.</li>
            <li>Surely it is recommended for its various uses.</li>
            <li>I was searching for a solution to get rid of my worries, and then my friend suggested me this Tamanu oil.&lt;br /&gt;This turned to be a gift which made my skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li>and I am starting to look better than I have in years.</li>
            <li>For many years the back of my ears has sort of swelling.</li>
            <li>The first thing my husband asked when I used it on his hands was,  &amp;#34;Why</li>
            <li>Not just temporarily better, but actually CURED!!!</li>
            <li>Not my first like this.  </li>
            <li>It is healing, shrinking, and fading fast!  </li>
            <li>Painting each toe nail with the Tamamu Oil on a daily basis led to great improvement after only a week and continues to ameliorate my problem to the point of complete cure.</li>
            <li>I liked the product but wondered why black bits were appearing in the oil.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this Tamanu for its greater reaction towards moisturizing the dry skin.</li>
            <li>So I started doing research on more natural approaches to control my problem and skin care in general, and I found the benefits of tamanu oil.</li>
            <li>Amazon is a good source for a hard to find product.  </li>
            <li>I notice such a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>Slice of Nature&#x27;s oil is Madagascan, and is a lighter, yellowish color with a much milder scent.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve read it supposedly works really well on stretch marks if used for nine months or so).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very thick.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>i really need to stay off Pinterest</li>
            <li>Yet it works very well on my skin.</li>
            <li>I am really optimistic about the outcome of this product.</li>
            <li>It really works</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>However, it really smooths the skin.</li>
            <li>Really offensive order.</li>
            <li>I really like the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought both Madagascan and Tahitian Tamanu Oil and the Tahitian one is much nicer to use.</li>
            <li>Very earthy smell though.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really say if tamanu oil fades old scars, but I LOVE it as a nightly facial oil.</li>
            <li>Not expecting much, I started applying it just under my nose and on my chin where the POD affected me.</li>
            <li>Well it did much to improve my oily skin.</li>
            <li>This brand is also more affordable than other brands I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li>My skin is no longer irritated and it seems to be helping with its overall tone which is kinda cool.</li>
            <li>It is still a little dry after I wash my face before I apply the tamanu oil, but as long as I use it, my face is happy and hydrated!  </li>
            <li>Within a couple days, the itching went down quite a bit, and I was able to sleep through the night.</li>
            <li>I rubbed some on my hand and then applied a wet, warm cloth over it and left it on every day.</li>
            <li>The color is different: too gold ; the consistency is certainly different more like olive oil; there is no sediment AT ALL</li>
            <li>I have high hopes that the condition will gradually disappear altogether using this oil.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Slice of Nature Tamanu Oil.</li>
            <li>We would be purchasing again from them and highly recommend this tamanu.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for the real and natural Tamanu oil, then this is your mate.</li>
            <li>Now I feel to live my dreams.</li>
            <li>Not only is his hair growing back in the balding spots, but his hair is growing super fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve started doing IPL treatments and it seems to cool my face down from the heat, it also healed a burn pretty fast and left no scarring.</li>
            <li>The first purchase was a different brand.</li>
            <li>I looked online at various other websites for more information about this</li>
            <li>This stuff has completely fixed that!</li>
            <li>A small brush would make more sense.</li>
            <li>I would try this brand due to the free shipping vs the cost of shipping on Natural .</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t expecting perfume of course, but it can be a little strong.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t speak to how it helps to fade old stetch marks, but a new burn?  </li>
            <li>next mosquito bite I got, I quickly dabbed on a tiny drop of the Tamanu oil.&lt;br /&gt;The itch immediately subsided and my reaction to the bite was&lt;br /&gt;MUCH</li>
            <li>Finally, I came across a comment in a forum from someone who sounded like they were suffering from the exact same condition, and they highly recommended tamanu oil, specifically Madagascan, because of its antimicrobial attributes.</li>
            <li>It absorbs completely.</li>
            <li>After harvesting, the very light-colored nuts are laid out in the sun and after several weeks they turn brown and begin to ooze the oil, which is then collected from (hopefully) cold-pressed nuts.</li>
            <li>After harvesting, the very light-colored nuts are laid out in the sun and after several weeks they turn brown and begin to ooze the oil, which is then collected from (hopefully) cold-pressed nuts.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for about 3 weeks and it has completely transformed my skin.  </li>
            <li>I use it day and night and within 1 week, all of my problem spots had almost completely healed.</li>
            <li>My skin has never been so soft.</li>
            <li>Then in two night’s application of this oil, it has completely cleared up.</li>
            <li>The eye-dropper is natural rubber</li>
            <li>I have always ordered  Natural Styles tamanu oil, but thougjht</li>
            <li>Will stick with Natural Styles and pay the shipping.. Yvonne</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had acne since I was 14 and went completely natural.</li>
            <li>I like it being natural and it worked well.</li>
            <li>Wanted to try tamanu oil for old acne scars.</li>
            <li>my face is SOFT  and SMOOTH.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>I bought this to help fade old stretch marks.  </li>
            <li>Most recently using a few $60+ moisturizers.</li>
            <li>Msybe its okay for some cosmetic applications but not for serious use for which this oil is renowned.</li>
            <li>Also, the cost at Amazon was much less than at many other sites.  </li>
            <li>I am new to using tamanu oil, and this is the second purchase I&#x27;ve made.</li>
            <li>It works very well on dry skin.</li>
            <li>I am 26 and still struggle with very problematic skin- acne, scarring, extremely dry etc.</li>
            <li>When cooking, I‘ve accidently burnt my hand many times, those burns have damaged only the top layers of the skin, making the area red and painful.</li>
            <li>My skin is starting to clear up</li>
            <li>When i say cure, meaning that, soon when it&#x27;s gone, don&#x27;t go back to your old habits because it will come</li>
            <li>It just gives me natural glow when used regularly.</li>
            <li>I ordered this a few weeks ago and began using it right away.</li>
            <li>It is smelly and sloppy and just discolored my nails more.</li>
            <li>But the oil will not dry, so I will probably won&#x27;t see any improvement.</li>
            <li>My first one is Tahitian and it is very strong smelling, dark green and thick.</li>
            <li>There is no excuse for this sort of packaging!</li>
            <li>The Madagascan one is obviously more rich &amp; concentrated (not sure how that affects the effectiveness of the oil) but the smell and the texture is so overpowering, I find it difficult to use.</li>
            <li>It also has a sour smell and gets unusually sweaty.</li>
            <li>Never used hot water on the body when soaking in the tub!I mostly used cold water when i soak!Then i will shower after with pine tar soap to remove any dry skin.</li>
            <li>The price is right, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>If I am in a rush, I just use a little on the problem spots and rub it in very well and within about 10 min</li>

            <li> So far it is working great!</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to Tamanu oil by an oil cleansing method blog and started doing research and found this slice of nature with great reveiws.</li>
            <li> Using this oil all over my face is super!!</li>
            <li> It helps a lot with itching and works a lot better than creams I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It seems to absorb into my skin a bit better and mixes well with the argan oil I also purchased from Slice of Nature.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;d like to know more about the healing properties of this oil, it&#x27;s history and process of extracting the oil</li>

            <li> The results are great and I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I am able to apply makeup.</li>
            <li> I did some more research and tried jojoba oil and emu oil.</li>
            <li> I have consulted the doctor about it but his medicines never got them better.</li>
            <li> I am very much satisfied with its outcome</li>
            <li> I was able to see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> If you could make sure not to wear socks or shoes, like move to the Bahamas, it might work.  </li>
            <li> and I am glad I bought this.</li>
            <li> I dont know why more people dont know about tamanu oil.</li>
            <li> Surely recommended for its speedy results.</li>
            <li> Tamanu oil has many applications.</li>
            <li> I am just looking forward to know more of its effects in the days to come.</li>
            <li> did some research and found that it has many uses beyond insect</li>
            <li> It helps a lot with itching and works a lot better than creams I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> more before it runs out of stock.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face a bit shiny, but I don&#x27;t mind that any since I can dab off any excess after most of it absorbs.</li>
            <li> For about a year I kept the POD mostly at bay using tea tree oil, but it was always still visible and flared up often.</li>
            <li> My face is so incredible clear and scars are disappearing.</li>
            <li> My skin feels more plump, radiant, even toned, and healthy since using it.</li>
            <li> I love using it</li>
            <li> but the fragrance is overwhelming and the applicator problem is a deterrent.</li>
            <li> Glad we did.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I burnt my arm on the oven top</li>
            <li> This is great stuff, and if your or someone you know has an acne or foot fungus, I highly reccomend this product, it&#x27;s wondrful.</li>

            <li> Not bad at all!</li>
            <li> It is wonderful mixed with argan and rosehip for the rest of my face; just one-two drops of each under my face cream and my skin is protected well from the elements and looks fresh and dewy all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> since I seem to always be getting bitten by something and have strong reactions to bites, I decided to order it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The smell is strong , but it fades after about a hour.</li>
            <li> The quality is amazing and shipping was very fast.</li>

            <li> Omg love this product stops itching right away.</li>

            <li> They also sent me a new bottle that had a top with a plastic squeeze top.</li>
            <li> It looks so much better and feels very hydrated when I wake up in the morning!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m quite familiar with its characteristics; this oil seems to be significantly subpar.  </li>
            <li> While slice of nature was not my first choice I am glad  I purchased</li>
            <li> The smell of the oil is strong, but the results are worth it.</li>
            <li> you look on some of the various websites about tamanu oil, it is quite fascinating how the oil is extracted.</li>

            <li> The pharmacies are the biggest killers in the world that allowed to sell chemical drugs!I know cure for many things, but the doctors will tell you there is no cure for many things, which is a big lie!Edgar Casey cure people</li>

            <li> I have a scratch that needs to heal quickly</li>

            <li> This Tamanu oil promotes the formation of new tissue and also wound healing and assists the growth of healthy skin.</li>
            <li> and my skin regenerated so fast!!</li>
            <li> This feels great, however the smell is a little &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I figured it was worth a try, since it could be bacterial.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, and the skin feels so soft after you use it.</li>
            <li> It absorbs fairly well than I expected.</li>
            <li> and I hope to see his good hands back very soon.</li>
            <li> The price was definitely worth the quality.</li>
            <li> After many cycles of antibiotics and the side-effects of that, I went completely natural in my beauty routine.</li>
            <li> Blemishes on my sons face started getting better in about 3 days time and are now almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t seem to be making my problem any worse, which is also awesome.</li>
            <li> The dropper really comes in handy when using the oil, no messy spills and you can apply just  the right amount of oil .Like  </li>
            <li> A really awesome thing that doesn&#x60;t change its effectiveness even when mixed with other oils.</li>
            <li> but I stopped using it right away after that.</li>
            <li> well packed and got here in right on time.  </li>
            <li> The scent is strong, but fresh, more like I’m in a green forest, I find it so cool and calming.</li>
            <li> My skin is too oily and sensitive and because of that it gets easily irritated.</li>
            <li> I am very happy and usually don&#x27;t turn to sucj natural remedies for skin marks but HIGHLY</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve also studied more about the many uses of this oil: eczema, psoriasis, blisters (I put some on a small blister that arose on my lip -</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more from them when I get over.</li>
            <li> The scarring is starting to get better, but taking a bit longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For more than a year I had this infection and finally someone told me to try this oil.</li>
            <li> Surely it is recommended for its various uses.</li>
            <li> I was searching for a solution to get rid of my worries, and then my friend suggested me this Tamanu oil.&lt;br /&gt;This turned to be a gift which made my skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li> and I am starting to look better than I have in years.</li>
            <li> For many years the back of my ears has sort of swelling.</li>
            <li> The first thing my husband asked when I used it on his hands was,  &amp;#34;Why</li>
            <li> Not just temporarily better, but actually CURED!!!</li>
            <li> Not my first like this.  </li>
            <li> It is healing, shrinking, and fading fast!  </li>
            <li> Painting each toe nail with the Tamamu Oil on a daily basis led to great improvement after only a week and continues to ameliorate my problem to the point of complete cure.</li>
            <li> I liked the product but wondered why black bits were appearing in the oil.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this Tamanu for its greater reaction towards moisturizing the dry skin.</li>
            <li> So I started doing research on more natural approaches to control my problem and skin care in general, and I found the benefits of tamanu oil.</li>
            <li> Amazon is a good source for a hard to find product.  </li>
            <li> I notice such a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Slice of Nature&#x27;s oil is Madagascan, and is a lighter, yellowish color with a much milder scent.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve read it supposedly works really well on stretch marks if used for nine months or so).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> i really need to stay off Pinterest</li>
            <li> Yet it works very well on my skin.</li>
            <li> I am really optimistic about the outcome of this product.</li>
            <li> It really works</li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> However, it really smooths the skin.</li>
            <li> Really offensive order.</li>
            <li> I really like the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought both Madagascan and Tahitian Tamanu Oil and the Tahitian one is much nicer to use.</li>
            <li> Very earthy smell though.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really say if tamanu oil fades old scars, but I LOVE it as a nightly facial oil.</li>
            <li> Not expecting much, I started applying it just under my nose and on my chin where the POD affected me.</li>
            <li> Well it did much to improve my oily skin.</li>
            <li> This brand is also more affordable than other brands I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> My skin is no longer irritated and it seems to be helping with its overall tone which is kinda cool.</li>
            <li> It is still a little dry after I wash my face before I apply the tamanu oil, but as long as I use it, my face is happy and hydrated!  </li>
            <li> Within a couple days, the itching went down quite a bit, and I was able to sleep through the night.</li>
            <li> I rubbed some on my hand and then applied a wet, warm cloth over it and left it on every day.</li>
            <li> The color is different: too gold ; the consistency is certainly different more like olive oil; there is no sediment AT ALL</li>
            <li> I have high hopes that the condition will gradually disappear altogether using this oil.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Slice of Nature Tamanu Oil.</li>
            <li> We would be purchasing again from them and highly recommend this tamanu.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for the real and natural Tamanu oil, then this is your mate.</li>
            <li> Now I feel to live my dreams.</li>
            <li> Not only is his hair growing back in the balding spots, but his hair is growing super fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started doing IPL treatments and it seems to cool my face down from the heat, it also healed a burn pretty fast and left no scarring.</li>
            <li> The first purchase was a different brand.</li>
            <li> I looked online at various other websites for more information about this</li>
            <li> This stuff has completely fixed that!</li>
            <li> A small brush would make more sense.</li>
            <li> I would try this brand due to the free shipping vs the cost of shipping on Natural .</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t expecting perfume of course, but it can be a little strong.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t speak to how it helps to fade old stetch marks, but a new burn?  </li>
            <li> next mosquito bite I got, I quickly dabbed on a tiny drop of the Tamanu oil.&lt;br /&gt;The itch immediately subsided and my reaction to the bite was&lt;br /&gt;MUCH</li>
            <li> Finally, I came across a comment in a forum from someone who sounded like they were suffering from the exact same condition, and they highly recommended tamanu oil, specifically Madagascan, because of its antimicrobial attributes.</li>
            <li> It absorbs completely.</li>
            <li> After harvesting, the very light-colored nuts are laid out in the sun and after several weeks they turn brown and begin to ooze the oil, which is then collected from (hopefully) cold-pressed nuts.</li>

            <li> I use it day and night and within 1 week, all of my problem spots had almost completely healed.</li>
            <li> My skin has never been so soft.</li>
            <li> Then in two night’s application of this oil, it has completely cleared up.</li>
            <li> The eye-dropper is natural rubber</li>
            <li> I have always ordered  Natural Styles tamanu oil, but thougjht</li>

            <li> I bought this to help fade old stretch marks.  </li>
            <li> Most recently using a few $60+ moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Msybe its okay for some cosmetic applications but not for serious use for which this oil is renowned.</li>
            <li> Also, the cost at Amazon was much less than at many other sites.  </li>
            <li> I am new to using tamanu oil, and this is the second purchase I&#x27;ve made.</li>
            <li> It works very well on dry skin.</li>
            <li> I am 26 and still struggle with very problematic skin- acne, scarring, extremely dry etc.</li>
            <li> When cooking, I‘ve accidently burnt my hand many times, those burns have damaged only the top layers of the skin, making the area red and painful.</li>
            <li> My skin is starting to clear up</li>
            <li> When i say cure, meaning that, soon when it&#x27;s gone, don&#x27;t go back to your old habits because it will come</li>
            <li> It just gives me natural glow when used regularly.</li>
            <li> I ordered this a few weeks ago and began using it right away.</li>
            <li> It is smelly and sloppy and just discolored my nails more.</li>
            <li> But the oil will not dry, so I will probably won&#x27;t see any improvement.</li>
            <li> My first one is Tahitian and it is very strong smelling, dark green and thick.</li>
            <li> There is no excuse for this sort of packaging!</li>
            <li> The Madagascan one is obviously more rich &amp; concentrated (not sure how that affects the effectiveness of the oil) but the smell and the texture is so overpowering, I find it difficult to use.</li>
            <li> It also has a sour smell and gets unusually sweaty.</li>
            <li> Never used hot water on the body when soaking in the tub!I mostly used cold water when i soak!Then i will shower after with pine tar soap to remove any dry skin.</li>
            <li> The price is right, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> If I am in a rush, I just use a little on the problem spots and rub it in very well and within about 10 min</li>
            <li> It has a strange nutty smell, and is thick and will stain your clothes, but it is worth it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing and it helped heal my dry patches from this harsh winter.</li>
            <li> However, it does go on pretty thick.</li>
            <li> I have always had extremely dry skin everywhere, my face especially.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m wondering how long before the oil turns it to goo but one could put a regular cap on it as one drop goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Fine at night but in the morning can be a bit difficult.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing with a condition in my groin area (taint to be specific) and anus for over two years where it gets extremely itchy, especially at night.</li>
            <li> Okay, so in all honesty, this stuff stinks.</li>
            <li> Not sure if that&#x27;s normal and goes away with continued use,</li>
            <li> I only use this oil in the evening because I am not really fond of the scent.</li>
            <li> I use for minor cuts and wounds on my dogs</li>
            <li> a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> My other oil makes a BIG difference on this spot!</li>
            <li> Researched a lot of different brands on amazon  and other websites.</li>
            <li> I douse my skin in whatever I can and it is still dry and flakey.</li>
            <li> It does not help my skin allergy problem and even made the skin dry and peeling.</li>
            <li> so I keep it use for my dry itching scalp.</li>
            <li> It got rid of my dry skin and also helped vanishing my scars.</li>
            <li> It would heal and a few days later come back.</li>
            <li> I think they may have replaced the old rubber bulb dispenser with this newer plastic design, but I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> Now after two weeks of using it, the itching is even less, the smell and sweatiness are gone, and the area appears to be starting to heal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry, but it smells like burnt/smoky wood, but if you can get past the smell, you have magic in your hands.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a solution as I was suffering with very dry skin around my elbows, knees, and feet and nothing that I seemed to use</li>
            <li> This may be a little graphic, so be warned.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis which means I have dry, extremely itchy skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been to dermatologists, used prescription ointments and over the counter products with not much luck, it just keeps recurring.</li>
            <li> I mix it with coconut oil and cocoa butter for a foot cream which keeps odor at bay and smooths rough heels.</li>
            <li> I mix it with coconut oil and cocoa butter for a foot cream which keeps odor at bay and smooths rough heels.</li>
            <li> Aloe Vera juice i drink 2oz a day on empty stomach then lots of water.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to harsh acne treatments.</li>
            <li> I was not much on alternative medications before</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it is unprocessed.</li>
            <li> I had minimal burns during treatment.  </li>
            <li> So I started using this oil for cleansing my face mixed with raw honey.</li>
            <li> My 14 year old son had a pretty bad cas of acne.</li>

            <li> I just received it in the mail today and there is in-depth information about tamanu, called foraha in Madagascar, as well as other native oils of the region.</li>
            <li> for some of the other reviews...</li>
            <li> I do not know the reason but guess it must have been due to my skin’s sensitivity towards the metal which I wore.  </li>
            <li> It does not leave my skin sticky like other oils do.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it to find out its other applications and results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product from other sellers on Amazon</li>
            <li> are you putting olive oil on me instead of yhe Tamanu  oil?&amp;#34;  I can tell it has tamanu in it due to the nutty aroma.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this on my various outbreaks every day since I got this 100% pure cold pressed tamanu oil</li>
            <li> Color is a lighter yellow green, from Madagascar, and the AC is a dark green from Vietnam.</li>
            <li> Smell of the Slice of Nature is very sharp and pungent; my nose doesn&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
            <li> That process has contaminated the oil with slimy black spots, and is disintegrating the dropper itself.</li>
            <li> less....</li>
            <li> I then realized yesterday that the black rubber dropper was melting into the oil.</li>
            <li> The applicator fell a part in the bottle and some black stuff appeared on and in the bottle.  </li>
            <li> There is a little bit of an adjustment period while your skin learns to produce less oil</li>
            <li> So I bought this to help with my acne and some acne scars, but it caused my face to burn and itch a little bit.</li>
            <li> I put a little on my hands at night before sleep.</li>
            <li> It can get a little messy and as the seller stated, the smell is something I had to get use to.</li>
            <li> They had been taking about 2 weeks to heal and now they are gone in a few days.</li>
            <li> I applied the tamanu oil and then patted on some sugar and exfoliated for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> , I persevered and slathered the green stinky oil all over my face.</li>
            <li> The swelling reduced gradually and disappeared within a few weeks and my skin stays hydrated too.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s raw form</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s raw form</li>
            <li> I like this brand of tamanu oil because it is truly raw and unfiltered</li>
            <li> I do not understand how you call this raw and unrefined.</li>
            <li> this product.&lt;br /&gt;The product is thick and has a earthy slight smoky aroma.</li>
            <li> I said the oil is thick so a little goes</li>
            <li> There is no better undereye treatment for me - it&#x27;s all I use at night.</li>
            <li> Each seems to be equal in quality , swampy color and weird odor.</li>
            <li> I use it on any abrasions, on my face, on a small area on my wrist which I suspect is cancer.  </li>
            <li> I can no longer use the applicator and not sure I will buy again.  </li>
            <li> While I saw there for a hour or so, sniffing the oil every so often to get acclimated to the smell (which I eventually did) and that the smell dissipates after a few minutes, I found that cutting it with another oil helps minimize the smell, so I mix two drops of this with two drops of maracuja oil and apply it to my face twice a day after my regular moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed since I never got to see these &amp;#34;miraculous&amp;#34; results everyone has been claiming to have so far.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for people who have skin conditions that are hard to treat.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s thick</li>
            <li> Since ive been using this I have to say I am slowly seeing an improvement.</li>
            <li> The oil is thick.</li>
            <li> It is working on him, bringing slow changes</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a bit thick, but nothing unworkable.</li>
            <li> Not the least bit irritating, it moisturizes, soothes and tones my skin without greasiness.</li>
            <li> I am shocked with the improvement that I am starting to see happen</li>
            <li> just some small thin lines, no raised seams!</li>
            <li> I was terribly affected by Eczema and was seriously looking out for a fast solution and my friend happened to refer me Tamanu oil.</li>
            <li> This oil can also help heal and soothe irritations and sores caused by shingles and are hailed as a “secret weapon” by shingles sufferers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually weird to me that people have complained about it.</li>
            <li> Worked wonder on my daughters face as it reduced redness and inflammation and decreased the size of her pimples within a week.</li>
            <li> After using this oil with the argan oil, the scars are virtually impossible to detect; just some small thin lines, no raised seams!</li>
            <li> and my scar was terrible as the injury was kinda way too big!</li>
            <li> It stinks</li>
            <li> DUDE, I will LET YOU KNOW if I&#x27;m unhappy.</li>
            <li> Too soon to see results but unhappy with packaging.  </li>
            <li> Slice of Nature stinks so bad</li>
            <li> It stinks, bad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nearly impossible not to scratch when it flares up, and when I do, it bleeds and gets sore.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to get rid of bad acne and times of distress.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so bad that it wakes me up almost every night.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helped a lot with my psoriasis, and I heard about it from a friend that uses it for her bad acne.</li>
            <li> This stuff stinks!</li>
            <li> I like to use it as a base for my hand creme and on my lips and under my eyes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very unpleasant and quite embarassing.</li>
            <li> My son has very bad hands affected from Eczema</li>
            <li> Plum island is the biggest disease laboratory in the world!People please wake up and cure yourself from this evil</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I started using Tamanu oil about a month ago, every night. It absorbs completely. I use about a pea sized drop. My acne is moderate, and I&#x27;ve had it since I was thirteen. I&#x27;ve been to dermatologists, used prescription ointments and over the counter products with not much luck, it just keeps recurring. Although this oil doesn&#x27;t claim to cure it, it is definitely controlling it! My skin is no longer irritated and it also seems to be helping with its overall tone. It looks so much better and feels very hydrated when I wake up in the morning! This brand is also more affordable than other brands I&#x27;ve seen. The price is right, and a little goes a long way. The scent is strong, but fresh, more like I’m in a green forest, I find it so cool and calming. Would I recommend it? Yes, if you happen to have a similar problem to mine, go ahead, try it! You have nothing to lose.</li>
            <li> Nice Oil -- VERY FAST SHIPPING &amp; SECURELY PACKAGED. Good Purchase!</li>
            <li> This is a great product against psoriasis. It helps a lot with itching and works a lot better than creams I&#x27;ve tried. I recommend this to get rid of bad acne and times of distress.</li>
            <li> I am new to using tamanu oil, and this is the second purchase I&#x27;ve made. The first purchase was a different brand. After doing some research, I discovered there are two different types of tamanu oil - one from Tahiti and one from Madagascar. My first one is Tahitian and it is very strong smelling, dark green and thick. Slice of Nature&#x27;s oil is Madagascan, and is a lighter, yellowish color with a much milder scent. On their site, they make the statement that Madagascan oil is preferable to Tahitian but there is no information as to why this is so. I looked online at various other websites for more information about this but none was forthcoming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, I do prefer this one to the Tahitian one! It seems to absorb into my skin a bit better and mixes well with the argan oil I also purchased from Slice of Nature. I like to use it as a base for my hand creme and on my lips and under my eyes. There is no better undereye treatment for me - it&#x27;s all I use at night. Not the least bit irritating, it moisturizes, soothes and tones my skin without greasiness. I literally use just one drop rubbed between my fingertips and pat under my eyes and on my lips. My regular lip balm goes over it and I wake up to moist, youthful lips. It is wonderful mixed with argan and rosehip for the rest of my face; just one-two drops of each under my face cream and my skin is protected well from the elements and looks fresh and dewy all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also studied more about the many uses of this oil: eczema, psoriasis, blisters (I put some on a small blister that arose on my lip - the blister was gone the next day), toenail fungus, skin infections - there are so many more things this oil can be used for. Years ago I was bitten in the face by a German Shepherd (my fault - I got in the middle of a dogfight and tried to break it up). My nose and lip were split open and when the wounds healed of course I had scars. After using this oil with the argan oil, the scars are virtually impossible to detect; just some small thin lines, no raised seams! I mix it with coconut oil and cocoa butter for a foot cream which keeps odor at bay and smooths rough heels. This is truly a miracle oil, so economical and so much better than any department store goo I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you look on some of the various websites about tamanu oil, it is quite fascinating how the oil is extracted. The nut in it&#x27;s raw form seemingly has no oil. After harvesting, the very light-colored nuts are laid out in the sun and after several weeks they turn brown and begin to ooze the oil, which is then collected from (hopefully) cold-pressed nuts. Slice of Nature&#x27;s tamanu oil is cold-pressed. I will order again from this company because they offer a superior product, have an honest business ethic and seem to sincerely believe in providing a natural product in it&#x27;s purest form. I&#x27;m very impressed all around!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;d like to know more about the healing properties of this oil, it&#x27;s history and process of extracting the oil, I recommend \\&quot;The Healing Trail: Essential Oils of Madagascar\\&quot; by Georges M.

            <li> I use this in my soap and lotion crafting.  It works beautifully.</li>
            <li> I ordered this a few weeks ago and began using it right away. It works very well on dry skin. I will definitely buy more from them when I get over.</li>
            <li> Tamanu oil can help relieve pain caused by shingles flare-ups. This oil can also help heal and soothe irritations and sores caused by shingles and are hailed as a “secret weapon” by shingles sufferers. I find it useful for much more good effects.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed! There is a little bit of an adjustment period while your skin learns to produce less oil but now my skin is so improved!  I have started using it on my face,neck and hands, to address summer dryness. The results are great and I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I am 26 and still struggle with very problematic skin- acne, scarring, extremely dry etc. I&#x27;ve tried everything. Most recently using a few $60+ moisturizers. I was looking into using Vitamin E oil when I came across tamanu oil. It is beyond amazing!!!! I have been using it for about 3 weeks and it has completely transformed my skin.  I use it day and night and within 1 week, all of my problem spots had almost completely healed. They had been taking about 2 weeks to heal and now they are gone in a few days. The dark spots have improved hugely!!!! The scarring is starting to get better, but taking a bit longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than acne, my second biggest issue is the dryness. I have always had extremely dry skin everywhere, my face especially. I douse my skin in whatever I can and it is still dry and flakey. This stuff has completely fixed that! It is still a little dry after I wash my face before I apply the tamanu oil, but as long as I use it, my face is happy and hydrated!  Tonight, I made a sugar scrub. I applied the tamanu oil and then patted on some sugar and exfoliated for a few minutes. After rinsing, I can feel the oil is still left on my skin.  My skin has never been so soft. I am so thankful I found this stuff!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for some of the other reviews... It smells a bit nutty. Not bad at all! It&#x27;s actually weird to me that people have complained about it. Maybe it was a different brand? However, it does go on pretty thick. Fine at night but in the morning can be a bit difficult. If I am in a rush, I just use a little on the problem spots and rub it in very well and within about 10 min I am able to apply makeup. I use generously in the evenings. Try this stuff!!!! It&#x27;s too cheap and amazing not to!</li>
            <li> So I bought this to help with my acne and some acne scars, but it caused my face to burn and itch a little bit. I&#x27;m not allergic to nuts or anything at all. Not sure if that&#x27;s normal and goes away with continued use, but I stopped using it right away after that. I&#x27;m a little disappointed since I never got to see these &amp;#34;miraculous&amp;#34; results everyone has been claiming to have so far. Any thoughts on this?</li>
            <li> I only use this oil in the evening because I am not really fond of the scent. Although, I got used to the smell after a couple of applications and it does not bother me. It is not an offensive smell either.</li>
            <li> I have ordered Tamanu oil 3 times now from 3 different sellers. Each seems to be equal in quality , swampy color and weird odor. It stinks but it works. Acne, warts, cuts, rashes.&lt;br /&gt;This seller has repeatedly emailed me and even CALLED me asking for feedback. DUDE, I will LET YOU KNOW if I&#x27;m unhappy. Ever heard of &amp;#34;no news is good news&amp;#34;??</li>
            <li> Tamanu oil DO NOT work for psoriasis or eczema!This product make the skin to become flame! Psoriasis is not a skin condition disease that you can heal with creams or ointments!Psoriasis is a immune disease that can be control and be cure! When i say cure, meaning that, soon when it&#x27;s gone, don&#x27;t go back to your old habits because it will come back!This is what i used! Aloe Vera juice i drink 2oz a day on empty stomach then lots of water. Then i will jog for 30 minutes to 45 minutes in the morning sunlight. The morning sunlight is the best thing for all skin diseases.Then after jogging i will soak in the tub with dead-sea-salt and tea oil and jojoba oil and apple cider vinegar.Never used hot water on the body when soaking in the tub!I mostly used cold water when i soak!Then i will shower after with pine tar soap to remove any dry skin.Then for lotions i will used 100% coconut butter or coconut oil, used what lotion is best for you and try to avoid chemicals soaps and lotions!Stay with drinking lots of water and 100% real fruit juice or veg juice all day long.That will make your skin heal faster because of the vitamins!Intake lots of vitamins C,D,K,B and A.Now this is the most important thing to do when healing anything any parts of the body or soul.Now do Root chakra yoga to eliminate toxins from the body 4 to 5 times a week!Yoga is proven to heal mostly anything when doing it right!Believe me, there is an cure for everything except Evil!The Doctors don&#x27;t want you to heal yourself at home,because they don&#x27;t make any money from it! The pharmacies are the biggest killers in the world that allowed to sell chemical drugs!I know cure for many things, but the doctors will tell you there is no cure for many things, which is a big lie!Edgar Casey cure people and so did Richard Simpson,with cannabis! Cannabis cure 95% of everything man can think of and Richard had proven that! Good luck to all humans that wants to be cure naturally!Google 13 bloodlines and read to find out who is killing the world!They don&#x27;t care,you are a slave to used for working and experiments! Plum island is the biggest disease laboratory in the world!People please wake up and cure yourself from this evil matrix!Good luck my friendly humans of all kind!</li>
            <li> This may be a little graphic, so be warned. I&#x27;ve been dealing with a condition in my groin area (taint to be specific) and anus for over two years where it gets extremely itchy, especially at night. It&#x27;s so bad that it wakes me up almost every night. It&#x27;s nearly impossible not to scratch when it flares up, and when I do, it bleeds and gets sore. It also has a sour smell and gets unusually sweaty. It&#x27;s very unpleasant and quite embarassing. My doctor looked at it and just said I should put hydrocortisone on it. All that did was soothe some of the itching but didn&#x27;t treat the problem. I tried anti-fungal medications, thinking it might be jock itch or a male yeast infection,  but they didn&#x27;t seem to improve anything. I did some more research and tried jojoba oil and emu oil. They didn&#x27;t seem to have an effect either except for brief soothing. Finally, I came across a comment in a forum from someone who sounded like they were suffering from the exact same condition, and they highly recommended tamanu oil, specifically Madagascan, because of its antimicrobial attributes. I figured it was worth a try, since it could be bacterial. I ordered it and started applying it in the morning and at night. Within a couple days, the itching went down quite a bit, and I was able to sleep through the night. It still had occasional itchiness, but the bleeding stopped and didn&#x27;t get so sore. Now after two weeks of using it, the itching is even less, the smell and sweatiness are gone, and the area appears to be starting to heal. I&#x27;m not declaring victory just yet, but this oil has done what everything else could not. The smell of the oil is strong, but the results are worth it. I have high hopes that the condition will gradually disappear altogether using this oil.</li>
            <li> It does not help my skin allergy problem and even made the skin dry and peeling. Itching is still so I keep it use for my dry itching scalp. Hope it works.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with the results of tamanu oil on my skin. I was terribly affected by Eczema and was seriously looking out for a fast solution and my friend happened to refer me Tamanu oil. I just ordered one from this good brand and I was very happy. Now I feel to live my dreams.</li>
            <li> I had an abrasion on the bridge of my nose from my glasses and I feared a lot to use glasses then after. It spoiled my looks and I was teased because of that. Then in two night’s application of this oil, it has completely cleared up. Now I don’t fear about using my glasses!</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to Tamanu oil by an oil cleansing method blog and started doing research and found this slice of nature with great reveiws. This product satisfies at an excellent price. I have found it to be very healing and an excellent anti inflammatory. If I get a pimple, I can massage a bit of Tamanu oil on and by next day, it has diminished greatly. I will never go back to harsh acne treatments. I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I get some skin infection in my hands when it is time for winter. I have consulted the doctor about it but his medicines never got them better. For more than a year I had this infection and finally someone told me to try this oil. I rubbed some on my hand and then applied a wet, warm cloth over it and left it on every day. After a week, my infection was gone. I would recommend this for people who have skin conditions that are hard to treat.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for the real and natural Tamanu oil, then this is your mate. Love for its price and effective action.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for the best anti- bacterial oil, then this tamanu is the best to work on it, especially on Acne&#x27;s. I am very much satisfied with its outcome</li>
            <li> This feels great, however the smell is a little &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;. Wasn&#x27;t expecting perfume of course, but it can be a little strong.</li>
            <li> This stuff is excellent.  I was not much on alternative medications before but this stuff is really effective for a full spectrum of skin-related maladies.  The eye-dropper is natural rubber so I&#x27;m wondering how long before the oil turns it to goo but one could put a regular cap on it as one drop goes a long way.  Shipped well packed and got here in right on time.  I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a solution as I was suffering with very dry skin around my elbows, knees, and feet and nothing that I seemed to use would help me until I found this Tamunu. It works quickly and effectively. It got rid of my dry skin and also helped vanishing my scars. Surely it is recommended for its various uses.</li>
            <li> I have sun damage from living in miami all my life. I was searching for a solution to get rid of my worries, and then my friend suggested me this Tamanu oil.&lt;br /&gt;This turned to be a gift which made my skin so soft and smooth. When I put it on, it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t make my face feel greasy. I was able to see a difference in my skin. I just Love it!</li>
            <li> It holds the best healing qualities! I had this skin allergy on my ankle wearing anklets. I do not know the reason but guess it must have been due to my skin’s sensitivity towards the metal which I wore.  This oil actually healed the problem! So far it is working great!</li>
            <li> This is a great quality oil. I can&#x27;t speak for whether it works or not, I don&#x27;t have patience to use it all the time (I&#x27;ve read it supposedly works really well on stretch marks if used for nine months or so). But the smell (nutty) is so wonderful! Even after I&#x27;ve washed my clothes, it stays on them. I love the smell, and the skin feels so soft after you use it. It&#x27;s very thick.&lt;br /&gt;I keep it in case I have a scratch that needs to heal quickly, it supposedly helps with that (I can see why, it&#x27;s thick so it creates nice protection once applied on your skin).</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even begin telling you how happy this makes my husband. Not only is his hair growing back in the balding spots, but his hair is growing super fast. For anyone wandering around to restore their hair growth or their husband&#x27;s, please get this oil without hesitating! The quality is really exceptional!</li>
            <li> This stuff stinks! It smells like a pile of burning tires in the middle of a sewage treatment plant. The desire for beautiful glowing skin, I persevered and slathered the green stinky oil all over my face. As I stood there with a warm towel over my face steaming the goo into my skin I had one thought.....i really need to stay off Pinterest it&#x27;s turning me into a fruitcake.</li>
            <li> This product did nothing to help my toenail fungus. It is smelly and sloppy and just discolored my nails more.</li>
            <li> This oil is supposed to help solve the problem of fungus under the toe nails.  If you could make sure not to wear socks or shoes, like move to the Bahamas, it might work.  But the oil will not dry, so I will probably won&#x27;t see any improvement. In Addition, It has an eye dropper in the bottle with which to apply the liquid. A small brush would make more sense.</li>
            <li> The Tamanu Oil was quite effective in curing the toe nail fungus that I was struggling with for years. Painting each toe nail with the Tamamu Oil on a daily basis led to great improvement after only a week and continues to ameliorate my problem to the point of complete cure.</li>
            <li> My skin seems to like this oil. I&#x27;ve started doing IPL treatments and it seems to cool my face down from the heat, it also healed a burn pretty fast and left no scarring.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I have been looking for. I like the fact that it is unprocessed. It can get a little messy and as the seller stated, the smell is something I had to get use to. Yet it works very well on my skin. Since ive been using this I have to say I am slowly seeing an improvement. My skin is starting to clear up and I am starting to look better than I have in years. I am really optimistic about the outcome of this product. I never knew how good Tamanu Oil was for the skin. I am shocked with the improvement that I am starting to see happen and I am glad I bought this. It really works</li>
            <li> I dont know why more people dont know about tamanu oil. I will never go without this again. Truly miraculous for skin.</li>
            <li> For many years the back of my ears has sort of swelling. It would heal and a few days later come back. This oil has taken care of the problem. It works really well. I put a little on my hands at night before sleep. The swelling reduced gradually and disappeared within a few weeks and my skin stays hydrated too. Much satisfied with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I use it to help decrease the appearance of my stretch marks on my legs and it makes my skin feel really smooth and supple. I dilute it in some fractionated coconut oil and rub it all over after I shower. It absorbs fairly well than I expected. It does not leave my skin sticky like other oils do.</li>
            <li> I used this oil during my radiation treatments.  It has a strange nutty smell, and is thick and will stain your clothes, but it is worth it.  I had minimal burns during treatment.  I would put this on my skin at night and by morning, my skin looked great.  If it weren&#x27;t for the smell, I would use this as a facial oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about a month for scarring in various areas. So great! I notice such a huge difference in my skin. This tamanu oil works and I plan on making it a staple product forever. Surely recommended for its speedy results.</li>
            <li> Omg love this product stops itching right away. Order back up for when I run out.</li>
            <li> I like this brand of tamanu oil because it is truly raw and unfiltered so you get all the benefits.</li>
            <li> Boy, does this stuff stink! However, it really smooths the skin. Very different from the Aura Cacia Tamanu I bought before. Color is a lighter yellow green, from Madagascar, and the AC is a dark green from Vietnam. Smell of the Slice of Nature is very sharp and pungent; my nose doesn&#x27;t like it at all. But, if it works to put some elasticity back into my skin, well then, my nose will have to suffer. I&#x27;ll use this bottle up until it&#x27;s gone to see if I can get a good improvement on my skin as it tears like paper. Good Luck to Me!</li>
            <li> Tamanu oil has many applications. It just gives me natural glow when used regularly. I will continue to use it to find out its other applications and results.</li>
            <li> I found it is great for healing skin ailments from acne, eczema, psoriasis and more. This Tamanu oil promotes the formation of new tissue and also wound healing and assists the growth of healthy skin. I am just looking forward to know more of its effects in the days to come.</li>
            <li> I have always ordered  Natural Styles tamanu oil, but thougjht I would try this brand due to the free shipping vs the cost of shipping on Natural . Big Mistake!!!! Slice of Nature stinks so bad I can&#x27;t stand to put it on. Really offensive order. Will stick with Natural Styles and pay the shipping.. Yvonne</li>
            <li> The tamanu oil is dissolving the rubber eyedropper. That process has contaminated the oil with slimy black spots, and is disintegrating the dropper itself. The bottle was always stored upright. You&#x27;ll find another brand that has the same problem. There is no excuse for this sort of packaging! DON&#x27;T BUY THIS BRAND!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;The owner of Slice of Nature contacted me about the issue of the dissolving rubber eye-dropper. They also sent me a new bottle that had a top with a plastic squeeze top. That \\&quot;new\\&quot; design works fine. I think they may have replaced the old rubber bulb dispenser with this newer plastic design, but I&#x27;m not sure. I have found two listings on Amazon: one with a picture of the bottle with a rubber eye dropper, and another with the plastic one. You should order the plastic topped one (search for B008PFIT7I). If you get a rubber one, I would return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the odor some people have mentioned, I find it to be a very pleasant smell. It reminds me somewhat of hickory smoke. The oil is thick. I really like the product. Again, the only issue I had was with the rubber bulb. Also, the folks that own the company are very responsive to customer concerns.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product from other sellers on Amazon so I&#x27;m quite familiar with its characteristics; this oil seems to be significantly subpar.  The color is different: too gold ; the consistency is certainly different more like olive oil; there is no sediment AT ALL (I must admit I was concerned about that because it is in a squirt bottle) and that&#x27;s what contains the richest part of the oil.  I use it on any abrasions, on my face, on a small area on my wrist which I suspect is cancer.  My other oil makes a BIG difference on this spot! This oil does nothing to improve it.  I do not understand how you call this raw and unrefined. The first thing my husband asked when I used it on his hands was,  &amp;#34;Why are you putting olive oil on me instead of yhe Tamanu  oil?&amp;#34;  I can tell it has tamanu in it due to the nutty aroma.  Msybe its okay for some cosmetic applications but not for serious use for which this oil is renowned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne since I was 14 and went completely natural. Since then, I no longer have acne. But I do get hormonal break outs. TAMANU OIL! It has Amazing antibacterial properties, that reduces the appearance of acne scars, hyper pigmentation etc. I highly recommend Slice of Nature Tamanu Oil.</li>
            <li> Well priced for the quality!  When cooking, I‘ve accidently burnt my hand many times, those burns have damaged only the top layers of the skin, making the area red and painful. I made a serum out of this oil to help with these burns to facilitate healing!</li>
            <li> Amazon is a good source for a hard to find product.  Also, the cost at Amazon was much less than at many other sites.  I would and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I originally heard that Tamanu Oil was a great thing to have around for insect bites.&lt;br /&gt;And since I seem to always be getting bitten by something and have strong reactions to bites, I decided to order it.&lt;br /&gt;I did some research and found that it has many uses beyond insect bites.&lt;br /&gt;The next mosquito bite I got, I quickly dabbed on a tiny drop of the Tamanu oil.&lt;br /&gt;The itch immediately subsided and my reaction to the bite was&lt;br /&gt;MUCH less.... No Swelling....&lt;br /&gt;It Works....... On bites, cuts, scraps, blemishes, and sores.  It is even supposed to fade age spots....&lt;br /&gt;I ordered a bottle for my daughter &amp; she loves it too.&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis which means I have dry, extremely itchy skin. I have been using this on my various outbreaks every day since I got this 100% pure cold pressed tamanu oil and I can definitely tell a difference in my skin. Overall it is great and fast effective oil over psoriasis.</li>
            <li> This is great to sooth itching skin, and it works well on skin conditions. It&#x27;s helped a lot with my psoriasis, and I heard about it from a friend that uses it for her bad acne. It helps a lot with itching and works a lot better than creams I&#x27;ve tried. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> Good price for the size. Very strong scent.</li>
            <li> I use for minor cuts and wounds on my dogs but I also use on my wounds - great healing attributes - a must have I would think.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought both Madagascan and Tahitian Tamanu Oil and the Tahitian one is much nicer to use. The Madagascan one is obviously more rich &amp; concentrated (not sure how that affects the effectiveness of the oil) but the smell and the texture is so overpowering, I find it difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I like it being natural and it worked well.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I use it to make facial oil for my wife. She loves it, she swears it makes her look 10 years younger.</li>
            <li> Great for eczema and other skin conditions. Very earthy smell though.</li>
            <li> A truly amazing product</li>
            <li> I liked the product but wondered why black bits were appearing in the oil. I then realized yesterday that the black rubber dropper was melting into the oil. So gross.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this at might before bed and it really gives my skin a smooth and rich feeling, I love that it soaks in so fast with no oily feeling. I will be buying again and undoubtedly recommended for its great resultss.</li>
            <li> My son has very bad hands affected from Eczema and I happened to try these for him. It is working on him, bringing slow changes and I hope to see his good hands back very soon.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this Tamanu for its greater reaction towards moisturizing the dry skin. I am gonna buy one more before it runs out of stock.</li>
            <li> Wanted to try tamanu oil for old acne scars. Researched a lot of different brands on amazon  and other websites. While slice of nature was not my first choice I am glad  I purchased this product.&lt;br /&gt;The product is thick and has a earthy slight smoky aroma.The dropper really comes in handy when using the oil, no messy spills and you can apply just  the right amount of oil .Like  I said the oil is thick so a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Just started using the oil so I can&#x27;t really say if tamanu oil fades old scars, but I LOVE it as a nightly facial oil. So all in all even if it does not fade my scars my face is SOFT  and SMOOTH.&lt;br /&gt;Just A WARNING , do not use a lot of this oil. I only use 1/2 dropper for spot treatments and my neck area. The smell is strong , but it fades after about a hour. I am african american with combination skin ,so this is working well for me with no break outs.</li>
            <li> What a great product! The quality is amazing and shipping was very fast. The price was definitely worth the quality. Very happy with it!</li>
            <li> Okay, so in all honesty, this stuff stinks. I&#x27;m sorry, but it smells like burnt/smoky wood, but if you can get past the smell, you have magic in your hands. The bottle I got was the 2 ouncer and it&#x27;s a cloudy greenish oil that&#x27;s a bit thick, but nothing unworkable. While I saw there for a hour or so, sniffing the oil every so often to get acclimated to the smell (which I eventually did) and that the smell dissipates after a few minutes, I found that cutting it with another oil helps minimize the smell, so I mix two drops of this with two drops of maracuja oil and apply it to my face twice a day after my regular moisturizer. It leaves my face a bit shiny, but I don&#x27;t mind that any since I can dab off any excess after most of it absorbs. It&#x27;s very moisturizing and it helped heal my dry patches from this harsh winter. I also use it on my cuticles and a burn I have on my belly. Not just good for your face!</li>
            <li> This oil has healed my acne and reduced the scars on my face even when im not using it the results are amazing. I am very much happy.</li>
            <li> I suffered from Perioral Dermatitis for over two years, trying everything under the sun to help. After many cycles of antibiotics and the side-effects of that, I went completely natural in my beauty routine. For about a year I kept the POD mostly at bay using tea tree oil, but it was always still visible and flared up often. Truly at my wit&#x27;s end, I decided to try tamanu oil. Not expecting much, I started applying it just under my nose and on my chin where the POD affected me. Within days, it was vastly improved. Within a month, my POD was cured. Not just temporarily better, but actually CURED!!! A year later, I still have not seen a sign of the POD. Tamanu oil is miracle oil, and I would recommend it for any number of skin conditions. Try it, you might be amazed!</li>
            <li> Using this oil all over my face is super!! My face is so incredible clear and scars are disappearing. My skin feels more plump, radiant, even toned, and healthy since using it. A really awesome thing that doesn&#x60;t change its effectiveness even when mixed with other oils.</li>
            <li> I just had a surgery and my scar was terrible as the injury was kinda way too big! I used it for three weeks and my skin regenerated so fast!! I noticed remarkable changes. This oil is really amazing!! It has great healing properties! Love it so far!!</li>
            <li> This product works very much great! It is unique in that it has versatility and can be used in the skin or hair as a moisturizer to make you feel great! I love using it</li>
            <li> Too soon to see results but unhappy with packaging.  The applicator fell a part in the bottle and some black stuff appeared on and in the bottle.  I can no longer use the applicator and not sure I will buy again.  I do like the oil but the fragrance is overwhelming and the applicator problem is a deterrent.</li>
            <li> Wow! This stuff is great. My 14 year old son had a pretty bad cas of acne. We tried several products and nothing was working. We thought we&#x27;d give this a shot. Glad we did. Blemishes on my sons face started getting better in about 3 days time and are now almost completely gone. I was reading all about this stuff and saw it clears up Toe Nail Fungus which I&#x27;ve had a problem with for a couple years. Put this stuff on, and was amazed at how well it works. I love it. This is great stuff, and if your or someone you know has an acne or foot fungus, I highly reccomend this product, it&#x27;s wondrful.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help fade old stretch marks.  I did not have a lot of expectations but thought I would give it a try.  I did not use it like I should so I can&#x27;t speak to how it helps to fade old stetch marks, but a new burn?  Amazing!  I burnt my arm on the oven top and so Ihave a 2 1/2 line burn.  Not my first like this.  The last took years to fade with lotions, chemical peels, microdermabrasion, and sunscreen everytime I was out.  I have been using this oil morning and night on the burn and it looks like the last one I had did after about a year.  It is healing, shrinking, and fading fast!  I am very happy and usually don&#x27;t turn to sucj natural remedies for skin marks but HIGHLY reccomend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why not 5 stars?  It stinks, bad. But it works!</li>
            <li> Worked wonder on my daughters face as it reduced redness and inflammation and decreased the size of her pimples within a week. I am also using this oil occasionally on my face after my cleansing, toning and moisturizing routine at night. We would be purchasing again from them and highly recommend this tamanu.</li>
            <li> My skin is too oily and sensitive and because of that it gets easily irritated. So I started doing research on more natural approaches to control my problem and skin care in general, and I found the benefits of tamanu oil. Why not try? As nothing else was working in anyway. So I started using this oil for cleansing my face mixed with raw honey. Well it did much to improve my oily skin. My skin is no longer irritated and it seems to be helping with its overall tone which is kinda cool. It also doesn&#x27;t seem to be making my problem any worse, which is also awesome.</li>
