    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>/&gt;I was immediately impressed.  </li>
            <li>can attest that this is the Cardillac of all clippers and the best I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Excellent tool, a pleasure to use and what a difference in how my hair looks like.</li>
            <li>Great price, great product.</li>
            <li>If Panasonic reads this review and contacts me to send them the pieces for investigating the reason for the breakage, I&#x27;ll be happy to do so.</li>
            <li>Now my hairstyles friend is blown away by how good my cuts look.</li>
            <li>Good on you.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t be more happy than what I already am with it.</li>
            <li>I found both the ER1511 and ER1512 way superior (I own both versions).</li>
            <li>As I buzz my head twice a week, it seemed wise to consider a better device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, after about a year, the plastic body broke on its own.</li>
            <li>Some kind of a material fatigue.</li>
            <li>/&gt;OK, I admit the 10K stroke thingie is a nice feature.</li>
            <li>Excellent and Many thanks</li>
            <li>It comes with guides/attachments that I will never use but might be handy for many others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>By far one my best investments this year.</li>
            <li>Over the years I have owned many electric razors, this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>I have never confessed that I bought this trimmer:).</li>
            <li>/&gt;It makes more noise than the ER-GB40-S.  </li>
            <li>am fully satisfied with the reliability and durability.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>I recieved the item very quickly and as advertised in Amazon.</li>
            <li>Namely, it was way to easy to turn off the clipper accidentally while using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Probably the older ER160  is also inferior but I didn&#x27;t own one of those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It cuts great, and holds the battery for a long time.</li>
            <li>Even the older ER153 is better than the the ER1611.</li>
            <li>I have used cheaper corded models and my hair cuts never looks perfect - serviceable, but never perfect.</li>
            <li>I have used a Panasonic clipper for the last 15 years, then it died and wasn&#x27;t sure I would like this one as well.  </li>
            <li>Goes through hair like a hot knife through butter.</li>
            <li>Previously I owned the Panasonic ER-GB40-S, which I liked quite a bit.  </li>
            <li>However, when I buzz my head I cannot see much of my work</li>
            <li>/&gt;In addition, the two-sided attachments are much much clumsier than those of the ER151x series.</li>
            <li>Item as described and fast shipping</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I had read some of the reviews with complaints and was a little skeptical if I would really like it, but I love, love, love it!  </li>
            <li>The above is a true story.</li>
            <li>I like to cut my own hair and this trimmer, while really expensive, is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>These clippers run very fast and quiet.</li>
            <li>I ordered it sight unseen and was pleasantly surprised that it was well over my expectations.  </li>
            <li>so I am completely dependent on feel for spots I cannot see.  </li>
            <li>It fit my small hand extremely well, is quiet and clippers so smoothly.  </li>
            <li>It is clearly a major upgrade, a professional device compared to the ER-GB40-S.  </li>
            <li>, I bought mine from amazon.de when I was in Germany and found a major problem with it immediately.</li>
            <li>so I rely on sound (i.e. the cutting sound of hair or lack of cutting sound) as a gauge for the completeness of the job.  </li>

            <li> Every thing like i aspect to be</li>
            <li> Over the years I have owned many electric razors, this one is by far the best. It cuts great, and holds the battery for a long time.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine who cuts hair for a living owns this model. I like to cut my own hair and this trimmer, while really expensive, is worth every penny. I have used cheaper corded models and my hair cuts never looks perfect - serviceable, but never perfect. Now my hairstyles friend is blown away by how good my cuts look. I have never confessed that I bought this trimmer:).</li>
            <li> I have used a Panasonic clipper for the last 15 years, then it died and wasn&#x27;t sure I would like this one as well.  I ordered it sight unseen and was pleasantly surprised that it was well over my expectations.  It fit my small hand extremely well, is quiet and clippers so smoothly.  I had read some of the reviews with complaints and was a little skeptical if I would really like it, but I love, love, love it!  I found nothing not to like about this clipper.  Great price, great product.</li>
            <li> I recieved the item very quickly and as advertised in Amazon. Neither missing anything nor broken any component. Good on you. Excellent and Many thanks</li>
            <li> After owning a couple of trimmers/clippers, I bought this.  Previously I owned the Panasonic ER-GB40-S, which I liked quite a bit.  I used the ER-GB40-S to buzz my head and trim other body hair.  As I buzz my head twice a week, it seemed wise to consider a better device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was immediately impressed.  It is clearly a major upgrade, a professional device compared to the ER-GB40-S.  Of course it should be at several times the price.  Very solid construction.  Serious cutting action.  It comes with guides/attachments that I will never use but might be handy for many others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some nitpicky observations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no protective guard to cover the blade when it is stored.  That is a very small thing but given the price it seems like a big oversight.  I don&#x27;t want to damage the blade when I store it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along the same lines, there is also no case to store it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes more noise than the ER-GB40-S.  The noise isn&#x27;t annoying.  However, when I buzz my head I cannot see much of my work so I rely on sound (i.e. the cutting sound of hair or lack of cutting sound) as a gauge for the completeness of the job.  With the noise level for this model, I cannot hear the cutting action so I am completely dependent on feel for spots I cannot see.  I have found that feel is a less reliable gauge for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are relatively trivial issues but they nudge my rating from 5 stars to 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I have taken my time over the last 18 months to test this clipper.&lt;br /&gt;I can attest that this is the Cardillac of all clippers and the best I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;I am fully satisfied with the reliability and durability.&lt;br /&gt;In fact, I want to buy another one.&lt;br /&gt;Please advise how I can benefit for the 10% discount promised by seller Chuck.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> These clippers run very fast and quiet. Goes through hair like a hot knife through butter. If you&#x27;re a barber,  adding these clippers to your shop will definitely speed up hair cutting.</li>
            <li> I beg to disagree with all those 5-star ratings...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I bought mine from amazon.de when I was in Germany and found a major problem with it immediately. Namely, it was way to easy to turn off the clipper accidentally while using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, the two-sided attachments are much much clumsier than those of the ER151x series. I found both the ER1511 and ER1512 way superior (I own both versions). Even the older ER153 is better than the the ER1611. Probably the older ER160  is also inferior but I didn&#x27;t own one of those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, after about a year, the plastic body broke on its own. Some kind of a material fatigue. I bought the necessary replacement parts on amazon.de but, as it turned out, I couldn&#x27;t take apart the clipper so I couldn&#x27;t fix it. Authorized service in the US didn&#x27;t exist and I received an estimate from a repair shop that was way too expensive, almost as much as the clipper itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, IMHO, the ER1611 a piece of mis-engineered and over-engineered piece of junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, I admit the 10K stroke thingie is a nice feature. As I recall the ER151x series does only 6K strokes per minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the ER1512 is the king of all clippers (Panasonic or any other band). I can&#x27;t be more happy than what I already am with it. The ER1511 is essentially the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. The above is a true story. I still have the ER1611 and the  replacement parts. If Panasonic reads this review and contacts me to send them the pieces for investigating the reason for the breakage, I&#x27;ll be happy to do so. I will even pay for the postage and Panasonic can keep it. I don&#x27;t even ask for any compensation and/or replacement.</li>
            <li> Item as described and fast shipping</li>
            <li> I like it. Came on time. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Excellent tool, a pleasure to use and what a difference in how my hair looks like. By far one my best investments this year.</li>
