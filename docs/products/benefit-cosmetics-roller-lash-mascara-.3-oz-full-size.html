            <li>I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I have tried ALOT of mascara&#x27;s looking for one to give me length without clumping, this one is amazing</li>
            <li>If you have lashes you&#x27;d like to improve, this is amazing stuff.</li>
            <li>Comes off nicely without pulling your lashes out.</li>
            <li>There are mascaras that I liked</li>
            <li>It goes on kind of clumpy and looks like drugstore brand mascara.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;nothing is going to help.&amp;#34; (they&#x27;re so kind sometimes, no?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love Benefit</li>
            <li>I love the wand.</li>
            <li>; mascara wayyyy better.</li>
            <li>Ok, this stuff is greeeat.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic mascara!</li>
            <li>Ah, this is my favorite mascara now.</li>
            <li>I AM SO GLAD</li>
            <li>♡♡♡ :)</li>
            <li>Yay! :)</li>
            <li>However, if you have the most perfect lashes in the Western World like my daughter, then you&#x27;d probably want to pass.  </li>
            <li>Not as nice as mine, of course, but really cool lashes.&amp;#34;  I showed her the tube of mascara</li>
            <li>I wish I had all the money I&#x27;ve spent trying to find the perfect mascara.</li>
            <li>It lasts all day without flaking and washes off easily.</li>
            <li>It resists water yet washes off EASILY with soap and water.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m happy to report that I have stored all my other mascaras, including They&#x27;re Real, and proudly display Roller Lash on my makeup counter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of Benefit</li>
            <li>It applies smoothly, doesn&#x27;t clump, curls and extends lashes, it has conditioners in it, lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t flake or smudge.  </li>
            <li>but I was NOT disappointed.  </li>
            <li>When applying, I&#x27;m still getting clumps, even when I clean off the wand and try again.</li>
            <li>You have lashes on your right eye!</li>
            <li>SO curly, so long, so separated, so AMAZING!</li>
            <li>The product works well at lifting lashes and making lashes full.</li>
            <li>I purchased this at Ulta, but I love it so much</li>
            <li>It is well prices and shipped fast!!</li>
            <li>I rarely have to go over my lashes with a spooler – there are no clumps!&lt;br /&gt;•</li>
            <li>I have short straight wimpy lashes but with this mascara I get longer fuller CURLED lashes which I love!  </li>
            <li>It stays on a good 12 hours without smearing down your face (even when napping).</li>
            <li>Thanks Klout and Benefit!</li>
            <li>If you like ‘They’re Real’, then you have to try this product!</li>
            <li>&amp; I did exactly as they say.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve watched many good reviews of the Roller Lash Mascara on YouTube, yet I was still skeptical.</li>
            <li>I never used to buy &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34; mascara and always opted for my local drugstore/pharmacy for just a reliable and easy to get brand of mascara.  </li>
            <li>This is a huge deal for a makeup junkie such as myself.</li>
            <li>This mascara really does hook almost every lash and lift it upwards while creating a curled look.&lt;br /&gt;•</li>
            <li>The construction of the brush (curbed) helps with coverage on all lashes those at the very end and beginning of eyes.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>fast dry-out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works really well on making my eyelashes curly and defined.  </li>
            <li>So, this works really well</li>
            <li>This mascara really makes my eyes pop.</li>
            <li>It really does curl your lashes.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s brought out my teeny, skimpy lashes and it absolutely does not flake or clump.</li>
            <li>Best mascara, I use with primer and my lashes almost look fake!</li>
            <li>I researched &amp;#34;best mascara&amp;#34; online and learned about highly rated Benefit They&#x27;re Real, which was o.k.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re Real, so I thought I&#x27;d try out this new product.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many different brands of mascara I have tried over the years - finally one that curls, leaves my lashes soft and doesn&#x27;t flake!</li>
            <li>I had intended to try this new mascara by Benefit at its release.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think this would live up to the hype.  </li>
            <li>I have new post chemo eyelashes, and don&#x27;t want to have to break them with a lash curler.  </li>
            <li>This might be my new go-to mascarra.</li>
            <li>They’re Real mascara and generally prefer waterproof mascara for my makeup</li>
            <li>but wow does this work!</li>
            <li>Amazing voluminous to say the least!</li>
            <li>It makes my eyelashes look so much longer and lasts the entire day without having to reapply.  </li>
            <li>So glad I don&#x27;t have to waste money switching mascaras constantly anymore...</li>
            <li>Great volume and length, they look fake!</li>
            <li>mascaras - they don&#x27;t feed well  onto the brush, so there&#x27;s either clumping or dry sections and touching up just makes a mess of artificiality.  </li>
            <li>Earlier this year, I decided to look for a new mascara as Lancome just wasn&#x27;t giving me the effect I desired anymore; something changed in their formulas.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light weight formula that does not weigh lashes down, they stay long and perky.</li>
            <li>They actually stay soft!</li>
            <li>I generally try to avoid using an eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>I naturally have long lashes</li>
            <li>Really like this, but need a brownish black.</li>

            <li> Really like this, but need a brownish black.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is an age problem, but it&#x27;s frustrating to have full lashes on only one eye.</li>
            <li> read a few Amazon reviews that shared my horror and was convinced it was worth a try for the same reason everyone else mentioned - not satisfied with any mascaras i&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have long lashes to begin with, and this mascara makes them look even longer and lifts them without having to use a lash curler.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use and buy this for a long time to come!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent a small fortune purchasing high end mascaras which ended up in the trash because they clumped and flaked on my lashes.</li>
            <li> I used Benefit Roller Lash Mascara in Black on one eye only.</li>
            <li> waiting to see if Benefit has solved the other main complaint:  </li>
            <li> still went on thick &amp; it doesn&#x27;t look natural at all.  </li>
            <li> It does not clump, keeps lashes soft and seriously lasts all day...</li>
            <li> /&gt;this also says it &amp;#34;curls&amp;#34; - i don&#x27;t see a difference from other brands</li>
            <li> Stays on all day without flaking or smearing if you tear up or get caught in a down pour.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve thrown out half used over the years</li>
            <li> I have a spot of missing lashes from a scar on my lash line and this brush pulls even the finest lashes out so that I don&#x27;t look like I have anything missing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make lashes rock hard either.  </li>
            <li> I tried several others, including Dior Show (which I hated and took back), and decided to give Roller Lash a try.</li>
            <li> My daughter (blessed with her father&#x27;s amazingly thick fringe of lashes) keeps asking me why I even bother, since</li>
            <li> The wand is thin &amp; the mascara goes on heavy.  </li>
            <li> SERIOUSLY.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it&#x27;s not nearly as good.</li>
            <li> and she continued, &amp;#34; It&#x27;s not good for me, of course.</li>
            <li> Wish I didn&#x27;t spend the money to be disappointed by this mascara, but such is life.</li>
            <li> I have tried an insane amount of mascaras throughout the years and have never found anything that I couldn&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li> Expensive</li>
            <li> It is expensive for mascara</li>
            <li> You know, fake lashes without having to apply fake lashes.</li>
            <li> I was leary about spending $25 and ending up disappointed yet again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try to use it because I hate wasting money, but I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>

            <li> I had intended to try this new mascara by Benefit at its release. I love Benefit’s They’re Real mascara and generally prefer waterproof mascara for my makeup looks.&lt;br /&gt;• I love the wand. It spreads my eyelashes evenly. I rarely have to go over my lashes with a spooler – there are no clumps!&lt;br /&gt;• It is a good curling mascara. I generally try to avoid using an eyelash curler. This mascara really does hook almost every lash and lift it upwards while creating a curled look.&lt;br /&gt;• My eyes look bright and wide.&lt;br /&gt;• It lasts, lasts and lasts. I can wear it out on a night on the town without having to worry about smudging or re-applying. The mascara stays put until I remove it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to report that I have stored all my other mascaras, including They&#x27;re Real, and proudly display Roller Lash on my makeup counter. This is a huge deal for a makeup junkie such as myself. We do not often find a makeup product that truly stands up to all of its promises.&lt;br /&gt;I was ecstatic to quality for a Benefit Roller Lash Klout perk. Thanks Klout and Benefit!</li>
            <li> This Mascara Is awesome!</li>
            <li> It makes my lashes appear longer and fuller, however it smudges under my eyes by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how many different brands of mascara I have tried over the years - finally one that curls, leaves my lashes soft and doesn&#x27;t flake!</li>
            <li> If you like ‘They’re Real’, then you have to try this product! If you use the brush correctly and physically roll it onto your lashes in an upward motion, then it actually curls your lashes for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I reviewed my top 4 mascaras on my blog as well! http://www.newlyag.com/the-final-four/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking I might have gotten a defective batch. In reading all of the 5 star reviews, I&#x27;m not experiencing all the perks of this mascara. I still need to curl my lashes. When applying, I&#x27;m still getting clumps, even when I clean off the wand and try again. I&#x27;m pretty disappointed. I like the &amp;#34;They&#x27;re Real&amp;#34; mascara wayyyy better. I actually don&#x27;t have to curl my lashes with that mascara and I only experience clumps when it&#x27;s nearing the end of its shelf life. Wish I didn&#x27;t spend the money to be disappointed by this mascara, but such is life.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best mascara I have ever used. It is well prices and shipped fast!!</li>
            <li> Ok, this stuff is greeeat.</li>
            <li> Best mascara that I used yet.  The construction of the brush (curbed) helps with coverage on all lashes those at the very end and beginning of eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve watched many good reviews of the Roller Lash Mascara on YouTube, yet I was still skeptical. I wish I had all the money I&#x27;ve spent trying to find the perfect mascara. For me....though pricey...it&#x27;s a keeper and I&#x27;m extremely happy!</li>
            <li> Best mascara, I use with primer and my lashes almost look fake! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> i too hesitated over the cost.  read a few Amazon reviews that shared my horror and was convinced it was worth a try for the same reason everyone else mentioned - not satisfied with any mascaras i&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;my complaints about &amp;#34;all&amp;#34; mascaras - they don&#x27;t feed well  onto the brush, so there&#x27;s either clumping or dry sections and touching up just makes a mess of artificiality.  This brand has figured that out - perfect feed, perfect lashes.&lt;br /&gt;now waiting to see if Benefit has solved the other main complaint:  fast dry-out.&lt;br /&gt;this also says it &amp;#34;curls&amp;#34; - i don&#x27;t see a difference from other brands</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful mascara ( really separates your lashes) and it comes in a great wand!!  The only downsize is its price!  Expensive</li>
            <li> I have tried ALOT of mascara&#x27;s looking for one to give me length without clumping, this one is amazing does just what I was looking for! So glad I don&#x27;t have to waste money switching mascaras constantly anymore... my advice try this one!</li>
            <li> Works as promised, but way over-priced.</li>
            <li> This is great mascara. Lengthens and defines the lashes without gumming up or getting clumpy. Stays on all day without flaking or smearing if you tear up or get caught in a down pour. Comes off nicely without pulling your lashes out. It is expensive for mascara but it works and considering all the tubes of cheaper mascara I&#x27;ve thrown out half used over the years I think I&#x27;ll be buying it again.</li>
            <li> THE BEST EVERRRRRRR!!!!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think this would live up to the hype.  It works really well on making my eyelashes curly and defined.  I have new post chemo eyelashes, and don&#x27;t want to have to break them with a lash curler.  So, this works really well</li>
            <li> I love this! My eyelashes have never looked better!</li>
            <li> I have used Lancome mascara since college (that&#x27;s almost 30 years). Earlier this year, I decided to look for a new mascara as Lancome just wasn&#x27;t giving me the effect I desired anymore; something changed in their formulas. I researched &amp;#34;best mascara&amp;#34; online and learned about highly rated Benefit They&#x27;re Real, which was o.k. but still not what I was looking for. I tried several others, including Dior Show (which I hated and took back), and decided to give Roller Lash a try. BEST. MASCARA. EVER. I have long lashes to begin with, and this mascara makes them look even longer and lifts them without having to use a lash curler. I think I&#x27;ve discovered the 8th Wonder of the World!!  It lasts all day without flaking and washes off easily.</li>
            <li> Best mascara I have ever used. I am 65 and cannot see well without glasses. I can apply this, not getting any on my eye area, and not even have to use a brush or curler after applying. This is a fantastic mascara!</li>
            <li> Really like this, but need a brownish black. I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> Amazing voluminous to say the least!</li>
            <li> At a loss for words. Try it but it&#x27;s only $20 at Sephora!</li>
            <li> This mascara really makes my eyes pop.</li>
            <li> I never used to buy &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34; mascara and always opted for my local drugstore/pharmacy for just a reliable and easy to get brand of mascara.  HOWEVER, after I used a sample of this in my Birchbox I was hooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is THE BEST mascara I have ever used and totally worth every penny!  It makes my eyelashes look so much longer and lasts the entire day without having to reapply.  I will continue to use and buy this for a long time to come!</li>
            <li> It really does curl your lashes. I still used a curler, but this keeps them curled all day. It also doesn&#x27;t flake. This might be my new go-to mascarra.</li>
            <li> I have tried an insane amount of mascaras throughout the years and have never found anything that I couldn&#x27;t live without. There are mascaras that I liked but I was on a mission to find the best of the best. You know, fake lashes without having to apply fake lashes. So, the girls at Ulta talked me into buying the most expensive mascara in the store. I didn&#x27;t expect much but I was NOT disappointed.  I love this stuff!! The brush is a hook design and grabs lashes individually to separate.  It applies smoothly, doesn&#x27;t clump, curls and extends lashes, it has conditioners in it, lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t flake or smudge.  It doesn&#x27;t make lashes rock hard either.  They actually stay soft! This has never happened to me before. Absolutely amazing and worth the investment!!!!!!!!!</li>

            <li> Ah, this is my favorite mascara now. The product works well at lifting lashes and making lashes full. One of my eyelids has lash thinness. I don&#x27;t know if this is an age problem, but it&#x27;s frustrating to have full lashes on only one eye. This mascara is the only one I&#x27;ve found that fixes the problem. Mascara doesn&#x27;t give me raccoon eyes at end of day either. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent a small fortune purchasing high end mascaras which ended up in the trash because they clumped and flaked on my lashes. I was leary about spending $25 and ending up disappointed yet again. I was tempted to give up and go back to my $6 to $8 drugstore brands. I AM SO GLAD I BOUGHT ROLLER LASH. THIS MASCARA IS AMAZING!!!! It&#x27;s brought out my teeny, skimpy lashes and it absolutely does not flake or clump. It resists water yet washes off EASILY with soap and water. Please keep making this product. ♡♡♡ :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it! I naturally have long lashes but wow does this work! Great volume and length, they look fake!</li>
            <li> I purchased this at Ulta, but I love it so much I would recommend buying it ANYWHERE! SO curly, so long, so separated, so AMAZING!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Benefit They&#x27;re Real, so I thought I&#x27;d try out this new product. Unfortunately it&#x27;s not nearly as good. It doesn&#x27;t have the lengthening and fanning effect that I was hoping for. It goes on kind of clumpy and looks like drugstore brand mascara. I&#x27;m going to try to use it because I hate wasting money, but I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> i love this product, best I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara!!! I have short straight wimpy lashes but with this mascara I get longer fuller CURLED lashes which I love!  Yay! :)</li>
            <li> I have tried every mascara at the beauty counter, and nothing helped my skimpy blonde lashes. I&#x27;ve used &amp;#34;highly rated&amp;#34; mascaras that cost a ton and didn&#x27;t make me look as if I had lashes at all.  My daughter (blessed with her father&#x27;s amazingly thick fringe of lashes) keeps asking me why I even bother, since &amp;#34;nothing is going to help.&amp;#34; (they&#x27;re so kind sometimes, no?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, she ate her words. I used Benefit Roller Lash Mascara in Black on one eye only. I headed back into the living room, not saying anything. Seconds later, she noticed and exclaimed,&amp;#34;What on Earth did you do? You have lashes on your right eye! Not as nice as mine, of course, but really cool lashes.&amp;#34;  I showed her the tube of mascara and she continued, &amp;#34; It&#x27;s not good for me, of course. If I used it, I&#x27;d look like I had tarantulas over my eyes.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there.  If you have lashes you&#x27;d like to improve, this is amazing stuff. It stays on a good 12 hours without smearing down your face (even when napping). If you&#x27;re like me, you&#x27;d prefer to improve your lashes, making them look longer, thicker and showing those teeny baby lashes you didn&#x27;t know you had. However, if you have the most perfect lashes in the Western World like my daughter, then you&#x27;d probably want to pass.  Take your pick.</li>
            <li> this is the best mascara I have ever used!  It does not clump, keeps lashes soft and seriously lasts all day...SERIOUSLY.  I have a spot of missing lashes from a scar on my lash line and this brush pulls even the finest lashes out so that I don&#x27;t look like I have anything missing.  It&#x27;s a light weight formula that does not weigh lashes down, they stay long and perky.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get what all the fuss is.  I still needed to curl my lashes.  The wand is thin &amp; the mascara goes on heavy.  It didn&#x27;t seperate at all &amp; I did exactly as they say.  I even curled my lashes &amp; it still went on thick &amp; it doesn&#x27;t look natural at all.  I returned mine.</li>
