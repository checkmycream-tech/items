            <li>The pencil is very smooth and doesn&#x27;t flake.</li>
            <li>As a dirty/medium blonde, this color is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>I like this so much more than the Anastasia eyebrow gel.</li>
            <li>Glad I realized it came in pencil form.</li>
            <li>I finally have eyebrows and I am so happy!!</li>
            <li>It is okay.</li>
            <li>I thought it would stay on longer and look more natural,not so much.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It gives more pigment and is so much more natural looking while still being effective!</li>
            <li>Super easy!</li>
            <li>Stays on all day and it easy to use.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly!</li>
            <li>I find this pencil to be really helpful in creating a nice, defined brow.</li>
            <li>prefer the new brow brush with fibers be Benefits and l love better brows by It cosmetics.</li>
            <li>The lighter one underneath to create the shape and the darker on top to fill in to make them more natural looking.</li>
            <li>Nice, natural color....goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned and have light blonde hair-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to the whole eyebrow makeup, and this is super easy to use!!</li>
            <li>This is a great ash color, not too orangey or golden and it is soft enough that it doesn&#x27;t pull out any of my brow hairs.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s definitely worth the 23$.</li>
            <li>Trying to find the right color eyebrow pencil has proven to be a futile effort - until now.</li>
            <li>The consistency is just right and the color lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Soft color that glides on easily.  </li>
            <li>I am fairly blond and was worried it might be too dark, but it actually works great for my pale skin and light hair.</li>
            <li>Bought this brow pencil for the first time at ULTA Beauty Store.</li>
            <li>The taupe is a really great color for blondes that can be super light or applied a little heavier for dark blondes.</li>
            <li>The texture is just right, and the taupe/ash blonde color is perfect for my hair a complexion (in the past most brow pencils were too dark or too orangey).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I switched to this pencil in the same color - same wonderful product, but should last me a little longer.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and evenly, allowing you to make your brows as light or as dark as you wish.</li>
            <li>Delivery was reasonable.</li>
            <li>I think that i would buy the light brown next time.</li>
            <li>and it last all day, but the color is kinda of light for my skin type.</li>
            <li>I really like this eyebrow pencil</li>
            <li>This is important because most pencils do, and I have so few hairs there that every one counts!!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still on my first pencil (almost time for a new one).</li>
            <li>Very good product for those with blonde or light brown hair..... not too harsh or dark.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to remove, but stays on all day long without needing reapplication.</li>
            <li>I love my new look and the little brush on the other end.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too light and not too dark, and has the ashy tone to it that grey hair has.</li>
            <li>I bought the taupe and my hair is medium natural blonde.</li>

            <li> I bought Brow Wiz repeatedly and went through them like crazy.</li>

            <li> I bought this pencil to replace the one I finished of the same brand and color.  The best for me on the market.</li>
            <li> I bit the bullet and stopped dying my hair and going grey. Trying to find the right color eyebrow pencil has proven to be a futile effort - until now. The taupe color is perfect. It&#x27;s not too light and not too dark, and has the ashy tone to it that grey hair has. The consistency is just right and the color lasts all day. It&#x27;s expensive but well worth it. This is my eyebrow pencil for evermore.</li>
            <li> Best pencil for brows that I have found.  Soft color that glides on easily.  Delivery was reasonable.</li>
            <li> I prefer this over the Anastasia brow wiz pencil. Last longer and goes on my evenly for me.</li>
            <li> I love the color matches perfect</li>
            <li> Anastasia&#x27;s brow pencils are the best. The texture is just right, and the taupe/ash blonde color is perfect for my hair a complexion (in the past most brow pencils were too dark or too orangey). I used to order their brow wiz wind-up pencil, but it ran out way too quickly, especially considering that I don&#x27;t use it heavily. I&#x27;m glad I switched to this pencil in the same color - same wonderful product, but should last me a little longer.</li>
            <li> Anastasia Beverly Hills is the queen of all brow products and this pencil is no exception. It goes on smoothly and evenly, allowing you to make your brows as light or as dark as you wish. It&#x27;s easy to remove, but stays on all day long without needing reapplication. The brow comb on the end of the pencil allows for smoothing the pencil into your brows, as well as combing the brows in the same direction. As a dirty/medium blonde, this color is perfect for me. I wear makeup 3-4 times per week and this pencil with regular use lasts me about 3 months.</li>
            <li> Very good product for those with blonde or light brown hair..... not too harsh or dark.</li>
            <li> I now have eyebrows!!! This has been amazing for defining my face.. I&#x27;m new to the whole eyebrow makeup, and this is super easy to use!! Super easy! I like this so much more than the Anastasia eyebrow gel. It gives more pigment and is so much more natural looking while still being effective! I bought the taupe and my hair is medium natural blonde. This is a great match in my opinion. Id still use taupe though even if I go lighter with my hair.</li>
            <li> I think that i would buy the light brown next time. I like the way it goes on and it last all day, but the color is kinda of light for my skin type.</li>
            <li> I bought Brow Wiz repeatedly and went through them like crazy. At $20+ a pop, it was an expensive habit. Glad I realized it came in pencil form. I&#x27;ve used this 5 times already and haven&#x27;t had to sharpen it, as opposed to Brow Wiz, which I would&#x27;ve had to click over a couple dozen times. The taupe is a really great color for blondes that can be super light or applied a little heavier for dark blondes.</li>
            <li> Using with Anastasia Blonde Duo ...thinning brows!</li>
            <li> I find this pencil to be really helpful in creating a nice, defined brow. I am fairly blond and was worried it might be too dark, but it actually works great for my pale skin and light hair. Stays on all day and it easy to use. Doesn&#x27;t pull any of those delicate hairs out either if you are trying to fill in some sparse regions.</li>
            <li> I really like this eyebrow pencil and it is certainly the best I have found yet. I have terrible luck matching pencils to my blonde eyebrows but this is great. I love my new look and the little brush on the other end. I will be repurchasing this!</li>
            <li> This is a great ash color, not too orangey or golden and it is soft enough that it doesn&#x27;t pull out any of my brow hairs.  This is important because most pencils do, and I have so few hairs there that every one counts!!</li>
            <li> Love this product! I over-plucked my eyebrows when I was younger and am trying to let then grow back in. I also have oily skin and until now I was unable to use drugstore eyebrow pencils because they never lasted. I have purchased 2 different colors and use then in layers. The lighter one underneath to create the shape and the darker on top to fill in to make them more natural looking. The color stays all day. I finally have eyebrows and I am so happy!!</li>
            <li> It is okay. I thought it would stay on longer and look more natural,not so much.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the new brow brush with fibers be Benefits and l love better brows by It cosmetics. Jamie Kern is the best!!</li>
            <li> Nice, natural color....goes on smoothly.  Arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> very happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> Bought this brow pencil for the first time at ULTA Beauty Store. It has been almost a year and I&#x27;m still on my first pencil (almost time for a new one). The pencil is very smooth and doesn&#x27;t flake. It&#x27;s creamy. I think it&#x27;s definitely worth the 23$. I&#x27;ve tried to find a cheaper pencil but just ended up wasting my money. I&#x27;m fair skinned and have light blonde hair- the ash blonde color gives my brows life (blonde eyebrows tend to blend in with your skin so it looks like you have no eyebrows at all). I love this brow pencil!</li>
