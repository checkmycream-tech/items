            <li>I also have kind of small hands and this brush fit perfectly in my hand, I loved it on my hair, Tomorrow is wash day i cant wait to use it on them,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen a lot of these detanglung type of brushes  in ads and TV commercials and was pretty sure it was too good to be true type of deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Received this brush yesterday a lot quicker than expected and I love it!!!</li>
            <li>The brush glides through her hair smoothly without pulling or tugging.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like if you brush correctly and bottom to up, it doesn&#x27;t go through the tangles and rip your hair right through your brushing or combing.</li>
            <li>Haha!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very excited about this product and highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;Received the product for a special promotional price.</li>
            <li>Bought this detangling brush at a special promotion price for my daughters problematic tatty hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great shape, compact size, she loves the pink and has already been brushing her hair with</li>
            <li>I bought one for my nieces since I love mine so much.  </li>
            <li>She loves the colour of the brush in her beloved pink</li>
            <li>Most of all I love that it actually works, really tackles my knots, and completely pain free!</li>
            <li>This product worked great for my 6 year old daughter who has long curly hair.  </li>
            <li>daughters hair is inbetween a straight and super curly stage.</li>
            <li>This brush fits nicely in my hand, but does not work well with dry hair.</li>
            <li>It kind of avoids going straight through the big heart of the nest tangle and work around the looser tangles to take out those first.</li>
            <li>My daughter went through a lot of detangling spray and many different combs and brushes to stop the meltdowns with no luck.</li>
            <li>I had much higher hopes for this brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Actually though, I think this works decently well!</li>
            <li>Would not buy again, but for the $1.99 deal I got I cannot really complain.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use one of her normal ones!</li>
            <li>I adore the colour, who doesant love a bit of pink!</li>
            <li>I even forgot conditioner, which her mother assured me was an absolute necessity, and the comb easily went through her hair without causing a single &amp;#34;ouch!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend, I brought at a promotional price.</li>
            <li>I will never use a normal brush again.</li>
            <li>Before this brush, we would use a normal brush and she would frequently complain that it hurt and that I was pulling her hair</li>
            <li>I have a 6 year old diva daughter who rants and raves through every hair brushing session!</li>
            <li>The bristles are kind of tough</li>
            <li>Bought this brush as needed something for my young daughter.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this brush for when my 4 year old granddaughter comes to visit.</li>
            <li>Briefly tried it on my daughter, it seemed to go through easier than a regular brush, although it left her hair very frizzy ( and she has pin straight hair).  </li>
            <li>However the bristles are pretty sharp feeling on my scalp, and it ripped out A LOT of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;d be better for someone who doesn&#x27;t have such hard to manage hair</li>
            <li>It is harsh on the scalp, but works much better with wet hair.</li>
            <li>In this video I show the difference between a normal brush and the detangling brush on my 5 year old&#x27;s wet hair without any detangling</li>
            <li>I have very thick shoulder length hair and it leaves my hair completely tangle free without pulling or splitting my hair.</li>
            <li>The bristles are a soft plastic and it reminds me of a soft brush, but this one you can use for wet hair!</li>

            <li> This product worked great for my 6 year old daughter who has long curly hair.  Before this brush, we would use a normal brush and she would frequently complain that it hurt and that I was pulling her hair every morning I brushed it for her, even after spraying her hair with water.  Using this brush she doesn&#x27;t complain anymore.  The brush glides through her hair smoothly without pulling or tugging.  I wish I would have found this brush years ago!!  I will never use a normal brush again.</li>
            <li> Bought this brush as needed something for my young daughter.  Arrived very promptly which impressed me.  It&#x27;s a great shape, compact size, she loves the pink and has already been brushing her hair with it.&lt;br /&gt;Received the product for a special promotional price.</li>

            <li> I Love it , don&#x27;t hurt when you are untangling</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:8816ff775faa7bf317d0c7d3996a28f9]] The Belle Moi detangling brush was purchased at a discount in return for an honest review. I was very skeptical about this brush,so I am pleasantly surprised it works! The bristles are a soft plastic and it reminds me of a soft brush, but this one you can use for wet hair! My daughter went through a lot of detangling spray and many different combs and brushes to stop the meltdowns with no luck. In this video I show the difference between a normal brush and the detangling brush on my 5 year old&#x27;s wet hair without any detangling spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now after bath time she panics wondering where this brush is, because she&#x27;s scared I&#x27;ll use one of her normal ones! Haha!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very excited about this product and highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> Brilliant brush, detangled  quickly and painlessly my knotted hair; also fabulous for the shower to remove all traces of conditioner. Compact size ideal for handbag. I received this brush at a promotional price and can confirm this is an unbiased revue</li>
            <li> I have a 6 year old diva daughter who rants and raves through every hair brushing session! Thought we should try this as we needed something to stop the tantrums (hers and mine). She loves the colour of the brush in her beloved pink and I like the size of it, perfect to hold. We are both really impressed with how it detangled quickly and effectively. I&#x27;ll definitely be recommending it to anyone who will listen! We got for a promotional price, but would be more than happy to pay in full.. You can&#x27;t put a price on tear-free grooming!!</li>
            <li> The bristles seems to be hard and the brush handle is a little hard to hold compared to my wet brush which I like much better.  My daughter has very long hair and it did pull on her hair she did not like me brushing her hair with it at all.  I have not used it while her hair was wet.</li>
            <li> Very impressed with the quick delivery, and the detangling brush itself, very easy to hold, and a great size, perfect to put in your handbag! I adore the colour, who doesant love a bit of pink! Most of all I love that it actually works, really tackles my knots, and completely pain free!

            <li> This brush is now the Miracle brush in our home!&lt;br /&gt;My daughters hair is inbetween a straight and super curly stage. We have the hardest time when it comes to her having it brushed!&lt;br /&gt;I receive the brush today and couldn&#x27;t wait to use it. My daughter of course not to much.&lt;br /&gt;As I started to brush her hair she didn&#x27;t say one word! Then out of no where she says she LOVES this brush! She is now constantly brushing her hair! Best product for family&#x27;s that have very tangled hair!</li>
            <li> easy to hold because of the grab arm, bright color, do the job,my daughter loves to use it</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair, I am black and Portuguese. I also have kind of small hands and this brush fit perfectly in my hand, I loved it on my hair, Tomorrow is wash day i cant wait to use it on them,</li>

It&#x27;s not a miracle worker like you have a nest of knots in your hair and one comb through you have perfectly silky hair. It&#x27;s more like if you brush correctly and bottom to up, it doesn&#x27;t go through the tangles and rip your hair right through your brushing or combing. It kind of avoids going straight through the big heart of the nest tangle and work around the looser tangles to take out those first.</li>
            <li> This brush fits nicely in my hand, but does not work well with dry hair. It is harsh on the scalp, but works much better with wet hair.</li>
