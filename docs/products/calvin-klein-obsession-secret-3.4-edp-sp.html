            <li>Love this scent and receive many compliments</li>

            <li>This is my favorite perfume and could not believe the price.</li>
            <li>Need I say more?</li>
            <li>my mother loves this scent and it was a better price on Amazon than anywhere else I looked.</li>
            <li>Wow it was great.  </li>
            <li>I have the same problem with florals in SO&#x27;s otherwise likable (but not as good) sister, CK Obsession Night Woman, which is unwearable in warm weather.</li>
            <li>Such happiness!</li>
            <li>Love this cool smell</li>
            <li>This perfume isn&#x27;t comparible to anything - finally a totally unique scent!This perfume isn&#x27;t comparible to anything - finally a totally unique scent!</li>
            <li>Wife loved the new variation of Obsession.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a clue how i missed this previously but its wonderful and alluring .</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>Lucky me :) ?</li>
            <li>Plus its so cheap online.</li>
            <li>Thank you for offering this product at such a great  price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost 30 and Vera Wang&#x27;s Princess and Burberry&#x27;s The Beat are great fragrances for the younger crowd (my opinion).</li>
            <li>The package came on time and securely wrapped.  </li>
            <li>The dispenser is really a cool design.</li>
            <li>and I am good for the entire day and evening!  </li>
            <li>and I am a loyal customer and will always be.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is light, soft and sexy.</li>
            <li>So ladies if you are looking for something a little different that is  wonderful for a night out on the town this is one you will enjoy!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for, the discounted price was a HUGE bonus.  </li>
            <li>That may sound strange, but I love it this way!</li>
            <li>Bottle was in original packaging, and not used very much, if at all.  </li>
            <li>Purchased this for my sisters birthday, and she just loved the scent, not too light, but not to heavy.</li>
            <li>First off, I am very thankful to the merchant for shipping so quick.</li>
            <li>SO is very much like a vanilla coca-cola or a rootbeer float.</li>
            <li>but I think women in the middle would be most attracted to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>SO&#x27;s white florals are just on the edge of cloying for me, perhaps more so in heat.</li>
            <li>got more than what I had expected.</li>
            <li>She had appreciated the fragrance on a number of occasions.</li>
            <li>I am a fan of the original Obsession and had received a sample of this a while back.  </li>
            <li>Not lasting very long, but has a clean, fresh scent.</li>
            <li>It is just as new (did not have a polythene cover on the box pack though, but i do not mind).</li>
            <li>Subtle as compared to the original, but well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>The initial notes were very distinctive and spicy.</li>
            <li>We like its fragrance as it is soft and soothing.</li>
            <li>One spray and my wife said it smells like old lady perfume.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;SO is very American &amp; very well-done.</li>
            <li>SO is young &amp; up-beat</li>
            <li>perfume must be old or lost its potency</li>
            <li>I expected something similar to original Obsession, but it&#x27;s nothing like it.  </li>
            <li>This scent is like no other!  </li>
            <li>Secret Obsession is my favorite scent of all time.</li>
            <li>I love the original Obsession, but, was a bit disappointed in this version.</li>

            <li> Secret Obsession is my favorite scent of all time.</li>
            <li> I love the original Obsession, but, was a bit disappointed in this version.</li>
            <li> I love the base notes, not overpowering and seems so fresh even after a couple of hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has been such a sad thing that it is longer available in stores.</li>
            <li> The package came in earlier than I had expected.</li>
            <li> received as expected.</li>
            <li> Secret is soft, and quiet, but I like for nights.</li>
            <li> Secret obsession reminds me of a fragrance an older woman would like.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not fresh and airy.  </li>
            <li> Amazon, please re-stock Secret Obsession by CKlein as soon as possible!</li>
            <li> I love my grandma, but hated her perfume.  </li>
            <li> The Secret to Secret Obsession is this:  It smells just like Suntan Lotion mixed with Deep Woods Off.  </li>
            <li> Lately my sister in law had her birthday.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it does not smell horrible, hence the 3 stars; the notes remind me of something you&#x27;d smell on an older woman in her mid 40s.</li>
            <li> truly was disappointed, there was no fragrance other than sort of alcohol metal like odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bad move on my part.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Love this scent!  I am a fan of the original Obsession and had received a sample of this a while back.  Was glad to find this on here....very nice scent,  warm and spicy.  I love it!  Has great staying power too.</li>
            <li> Wife loved the new variation of Obsession. Subtle as compared to the original, but well worth the purchase.</li>

            <li> First off, I am very thankful to the merchant for shipping so quick. The package came in earlier than I had expected. Like their service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had ordered this as a tester bottle but i got a packaged bottle with caps. It is just as new (did not have a polythene cover on the box pack though, but i do not mind). Lucky me :) ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To speak of the perfume, it is just awesome. It seems to be a lasting perfume. The initial notes were very distinctive and spicy. Middle notes seemed to wear same notes as Burberry Weekender. I love the base notes, not overpowering and seems so fresh even after a couple of hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got more than what I had expected.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my sisters birthday, and she just loved the scent, not too light, but not to heavy.</li>
            <li> I love the original Obsession, but, was a bit disappointed in this version. Not lasting very long, but has a clean, fresh scent. Bottle was in original packaging, and not used very much, if at all.  Good bargain for the money.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for, the discounted price was a HUGE bonus.  Only wish the scent stayed with me a bit longer throughout the day.  Oh well, will just have to refresh!</li>
            <li> This perfume is a gorgeous combo of mulled wine, tropical tuberose, and incense. I find it perfect for autumn or winter. It&#x27;s sexy, but accesible. Plus its so cheap online.</li>
            <li> I put this on as soon as i unwrapped it.  I don&#x27;t have a clue how i missed this previously but its wonderful and alluring . Calvin Klein makes fragrances that keep their staying power and I am a loyal customer and will always be.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t LOVE it but it&#x27;s very nice if applied lightly.</li>
            <li> Thank you for offering this product at such a great  price. I love it. I am going to continue to purchase from this seller. If you have not tried this product I would encourage you to do so. If you can wear spicey parfums (parmum wearer you know what I am talking about) this one is a great one to buy.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this product since quite some time. We like its fragrance as it is soft and soothing. Lately my sister in law had her birthday. She had appreciated the fragrance on a number of occasions. Since she also liked this we thought it would be a good birth day gift. This was the best liked gift on that day and she immediately wore it. This gives such a soothing freshness that one can not avoid admiring it.</li>
            <li> Fragrance arrived in a short period of time so that&#x27;s fine.  I didn&#x27;t read anywhere that it was a tester without the cap so that was misleading.  I love the fragrance though.</li>
            <li> This fragrance has an ok aroma but I find that it&#x27;s not for me.  Secret obsession reminds me of a fragrance an older woman would like.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it does not smell horrible, hence the 3 stars; the notes remind me of something you&#x27;d smell on an older woman in her mid 40s. They&#x27;re not fresh and airy.  I&#x27;m almost 30 and Vera Wang&#x27;s Princess and Burberry&#x27;s The Beat are great fragrances for the younger crowd (my opinion).</li>
            <li> Perfect scent + Fast shipping + Excellent price point &#x3D; Winner! .....Amazon, please re-stock Secret Obsession by CKlein as soon as possible!</li>
            <li> Always get compliments when I wear this! I love it!</li>
            <li> The dispenser is really a cool design. Thought I might finad a jeannie in the bottle when i removed the top. The fragrance is light, soft and sexy. Several people have asked what perfume I was weraing. So ladies if you are looking for something a little different that is  wonderful for a night out on the town this is one you will enjoy!</li>
            <li> No offense. I love my grandma, but hated her perfume.  This is nothing like Obsession.  One spray and my wife said it smells like old lady perfume.  Bad move on my part. There you have it.</li>
            <li> Love this cool smell and i am looking forward of buying one more</li>
            <li> Love this scent and receive many compliments</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described.</li>
            <li> SO leaves an abstract gourmand impression without being a gourmand. SO is very much like a vanilla coca-cola or a rootbeer float. More specifically, to me it&#x27;s an A&amp;W ROOTBEER FLOAT. Yes, root beer &amp; vanilla ice cream in all it&#x27;s fizzy, frothy glory from top to bottom. SO isn&#x27;t about the notes &amp; progression, it&#x27;s about the impression it leaves. A gourmand without being a gourmand. Brilliant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO is very American &amp; very well-done. I pledge my love. It&#x27;s the oriental vanilla that I&#x27;m adopting for Fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO is misunderstood, and the thumbs-down reviews are not reflective of the fragrance. Rather, I think the thumb-downs are reflective of the disconnect between the fragrance and its advertising. SO is not sex-in-a-bottle and there is nothing come-hither about it. SO is a jeans &amp; sweater weather perfume, perfect for baking cookies or attending football games. SO is young &amp; up-beat but I think women in the middle would be most attracted to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word of warning. SO&#x27;s white florals are just on the edge of cloying for me, perhaps more so in heat. I have the same problem with florals in SO&#x27;s otherwise likable (but not as good) sister, CK Obsession Night Woman, which is unwearable in warm weather. SO is another one of the CK&#x27;s with hard-to-wear florals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside? Lasting power. Otherwise, SO would be SO perfect. I love SO but am so underwhelmed by the longevity. I&#x27;ve resorted to use SO in my scent bug, rather than on me. That may sound strange, but I love it this way!</li>
            <li> My daughter stated she put it on in the am and received many complaints on this, it held all day.  I would recommend it to anyone who like a great smell!</li>
            <li> I purchased this perfume at macys once for my wife.&lt;br /&gt;Nice and sensual fragrance but this time it wasn&#x27;t the case from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I truly was disappointed, there was no fragrance other than sort of alcohol metal like odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is the last time I purchase perfumes from Amazon or its vendors.</li>
            <li> The perfume is the best. I would recommended to any one. I got it for my mother and my daughter.</li>
            <li> Smells good on me !!!</li>
            <li> I was at my girlfriends house and noticed on her dresser &amp;#34;Secret Obsession&amp;#34; .. I, of course had to test the smell on me.  Wow it was great.  So I ordered it.  I must say , though, I absolutely love the bottle!!</li>
            <li> This scent is like no other!  One spray on my neck and wrist and I am good for the entire day and evening!  Yummy!</li>
            <li> The Secret to Secret Obsession is this:  It smells just like Suntan Lotion mixed with Deep Woods Off.  I expected something similar to original Obsession, but it&#x27;s nothing like it.  Keeps the mosquitos away though.</li>
            <li> smells good. honey likes it,</li>
            <li> Good product, good price, ladies love it.</li>
            <li> Out look is good but I didn&#x27;t like it&#x27;s smell</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume and could not believe the price. The package came on time and securely wrapped.  I was very pleased. This perfume smells so so good.  I get complements all the time how wonderful I smell.</li>
            <li> received as expected. great condition</li>
            <li> This is an Amazing Scent!!!! I am so happy I found it here. I have been looking everywhere for it.</li>
            <li> Secret Obsession is my favorite scent of all time. It has been such a sad thing that it is longer available in stores. I was so delighted to find it on Amazon, to order and to have it in my hands in 2 days! Such happiness!</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful.  Lots of compliments. Husband loves it.  Need I say more?</li>
            <li> perfume must be old or lost its potency some how. I cant tell I have it on within 10 minutes. Ripped off!</li>
            <li> my mother loves this scent and it was a better price on Amazon than anywhere else I looked.</li>
            <li> Secret is soft, and quiet, but I like for nights.</li>
