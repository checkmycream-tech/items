            <li>Pat your face and neck with warm water.  </li>
            <li>Oh, and did I mention it smells REALLY good? :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like it better if it had organic ingredients.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>For more reviews check out pimples and wrinkles online.</li>
            <li>Rub the bristles all over your neck and face (Make sure you twist the product close before doing this, so that you don&#x27;t accidentally squeeze more out)  Step 4:</li>
            <li>The price here is much better than in stores which makes it even better.</li>
            <li>I do recommend the mask for damaged hair :)</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this cleanser, and even moreso, the scrubber.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I loved this so much</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had nice success with this product.</li>
            <li>I loved that the smell wasn&#x27;t overwhelming, but still smelled clean and gentle.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find it since and had to result to Amazon, but it&#x27;s worth it!  </li>
            <li>i love the cleaning brush my face felt clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>Gentle, but pretty good.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stung my sensitive skin, and it smells nice and not too strong.</li>
            <li>It makes the daunting task of washing my face much easier and faster and generally more convenient.</li>
            <li>Afterwards, I rinse the gel off with cool water to close the pores and finish with an astringent.</li>
            <li>To start, the packaging looks cool</li>
            <li>If you like a nice, deep clean this is for you.</li>
            <li>I bought this product on a whim, as I already use Garnier for my haircare and thought it might be worth a shot on my skin.</li>
            <li>Take the Radiance Moisture Cream and dab it on your face and neck and continue rubbing until it is evenly absorbed all over your skin  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry or greasy, doesn&#x27;t have any obnoxious perfume, and removes a full face of makeup with amazing ease.  </li>
            <li>Threw it right away in the trash.</li>
            <li>Most cleansers I&#x27;ve tried have either been too oily (they cause my pores to clog or they generally irritate my skin), or too drying (causing tightness and wrinkling).  </li>
            <li>I love the garnier products in general</li>
            <li>The bristles for the brush are actually rubber, and gently glide across your skin and effectively remove any dirt, oil, or impurities.</li>
            <li>The cleanser doesn&#x27;t really foam much, and it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s getting my skin clean.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it, upon drying, my face felt amazingly soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I love this facial cleaner!  </li>
            <li>You actually do notice a difference after the first use, again after the first week or two, and if you continue using it the results are stunning.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely one of my favorite products.</li>
            <li>This will clean out your pores, the before and after is undeniable and my skin feels very soft after I use this product.  </li>
            <li>My skin felt soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>Even after the cleansing liquid is used up, the scrubber works great for whatever other facial cleansers you might have lying around.</li>
            <li>Seriously, this is the best facial product I have ever used!</li>
            <li>It left my skin so smooth, soft, and clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy enough for even HIM to use!</li>
            <li>On to the cleanser...although there seem to be some positive user reviews I have read of the product, I really was not a fan.</li>
            <li>(If you&#x27;re only going to do it once, I suggest doing it at night) and you&#x27;ll notice a HUGE change in your skin after about a week.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle on my skin</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really pour out, it&#x27;s a gel</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this cleanser.</li>
            <li>The rubber bristles really help to aid in removing dirt and grime from your skin.</li>
            <li>I did not see  an improve on my skin that much but is a cleaning / cleanser product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even gentle when used with beaded cleansers.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t think it would work any better than any other drug store cleanser</li>
            <li>(Wet face with warm water first to open the pores)</li>
            <li>The brush on the top isn&#x27;t really a brush as much as it is a disk with little silicon flanges poking out of it.  </li>
            <li>Once you&#x27;ve gone over your skin several times, let it sit for about 30 seconds  Step 5: Wash the cleanser off with warm water, then pat it dry with a towel  Step 6:</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and tend to have to stay on the side of \\&quot;gentle exfoliating\\&quot;, but they do make it sound like this is gentle enough for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The brush is so soft, it doesn&#x27;t feel as if it can really be exfoliating, although scrubbing under the eyes feels envigorating.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve now been using the Brusher Gel Cleanser in conjunction with the Gel Moisturizer for about 3 months, and my skin is improving so much - my skin is so soft and getting clearer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the inconvenience of being an Add-on Item only.</li>
            <li>and I believe prevents new ones.</li>
            <li>I have found my new favourite face wash.</li>
            <li>This product has made my skin look brand new and feel soft as a baby&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>From a distance, my skin was very clear but up close I knew it could improve.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>feels different when you used it for the first time but</li>
            <li>I think what makes this different than other products is only the application system, which is nice.</li>
            <li>The brush is soft enough that it gently cleans yet stimulates one&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>it probably did not suit my sensitive skin...</li>
            <li>My skin, though generally clear, has always been extremely sensitive, both to beauty products and to environmental irritants.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft now, the ingredients are not drying at all.</li>
            <li>Yet, it&#x27;s gentle enough to use in the morning and at night.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t use it every day just because I use Purity as a daily and really like that.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are so soft and make my face feel so soft, you can feel the beads in it working as your cleaning you face.  </li>
            <li>I did not really feel like the gel can deep clean on my skin..</li>
            <li>Outside of that, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I have liked Garnier Cleansers of times past but have had a hard time finding one I like right now within their current collection.</li>
            <li>This little brush not only managed to clean off my skin, but it also got off all the foundation I was wearing throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>This is a great facial cleanser, but for some reason it is very difficult to find in the stores.  </li>
            <li>After having been blessed with nearly 40 years of the sort of skin that makes strangers stop me and ask me what products I use to maintain my complexion, my luck has finally begun to wear out.  </li>
            <li>I did not really feel like the gel did much of anything and the packaging made me feel sort of jipped with the contents, add that to my discontent with the brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had very clear skin and never really bothered washing my face because it was very naturally balanced, but I did have some blackheads on my nose and larger pores around the bridge of my nose.</li>
            <li>With the low price of this cleanser with its gimmicky brush, I figured it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li>It get rids of makeup completely, there&#x27;s no residue whatsoever and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.</li>
            <li>The past few years, tiny wrinkles on my brow, and around my eyes and nose have become a bit more pronounced.  </li>
            <li>The massaging tool on the top was a little weird and took a while to get used to, but I did notice that my skin looked much cleared and nicer after using the product.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed smaller pores &amp; cleaner pores but it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> But the disappearance of the small bumps above my nose and on my chin a few days later proved that it really was working as promised, without overdrying.  </li>
            <li> There was no dryness at all, and this is something I have been searching for in a product for a long time.</li>
            <li> I got a bottle which was completely empty but had some sticky stuff on the outside.</li>
            <li> It gets rid of minor blemishes</li>
            <li> only so guess what this is what you get , the only reason I give 4 starts is because the cap is hard to use it</li>
            <li> I encourage anyone curious to buy this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff works well to use as a deep cleanser a few times a week.</li>
            <li> neck(A little goes a long way)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to start trying other Garnier skincare products.</li>
            <li> The gel cleanser doesn&#x27;t provide a lot of foam during scrubbing, so the first few times I used it, I was afraid I wasn&#x27;t cleansing my skin deeply enough.  </li>

            <li> it probably did not suit my sensitive skin... was expecting a lot from this product but i think it over-exfoliated my skin. The gel doesn&#x27;t come out properly from the cavity... but i would like to try its micro-bead version in future.</li>
            <li> After having been blessed with nearly 40 years of the sort of skin that makes strangers stop me and ask me what products I use to maintain my complexion, my luck has finally begun to wear out.  My skin, though generally clear, has always been extremely sensitive, both to beauty products and to environmental irritants.  The past few years, tiny wrinkles on my brow, and around my eyes and nose have become a bit more pronounced.  Most cleansers I&#x27;ve tried have either been too oily (they cause my pores to clog or they generally irritate my skin), or too drying (causing tightness and wrinkling).  With the low price of this cleanser with its gimmicky brush, I figured it was worth a try.  The first time I used it, upon drying, my face felt amazingly soft and smooth.  But I remained skeptical until I had used it regularly for about a week.  Still, I had no irritation at all.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry or greasy, doesn&#x27;t have any obnoxious perfume, and removes a full face of makeup with amazing ease.  The brush is so soft, it doesn&#x27;t feel as if it can really be exfoliating, although scrubbing under the eyes feels envigorating.  The gel cleanser doesn&#x27;t provide a lot of foam during scrubbing, so the first few times I used it, I was afraid I wasn&#x27;t cleansing my skin deeply enough.  But the disappearance of the small bumps above my nose and on my chin a few days later proved that it really was working as promised, without overdrying.  This is a really wonderful product at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle on my skin but I&#x27;m not seeing any extra benefits from using it. There&#x27;s nothing revolutionary about the facial brush and that&#x27;s a lot of plastic for one container. I&#x27;d like it better if it had organic ingredients. I&#x27;m going to stick with Burt&#x27;s Bees, Kiss My Face and Cetaphil.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. It makes the daunting task of washing my face much easier and faster and generally more convenient. I&#x27;ve always had very clear skin and never really bothered washing my face because it was very naturally balanced, but I did have some blackheads on my nose and larger pores around the bridge of my nose. From a distance, my skin was very clear but up close I knew it could improve. This product has made my skin look brand new and feel soft as a baby&#x27;s! And it&#x27;s so inexpensive. Seriously, this is the best facial product I have ever used!</li>
            <li> This product is excelent and i love it! I usually get allergic reaction using other brand but this one is awesome!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really had bad skin, but this winter had my face having bouts of extremely dry skin. I bought this product on a whim, as I already use Garnier for my haircare and thought it might be worth a shot on my skin. I absolutely love it. It left my skin so smooth, soft, and clean. I loved that the smell wasn&#x27;t overwhelming, but still smelled clean and gentle. There was no dryness at all, and this is something I have been searching for in a product for a long time. I know that this cleanser comes in microbead form in addition to this gel form, but I actually prefer the gel. Unlike some people, I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the brush or bottle. The bristles for the brush are actually rubber, and gently glide across your skin and effectively remove any dirt, oil, or impurities. I loved this so much I&#x27;m going to start trying other Garnier skincare products.</li>
            <li> This product (Garnier Brusher) was on sale at CVS, so I gave it a try. I hope it never goes out of production.&lt;br /&gt;Some have complained about turning the bottle upside down to dispense the cleanser. I don&#x27;t get what the problem is... I turn the bottle sideways so the amount being squeezed out can be seen. It doesn&#x27;t really pour out, it&#x27;s a gel so what comes out stays inside the bristles. Anyway, once the gel is in the bristles - you just scrub your face with it. (Wet face with warm water first to open the pores) It feels really good and massages the skin. Afterwards, I rinse the gel off with cool water to close the pores and finish with an astringent. My skin feels so soft now, the ingredients are not drying at all. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;My husband&#x27;s facial skin has always been a problem. He&#x27;s a plumber and he never seemed to cleanse his face properly. He tried the Garnier Brusher and what an improvement in his skin! It&#x27;s easy enough for even HIM to use! It scrubs out all the dirt from his pores, nooks and crannies. What a blessing!!!!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this cleanser. I have liked Garnier Cleansers of times past but have had a hard time finding one I like right now within their current collection. To start, the packaging looks cool but I found the brush irritating to my skin. Granted I have very sensitive skin and tend to have to stay on the side of \\&quot;gentle exfoliating\\&quot;, but they do make it sound like this is gentle enough for sensitive skin so I tried it.  On to the cleanser...although there seem to be some positive user reviews I have read of the product, I really was not a fan. I did not really feel like the gel did much of anything and the packaging made me feel sort of jipped with the contents, add that to my discontent with the brush. So sadly I will take a pass. For more reviews check out pimples and wrinkles online.</li>
            <li> I love this facial cleaner!  Best I&#x27;ve found!</li>
            <li> You actually do notice a difference after the first use, again after the first week or two, and if you continue using it the results are stunning. The rubber bristles really help to aid in removing dirt and grime from your skin. Yet, it&#x27;s gentle enough to use in the morning and at night.I encourage anyone curious to buy this product. You won&#x27;t regret it.    I like to couple mine with the \\&quot;Skin Renew- Radiance Moisture Cream.\\&quot; For those of you who are unsure how to use this to your best advantage, I&#x27;ll tell you how:    Step 1: Pat your face and neck with warm water.  Step 2: Take the cleanser, twist it open, place the bristles against your skin and squeeze the contents onto your face and neck(A little goes a long way)  Step 3: Rub the bristles all over your neck and face (Make sure you twist the product close before doing this, so that you don&#x27;t accidentally squeeze more out)  Step 4: Once you&#x27;ve gone over your skin several times, let it sit for about 30 seconds  Step 5: Wash the cleanser off with warm water, then pat it dry with a towel  Step 6: Take the Radiance Moisture Cream and dab it on your face and neck and continue rubbing until it is evenly absorbed all over your skin  YOU&#x27;RE DONE!    I would say to do this at least once a day (If you&#x27;re only going to do it once, I suggest doing it at night) and you&#x27;ll notice a HUGE change in your skin after about a week. It&#x27;s definitely one of my favorite products. Oh, and did I mention it smells REALLY good? :)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe what a great product this is.  I really didn&#x27;t think it would work any better than any other drug store cleanser but it does.  I use it when I need a good pore cleaning, about once a week, I don&#x27;t use it every day just because I use Purity as a daily and really like that.  This will clean out your pores, the before and after is undeniable and my skin feels very soft after I use this product.  I have very sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I like this cleanser. It doesn&#x27;t stung my sensitive skin, and it smells nice and not too strong. The only thing I wish is that the brushed part was detachable.</li>
            <li> This is a great facial cleanser, but for some reason it is very difficult to find in the stores.  Glad to have found a source on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I got a bottle which was completely empty but had some sticky stuff on the outside. Threw it right away in the trash.</li>
            <li> The Garnier Brusher Gel Cleanser sounds like such a silly gimmick.  The brush on the top isn&#x27;t really a brush as much as it is a disk with little silicon flanges poking out of it.  The cleanser doesn&#x27;t really foam much, and it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s getting my skin clean.  Then I rinse my face:  epiphany moment.  This little brush not only managed to clean off my skin, but it also got off all the foundation I was wearing throughout the day.  My skin felt soft and clean.  I&#x27;ve now been using the Brusher Gel Cleanser in conjunction with the Gel Moisturizer for about 3 months, and my skin is improving so much - my skin is so soft and getting clearer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one gripe I have with this brusher is getting the soap out of it to use - if you store it upright, it sometimes can be difficult to squeeze out the soap.  I started storing it upside down and it helps a little, but be prepared to squeeze a little to dispense the soap.  Outside of that, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> i love the cleaning brush my face felt clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find it hard to use like some of the other reviewers said. The massaging tool on the top was a little weird and took a while to get used to, but I did notice that my skin looked much cleared and nicer after using the product. The price here is much better than in stores which makes it even better.</li>
            <li> I like it smells good feels different when you used it for the first time but after that is great I did not see  an improve on my skin that much but is a cleaning / cleanser product only so guess what this is what you get , the only reason I give 4 starts is because the cap is hard to use it that&#x27;s all but is not a big deal;but I love the garnier products in general I do recommend the mask for damaged hair :)</li>
            <li> Using this has improved the quality of my skin greatly. I absolutely love this cleanser, and even moreso, the scrubber. Even after the cleansing liquid is used up, the scrubber works great for whatever other facial cleansers you might have lying around. It&#x27;s even gentle when used with beaded cleansers. Definitely worth the inconvenience of being an Add-on Item only. Don&#x27;t let any of it get in your eyes though, it hurts like a mother.</li>
            <li> I bought this when it was in stores and I absolutely love it.  I haven&#x27;t been able to find it since and had to result to Amazon, but it&#x27;s worth it!  My face loves it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product &amp; will be ordering again!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had nice success with this product. The brush is soft enough that it gently cleans yet stimulates one&#x27;s skin. I&#x27;ve noticed smaller pores &amp; cleaner pores but it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff works well to use as a deep cleanser a few times a week. It gets rid of minor blemishes and I believe prevents new ones. It has salityc acid in it, which is standard. I think what makes this different than other products is only the application system, which is nice.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing face wash! It get rids of makeup completely, there&#x27;s no residue whatsoever and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin. I will definitely buy again. I have found my new favourite face wash.</li>
            <li> A friend with a skin care business suggested this when I was in a cast for almost four months. Very hard to wash the face with one hand! Now I&#x27;m hooked. Gentle, but pretty good. And idiot proof!</li>
            <li> I like some of the  Garnier products , but not this brusher gel cleanser,  I did not really feel like the gel can deep clean on my skin..</li>
            <li> Favorite face wash ever!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleaner for a while now and I love it.  The bristles are so soft and make my face feel so soft, you can feel the beads in it working as your cleaning you face.  If you like a nice, deep clean this is for you.</li>
