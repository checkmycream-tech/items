            <li>This is one of the exceptional soaps that are available.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of this soap, although it doesn&#x27;t have a very strong cedar scent.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more of a once in a while purchase</li>
            <li>The smell of this soap is outstanding.  </li>
            <li>you are a guy and looking to pamper yourself a bit, but you do NOT want to smell like Bath and Body Works latest floral abomination</li>
            <li>My favorite soap of all time.</li>
            <li>The overall scent is very pleasant, however, and I like it a lot.</li>
            <li>Smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>This soap simply smells incredible.  </li>
            <li>clean, very clean.</li>
            <li>strong unique scent.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>As someone already mentioned, it felt like cheap hotel soap.</li>
            <li>This garbage is already making my skin peel from dryness and it smells just like the cheap motel soap.</li>
            <li>Not as great as juniper ridge, but close enough for the price.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells so great whomever shares a bathroom with you is bound to try this and keep using it, I suggest dry lock-boxing it for storage after every time you shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To many it may be a bit harder to handle, to many others it may be very easy.</li>
            <li>It has a strong odor in the shower but leaves your skin with a very pleasant and subtle odor of cedarwood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall good soap.</li>
            <li>My husband and I both use it; on him it smells manly, on me it smells fresh and sweet.</li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t even need to wear cologne because it&#x27;s that strong.</li>
            <li>We definitely will order more &amp; recommend to everyone!</li>
            <li>Masculine smell the wife will love.  </li>
            <li>My only gripe is that it makes my skin feel kind of &amp;#34;waxy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>My husband loves this soap, it keeps him smelling fresh all day.  </li>
            <li>It also smells great, and is all natural enough for my hippy mom.</li>
            <li>right here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin which is nice too</li>
            <li>Only upside was the scent, but you had to literally cake yourself in the thing if you wanted to smell like it for an hour at most, otherwise you&#x27;ll just smell musty all day.</li>
            <li>It has a sweet and soothing aroma, gentle on the skin, stays fragrant to the very end, does not crack, and can be used up to a paper-thin level.</li>
            <li>Good soap but hardly a Cedar scent</li>
            <li>Either way, it still provides a very creamy lather and cleanses and rinses</li>
            <li>Should last quite some time and everyone can enjoy it from start to finish.</li>
            <li>soap changed my whole life around.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep a ready supply of this soap on hand.  </li>
            <li>It really lathers up well.</li>
            <li>Nice scent good on body but drying bad for beard dries it out immediately</li>
            <li>This smells less like wood and more like Axe cologne or body wash, which is my mind</li>
            <li>And by strong I mean strong as far as soaps go, you aren&#x27;t going to have people coughing and gagging just by the smell</li>
            <li>Yes, it can leave your skin feeling a little dry, but put some lotion on and you&#x27;ll be delighted at the way your skin smells all day.</li>
            <li>I like this soap so much that I buy two at a time to be certain I won&#x27;t run out before the next delivery.</li>
            <li>I expected more from something with such a well-designed box.</li>
            <li>But for as rarely as I do bathe, the scent lasts very long.</li>
            <li>If you want it to last, keep it out of the public shower as your son will use it up quickly.</li>
            <li>Soft on skin.</li>
            <li>The scent is wonderfully masculine, the way SHAVING soap is supposed to be.</li>
            <li>is no where near rugged and wood scented.</li>
            <li>subtle fragrance whcih is okay.....</li>
            <li>but not sure if it is worth hte expense</li>
            <li>Women, of all ages, races, creeds, and social strata, are drawn to me like flies to honey when I actually do get around to bathing.</li>

            <li> a small side effect that is my advantage.</li>
            <li> A horrible artificial fake perfume smell, nothing like the clean scent  of cedar, and the box was old and worn.  </li>
            <li> bad they only have 5 stars</li>
            <li> may be addicted to this soap now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of natural and wood scented soaps and this is the worst I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, its smells like nothing when in use and dries your skin out.</li>
            <li> lame</li>
            <li> The scent does not stay with you, and it dries out my skin terribly.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I would not recommend this product, and feel this purchase was a big mistake!  A horrible artificial fake perfume smell, nothing like the clean scent  of cedar, and the box was old and worn.  I bought it as a gift and had to throw it away rather than deal with the hassle and expense of returning it.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells so great whomever shares a bathroom with you is bound to try this and keep using it, I suggest dry lock-boxing it for storage after every time you shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. don&#x27;t forget to scrub those folds!</li>
            <li> I like this soap so much that I buy two at a time to be certain I won&#x27;t run out before the next delivery.</li>
            <li> not what I wanted. I wanted soap that had a smell of redwood. This does not</li>
            <li> Smells great in the box. Unfortunately, its smells like nothing when in use and dries your skin out.</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING!!!  The fragrance/scent is appealing to both male/female.....TOTALLY aromatic, sensory healing properties---LOVE IT!!!!!!  We definitely will order more &amp; recommend to everyone!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic. It&#x27;s amazing in the sense that the smell lingers with you throughout the day. You really don&#x27;t even need to wear cologne because it&#x27;s that strong. And by strong I mean strong as far as soaps go, you aren&#x27;t going to have people coughing and gagging just by the smell but if someone goes in for a hug they&#x27;ll notice your manly smell. My wife loves it and wishes I wore it 24/7 but at $9 a pop it&#x27;s more of a once in a while purchase</li>
            <li> This soap smells so amazing! It actually smells like just cut cedar wood! I will be purchasing again!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank You!</li>
            <li> Mmmm. This smells like a lumberjack should.</li>
            <li> This is one of the exceptional soaps that are available. A very nice cedar wood scent it there and stays throughout a shower and beyond. The only little down side is the square shape. To many it may be a bit harder to handle, to many others it may be very easy. Either way, it still provides a very creamy lather and cleanses and rinses clean, very clean. Should last quite some time and everyone can enjoy it from start to finish. People that are outdoors all the time - GET IT!!</li>
            <li> As someone already mentioned, it felt like cheap hotel soap. Didn&#x27;t clean very well, rather left a thin film of soap scum on your skin, making it feel rubbery yet still with a film of filth from your day. Only upside was the scent, but you had to literally cake yourself in the thing if you wanted to smell like it for an hour at most, otherwise you&#x27;ll just smell musty all day.</li>
            <li> The other reviews have to be written by people who have never tried the product or people that work for the company. This garbage is already making my skin peel from dryness and it smells just like the cheap motel soap. Not even a hint of cedar. Save your money.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this soap, although it doesn&#x27;t have a very strong cedar scent.  The overall scent is very pleasant, however, and I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> Best smelling soap. Scientific fact. Women, of all ages, races, creeds, and social strata, are drawn to me like flies to honey when I actually do get around to bathing. But for as rarely as I do bathe, the scent lasts very long. Couple days. I feel like such a man when I wear this soap. It&#x27;s so manly, my dad started talking to me again, and he doesn&#x27;t seem so ashamed of me nowadays.&lt;br /&gt;This soap changed my whole life around.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep a ready supply of this soap on hand.  It has a sweet and soothing aroma, gentle on the skin, stays fragrant to the very end, does not crack, and can be used up to a paper-thin level.</li>
            <li> smells great in the shower but once you rinse your body...you rinse away the smell as well.... lame</li>
            <li> Product as asked. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Smells pretty good. Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin which is nice too</li>
            <li> The best cedar soap out there! 5th repeat purchase. Starting to think I&#x27;m lumbersexual (That&#x27;s actually a term).</li>
            <li> Good soap but hardly a Cedar scent</li>
            <li> Masculine smell the wife will love.  I feel like my beard is growing a bit faster; a small side effect that is my advantage.</li>
            <li> Smells great!  Bought as stocking stuffers and they were the perfect gift for the important men in my life!</li>
            <li> Excellent fragrance. Soft on skin.</li>
            <li> So, the grocery store where I&#x27;m employed has carried this soap for some time, I just had yet to take the plunge. The scent is wonderfully masculine, the way SHAVING soap is supposed to be. Leave the electric taurus turds and chemical goop alone, grab a razor and phyuck with this.</li>
            <li> This product is awful, don&#x27;t be fooled by the nice packaging and the smell in the box. The scent does not stay with you, and it dries out my skin terribly. This is not worth $10.</li>
            <li> The smell of this soap is outstanding.  Sort of woodsy and spicy.  If you want it to last, keep it out of the public shower as your son will use it up quickly.</li>
            <li> Best cedarwood soap I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> subtle fragrance whcih is okay..... but not sure if it is worth hte expense</li>
            <li> strong unique scent.  Great as a room freshener as well as a great soap.  My son loves this and it lathers well.</li>
            <li> Great smell, good price. My only gripe is that it makes my skin feel kind of &amp;#34;waxy&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ve used other cedar soaps that don&#x27;t make my skin feel that way. Overall good soap. Not as great as juniper ridge, but close enough for the price.</li>
            <li> Nice scent good on body but drying bad for beard dries it out immediately</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of natural and wood scented soaps and this is the worst I&#x27;ve purchased. I expected more from something with such a well-designed box. This smells less like wood and more like Axe cologne or body wash, which is my mind is no where near rugged and wood scented.</li>
            <li> This soap simply smells incredible.  It has a strong odor in the shower but leaves your skin with a very pleasant and subtle odor of cedarwood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may be addicted to this soap now, I had to shower without it the other day and I seriously felt like the shower wasn&#x27;t nearly as nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a guy and looking to pamper yourself a bit, but you do NOT want to smell like Bath and Body Works latest floral abomination, this is the ticket right here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also my fiancee LOVES the smell.</li>
            <li> My favorite soap of all time. Yes, it can leave your skin feeling a little dry, but put some lotion on and you&#x27;ll be delighted at the way your skin smells all day. My husband and I both use it; on him it smells manly, on me it smells fresh and sweet.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this soap, it keeps him smelling fresh all day.  It smells great in bed.  It really lathers up well.</li>
            <li> Got it to replace some uber-manly soap that my step dad had in his bathroom. This soap was uber-manly enough to replace it. He, and I quote &amp;#34;Loved it&amp;#34; - my mom.  It also smells great, and is all natural enough for my hippy mom.</li>
            <li> Lather: 10/10&lt;br /&gt;Clean: 10/10&lt;br /&gt;Smell: 10/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad they only have 5 stars</li>
            <li> Great smell, great lather without overkill!</li>
