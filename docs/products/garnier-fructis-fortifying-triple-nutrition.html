            <li>I love how good my hair smells after getting out of the shower.</li>
            <li>This is what you need; a spraying plastic bottle, 70% of water for the bottle, some this conditioner, rose hip oil, Garnier Anti-Frizz Serum, and Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li>Smells nice</li>

            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>:) I have since bought more of this, and I will keep doing so.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that this works on my hair (course and curly)</li>
            <li>I tell you this made my hair shinier, more moisturized but bouncy than anything I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>This conditioner made sure I don&#x27;t have to.</li>
            <li>The slip is OUTSTANDING, smells great, and my curls are very defined.</li>
            <li>I hope this helps others that have the problems I did :)</li>
            <li>It is not tangled any more.</li>
            <li>This is the best conditioner I have found in a LONG time!  </li>
            <li>I strongly suggest this to curly haired 3A-4C hair type...</li>
            <li>The shampoo is fine but it is not what i needed.</li>
            <li>: I won&#x27;t recommend for those looking for volumizing, people with fine hair, etc.</li>
            <li>The scent is strongly acidic citrus, as if to match the rich texture.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is the best so far for my natural kinky 4b hair type.</li>
            <li>Oh, it is also really cheap.</li>
            <li>Great mixed with oil for pre poo.</li>
            <li>I bought this product at walgreens as an accident, and im so happy i finally found this product to add to my hair regimen!</li>
            <li>This conditioner by far is one of my favorite conditioners, along with aphogee&#x27;s keratin reconstructor and organic root stimulator replenshing conditioner!</li>
            <li>Getting to the point that I was spending so much time and more $ than I care to admit was a bane in my existence.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more than pleased at finding such a cheap HG keeper!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It does fade quickly, though.</li>
            <li>I use this as a co-wash - putting the conditioner on the ends and leaving it there while I wash my roots and scalp with a mild shampoo.</li>
            <li>so my hair is super curly.</li>
            <li>and it quickly damaged me and my daughters hair.</li>
            <li>Its falling out, split end are forming as quickly as I can get them cut off and its tangled as soon as I brush it.</li>
            <li>price point is super awesome.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very very frizzy hair, I have bought just about every product at the salon and the store but without using a lot of product, nothing works!</li>
            <li>After washing it out, my hair was STILLL easy to detangle and very manageable.</li>
            <li>Works really well!!</li>
            <li>My hair is shiny, super soft, healthy in appearance,  &amp; no frizz or flyaways.</li>
            <li>It smells great, helps define curls due to being highly moisturizing, and cheap as you can get.</li>
            <li>Its so shiny but not greasy and smells like fresh oranges.</li>
            <li>Great conditioner, left my color-treated hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Actually, Garnier Fructis has great products in general.  </li>
            <li>Alot of products dry out my hair but with this conditioner and garnier fructis hairspray my hair looks shiny and healthy!</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft, shiny and easy to style.</li>
            <li>I have tried almost every common brand of conditioner, and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>I have only use this product once, but so far so good.  </li>
            <li>Keratase, Biolage, Triple Moisture, hot oil treatments,  Sebastian, Aphogee, and every product known to man for &amp;#34;ethnic&amp;#34; hair..</li>
            <li>but I have been consistently using this for months.</li>
            <li>Great price and last long...</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>By this point, I had 3-4&amp;#34; left of damage, but couldn&#x27;t bring myself to cut any more.</li>
            <li>Packaging needs to be a little more secure...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many kinds of shampoos and conditioners before but in most cases, just after starting to use them, my hair would become dry and start to form split ends.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see breakage hair any more, and my hair looks healthy and thick.</li>
            <li>This product is just what I expected, and the subscribe and save option makes it very easy for me.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is magical and I would recommend this to anyone with frizzy, dry, or thirsty hair.</li>
            <li>Usually I stay away from Garnier products because of my experience with the color treated line they had, but they really did good with this.</li>
            <li>SO MUCH.</li>
            <li>and I use this as co-wash, which just means I wash my hair without shampoo and I find this product to be very moisturizing and it leaves my hair very manageable so that I can detangle my hair with ease.</li>
            <li>Yum.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need much to get it all over your hair.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to spend too much to get your hair looking</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>, this is so much</li>
            <li>I have long, straight fine hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After the first use, my hair was so soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>The conditioner does its job detangling my long hair, the primary reason I use it.  </li>
            <li>My second purchase of the same and love the fruity smell.</li>
            <li>and i highly recommend for any race.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;Ordering</li>
            <li>Makes my hair really soft!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a natural headed gal with 4B hair that get extremely dry very quick</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel normal.</li>
            <li>I went right away and bought a bottle...and haven&#x27;t looked back.</li>
            <li>The only thing I really dislike is the smell, very chemicallyâ€¦and they try to cover it with fruity scents buuttt I can smell through it</li>
            <li>My curls drink it up and becomes very soft and springy.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel great, and it&#x27;s so thick and not runny like other conditioners.</li>
            <li>My fried locks feel SO soft!  </li>
            <li>I usually put some leave-in conditioner, but I passed on it after feeling how smooth my hair was!</li>
            <li>This will be replacing the other expensive brands in my collection because it works the best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve went through expensive products such as phyto and redken and its not as good as the garnier fructis triple nutrition conditioner!</li>
            <li>I am African American, with kinky curly hair that I relax, and this conditioner leaves my hair super silky and soft!  </li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to scents, that might be a bit overpowering.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair really soft.</li>
            <li>My hair was moisturized and soft.  </li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>I had this problem with my old conditioner.</li>
            <li>I wear my hair natural, type 4 curls.</li>
            <li>old &amp;#34;bumble&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I went with this though, because it&#x27;s thick and creamy.  </li>
            <li>I love that the garnier fructis conditioners are creamy and thick.</li>
            <li>My new growth lays down, and forms pretty waves from this conditioner, and I also use this on my daughter&#x27;s hair!  </li>
            <li>It is subtle and not over the top.</li>
            <li>This conditioner in particular is used on my hair daily and all i can see is my hair is left soft and detangled!!</li>
            <li>I really wanted to try this out because during the summer my hair can get very, intensely dry.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t recommend this for people with fine hair-or at least use a minute amount.</li>
            <li>I used this for quite some time with conditioner and leave in conditioner and for a while it made my hair shiney and soft and then all of a sudden it turned on me</li>
            <li>Has a nice apple, faint smell.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner has just enough moisture to keep my hair strong and thick while not overloading it.</li>
            <li>I have had dry hair for a few years and tried to do many wayã„´ done for my dry hair.</li>
            <li>No single strand knots, no hair balls.</li>
            <li>As an added benefit, it also makes my hair feel more hydrated than usual without weighing down my hair and making it greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am AA with dry natural 3C/4A hair.  </li>
            <li>it comes to conditioners, thick is better than watered down.</li>
            <li>Once a month I use a different shampoo though, other than the one that is related to this particular conditioner, just to freshen it up.</li>

            <li> My second purchase of the same and love the fruity smell.</li>
            <li> and i highly recommend for any race.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;Ordering</li>
            <li> Makes my hair really soft!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural headed gal with 4B hair that get extremely dry very quick</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel normal.</li>
            <li> I went right away and bought a bottle...and haven&#x27;t looked back.</li>
            <li> The only thing I really dislike is the smell, very chemicallyâ€¦and they try to cover it with fruity scents buuttt I can smell through it</li>
            <li> My curls drink it up and becomes very soft and springy.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel great, and it&#x27;s so thick and not runny like other conditioners.</li>
            <li> My fried locks feel SO soft!  </li>
            <li> I usually put some leave-in conditioner, but I passed on it after feeling how smooth my hair was!</li>
            <li> This will be replacing the other expensive brands in my collection because it works the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve went through expensive products such as phyto and redken and its not as good as the garnier fructis triple nutrition conditioner!</li>
            <li> I am African American, with kinky curly hair that I relax, and this conditioner leaves my hair super silky and soft!  </li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to scents, that might be a bit overpowering.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair really soft.</li>
            <li> My hair was moisturized and soft.  </li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> I had this problem with my old conditioner.</li>
            <li> I wear my hair natural, type 4 curls.</li>
            <li> old &amp;#34;bumble&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I went with this though, because it&#x27;s thick and creamy.  </li>
            <li> I love that the garnier fructis conditioners are creamy and thick.</li>
            <li> My new growth lays down, and forms pretty waves from this conditioner, and I also use this on my daughter&#x27;s hair!  </li>
            <li> It is subtle and not over the top.</li>
            <li> This conditioner in particular is used on my hair daily and all i can see is my hair is left soft and detangled!!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to try this out because during the summer my hair can get very, intensely dry.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t recommend this for people with fine hair-or at least use a minute amount.</li>
            <li> I used this for quite some time with conditioner and leave in conditioner and for a while it made my hair shiney and soft and then all of a sudden it turned on me</li>
            <li> Has a nice apple, faint smell.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner has just enough moisture to keep my hair strong and thick while not overloading it.</li>
            <li> I have had dry hair for a few years and tried to do many wayã„´ done for my dry hair.</li>
            <li> No single strand knots, no hair balls.</li>
            <li> As an added benefit, it also makes my hair feel more hydrated than usual without weighing down my hair and making it greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am AA with dry natural 3C/4A hair.  </li>
            <li> it comes to conditioners, thick is better than watered down.</li>
            <li> Once a month I use a different shampoo though, other than the one that is related to this particular conditioner, just to freshen it up.</li>
            <li> if your hair is dry, damaged or in a need for a little TLC i would highly recommend this!  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t bore anyone with stuff everyone already said, but for natural ladies who like rocking mini twists and don&#x27;t want to be all day taking them down -- applying this product, water, and using a denman or denman-knock off will instantly detangle hair like a dream.  </li>
            <li> she has long blonde hair</li>
            <li> It is really moisturizing due to the oils and might weight hair down.</li>
            <li> keeps my hair soft and moisturized without weighing it down with residue.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried a TON of different brands from cheap to expensive - and this is affordable.</li>
            <li> I like this bottle design that has a small raised bubble on the cap making it much easier to open when hands are wet and soapy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am usually a HUGE fan of garnier fructis products but this one was a fail for me..</li>
            <li> Something that would turn my bi-polar, fuzzy curls into long, flowing, botticelli locks with defined curls.  </li>
            <li> After leaving this on for about 5 minutes in the shower I rinsed and my hair felt silky and long.  </li>
            <li> Im now considering cutting my extremely long hair that I used to love because it is damaged all the way to the root.</li>
            <li> I have long hair that can tend to be dry, I am hoping to see an improvement in shine and sleekness.</li>
            <li> Garnier Fructis Triple Nutrition Conditioner is advertised for dry or damaged hair.</li>

            <li> I will start by saying that I am a Caucasian with 3a/3b, colored, dry &amp; damaged hair.</li>
            <li> While it did teach me, it did nothing for the dry damage.</li>

            <li> I have naturally curly and thick hair.</li>
            <li> I put a small amount in a spray bottle to spray in my hair on the 2nd day after washing it as I&#x27;m not able to wash daily or my hair will break and fall.  </li>

            <li> Garnier Fructis Triple Nutrition Conditioner is advertised for dry or damaged hair. I wouldn&#x27;t say my hair is damaged, but I do always think it&#x27;s a bit dry. The conditioner does its job detangling my long hair, the primary reason I use it.  As an added benefit, it also makes my hair feel more hydrated than usual without weighing down my hair and making it greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to conditioners, thick is better than watered down. Garnier is very thick -- thicker than any conditioner I&#x27;ve used in a long while.  The scent is strongly acidic citrus, as if to match the rich texture. If you are sensitive to scents, that might be a bit overpowering. It does fade quickly, though. I don&#x27;t notice it after I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> * Fructis Triple Nutrition, Can&#x27;t get enough of the great scent!  * For a gel shampoo, is not drying, but I still prefer a cream shampoo for moisture and hydration  * This worked fine and was happy that I still bought it!</li>
            <li> I have combination hair &amp; I&#x27;m also transitioning (meaning I got a permanent straightening treatment and now I&#x27;m growing out my hair and slowly cutting of the straightened ends.)I have 3 textures in my hair[3b,3c,4a](4 if you count the noodlely ends) I washed my hair with a sulfate shampoo to cleanse my scalp and my hair was like a Brillo pad. But when I put this stuff in, it was an instant transformation This conditioner is thick. Thicker than aussie&#x27;s moist conditioner[I swear by that] and let me tell you, It was a breeze detangling. No single strand knots, no hair balls. It was bliss. After washing it out, my hair was STILLL easy to detangle and very manageable. It&#x27;s like a gift from god. It makes my hair really soft. I love it. I use it to make my deep conditioning treatment. Usually I stay away from Garnier products because of my experience with the color treated line they had, but they really did good with this. I LOVE IT SO MUCH. I&#x27;m never gonna be without a bottle of this stuff ever. INVEST! INVEST!</li>
            <li> I really love this conditioner from Garnier Fructis. It leaves my hair soft, shiny and easy to style. Personally I would recommend all Garnier Fructis products because I use the mousse, hair spray as well as the shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t bore anyone with stuff everyone already said, but for natural ladies who like rocking mini twists and don&#x27;t want to be all day taking them down -- applying this product, water, and using a denman or denman-knock off will instantly detangle hair like a dream.  After I was done detangling, I kept the conditioner in for a deep conditioner treatment.  My hair was moisturized and soft.  The product can as well be used as prepoo, cowash, rinse out, and leave in.  Has a nice apple, faint smell.  I&#x27;ve bought 3 bottle definetly a staple!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE. Best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. Makes my hair feel great, and it&#x27;s so thick and not runny like other conditioners. Less goes further with this stuff. Love it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite conditioner. I&#x27;ve used many kinds of shampoos and conditioners before but in most cases, just after starting to use them, my hair would become dry and start to form split ends. I switched on and off until my mom found this conditioner. This conditioner has just enough moisture to keep my hair strong and thick while not overloading it. Once a month I use a different shampoo though, other than the one that is related to this particular conditioner, just to freshen it up. I&#x27;ve used Garnier Fructis&#x27; Triple Nutrition Fortifying Conditioner and Shampoo for a couple years now. Even if the humidity and climate changes as I travel, my hair still looks and feels GREAT! This conditioner is magical and I would recommend this to anyone with frizzy, dry, or thirsty hair.</li>
            <li> I like this bottle design that has a small raised bubble on the cap making it much easier to open when hands are wet and soapy. I use this as a co-wash - putting the conditioner on the ends and leaving it there while I wash my roots and scalp with a mild shampoo. I then condition again with another brand. I can&#x27;t say how the product leaves your hair after use as I follow it up with another brand but it has a pleasing smell, it is well priced on Amazon, and I will likely buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural headed gal with 4B hair that get extremely dry very quick and I use this as co-wash, which just means I wash my hair without shampoo and I find this product to be very moisturizing and it leaves my hair very manageable so that I can detangle my hair with ease. It also doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling heavy and weighed down which is an extreme plus and my book. I will continue to use this product in the future.&lt;br /&gt;So if your hair is dry, damaged or in a need for a little TLC i would highly recommend this!  Keep up the good work Garnier!</li>
            <li> I recieved this product as part a of a buzz campaign on buzzagent.com..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am usually a HUGE fan of garnier fructis products but this one was a fail for me.. The conditioner left my hair feeling heavy and greesy.. I have color treated damaged hair that is always frizzy.. this product took me to the other side of the spectrum!!</li>
            <li> Iam African American and Irish so my hair is super curly.Alot of products dry out my hair but with this conditioner and garnier fructis hairspray my hair looks shiny and healthy!</li>
            <li> My second purchase of the same and love the fruity smell. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price!</li>
            <li> I have tried almost every common brand of conditioner, and this is by far the best. Smells amazing and this particular kind (triple nutrition) has the best effects I have ever seen.  I have curly blonde hair and this conditioner keeps my hair soft and moisturized without weighing it down with residue.</li>
            <li> Wow.  Finally, something that nourishes my hair!...  I have tried... Keratase, Biolage, Triple Moisture, hot oil treatments,  Sebastian, Aphogee, and every product known to man for &amp;#34;ethnic&amp;#34; hair.. I have spent SOOOO much money on hair products just so that I could find the one... that ONE conditioner or product that moisturize and tame my frizzy, dried, curly, crazy hair.  Something that would turn my bi-polar, fuzzy curls into long, flowing, botticelli locks with defined curls.  Well, I have found it.  In the shower this stuff made my hair feel like butter.  My tangles have NEVER been easier to comb through.  After leaving this on for about 5 minutes in the shower I rinsed and my hair felt silky and long.  I than added a bit of jojoba oil and some more of this as a leave in conditioner along with a bit of Frizz Ease (the frizz ease does not work all that great alone so I thought I mix it with some stuff).  The result?  My fried locks feel SO soft!  My curls are defined and my hair feels silky and looks shiny and gorgeous!  Those Botticelli curls are even there.  I am going to buy this stuff by the gallons.  Finally my search is over.  Oh yes... I love the smell.</li>
            <li> I get this for my boys because it smells good!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this conditioner! I have very very frizzy hair, I have bought just about every product at the salon and the store but without using a lot of product, nothing works! I hate product! This works, without using mouse and gel and anti frizz serum.  I put a small amount in a spray bottle to spray in my hair on the 2nd day after washing it as I&#x27;m not able to wash daily or my hair will break and fall.  Wonderful product, I love it!</li>
            <li> I bought it because I ran out of my usual conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair tends to get lots of buildup, even after cleansing it every other week. I decided to switch things up! I am a sucker for things that are almost sold out, and I saw that there was only 2 left of these on the shelf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a really nice fruity smell! I love it. It is subtle and not over the top. I love how good my hair smells after getting out of the shower. Yum.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need much to get it all over your hair.I had this problem with my old conditioner. It was so thick, I couldn&#x27;t get it all over my tips. Oh, it is also really cheap. You don&#x27;t have to spend too much to get your hair looking fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: I have long (down to my lower back), thin, frizzy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first use, my hair was so soft and shiny! I usually put some leave-in conditioner, but I passed on it after feeling how smooth my hair was! My hair usually gets frizzy and goes all over the place after being air dried, but after using it my hair has become less frizzy. I don&#x27;t have to worry about straightening it before I head out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it close to two weeks. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I ordered a fortifying conditioner but i received a fortifying shampoo! The shampoo is fine but it is not what i needed.</li>
            <li> Works really well!! Makes my hair really soft!!</li>
            <li> Love this! I am usually changing conditioners everytime I need to restock but I have been consistently using this for months. I have naturally curly and thick hair. It smells great, helps define curls due to being highly moisturizing, and cheap as you can get. I would say that this is the best garnier product ever made. Don&#x27;t hesitate to try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I won&#x27;t recommend for those looking for volumizing, people with fine hair, etc. It is really moisturizing due to the oils and might weight hair down.</li>
            <li> I used this for quite some time with conditioner and leave in conditioner and for a while it made my hair shiney and soft and then all of a sudden it turned on me and it quickly damaged me and my daughters hair. Im now considering cutting my extremely long hair that I used to love because it is damaged all the way to the root. Its falling out, split end are forming as quickly as I can get them cut off and its tangled as soon as I brush it. Im trying to repair it but its not working. I wont ever use this again. My daughter is in tears when I brush her hair because hers is as damaged as mine and she cant even leave it down anymore.</li>
            <li> Great smell and work realy well on my hair.</li>
            <li> This product is just what I expected, and the subscribe and save option makes it very easy for me. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I will always have this conditioner. Great mixed with oil for pre poo. Great price and last long... Try with heat cap if you have low porosity hair.</li>
            <li> Not good, leaves hair rough.</li>
            <li> My hair always looks gorgeous on days I apply this conditioner! :) I have since bought more of this, and I will keep doing so.</li>
            <li> I am AA with dry natural 3C/4A hair.  This product is awesome and I use it daily.  My curls drink it up and becomes very soft and springy.  Simply gorgeous.  I would recommend this product to anyone that has dry or thirsty hair.</li>
            <li> grandaughter in college loves it.  she has long blonde hair and i send this and the shampoo often to help her out</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner I have found in a LONG time!  I am African American, with kinky curly hair that I relax, and this conditioner leaves my hair super silky and soft!  My new growth lays down, and forms pretty waves from this conditioner, and I also use this on my daughter&#x27;s hair!  It is great stuff at a cheap price!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both use this shampoo and conditioner and it works great.  Sometimes, for me, I feel like I have to change up after a while because it loses it&#x27;s effectiveness.  i&#x27;ll use the color protector for a few weeks and then come back to this.  My daughter uses this constantly with no issues but she also doesn&#x27;t use gel and hairspray like I do.  I love the fact that this works on my hair (course and curly) and I&#x27;ve tried a TON of different brands from cheap to expensive - and this is affordable.</li>
            <li> i love all Garnier Fructis hair product because they work great with any hair type. This is the best brand on the market and i highly recommend for any race.</li>
            <li> I wear my hair natural, type 4 curls. This product surprisingly relaxes the hair. Its so shiny but not greasy and smells like fresh oranges. I recommend the shampoo, conditioner, and hair oil be used together. This will be replacing the other expensive brands in my collection because it works the best. Go Garnier!</li>
            <li> Could have been shipping but one bottle was busted open when I got it. Packaging needs to be a little more secure...Some bubble wrap never hurt.</li>
            <li> I have long, straight fine hair. I&#x27;ve used conditioners from one end of the spectrum to the other.&lt;br /&gt; I tell you this made my hair shinier, more moisturized but bouncy than anything I&#x27;ve ever used, it is great!&lt;br /&gt;The price point is super awesome.&lt;br /&gt;My old &amp;#34;bumble&amp;#34; conditioner  cost 53.00, this is so much better.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;Ordering from amazon is so easy too! Read ingredients and reviews from the comfort of your home. No hectic store lines. Great!</li>
            <li> Great conditioner, left my color-treated hair soft and shiny.  Smells good... Actually, Garnier Fructis has great products in general.  This is another one of them.</li>
            <li> I bought this along with the Triple Nutrition Moisture spray and 3-Minute Deep Conditioner. This product smells great and my hair felt so smooth after using it.  I have only use this product once, but so far so good.  I give it 4 out of 5 stars, because I want to see if I like it over time...</li>
            <li> I really wanted to try this out because during the summer my hair can get very, intensely dry.  It feels like straw on a bad day.  The thing is my hair is long and curly and if a conditioner doesn&#x27;t work with my hair, it&#x27;s a total waste!  I&#x27;m glad I went with this though, because it&#x27;s thick and creamy.  It doesn&#x27;t give my curls the same life and volume as a cleansing shampoo but then again, it isn&#x27;t a cleansing shampoo.  I can see this weighing my hair down if it was being used too often.  The only thing I really dislike is the smell, very chemicallyâ€¦and they try to cover it with fruity scents buuttt I can smell through it and it&#x27;s a bit nauseating.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF! I use it everyday to keep my relaxed hair moisturized! I&#x27;ve had frizzy hair for the last 2 years and ive been trying to find something to keep my hair moisturized.I&#x27;ve went through expensive products such as phyto and redken and its not as good as the garnier fructis triple nutrition conditioner! I bought this product at walgreens as an accident, and im so happy i finally found this product to add to my hair regimen! I use this conditioner for my co wash days and wash and condition days.It works great! I love that the garnier fructis conditioners are creamy and thick. Just remember to wash it all out! If you dont wash out all of the product, your hair will be greasy. I recommend the Garnier fructis anti frizz serum, Garnier fructis 3 minute undo treatment, Garnier fructis sleek and shine leave in conditioner and the Garnier fructis smoothing milk. These products do wonders for my hair!</li>
            <li> This conditioner by far is one of my favorite conditioners, along with aphogee&#x27;s keratin reconstructor and organic root stimulator replenshing conditioner! This conditioner in particular is used on my hair daily and all i can see is my hair is left soft and detangled!! I only wash(shampoo) once a week and use this conditioner as a co~wash! Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> I will start by saying that I am a Caucasian with 3a/3b, colored, dry &amp; damaged hair. Due to a dye-job gone horribly wrong, my waist-length hair was recently cut to my shoulder blades. My hair was literally like straw, and nothing I tried was helping. I began the CG method, thinking I just wasn&#x27;t caring for my curls correctly and that this would help. While it did teach me, it did nothing for the dry damage. Getting to the point that I was spending so much time and more $ than I care to admit was a bane in my existence. My hair was just destroyed. From DivaCurl to Tresseme (sp?) and every home remedy I could find...nothing helped.&lt;br /&gt;Then I saw the reviews on here for this conditioner. I didn&#x27;t purchase it from Amazon, because there is a &#x27;Mart down the road from me and I knew they had it. I went right away and bought a bottle...and haven&#x27;t looked back. By this point, I had 3-4&amp;#34; left of damage, but couldn&#x27;t bring myself to cut any more. This conditioner made sure I don&#x27;t have to. The slip is OUTSTANDING, smells great, and my curls are very defined. My hair is shiny, super soft, healthy in appearance,  &amp; no frizz or flyaways. By the way, I have not had to use any leave-in conditioner yet! I&#x27;m more than pleased at finding such a cheap HG keeper!!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend this for people with fine hair-or at least use a minute amount. It could tend to weigh that hair type down if not, or not rinsed out EXTREMELY well. I hope this helps others that have the problems I did :)</li>
            <li> A little too moisturizing/greasy for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have only used it twice so far, but it definitely makes my wet hair easier to comb out.  I have long hair that can tend to be dry, I am hoping to see an improvement in shine and sleekness.</li>
            <li> This is amazing. It works well for my dry hair. I have had dry hair for a few years and tried to do many wayã„´ done for my dry hair. However, it didn&#x27;t work well. Recently, I found a solution for my hair. I just would like to share information with somebody who has a problem like me. Of course, I use this conditioner when I wash my hair. Also, I made a DIY hair serum myself, which is working well with this conditioner . This is what you need; a spraying plastic bottle, 70% of water for the bottle, some this conditioner, rose hip oil, Garnier Anti-Frizz Serum, and Vitamin C serum. I have been using my DIY hair Serum over 1 month before I comb my hair. I don&#x27;t see breakage hair any more, and my hair looks healthy and thick. It is not tangled any more. I am so happy with my hair.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is the best so far for my natural kinky 4b hair type. I was looking for a staple conditioner and I think I found it. I strongly suggest this to curly haired 3A-4C hair type... you will not regret buying that....Its wonderful!!!!</li>
            <li> Smells nice&lt;br /&gt;cleans my hair&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t go above and beyond. Makes my hair feel normal. I have an afro. It doesn&#x27;t damage my hair so yea</li>
