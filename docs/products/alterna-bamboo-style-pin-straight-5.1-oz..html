            <li> But at least it DOES work, and pretty well I might add.</li>
            <li> so it floats, but I wouldn&#x27;t ever dare dry my hair without the bamboo!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way too, I probably won&#x27;t use the entire bottle for at least 6 months.  </li>
            <li> The frizz doesn&#x27;t go completely away because I have thin hair</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t stop the grizzlies like the previous product.</li>
            <li> This product helps me straighten my curly hair in much less blow drying time!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little expensive, but everyone&#x27;s gotta make money</li>
            <li> I found this product did help straighten my hate easier than any other over the counter purchase.  </li>
            <li> Just isn&#x27;t working unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t seem to find this anywhere else unfortunately.</li>
            <li> then it was discontinued :(.</li>

            <li> This stuff makes my hair much softer and tamer after blow drying, and I love the smell!</li>
            <li> Gives hair smoothness, shine, heat protection, and straightens without flattening hair.</li>
            <li> This product works okay to straighten but causes significant static in my hair, even after the cold, dry temperatures have subsided.</li>
            <li> Works well. My hair is soft, straight, and shiny after applying and straightening. It&#x27;s a little expensive, but everyone&#x27;s gotta make money I guess. I didn&#x27;t give it four stars because I wish these products were a little more natural. But at least it DOES work, and pretty well I might add.</li>
            <li> Somewhat works....not as well as I thought.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I have really frizzy/wavy hair and this does an awesome job controlling the fizz and giving me a nice smooth weightless finish!</li>
            <li> Great product. The best I&#x27;ve tried to control humidity. Didn&#x27;t take it completely away but did manage the humidity better than other products I&#x27;ve tried</li>

            <li> I bought this because Alterna no longer makes the smoothing product that I used to use.  I didn&#x27;t necessarily want pin straight hair but just something to smooth it.  If you&#x27;re looking for something to super straighten your hair, then this is it.  For me it stripped all of my body.  Just isn&#x27;t working unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and this product is fabulous. I am enjoying &#x27;losing&#x27; my curls for a smooth, sleek, shiny alternative.</li>
            <li> I used alterna hemp straightening balm for years...then it was discontinued :(. This was purchased in a hunt for a replacement.  Works good enough,  it doesn&#x27;t stop the grizzlies like the previous product.</li>
            <li> I loved this product the first two times I bought it from Ulta but this time around  i bought it online and it seems like the formula might have changed. Maybe it is the weather but it does not work as well</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.  I have very fine, frizzy hair.  I&#x27;ve tried every product on the market.  This is the best one.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair and I love alterna products. I like the fact that this protects my hair and helps straighten while using heat from dryer but would like to see better hold</li>
            <li> just about the best product to straighten curly hair with. Can&#x27;t seem to find this anywhere else unfortunately. If you want sleek, straight hair you will not regret this purchase!</li>
            <li> Good product but I still need to use a flatiron.</li>
            <li> I have used this product and It really does what it says it does I highly recommended it I will buy it again</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  I have tried many brands and this really helps add some shine and moisture to my hair.  I have very, very curly hair that always needs some moisture to it&#x27;s frizzy ends.  A little goes a long way too, I probably won&#x27;t use the entire bottle for at least 6 months.  Good buy.</li>
            <li> This product helps me straighten my curly hair in much less blow drying time! Smells great and softens my strands!</li>
            <li> I found this product did help straighten my hate easier than any other over the counter purchase.  I would buy this again.</li>
