            <li>&amp;#34;Dark Side of the Mood&amp;#34; has fetched the most compliments for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the colors.</li>
            <li>what&#x27;s with the red?&amp;#34; I love all the greys since it&#x27;s a polish color you don&#x27;t see often.</li>
            <li>I fell in love and felt like a sexy vixen.</li>
            <li>I would have thought they would have been more pigmented.</li>
            <li>I love OPI</li>
            <li>Love the colors and love the nail polish</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I love any of the colors</li>
            <li>I love this nail polish set.</li>
            <li>Love these colors.</li>
            <li>I love the assortment of colors.</li>
            <li>I love this set.</li>
            <li>I love the colors</li>
            <li>The glitter is some of the best overall coverage I have ever seen, and the polish lasts through washing dishes for two weeks :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with the colors ty</li>
            <li>The colors are amazing &amp; worth everything!</li>
            <li>Some of the best grey shades I&#x27;ve ever come across.</li>
            <li>These originally were not supposed to arrive until February 5th!</li>
            <li>Beautiful variety and can be used for many different occasions.</li>
            <li>Note: The seller was amazing, very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>today i change different color is beautiful</li>
            <li>Super cute colors.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous nail polish.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t shiooed in a box but a cheap envelope.</li>
            <li>and it has lasted, chip free, for about five days now.</li>
            <li>My toes look fabulous.</li>
            <li>So far have loved them all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Polish is creamy and offers good coverage.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just the right size to order when you aren&#x27;t sure of the color.</li>
            <li>Both take 2-3 coats to achieve the true color but look great when properly applied.</li>
            <li>And perfect for trying new colors without spending ten bucks a pop.</li>
            <li>As most people before me have said, they do chip fast!</li>
            <li>Nail polish was great and it lasted a long time.</li>
            <li>For my first choice I went with Cement The Deal with a top coat of Shine For Me.</li>
            <li>They were true to the picture.</li>
            <li>You have to put around 3-4 coats to get full coverage though.</li>
            <li>These shades look really good on, I will be buying the regular sized bottled when I run out.</li>
            <li>Once I finish the minis, I plan to get a couple of the colors in full size.</li>
            <li>I used 3 coats to cover and even now I can still kind of see spots where it didn&#x27;t completely cover.  </li>
            <li>I got it and it looks cool.</li>
            <li>Gorgeous colors that only need two coats!</li>
            <li>These are very small samples, but perfect for testing out the colors.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This mini-collection of Fifty Shades of Grey-inspired colors is super wearable.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery product as stated</li>
            <li>but I do like My Silk Tie mainly because silver is my favorite color.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was quick and was exactly what I imagined would be!</li>
            <li>Love my new nail polishes</li>
            <li>Fast shipment, quality product!!</li>
            <li>Everyone loves it and wants to use it!!</li>
            <li>Their brushes work well, their polish is nicely pigmented, and I even hear that if you&#x27;re not constantly bumping your nails into things like I am, the polish is chip-resistant.</li>
            <li>I really liked the colors and the tiny nail polish</li>
            <li>FUN.  </li>
            <li>The recipient was thrilled (a big 50 Shades fan) and she loves all the colors.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!!!</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected and such a great price!!</li>
            <li>Much like the book, the Fifty Shades of Grey nail polish is good in theory but lacking in quality.</li>
            <li>The color &amp;#34;My Silk Tie&amp;#34; is a personal favorite that adds a lot of shine in a true silver color, while</li>
            <li>If the product comes in a more classy look, it will be most suitable for present and gift or simply keeping as display.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The colors look gorgeous in the box, but when used, they seemed watered down.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I was able to buy all the colors in this little mini set.</li>
            <li>Bottles are cute and tiny and just the right size.</li>
            <li>Box a little damaged in shipping but otherwise good, thanks!</li>
            <li>Love the colors and will definitely purchase from seller again.</li>
            <li>Overall I was satisfied.</li>
            <li>They are really pretty though.</li>
            <li>First of all, who doesn&#x27;t like OPI brand polish?</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>Love the red color.  </li>
            <li>That Red is fabulous!</li>
            <li>Thank so much first got it</li>
            <li>Product is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>These bottles take away the &amp;#34;guilt of experimenting&amp;#34; ;)&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are exactly the colors I want to wear every day.</li>
            <li>Love the different shades.  </li>
            <li>Love the color, and it last longer.</li>
            <li>but it was a color that I most likely wouldn&#x27;t wear much</li>
            <li>18 &amp; 25, respectively, I am looking for unique &amp; fun items for their baskets.</li>
            <li>A good starter kit if you are not sure which</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s good that they come in small bottles</li>
            <li>The red is a true red and grey is one of my favorite choices for polish so happy with all the shades of grey.</li>
            <li>That way you can have all the colors for a little more than the price of a full size bottle</li>
            <li>I love to wear grey nail polish, so I was all over this kit as soon as I saw it!</li>
            <li>The shades are nice, I really like the little bottles.</li>
            <li>She said that the little bottles were the best because they didn&#x27;t go to waste.</li>
            <li>Good color and hard to chip</li>
            <li>Thanks for everything.</li>
            <li>Arrived fast</li>
            <li>They really shouldn&#x27;t have bothered with this one.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and just as described.</li>
            <li>I really like the color aassortment .</li>
            <li>I really ended up really liking the colors that I didn&#x27;t think I would...</li>
            <li>CAME FAST.  </li>
            <li>these colors seems to have become very popular.i&#x27;ll</li>
            <li>Allows for me to use colors without polish getting old, right amount in bottle.</li>
            <li>was great , what I like about the mini bottles is it doesn&#x27;t go to waste and put in the fifty shades of grey box</li>
            <li>The dark gray needs more coats then anticipated.</li>
            <li>I only wish they had a pack like this for the full size nail polishes.</li>
            <li>i love it well not big fan red color</li>
            <li>the smaller bottles that let you try more of the OPI products than you would if buying individually.</li>
            <li>The only great colors in this pack are the red and dark charcoal.</li>
            <li>so I can show up at the first showing of Fifty Shades of Grey with just the right shade on my nails.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I highly recommend this collection.</li>
            <li>just seemed to cliche and normal</li>
            <li>The red is the only color that I liked out of the entire set.</li>
            <li>Just didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations.     </li>
            <li>Overall they are a nice set and pair very well with each other or single.</li>
            <li>Dried out and became very goopy quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so buying a large bottle of that red.</li>
            <li>I wore the red, dark grey, and glitter to the movie premiere in NYC and received so many compliments!</li>
            <li>Other than the need for multiple coats, I love the colors and will probably buy a few full sizes from this collection.</li>
            <li>But I am old school with nail polish</li>
            <li>so I can try all the different colour without spending too much on them.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>and I intend to contact OPI directly about the problem.  </li>
            <li>Love the colors, but not a huge fan of the TINY bottles they come in.</li>
            <li>I got one for me because I loved the colors and am obsessed with nail polish and one for a friend as a Christmas gift because she loves Fifty Shades.</li>
            <li>i love grey n black</li>
            <li>Pictures are of three coats of each: first hand Romantically Involved, second hand is Cement the Deal covered in Shine for Me, middle finger is My Silk Tie.</li>
            <li>Very opaque and long wearing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not entirely sure they are the genuine colors?</li>
            <li>/&gt;Coating a layer of &amp;#34;Shine for me&amp;#34; after using the matte grey colour as base colour make the whole look much more sexy.</li>
            <li>I usually avoid grey because on me the color looks like a cadaver, but these shades seem to be very clean and clear with no muddy undertones.</li>
            <li>With the new 50 Shades fad going on and an assignment from my sister to assemble the traditional Easter bags for my 2 grown nieces.</li>
            <li>And the brush is tiny, half the width of a normal size bottle brush, so it&#x27;s harder to get smooth.</li>
            <li>The red is a deep classic color</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need the red, but really like the grey options.</li>
            <li>All too often  I find myself tossing the full size bottles after only a few uses.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was quick, only took a few days.</li>
            <li>The colors are pretty, but a little &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>This nail polish was very watered down and chipped within 24 hours on each use.</li>
            <li>the three grays and deep red are easy everyday polishes even for your average housewife.</li>

            <li> LOVE THE COLORS.  </li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Dark Side of the Mood&amp;#34; has fetched the most compliments for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the colors.</li>
            <li> what&#x27;s with the red?&amp;#34; I love all the greys since it&#x27;s a polish color you don&#x27;t see often.</li>
            <li> I fell in love and felt like a sexy vixen.</li>
            <li> I would have thought they would have been more pigmented.</li>
            <li> I love OPI</li>
            <li> Love the colors and love the nail polish</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I love any of the colors</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish set.</li>
            <li> Love these colors.</li>
            <li> I love the assortment of colors.</li>
            <li> I love this set.</li>
            <li> I love the colors</li>
            <li> The glitter is some of the best overall coverage I have ever seen, and the polish lasts through washing dishes for two weeks :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with the colors ty</li>
            <li> The colors are amazing &amp; worth everything!</li>
            <li> Some of the best grey shades I&#x27;ve ever come across.</li>
            <li> These originally were not supposed to arrive until February 5th!</li>
            <li> Beautiful variety and can be used for many different occasions.</li>
            <li> Note: The seller was amazing, very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> today i change different color is beautiful</li>
            <li> Super cute colors.  </li>
            <li> Fabulous nail polish.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t shiooed in a box but a cheap envelope.</li>
            <li> and it has lasted, chip free, for about five days now.</li>
            <li> My toes look fabulous.</li>
            <li> So far have loved them all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Polish is creamy and offers good coverage.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just the right size to order when you aren&#x27;t sure of the color.</li>
            <li> Both take 2-3 coats to achieve the true color but look great when properly applied.</li>
            <li> And perfect for trying new colors without spending ten bucks a pop.</li>
            <li> As most people before me have said, they do chip fast!</li>
            <li> Nail polish was great and it lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> For my first choice I went with Cement The Deal with a top coat of Shine For Me.</li>
            <li> They were true to the picture.</li>
            <li> You have to put around 3-4 coats to get full coverage though.</li>
            <li> These shades look really good on, I will be buying the regular sized bottled when I run out.</li>
            <li> Once I finish the minis, I plan to get a couple of the colors in full size.</li>
            <li> I used 3 coats to cover and even now I can still kind of see spots where it didn&#x27;t completely cover.  </li>
            <li> I got it and it looks cool.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous colors that only need two coats!</li>
            <li> These are very small samples, but perfect for testing out the colors.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This mini-collection of Fifty Shades of Grey-inspired colors is super wearable.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery product as stated</li>
            <li> but I do like My Silk Tie mainly because silver is my favorite color.  </li>
            <li> The shipping was quick and was exactly what I imagined would be!</li>
            <li> Love my new nail polishes</li>
            <li> Fast shipment, quality product!!</li>
            <li> Everyone loves it and wants to use it!!</li>
            <li> Their brushes work well, their polish is nicely pigmented, and I even hear that if you&#x27;re not constantly bumping your nails into things like I am, the polish is chip-resistant.</li>
            <li> I really liked the colors and the tiny nail polish</li>
            <li> FUN.  </li>
            <li> The recipient was thrilled (a big 50 Shades fan) and she loves all the colors.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!!!</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected and such a great price!!</li>
            <li> Much like the book, the Fifty Shades of Grey nail polish is good in theory but lacking in quality.</li>
            <li> The color &amp;#34;My Silk Tie&amp;#34; is a personal favorite that adds a lot of shine in a true silver color, while</li>
            <li> If the product comes in a more classy look, it will be most suitable for present and gift or simply keeping as display.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The colors look gorgeous in the box, but when used, they seemed watered down.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I was able to buy all the colors in this little mini set.</li>
            <li> Bottles are cute and tiny and just the right size.</li>
            <li> Box a little damaged in shipping but otherwise good, thanks!</li>
            <li> Love the colors and will definitely purchase from seller again.</li>
            <li> Overall I was satisfied.</li>
            <li> They are really pretty though.</li>
            <li> First of all, who doesn&#x27;t like OPI brand polish?</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Love the red color.  </li>
            <li> That Red is fabulous!</li>
            <li> Thank so much first got it</li>
            <li> Product is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> These bottles take away the &amp;#34;guilt of experimenting&amp;#34; ;)&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are exactly the colors I want to wear every day.</li>
            <li> Love the different shades.  </li>
            <li> Love the color, and it last longer.</li>
            <li> but it was a color that I most likely wouldn&#x27;t wear much</li>
            <li> 18 &amp; 25, respectively, I am looking for unique &amp; fun items for their baskets.</li>
            <li> A good starter kit if you are not sure which</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s good that they come in small bottles</li>
            <li> The red is a true red and grey is one of my favorite choices for polish so happy with all the shades of grey.</li>
            <li> That way you can have all the colors for a little more than the price of a full size bottle</li>
            <li> I love to wear grey nail polish, so I was all over this kit as soon as I saw it!</li>
            <li> The shades are nice, I really like the little bottles.</li>
            <li> She said that the little bottles were the best because they didn&#x27;t go to waste.</li>
            <li> Good color and hard to chip</li>
            <li> Thanks for everything.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast</li>
            <li> They really shouldn&#x27;t have bothered with this one.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and just as described.</li>
            <li> I really like the color aassortment .</li>
            <li> I really ended up really liking the colors that I didn&#x27;t think I would...</li>
            <li> CAME FAST.  </li>
            <li> these colors seems to have become very popular.i&#x27;ll</li>
            <li> Allows for me to use colors without polish getting old, right amount in bottle.</li>
            <li> was great , what I like about the mini bottles is it doesn&#x27;t go to waste and put in the fifty shades of grey box</li>
            <li> The dark gray needs more coats then anticipated.</li>
            <li> I only wish they had a pack like this for the full size nail polishes.</li>
            <li> i love it well not big fan red color</li>
            <li> the smaller bottles that let you try more of the OPI products than you would if buying individually.</li>
            <li> The only great colors in this pack are the red and dark charcoal.</li>
            <li> so I can show up at the first showing of Fifty Shades of Grey with just the right shade on my nails.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I highly recommend this collection.</li>
            <li> just seemed to cliche and normal</li>
            <li> The red is the only color that I liked out of the entire set.</li>
            <li> Just didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations.     </li>
            <li> Overall they are a nice set and pair very well with each other or single.</li>
            <li> Dried out and became very goopy quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so buying a large bottle of that red.</li>
            <li> I wore the red, dark grey, and glitter to the movie premiere in NYC and received so many compliments!</li>
            <li> Other than the need for multiple coats, I love the colors and will probably buy a few full sizes from this collection.</li>
            <li> But I am old school with nail polish</li>
            <li> so I can try all the different colour without spending too much on them.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> and I intend to contact OPI directly about the problem.  </li>
            <li> Love the colors, but not a huge fan of the TINY bottles they come in.</li>
            <li> I got one for me because I loved the colors and am obsessed with nail polish and one for a friend as a Christmas gift because she loves Fifty Shades.</li>
            <li> i love grey n black</li>
            <li> Pictures are of three coats of each: first hand Romantically Involved, second hand is Cement the Deal covered in Shine for Me, middle finger is My Silk Tie.</li>
            <li> Very opaque and long wearing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not entirely sure they are the genuine colors?</li>
            <li> /&gt;Coating a layer of &amp;#34;Shine for me&amp;#34; after using the matte grey colour as base colour make the whole look much more sexy.</li>
            <li> I usually avoid grey because on me the color looks like a cadaver, but these shades seem to be very clean and clear with no muddy undertones.</li>
            <li> With the new 50 Shades fad going on and an assignment from my sister to assemble the traditional Easter bags for my 2 grown nieces.</li>
            <li> And the brush is tiny, half the width of a normal size bottle brush, so it&#x27;s harder to get smooth.</li>
            <li> The red is a deep classic color</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need the red, but really like the grey options.</li>
            <li> All too often  I find myself tossing the full size bottles after only a few uses.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was quick, only took a few days.</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty, but a little &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This nail polish was very watered down and chipped within 24 hours on each use.</li>
            <li> the three grays and deep red are easy everyday polishes even for your average housewife.</li>
            <li> Compared to the normal OPI bottle, I don&#x27;t think it is even half the size.</li>
            <li> Very boring, ok I get why so many Greys, but please, 60% of the collection is some form of grey, (yeah</li>
            <li> I am in love with OPI already, but when you add 50 Shades of Grey how can you go wrong?</li>
            <li> On the plus side it dried quick so the 3 coats were a little quicker</li>
            <li> The shades of grey gave different touch to my nails.</li>
            <li> Being a fan of 50 shades of grey, this nail pack is definitely a must-have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When the 50 Shades OPI line was announced it, I joked, &amp;#34;Way to drop the ball OPI, there&#x27;s only 5 not 50 shades of grey and</li>
            <li> Like the Books and the Movie, you are only limited by your imagination!</li>
            <li> For OPI polish, I found it to be pretty on par with other colors in the same brand, except that the two darker grays were a little thin and required a third coat for completely opaque coverage.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t resist the price especially when I saw other kits for 3 times the amount.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve tried them all out next to each other</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> Mr Grey will see you now!</li>
            <li> Simply give a nice touch to all the colours with just one coat over the base colour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With the bottle sizes being so small, it ran down quite fast.  </li>
            <li> I am thinking Embrace the Grey or My Silk Tie!!</li>
            <li> I also like that the bottles are small since I never seem to get through an entire regular size bottle of polish.</li>
            <li> When I opened it I was a little surprised on how small the bottles actually are.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to like...nail polishes and Fifty Shades of Grey together?!!!</li>
            <li> Arrived faster than expected.</li>
            <li> and you need multiple applications for it to look half way decent and a base coat is an absolute must.</li>
            <li> so the color combinations are endless.</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty, but the polish is very thin and runny.</li>
            <li> For these to be pretty dark colors, it&#x27;s very thin</li>
            <li> Some are to dark for me.</li>
            <li> The polish isn&#x27;t what I was expecting though, all of the greys require at least three coats to get a solid color.</li>
            <li> /&gt;What&#x27;s not worth buying?</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that they will be gone soon.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re &amp;#34;three-free&amp;#34; (fewer of the really nasty chemicals), and have a well-deserved reputation for being of good quality.</li>
            <li> Overall, I would have no issue from purchasing from this Seller again, although shipping was a bit slow.</li>
            <li> but I do think the polish seemed watered down.</li>
            <li> It will take a few coats.</li>
            <li> I have a few OPIs that need two coats, but none that need three.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this set, wait for it to go on clearance.</li>
            <li> I know some people have complained that two of the colors resembled each other</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took longer than usual to arrive but no harm.</li>
            <li> Love the colors but the quality of the nail polish was horrible.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really small</li>
            <li> Disappointing to say the least, I hate to see how it looks after a full day of wear.</li>
            <li> These polish were not good.</li>
            <li> Both a co-worker and myself purchased this set and the polishes were thin and watery</li>
            <li> I had no issue with the Seller, but the product on the other hand, was very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> Even the red is boring.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with OPI!</li>
            <li> Really bad nail polish will not buy again</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed</li>
            <li> Texture of these is terrible!</li>

            <li> Super fast shipping! Love the colors and will definitely purchase from seller again. Thanks for everything.</li>
            <li> I love the colores and quality</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty, but a little &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34;. It will take a few coats.</li>
            <li> Just the right size to order when you aren&#x27;t sure of the color. So far have loved them all.</li>
            <li> Very nice colors. Couldn&#x27;t resist the price especially when I saw other kits for 3 times the amount.</li>
            <li> The package came exactly on time, in perfect condition. When I opened it I was a little surprised on how small the bottles actually are. Compared to the normal OPI bottle, I don&#x27;t think it is even half the size. I provided a photo for comparison. Despite that, I loved all of the colors. They were true to the picture. They went on beautifully with a couple of coats. I just wish they were a bit bigger, but it is a great way to try the colors out! Overall I was satisfied.</li>
            <li> Nice gray assortment. Very opaque and long wearing.</li>
            <li> Colors are beautiful! You have to put around 3-4 coats to get full coverage though. And the brush is tiny, half the width of a normal size bottle brush, so it&#x27;s harder to get smooth. They are really pretty though.</li>
            <li> Great pack of shades at a reasonable $ !!!!</li>
            <li> Love love!!! Exactly what I expected and such a great price!!</li>
            <li> First of all, who doesn&#x27;t like OPI brand polish? They&#x27;re &amp;#34;three-free&amp;#34; (fewer of the really nasty chemicals), and have a well-deserved reputation for being of good quality. Their brushes work well, their polish is nicely pigmented, and I even hear that if you&#x27;re not constantly bumping your nails into things like I am, the polish is chip-resistant. Good stuff. Secondly, yes, these bottles are tiny. Teensy teeny weeny. And perfect for trying new colors without spending ten bucks a pop. Also perfect if you don&#x27;t wear nail polish all the time and don&#x27;t need a bunch of half-full (says the optimist) bottles cluttering up your place. Also nice for sharing, if you&#x27;re a generous sort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mini-collection of Fifty Shades of Grey-inspired colors is super wearable. &amp;#34;My Silk Tie&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Shine for Me&amp;#34; are both glittery, silvery colors for fancier finger occasions, but the three grays and deep red are easy everyday polishes even for your average housewife. All the colors have blue undertones. For OPI polish, I found it to be pretty on par with other colors in the same brand, except that the two darker grays were a little thin and required a third coat for completely opaque coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I highly recommend this collection.</li>
            <li> I really liked the colors and the tiny nail polish</li>
            <li> Arrived fast and I love all of the colors in the mini pack. However the polish does not last. I applied it and not even two hours later it started wearing off around the edges, and all I had done in that time was read and shower. Disappointing to say the least, I hate to see how it looks after a full day of wear.</li>
            <li> Love it!!  The colors are great ,can&#x27;t wait to wear them.</li>
            <li> Great coverage.  Always liked OPI polishes.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Super fast shipping! Exactly what I wanted &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Great!  Allows for me to use colors without polish getting old, right amount in bottle.</li>
            <li> Fabulous nail polish.</li>
            <li> Love the colors, but not a huge fan of the TINY bottles they come in.</li>
            <li> These shades look really good on, I will be buying the regular sized bottled when I run out.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery product as stated</li>
            <li> The only great colors in this pack are the red and dark charcoal. Both take 2-3 coats to achieve the true color but look great when properly applied. Usually last 1-3 days without chipping for me.</li>
            <li> Perfect sizes and prize.</li>
            <li> Did not like this collection.  Very boring, ok I get why so many Greys, but please, 60% of the collection is some form of grey, (yeah Fifty shades, I get it).  They really shouldn&#x27;t have bothered with this one.  Even the red is boring.</li>
            <li> Opi is a good brand so no surprise that I am happy with this purchase. Item arrived intact with even some beauty samples. No complaints.</li>
            <li> Really bad nail polish will not buy again</li>
            <li> Perfect gift set for my sis-in-law...</li>
            <li> The colors are AWESOME!!!!</li>
            <li> Much like the book, the Fifty Shades of Grey nail polish is good in theory but lacking in quality.</li>
            <li> As most people before me have said, they do chip fast! Not all of them but a couple of them. Overall they are a nice set and pair very well with each other or single. Loved all of the colors and I don&#x27;t think that they look a like at all. I know some people have complained that two of the colors resembled each other but I&#x27;ve tried them all out next to each other and they are enough shades off to see a difference. I&#x27;d recommend and would repurchase.</li>
            <li> Love the product!!! Thanks so much!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice collection.  Perfect sized bottles to sample each color without having to commit to the cost of full sized bottles.  Great pigmentation and perfect for grey ombr√© or gradient designs.</li>
            <li> I love this set.  OPi never dissapoints.</li>
            <li> I love to wear grey nail polish, so I was all over this kit as soon as I saw it!</li>
            <li> Loved these colors! Bottles are cute and tiny and just the right size.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty, but the polish is very thin and runny. Take many coats to cover.</li>
            <li> A good starter kit if you are not sure which shade(s) you like. The brushes are not in good quality at all.</li>
            <li> Super cute colors.  I got one for me because I loved the colors and am obsessed with nail polish and one for a friend as a Christmas gift because she loves Fifty Shades.</li>
            <li> Highly impressed! These originally were not supposed to arrive until February 5th! Received them on the 31st of January. Very happy!</li>
            <li> Love these colors. Beautiful variety and can be used for many different occasions.</li>
            <li> Some are to dark for me. But I am old school with nail polish</li>
            <li> Love the red color.  These are very small samples, but perfect for testing out the colors.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Satisfied customer even though the colour starts to wear out after 2 days.</li>
            <li> I really love all the greys in this set. I didn&#x27;t need the red, but really like the grey options. I also like that the bottles are small since I never seem to get through an entire regular size bottle of polish.</li>
            <li> Absolutely one of the greatest collections from OPI. That Red is fabulous!</li>
            <li> These arrived quickly and are all beautiful colors.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with OPI! Great colors! Love it.</li>
            <li> Love the colors im an OPI fan</li>
            <li> The shades are nice, I really like the little bottles.</li>
            <li> Great colors and collection.  Probably the best thing to come out of the book and movie.</li>
            <li> Like the Books and the Movie, you are only limited by your imagination! Some of the best grey shades I&#x27;ve ever come across. I usually avoid grey because on me the color looks like a cadaver, but these shades seem to be very clean and clear with no muddy undertones. The red is a deep classic color so I&#x27;m very happy with the collection.</li>
            <li> Love the mini bottles the colors are so pretty packaging was wonderful shipping was great , what I like about the mini bottles is it doesn&#x27;t go to waste and put in the fifty shades of grey box was so great Thank You ‚ô°</li>
            <li> Fast shipment, quality product!!</li>
            <li> Great product. One was for a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took longer than usual to arrive but no harm.</li>
            <li> Love the mini sizes. That way you can have all the colors for a little more than the price of a full size bottle</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find these and very pleased how quickly they arrived! I gave them to each of my friends the night we saw the movie,</li>
            <li> My box came damaged. I would have liked to kept the box because of movie. I was disappointed. It wasn&#x27;t shiooed in a box but a cheap envelope. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> The colors look gorgeous in the box, but when used, they seemed watered down.  I had to use about 3 or 4 coats to get to where the color looks like the one in the bottle.  With the bottle sizes being so small, it ran down quite fast.  Not impressed.</li>
            <li> The box arrived in perfect condition and about two days earlier than I was expecting. The polish isn&#x27;t what I was expecting though, all of the greys require at least three coats to get a solid color. I have a few OPIs that need two coats, but none that need three. With that being said, I did three coats of &amp;#34;Dark Side of the Mood&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;My Silk Tie&amp;#34; on my pointer finger and it has lasted, chip free, for about five days now. So they&#x27;re still the great quality I expect from OPI. I used OPI Chip Skip and an OPI top coat. Other than the need for multiple coats, I love the colors and will probably buy a few full sizes from this collection.</li>
            <li> It was perfect so I could try all the colors and not buy a big bottle of Each..</li>
            <li> The shades of grey gave different touch to my nails. Being a fan of 50 shades of grey, this nail pack is definitely a must-have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- I don&#x27;t always use these colours. So it&#x27;s good that they come in small bottles so I can try all the different colour without spending too much on them.&lt;br /&gt;- Love the &amp;#34;Shine for me&amp;#34;. Simply give a nice touch to all the colours with just one coat over the base colour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- If the product comes in a more classy look, it will be most suitable for present and gift or simply keeping as display.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s not worth buying? It&#x27;s 50 shades of grey!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suggestion:&lt;br /&gt;Coating a layer of &amp;#34;Shine for me&amp;#34; after using the matte grey colour as base colour make the whole look much more sexy.</li>
            <li> Love these set. Once I finish the minis, I plan to get a couple of the colors in full size.</li>
            <li> Came way before the estimated date. Great product!</li>
            <li> Nail polish was great and it lasted a long time. I am always cleaning and washing my hands and it still looked great!</li>
            <li> Thank so much first got it n use it i really love it im so happy been wear nail for week today i change different color is beautiful i love it well not big fan red color i love grey n black</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and just as described.</li>
            <li> Oh my. I like gray. Especially on my nails. This is gray heaven. With a pop of blue red. And OPI is the best.</li>
            <li> It was excellent, arrived in time. Great choice!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this set!! They arrived just in time so I can show up at the first showing of Fifty Shades of Grey with just the right shade on my nails. I am thinking Embrace the Grey or My Silk Tie!!</li>
            <li> I really like the color aassortment . Going to use it next week</li>
            <li> Love this!! Bought it so I could do my nails before going to the movie and it was even better than I imagined!! Everyone loves it and wants to use it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not entirely sure they are the genuine colors?</li>
            <li> Love the colors but the quality of the nail polish was horrible.  I used 3 coats to cover and even now I can still kind of see spots where it didn&#x27;t completely cover.  On the plus side it dried quick so the 3 coats were a little quicker but I do think the polish seemed watered down.</li>
            <li> This is a great way to sample the colors without spending the full price on a full size bottle.</li>
            <li> Loved it! Even though a couple colors took several coats, the colors was still awesome in the end!</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than expected! Great price :-)</li>
            <li> Great way to check out all the colors! I really ended up really liking the colors that I didn&#x27;t think I would...they&#x27;re some of my favorites.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT!  LOVE THE COLORS.  CAME FAST.  FUN.  Product is exactly as advertised. Happy.</li>
            <li> I had no issue with the Seller, but the product on the other hand, was very disappointing.  Both a co-worker and myself purchased this set and the polishes were thin and watery (my co-worker ordered the product from a completely different Seller, so it wasn&#x27;t the Seller).  The problem is with the polishes themselves and I intend to contact OPI directly about the problem.  Overall, I would have no issue from purchasing from this Seller again, although shipping was a bit slow.</li>
            <li> Love the colors......really wear well!!!!</li>
            <li> The dark gray needs more coats then anticipated. Good travel size</li>
            <li> With the new 50 Shades fad going on and an assignment from my sister to assemble the traditional Easter bags for my 2 grown nieces. 18 &amp; 25, respectively, I am looking for unique &amp; fun items for their baskets.I ordered one set for each which contains several mini-bottles of OPI Nail Polish that are in a box named 50 shades of gray. I think they will like them ad these colors seems to have become very popular.i&#x27;ll write another post after the jury  ( the girls) looks it over!</li>
            <li> Six beautiful &amp;#34;samplers&amp;#34; that come in six amazing colors all neatly packaged in a window box. The color &amp;#34;My Silk Tie&amp;#34; is a personal favorite that adds a lot of shine in a true silver color, while &amp;#34;Dark Side of the Mood&amp;#34; has fetched the most compliments for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the smaller bottles that let you try more of the OPI products than you would if buying individually. All too often  I find myself tossing the full size bottles after only a few uses.  These bottles take away the &amp;#34;guilt of experimenting&amp;#34; ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Polish is creamy and offers good coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gray/silvers seem to be a popular choice this year.  Would recommend .</li>
            <li> I love the colors. The quality is typically excellent  OPI. My only complaint is that they will be gone soon. For that reason only I give this 4 stars.</li>
            <li> When the 50 Shades OPI line was announced it, I joked, &amp;#34;Way to drop the ball OPI, there&#x27;s only 5 not 50 shades of grey and what&#x27;s with the red?&amp;#34; I love all the greys since it&#x27;s a polish color you don&#x27;t see often. I have avoided red nail polish since I was a teen, I blame it on being a goth/alternative girl in the 1990s for then red just seemed to cliche and normal and I carried that into adulthood. Then I put on the red, called Romantically Involved, that came with this. I fell in love and felt like a sexy vixen. I&#x27;m so buying a large bottle of that red. I hope OPI does color collections for the next two movies.</li>
            <li> Good color and hard to chip</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really small but I like the colors</li>
            <li> I know the description said mini but I didn&#x27;t expect it to be THAT MINI...</li>
            <li> The shipping was quick and was exactly what I imagined would be!</li>
            <li> Love my new nail polishes</li>
            <li> Box a little damaged in shipping but otherwise good, thanks!</li>
            <li> The colors are amazing &amp; worth everything! Shipping was quick, only took a few days.</li>
            <li> Arrived faster than expected. What&#x27;s not to like...nail polishes and Fifty Shades of Grey together?!!!</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors. I&#x27;m glad I was able to buy all the colors in this little mini set.For my first choice I went with Cement The Deal with a top coat of Shine For Me. My toes look fabulous.</li>
            <li> These polish were not good. I would have thought they would have been more pigmented. The red is the only color that I liked out of the entire set. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this set, wait for it to go on clearance. Note: The seller was amazing, very fast shipping. My review is based on product not seller. I love OPI</li>
            <li> Got for my niece she LOVED IT</li>
            <li> This nail polish was very watered down and chipped within 24 hours on each use.</li>
            <li> Love the colors and love the nail polish</li>
            <li> Texture of these is terrible! Very disappointed</li>
            <li> Thanks it came right on time, it came in great condition, love it!!!</li>
            <li> I looked at videos and read reviews for this product prior to purchasing.  On everyone I saw, the color looked completely different to me. I can&#x27;t say I love any of the colors but I do like My Silk Tie mainly because silver is my favorite color.  For these to be pretty dark colors, it&#x27;s very thin and you need multiple applications for it to look half way decent and a base coat is an absolute must. Overall for the price, I wouldn&#x27;t buy again. Just didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations.     Pictures are of three coats of each: first hand Romantically Involved, second hand is Cement the Deal covered in Shine for Me, middle finger is My Silk Tie.</li>
            <li> I love it! The colors are gorgeous. I just used it for Valentine&#x27;s Day. I&#x27;m going to use it again this weekend because I&#x27;m going to watch the film on Saturday with my mom and aunt and I can&#x27;t wait.</li>
            <li> Love the colors, amazing!</li>
            <li> I only wish they had a pack like this for the full size nail polishes.</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish set. My silk tie is perfection!</li>
            <li> Love these colors. They all match well together so the color combinations are endless. The red is a true red and grey is one of my favorite choices for polish so happy with all the shades of grey. No pun intended.</li>
            <li> Come to think of it, Fifty Shades or no Fifty Shades, this is a very good and affordable set of OPI nail polishes. I love the assortment of colors. They are exactly the colors I want to wear every day.</li>
            <li> Love the different shades.  Mix and match...</li>
            <li> Dried out and became very goopy quickly.</li>
            <li> Colours are beautiful</li>
            <li> Nice gift set. You can get a good 10 uses out of the bottles, but you do need a 2-3 coats for it to look good. The only reason I gave it a 3 was because one of the bottles was leaking when I received it but it was a color that I most likely wouldn&#x27;t wear much</li>
            <li> Great colors I&#x27;ll use all year round!!&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
            <li> Great colors..Mr Grey will see you now!</li>
            <li> Love the colors!  I have already tried them all and I can&#x27;t say I have one favorite but all!!</li>
            <li> I love this set. The colors are beautiful!</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift. The recipient was thrilled (a big 50 Shades fan) and she loves all the colors.</li>
            <li> I got it and it looks cool. I love the colors</li>
            <li> Love the color, and it last longer.</li>
            <li> My daughter absolutely loved this item.She said that the little bottles were the best because they didn&#x27;t go to waste.</li>
            <li> I gave these to friends as Valentine;s gift.  Big Hit!</li>
            <li> I am in love with OPI already, but when you add 50 Shades of Grey how can you go wrong? I wore the red, dark grey, and glitter to the movie premiere in NYC and received so many compliments! The glitter is some of the best overall coverage I have ever seen, and the polish lasts through washing dishes for two weeks :)</li>
            <li> The products arrived just in time. The colors are rich with a flawless application. The bottles are smaller than traditional size polishes. In the photo below I used only on the pointing finger.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with the colors ty</li>
            <li> Gorgeous colors that only need two coats!</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors! :) perfect sizes.</li>
