            <li>Smells nice.</li>
            <li>It dissolves into my skin and leaves a nice dewy finish.  </li>
            <li>While it is an excellent product, I have to use too much to feel hydrated and cannot afford it on an ongoing basis.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m thrilled.  </li>

            <li>So far the best loreal cream.</li>
            <li>This smells wonderful light and not overpowering, a soft floral or rose...</li>
            <li>You can feel its cream are very smooth.</li>
            <li>its very smooth to apply...</li>
            <li>is very good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>I had lived in Texas for three years where I acquired many wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>Nice, light moisturizer for use every day under makeup.</li>
            <li>Since I have been using this stuff I haven&#x27;t had nearly as many problems with my sensitivity</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like I need to use makeup to make my skin look better now.    </li>
            <li>Love this cream for my face.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fabulous!</li>
            <li>Love this moisturizer.</li>

            <li>Love this product.....</li>
            <li>I love Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love this cream</li>
            <li>I am not using it any more.</li>
            <li>and I found this on Amazon which L&#x27;oreal was my favorite brand also.</li>
            <li>I love it because I think I need more moisturizer in SF and Loreal could provide moisturizer that I need.</li>
            <li>I love this for the winter.</li>
            <li>You pay more for it&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>This moisture cr&amp;egrave;me is okay.</li>
            <li>A must-have product to maintain youthful, healthy skin.  </li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>I love loreal products</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I did a bit of research before buying it, and I&#x27;m so glad it works with my skin.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite day cream.</li>
            <li>This does it for me, for the most part.</li>
            <li>The smell is light, the formula is light; it was just a good option for using a dab to stay hydrated without feeling greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem</li>
            <li>I love this cream because it keeps my skin hydrated ALL DAY.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight so it absorbs more thoroughly than I hoped for.</li>
            <li>i recommend the product you can buy it several times excellent bran</li>
            <li>and you can be confident</li>
            <li>ok I know that we should use SPF</li>
            <li>You will love the results.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>On Amazon I get a better price and have the auto delivery option</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>; it serves better in the summer time.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find it everywhere, glad to see it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>So many others will work their way into my eyes during the day and burn like heck.  </li>
            <li>My favorite cream.</li>
            <li>Love this face cream.</li>
            <li>Please keep it in stock for others to enjoy!</li>
            <li>an will order many more..:)</li>
            <li>Love this cream...not sticky, does not cause zits, not oily.  </li>
            <li>This cream is by far my favorite moisturizer, it is light, smells good, penetrates the skin fast and is a wonderful moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>This works best for slightly dry skin.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone, 40 plus years old, but I feel the women in the 50 plus years catagory, as I am, would greatly benefit the most.</li>
            <li>I have used this for years and love how smooth it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and refreshing.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance.</li>
            <li>It has relieved the dryness making skin smooth and feeling clean!</li>
            <li>and it was working fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super moisturizing, a must buy for winter!</li>
            <li>works well, smells good and rubs in easily with a soft skin affect.</li>
            <li>Also, I use a needling roller on my face which will sometimes cause the skin to dry and flake off (which is a good thing!)...</li>
            <li>and when I use something else I can tell a huge difference.</li>
            <li>It feels so comfortable all day.</li>
            <li>The application is very fluid which is great as I use it also on my eye lids.</li>
            <li>This product is available at Walmart, as well.</li>
            <li>I use at night, as it is so light on my face.</li>
            <li>I think for the price its great, and doesn&#x27;t make me break out and only have to put it on once</li>
            <li>Smooth surface after applying the cream.</li>
            <li>so this is really important at my age.</li>
            <li>And it feels light.</li>
            <li>I find it absolutely perfect for my skin and at such a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>- I don&#x27;t use foundation powder - as much as I struggle with my skin color (mostly I notice it - not too many others)</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s very economical too.  </li>
            <li>it is very useful for winter and summer.</li>
            <li>The benefits significantly outweigh the one fault that I have found.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s become more &amp; more difficult to find this product in the stores, so I was delighted when I found I could order it through Amazon!!</li>
            <li>I fell in love after my first use.  </li>
            <li>It was economical about 8 bucks!</li>
            <li>I changed up my cleanser and added this amazing moisture cream and its like I have new skin.</li>
            <li>Light and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>It has no smell and it is absorbed quite easily.</li>
            <li>The wrinkles are reduced but my face turned bright red splotchy.</li>
            <li>There is absolutely nothing better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is relatively inexpensive and therefore is a good buy for the money.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Not a bad product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve grown to love it - leaves my extremely dry skin nicely moisturized.</li>
            <li>Not too great for me, but it might work for other people.</li>
            <li>Good moisture, but find the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Collagen Moisture FIller a little better,, like the fact has the collagen .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy or heavily scented and leaves my skin smooth and feeling great.</li>
            <li>I am lucky to find it at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>i love this moisture cream and decent price.</li>
            <li>the face is very soft, highly recommend, you will not regret, tamnien smells good.</li>
            <li>But I use foundation and a slight touch of L&#x27;Oreal or Bare Essential mineral powder which gives me a flawless complexion, I am 62 with good skin.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t give out a review usual, but this one is really good and make me want to share with you guys!</li>
            <li>This is a staple of my morning and night routine, its non greasy, sets into the skin well, and of course is very moisturizing!!</li>
            <li>and I am constantly asked how I keep my skin looking amazing at 48.</li>
            <li>If you are searching a kind of hydrate facial cream for day and night.</li>
            <li>So back to this cream, Loreal has always been a good product and reasonably priced</li>
            <li>Nothing miraculous, but applying it to a freshly washed face gives me a temporarily supple feeling.</li>
            <li>This is worth the money.</li>
            <li>The smell is simply clean and makes you feel good, and I am very sensitive towards fragrances in lotions especially on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is great if you have normal to dry skin as I do.</li>
            <li>I see great improvement in the skin texture and overall appearance, much better than when I use other moisturizers.</li>
            <li>immediately started to exfoliate as much as I could, and did my best to stay out of the sun but long story short, my skin was permanently darkened because my immune system was compromised.  </li>
            <li>Shortly after that is what I call \\&quot;the water stage,\\&quot; where as if by magic, my entire face seems to have a fine sheen of water just sitting right on top.  </li>
            <li>Nothing special really...</li>
            <li>Then I tried Loreal and it&#x27;s working better for me because it&#x27;s more moist than my previous product.</li>
            <li>With just a small amount, my skin is moisturized and feels great.  </li>
            <li>Its larger than my expected size and come with very good favor of smell.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin, but this keeps my skin soft and smooth all day, without a greasy feel... and it has such a light pleasant fragrance.  </li>
            <li>A great product with a little price tag!!</li>
            <li>and I have been getting compliments since the day I first tried it.</li>
            <li>This is my first review of any product</li>
            <li>I switched from clinique Dramatically Different moisturizer to this one as it is more affordable.</li>
            <li>The product is exactly as stated.  </li>
            <li>First time using this product....</li>
            <li>I keep coming back to this product and its still lovely.</li>
            <li>I like feeling natural and free with my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Overall?</li>
            <li>And the price is not expensive.</li>
            <li>The first time I bought it was at Wal mart</li>
            <li>Of all the facial moisturizers that I&#x27;ve tried this is the only one that works with my facial skin the best.</li>
            <li>so I put facial powder on top of it ;)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed more breakouts recently.</li>
            <li>Because, (1) works great on my sensitive skin that can easily develop a red rash with other creams,</li>
            <li>If you can get over that and just dab your face with a dry towel or light powder, it really works well and makes your skin feel soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>I gave this product 4 out of 5 stars because it feels kind of greasy and looks slightly greasy/shiny.</li>
            <li>Price is also very decent.</li>
            <li>I really realized the natural beauty of your true skin color.</li>
            <li>Decent price!</li>
            <li>Non-pore-clogging, intense moisturizing creams can be very hard to find, but this is a great, cost-effective option.</li>
            <li>No false promises or fancy ingredients</li>
            <li>The amount of items I found this year at reasonable prices and fast shipping made my holiday shopping a breeze.</li>
            <li>thanks so much.</li>
            <li>This product non-like others sticky after you put on your face, it&#x27;s very creamy.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It has never broken me out, but ymmv.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>thanks again.</li>
            <li>The scent is very suttle as well.</li>
            <li>this product really work for me</li>
            <li>Feels very creamy.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t really go away ;</li>
            <li>It is very creamy, but not greasy</li>
            <li>I am very disapointed with this product.</li>
            <li>like I just applied it for the whole day, but it doesn&#x27;t feel that way to the touch.</li>
            <li>I expected more because it was loreal.</li>
            <li>Thank you amazon because it really works</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>It contains Shea Butter and my skin feels very moist.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I love the creme, will definitely re order, and for my break out sensitive prone skin, no issue either.</li>
            <li>You should try this, it&#x27;s not very expensive.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant scent, it has a creamy texture, and I did notice a positive change in my skins appearance after only a few uses.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying this if you have easily irritated skin and struggle with dry spots.</li>
            <li>but I particularly like this cream</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m from Indonesia, a tropical country with high humidity.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li>it has a little more moisture.</li>
            <li>It feels very cooling and soft when it goes on</li>
            <li>but I love this stuff for everyday use.</li>
            <li>My favorite moisturizer, not too heavy.</li>
            <li>(that were usually flaky) are always baby smooth, and I rarely have to exfoliate my face now.</li>
            <li>I was so disappointed to discover that the product was not any more available where I live, but so relieved that it was available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I live in a desert climate and this is a god-sent.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feel very soft and I also like the smell.   </li>
            <li>Makes my skin very soft and elastic.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive combination skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have used this product for years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 67, live in the desert Southwest and experience many months of dry, dry heat</li>
            <li>I have tried many of the more expensive daily moisturizers from upscale product lines but for the price, this performs just as well.</li>
            <li>Despite super dry skin it sinks in with one quick application and the scent fades to nothingness</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin soft and supple even at age 71!</li>
            <li>But after I applied this on, wow~ I can say that is very soft.</li>
            <li>This is most likely due to the moisturizer because I am 36 yrs old and have not had problems with acne since my early 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Its made a definite positive impact on the look and feel of my skin.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer isn&#x27;t as good as other ones I&#x27;ve tried (leaves a weird residue, causes breakouts if I use it more than a couple times a week), but the pot packaging made it seem fancy and expensive, and thus effective.</li>
            <li>I am very happy wtth this product because it is impossible toi find in any stores near me and this is the only cream I like....</li>
            <li>I am usally a big fan of loreal products, but this particular product did not desearve any stars!</li>
            <li>I really like that this is not a heavy cream on my face especially at night time.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my skin soft, hydrated and its not greasy.</li>
            <li>I am 22 years old and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Also, I am highly sensitive to anything scented and this product is without smell.  </li>
            <li>really skin change different..</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive skin, but I didn&#x27;t get any troubles.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin and will break out with the drop of a hat, but this moisture cream works wonders.</li>
            <li>(I have sensitive skin) but prevents peeling from the cleanser.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and moist without being greasy.</li>
            <li>It leaves me skin feeling soft and pliable, not greasy or oily.  </li>
            <li>The moisture of it last whole day.</li>
            <li>Must have a skin allergy to this as my skin developed a rash from it.</li>
            <li>It has taken me a couple of years of trying different products to find something that really works on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I am 46 years old</li>
            <li>I also send jars of it to my daughter who lives in the far east.  </li>
            <li>She has extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It also provides a wonderful base for my moisturizer and hydration by L&#x27;Oreal</li>
            <li>First bought this cream a year ago and now I&#x27;m needing a third jar (I do alternate with another cream).</li>
            <li>My problem is, this product is becoming harder and harder to find on store shelves.&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE</li>
            <li>High prices aren&#x27;t necessary for quality skincare products.</li>
            <li>It absorbs into your skin without greasy or heavy residue, yet it deeply moisturizes leaving your skin feeling fresh and new!</li>
            <li>NOT get this product if you like your skin very matte or a bit dry - or IF you get this - you&#x27;ll need foundation/powder</li>
            <li>It was very watery and didn&#x27;t do anytching for my dry face.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Not for when you need major moisturizing</li>
            <li>I would rather have shiny, hydrated skin than the awfully dry skin that I normally have!  </li>
            <li>(I grew up in Long Island), as I got older</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin and many other brands work for the moment, but leave me feeling dry again in seconds.  </li>
            <li>It is such a fully hydrating cream that is not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>This is more thin than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>She loves L&#x27;Oreal lotion so much that she do not want to use other products.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell and texture of this creme, a very small amount goes a very very long way.</li>
            <li>I seriously have to go pat dry with a towel, because it looks like I&#x27;ve worked up a sincere sweat.  </li>
            <li>At 71 years old I have tried dozens of facial moisturizers in all price ranges and keep coming back to Hydra-Renewal.  </li>
            <li>I love to use this cream when my face is feeling especially tight and dry.  </li>
            <li>but there are several other L&#x27;Oreal skin products to do those jobs very well.</li>
            <li>This cream really let me down.</li>
            <li>Why pay high price for other brands is beyond me.</li>
            <li>I am 37 years old and have extremely dry skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive, prone to dermatitis and on the dry side, Even when I let myself be tempted by new, more expensive and well reviewed other brands, I keep coming back to this product.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin on my cheeks and nose; it gets sensitive, too.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s just a little too much.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Smells nice.</li>
            <li> It dissolves into my skin and leaves a nice dewy finish.  </li>
            <li> While it is an excellent product, I have to use too much to feel hydrated and cannot afford it on an ongoing basis.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m thrilled.  </li>

            <li> is very good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love</li>
            <li> I had lived in Texas for three years where I acquired many wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> Nice, light moisturizer for use every day under makeup.</li>
            <li> Since I have been using this stuff I haven&#x27;t had nearly as many problems with my sensitivity</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like I need to use makeup to make my skin look better now.    </li>

            <li> and it&#x27;s fabulous!</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer.</li>

            <li> Love this product.....</li>
            <li> I love Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this cream</li>
            <li> I am not using it any more.</li>
            <li> and I found this on Amazon which L&#x27;oreal was my favorite brand also.</li>
            <li> I love it because I think I need more moisturizer in SF and Loreal could provide moisturizer that I need.</li>
            <li> I love this for the winter.</li>
            <li> You pay more for it&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> This moisture cr&amp;egrave;me is okay.</li>
            <li> A must-have product to maintain youthful, healthy skin.  </li>
            <li> I love this cream.</li>
            <li> I love loreal products</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I did a bit of research before buying it, and I&#x27;m so glad it works with my skin.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite day cream.</li>
            <li> This does it for me, for the most part.</li>
            <li> The smell is light, the formula is light; it was just a good option for using a dab to stay hydrated without feeling greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem</li>
            <li> I love this cream because it keeps my skin hydrated ALL DAY.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight so it absorbs more thoroughly than I hoped for.</li>
            <li> i recommend the product you can buy it several times excellent bran</li>
            <li> and you can be confident</li>
            <li> ok I know that we should use SPF</li>
            <li> You will love the results.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> On Amazon I get a better price and have the auto delivery option</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> ; it serves better in the summer time.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find it everywhere, glad to see it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> So many others will work their way into my eyes during the day and burn like heck.  </li>
            <li> My favorite cream.</li>
            <li> Love this face cream.</li>
            <li> Please keep it in stock for others to enjoy!</li>
            <li> an will order many more..:)</li>
            <li> Love this cream...not sticky, does not cause zits, not oily.  </li>
            <li> This cream is by far my favorite moisturizer, it is light, smells good, penetrates the skin fast and is a wonderful moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> This works best for slightly dry skin.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone, 40 plus years old, but I feel the women in the 50 plus years catagory, as I am, would greatly benefit the most.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and love how smooth it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and refreshing.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance.</li>
            <li> It has relieved the dryness making skin smooth and feeling clean!</li>
            <li> and it was working fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super moisturizing, a must buy for winter!</li>
            <li> works well, smells good and rubs in easily with a soft skin affect.</li>
            <li> Also, I use a needling roller on my face which will sometimes cause the skin to dry and flake off (which is a good thing!)...</li>
            <li> and when I use something else I can tell a huge difference.</li>
            <li> It feels so comfortable all day.</li>
            <li> The application is very fluid which is great as I use it also on my eye lids.</li>
            <li> This product is available at Walmart, as well.</li>
            <li> I use at night, as it is so light on my face.</li>
            <li> I think for the price its great, and doesn&#x27;t make me break out and only have to put it on once</li>
            <li> Smooth surface after applying the cream.</li>
            <li> so this is really important at my age.</li>
            <li> And it feels light.</li>
            <li> I find it absolutely perfect for my skin and at such a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> - I don&#x27;t use foundation powder - as much as I struggle with my skin color (mostly I notice it - not too many others)</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s very economical too.  </li>
            <li> it is very useful for winter and summer.</li>
            <li> The benefits significantly outweigh the one fault that I have found.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s become more &amp; more difficult to find this product in the stores, so I was delighted when I found I could order it through Amazon!!</li>
            <li> I fell in love after my first use.  </li>
            <li> It was economical about 8 bucks!</li>
            <li> I changed up my cleanser and added this amazing moisture cream and its like I have new skin.</li>
            <li> Light and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> It has no smell and it is absorbed quite easily.</li>
            <li> The wrinkles are reduced but my face turned bright red splotchy.</li>
            <li> There is absolutely nothing better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is relatively inexpensive and therefore is a good buy for the money.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not a bad product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve grown to love it - leaves my extremely dry skin nicely moisturized.</li>
            <li> Not too great for me, but it might work for other people.</li>
            <li> Good moisture, but find the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Collagen Moisture FIller a little better,, like the fact has the collagen .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy or heavily scented and leaves my skin smooth and feeling great.</li>
            <li> I am lucky to find it at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> i love this moisture cream and decent price.</li>
            <li> the face is very soft, highly recommend, you will not regret, tamnien smells good.</li>
            <li> But I use foundation and a slight touch of L&#x27;Oreal or Bare Essential mineral powder which gives me a flawless complexion, I am 62 with good skin.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t give out a review usual, but this one is really good and make me want to share with you guys!</li>
            <li> This is a staple of my morning and night routine, its non greasy, sets into the skin well, and of course is very moisturizing!!</li>
            <li> and I am constantly asked how I keep my skin looking amazing at 48.</li>
            <li> If you are searching a kind of hydrate facial cream for day and night.</li>
            <li> So back to this cream, Loreal has always been a good product and reasonably priced</li>
            <li> Nothing miraculous, but applying it to a freshly washed face gives me a temporarily supple feeling.</li>
            <li> This is worth the money.</li>
            <li> The smell is simply clean and makes you feel good, and I am very sensitive towards fragrances in lotions especially on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is great if you have normal to dry skin as I do.</li>
            <li> I see great improvement in the skin texture and overall appearance, much better than when I use other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> immediately started to exfoliate as much as I could, and did my best to stay out of the sun but long story short, my skin was permanently darkened because my immune system was compromised.  </li>
            <li> Shortly after that is what I call \\&quot;the water stage,\\&quot; where as if by magic, my entire face seems to have a fine sheen of water just sitting right on top.  </li>
            <li> Nothing special really...</li>
            <li> Then I tried Loreal and it&#x27;s working better for me because it&#x27;s more moist than my previous product.</li>
            <li> With just a small amount, my skin is moisturized and feels great.  </li>
            <li> Its larger than my expected size and come with very good favor of smell.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, but this keeps my skin soft and smooth all day, without a greasy feel... and it has such a light pleasant fragrance.  </li>
            <li> A great product with a little price tag!!</li>
            <li> and I have been getting compliments since the day I first tried it.</li>
            <li> This is my first review of any product</li>
            <li> I switched from clinique Dramatically Different moisturizer to this one as it is more affordable.</li>
            <li> The product is exactly as stated.  </li>
            <li> First time using this product....</li>
            <li> I keep coming back to this product and its still lovely.</li>
            <li> I like feeling natural and free with my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Overall?</li>
            <li> And the price is not expensive.</li>
            <li> The first time I bought it was at Wal mart</li>
            <li> Of all the facial moisturizers that I&#x27;ve tried this is the only one that works with my facial skin the best.</li>
            <li> so I put facial powder on top of it ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed more breakouts recently.</li>
            <li> Because, (1) works great on my sensitive skin that can easily develop a red rash with other creams,</li>
            <li> If you can get over that and just dab your face with a dry towel or light powder, it really works well and makes your skin feel soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 4 out of 5 stars because it feels kind of greasy and looks slightly greasy/shiny.</li>
            <li> Price is also very decent.</li>
            <li> I really realized the natural beauty of your true skin color.</li>
            <li> Decent price!</li>
            <li> Non-pore-clogging, intense moisturizing creams can be very hard to find, but this is a great, cost-effective option.</li>
            <li> No false promises or fancy ingredients</li>
            <li> The amount of items I found this year at reasonable prices and fast shipping made my holiday shopping a breeze.</li>
            <li> thanks so much.</li>
            <li> This product non-like others sticky after you put on your face, it&#x27;s very creamy.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It has never broken me out, but ymmv.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> thanks again.</li>
            <li> The scent is very suttle as well.</li>
            <li> this product really work for me</li>
            <li> Feels very creamy.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t really go away ;</li>
            <li> It is very creamy, but not greasy</li>
            <li> I am very disapointed with this product.</li>
            <li> like I just applied it for the whole day, but it doesn&#x27;t feel that way to the touch.</li>
            <li> I expected more because it was loreal.</li>
            <li> Thank you amazon because it really works</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> It contains Shea Butter and my skin feels very moist.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I love the creme, will definitely re order, and for my break out sensitive prone skin, no issue either.</li>
            <li> You should try this, it&#x27;s not very expensive.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant scent, it has a creamy texture, and I did notice a positive change in my skins appearance after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend trying this if you have easily irritated skin and struggle with dry spots.</li>
            <li> but I particularly like this cream</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m from Indonesia, a tropical country with high humidity.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li> it has a little more moisture.</li>
            <li> It feels very cooling and soft when it goes on</li>
            <li> but I love this stuff for everyday use.</li>
            <li> My favorite moisturizer, not too heavy.</li>
            <li> (that were usually flaky) are always baby smooth, and I rarely have to exfoliate my face now.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed to discover that the product was not any more available where I live, but so relieved that it was available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I live in a desert climate and this is a god-sent.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feel very soft and I also like the smell.   </li>
            <li> Makes my skin very soft and elastic.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive combination skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have used this product for years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 67, live in the desert Southwest and experience many months of dry, dry heat</li>
            <li> I have tried many of the more expensive daily moisturizers from upscale product lines but for the price, this performs just as well.</li>
            <li> Despite super dry skin it sinks in with one quick application and the scent fades to nothingness</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin soft and supple even at age 71!</li>
            <li> But after I applied this on, wow~ I can say that is very soft.</li>
            <li> This is most likely due to the moisturizer because I am 36 yrs old and have not had problems with acne since my early 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Its made a definite positive impact on the look and feel of my skin.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer isn&#x27;t as good as other ones I&#x27;ve tried (leaves a weird residue, causes breakouts if I use it more than a couple times a week), but the pot packaging made it seem fancy and expensive, and thus effective.</li>
            <li> I am very happy wtth this product because it is impossible toi find in any stores near me and this is the only cream I like....</li>
            <li> I am usally a big fan of loreal products, but this particular product did not desearve any stars!</li>
            <li> I really like that this is not a heavy cream on my face especially at night time.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my skin soft, hydrated and its not greasy.</li>
            <li> I am 22 years old and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Also, I am highly sensitive to anything scented and this product is without smell.  </li>
            <li> really skin change different..</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive skin, but I didn&#x27;t get any troubles.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin and will break out with the drop of a hat, but this moisture cream works wonders.</li>
            <li> (I have sensitive skin) but prevents peeling from the cleanser.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft and moist without being greasy.</li>
            <li> It leaves me skin feeling soft and pliable, not greasy or oily.  </li>
            <li> The moisture of it last whole day.</li>
            <li> Must have a skin allergy to this as my skin developed a rash from it.</li>
            <li> It has taken me a couple of years of trying different products to find something that really works on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I am 46 years old</li>
            <li> I also send jars of it to my daughter who lives in the far east.  </li>
            <li> She has extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It also provides a wonderful base for my moisturizer and hydration by L&#x27;Oreal</li>
            <li> First bought this cream a year ago and now I&#x27;m needing a third jar (I do alternate with another cream).</li>
            <li> My problem is, this product is becoming harder and harder to find on store shelves.&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE</li>
            <li> High prices aren&#x27;t necessary for quality skincare products.</li>
            <li> It absorbs into your skin without greasy or heavy residue, yet it deeply moisturizes leaving your skin feeling fresh and new!</li>
            <li> NOT get this product if you like your skin very matte or a bit dry - or IF you get this - you&#x27;ll need foundation/powder</li>
            <li> It was very watery and didn&#x27;t do anytching for my dry face.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Not for when you need major moisturizing</li>
            <li> I would rather have shiny, hydrated skin than the awfully dry skin that I normally have!  </li>
            <li> (I grew up in Long Island), as I got older</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and many other brands work for the moment, but leave me feeling dry again in seconds.  </li>
            <li> It is such a fully hydrating cream that is not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> This is more thin than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> She loves L&#x27;Oreal lotion so much that she do not want to use other products.  </li>
            <li> Love the smell and texture of this creme, a very small amount goes a very very long way.</li>
            <li> I seriously have to go pat dry with a towel, because it looks like I&#x27;ve worked up a sincere sweat.  </li>
            <li> At 71 years old I have tried dozens of facial moisturizers in all price ranges and keep coming back to Hydra-Renewal.  </li>
            <li> I love to use this cream when my face is feeling especially tight and dry.  </li>
            <li> but there are several other L&#x27;Oreal skin products to do those jobs very well.</li>
            <li> This cream really let me down.</li>
            <li> Why pay high price for other brands is beyond me.</li>
            <li> I am 37 years old and have extremely dry skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive, prone to dermatitis and on the dry side, Even when I let myself be tempted by new, more expensive and well reviewed other brands, I keep coming back to this product.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin on my cheeks and nose; it gets sensitive, too.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just a little too much.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about a year now, I&#x27;m 44, and due to an immune disorder, I have Vitiligo, a VERY mild version of it, meaning, I&#x27;m still fairly pale but my skin is uneven</li>
            <li> and I do have older skin, but am not sure how younger, oily skin would take to it.  </li>
            <li> when i wear my Mac Studio Fix, I prefer to use Mac&#x27;s prep and prime , as with only the moisturizer it seems to make my make up just a bit uneven, not badly, but i saw a bit of a difference.&lt;br /&gt;Might try it under the Prep and Prime as I am not sure if the Prep and Prime will give my dry prone face enough</li>
            <li> It will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I have had no problems applying sunscreen directly after and didn&#x27;t end up with a greasy mess on my face.  </li>
            <li> The only face cream that keeps my dry skin hydrated without making it oily after a long day.</li>
            <li> With a little research on the L&#x27;Oreal website, I found out that its a 30 year old product so that explains why I couldn&#x27;t find it.  </li>
            <li> My skin is finally soft and not all dried out.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels plumper and firmer after application and it is a good make-up base.</li>
            <li> only criticism is that it is a small amount and doesn&#x27;t last long, about a month applying it twice daily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of other moisturizing creams and always go back to this one.  </li>
            <li> I will use this cream forever if it&#x27;s made that long!  </li>
            <li> I was on vacation and thought my skin was going to rip apart from being so dry.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely dry</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion because my face gets dry</li>
            <li> but I prefer that to dry and cakey looking&lt;</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin...</li>
            <li> and my face was constantly dry...</li>
            <li> and I can apply my makeuo without my skin looking so dry...</li>
            <li> I normally do not have issues with acne</li>
            <li> but since using this for the past 2 weeks I have developed 2 pimples.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it was because I had sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have ALWAYS used super expensive department store moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> So, when I came to SF the climate is very dry for me.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I had been having issues with dry skin and being allergic to other cleansers/moisturizers.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find in my area and more expensive when I can find it.  </li>
            <li> the product came sooner then expected in its boxes neat and stacked.</li>
            <li> After a few days, I realized that it takes a long time for my skin to dry after applying this cream.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I have recently been suffering from dry skin and my face looked so dull.</li>
            <li> NO THANKS!</li>
            <li> I like this one because I feel I can apply it anytime of the day when my face is feeling a little dry.</li>
            <li> I actually like that it&#x27;s a little heavy in the sense</li>
            <li> so I have to be very careful about what I pick out.</li>
            <li> Non like others are expensive but did not worth much!</li>
            <li> this cream is only around $6, which is way less than I&#x27;ve paid in the past for other lotions that don&#x27;t work as well!</li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again because it seems a little too wet for me.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way without being heavy on my skin.</li>
            <li> For me, not worth buying..</li>
            <li> At least give it a try, then come back and share your review.  </li>
            <li> All of the other products that I tried dried my skin out and some made me break out.  </li>
            <li> It seems to help with my slight discoloration and does NOT add to my yellowish tone that I have acquired&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My neck, chest and face look smoother with less lines from years of sun damage.</li>
            <li> my skin was a mess</li>
            <li> Its a little on the shiny side</li>
            <li> I just dab a little powder on my nose and a little to the sides under my eyes</li>
            <li> I guess I was expecting Pond&#x27;s thickness, but I didn&#x27;t want to buy Ponds which is a little greasy for me.</li>
            <li> I have tried more expensive creams only to be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> it can make my skin a little oily looking</li>
            <li> It made my face burn a little, stopped using it.</li>
            <li> I use it year round.</li>
            <li> I used it a few times and now it is sitting there.</li>
            <li> I like this product as it is quite moisturizing without leaving a heavy residue.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, heavy or scratchy at all.</li>
            <li> whenever applying any foundation my dry skin made it look horrible but thanks to this product my skin is never dry...</li>
            <li> After using this cream for about two weeks I noticed   that the line on my neck looked pale and the   wrinkles on my face have been reduced.    </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t want it to be soaked in an oily film like some face lotions I have encountered in the past.</li>
            <li> Now, even if I apply the thinnest layer to my face, using a dot smaller than the size of a pencil eraser, I get this weird greasy feeling all over.  </li>
            <li> Whenever I cleaned my face after the cleaner, few mins go, my face will start feeling dry and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> This is one of the very few products that I would probably buy again.</li>
            <li> and this is one of the very few creams that does not give her an allergic reaction.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s wrong with this product, and I&#x27;m holding onto it to try in the dry winter months, but I&#x27;m not optimistic.  </li>
            <li> but I had a hard time finding it anywhere else.  </li>
            <li> This product makes my face look dull and my make up cakes on the morning after I wear it at night.  </li>
            <li> Well, too late ;-( about 12 years after running around Lady Bird Lake here in Austin, I came home and my skin was a yellowish tint.  </li>
            <li> I have used L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Hydra-Renewal Cream for at least 14 years, maybe longer.  </li>
            <li> Thick but not greasy.</li>
            <li> This stuff is seriously hydrating.</li>
            <li> Just what I need for protecting my face from the cold and dry weather.</li>
            <li> There was subtle tingling on face once applied.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical when I placed the order for this cream.  </li>
            <li> but not great</li>
            <li> Its thin and watery.</li>
            <li> The description and the reviews I read before buying it made me decide to try it, but unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
            <li> Very thin consistency.</li>
            <li> I have tried all kinds of moisturizers and have found a lot of disappointment.</li>
            <li> I am not used to cold weather</li>
            <li> I have yet to find makeup that doesn&#x27;t irritate my cheeks, so I&#x27;m always very wary of getting face cream.</li>
            <li> is, either they changed the formula or I got a bad batch.  </li>
            <li> When I purchase face cream I expect it to have a creamy base, but it is runny almost as if it has been deluted with water, or somthing.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like dot-to-dot puzzles and this one is indeed a challenge.  I love it.&lt;br /&gt;It was well-packaged and I would buy from this buyer again if I had the chance.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff. Why pay high price for other brands is beyond me.</li>
            <li> This face cream is great for my skin. It wasn&#x27;t greasy and left my skin, especially under my eyes, feeling hydrated. I use it just before bed every night. After about 3 weeks, my skin had cleared up. After being hydrated so well, it wasn&#x27;t as irritated and I didn&#x27;t break out anymore.</li>
            <li> I like it.&lt;br /&gt;It is very good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I initially liked this product when I started using it.  After a few days, I realized that it takes a long time for my skin to dry after applying this cream.  I changed my makeup routine to allow for extra drying time so that my face powder would not be applied to damp skin.  Yes, it does do a nice job of moisturizing but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again because it seems a little too wet for me.  I normally do not have issues with acne but since using this for the past 2 weeks I have developed 2 pimples.  This is most likely due to the moisturizer because I am 36 yrs old and have not had problems with acne since my early 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I had lived in Texas for three years where I acquired many wrinkles.  I also have deep horizontal line across my neck that I have had  all my life. After using this cream for about two weeks I noticed   that the line on my neck looked pale and the   wrinkles on my face have been reduced.    It leaves my skin feel very soft and I also like the smell.   I would describe the smell as feminine and relaxing.    I would recommend it to others in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> Nice, light moisturizer for use every day under makeup. If you are looking for anti aging or night cream, this isn&#x27;t it but there are several other L&#x27;Oreal skin products to do those jobs very well. Not for when you need major moisturizing but I love this stuff for everyday use. Keeps my skin soft, hydrated and its not greasy. I have tried many of the more expensive daily moisturizers from upscale product lines but for the price, this performs just as well. You can&#x27;t beat this product.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect \\&quot;light\\&quot; moisturizer for summer, and you can&#x27;t get it in the stores anymore so I hunt all over to get the product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer for several years. My skin is very sensitive, prone to dermatitis and on the dry side, Even when I let myself be tempted by new, more expensive and well reviewed other brands, I keep coming back to this product. It feels so comfortable all day.It does not make my eyes water and my skin feels moist from morning to night. The application is very fluid which is great as I use it also on my eye lids. I see great improvement in the skin texture and overall appearance, much better than when I use other moisturizers. Some people might object to the fact it can make the face shiny. But I use foundation and a slight touch of L&#x27;Oreal or Bare Essential mineral powder which gives me a flawless complexion, I am 62 with good skin. I was so disappointed to discover that the product was not any more available where I live, but so relieved that it was available on Amazon. I hope they never discontinue it. A great product with a little price tag!!</li>
            <li> I am 22 years old and I have sensitive skin. My skin dries out and I get hives a lot. Since I have been using this stuff I haven&#x27;t had nearly as many problems with my sensitivity and my skin feels great. I have tried all kinds of moisturizers and have found a lot of disappointment. I bought this Hyrda Renewal earlier this week and I have been getting compliments since the day I first tried it. It doesn&#x27;t smell the best but it works great. I would steer away from using a lot though. Its a little on the shiny side but it makes a great base for powder. I just dab a little powder on my nose and a little to the sides under my eyes and I look great! I don&#x27;t feel like I need to use makeup to make my skin look better now.    I gave this product 4 out of 5 stars because it feels kind of greasy and looks slightly greasy/shiny. (I would give it 4 1/2 stars if I had the option)I know it is supposed to make you look radiant or whatever but it&#x27;s just a little too much.  If you can get over that and just dab your face with a dry towel or light powder, it really works well and makes your skin feel soft and healthy. The benefits significantly outweigh the one fault that I have found.</li>
            <li> Love this cream for my face. Feels good and I believe it makes my skin look good.</li>
            <li> I had been having issues with dry skin and being allergic to other cleansers/moisturizers. I was on vacation and thought my skin was going to rip apart from being so dry. I found this and bought it and it&#x27;s fabulous! I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a year and when I use something else I can tell a huge difference. Love this moisturizer. It&#x27;s not greasy or heavily scented and leaves my skin smooth and feeling great.</li>
            <li> This is my first review of any product but I couldn&#x27;t pass up the opportunity to say &amp;#34;this is an amazing cream&amp;#34;. I had used this for about 2 months and my mother complimented my skin. When I needed to purchase more, I could not find it...so I bought a more expensive cream and my skin just wasn&#x27;t the same. I searched and and found it again . I love this stuff! My wrinkles just seem to melt away after one use!</li>
            <li> My favorite moisturizer, not too heavy. I use it year round.</li>
            <li> This is more thin than I thought it would be. I guess I was expecting Pond&#x27;s thickness, but I didn&#x27;t want to buy Ponds which is a little greasy for me. Hydra Renewal smells so nice and feels good going on. It doesn&#x27;t go on oily and soaks into my skin well. I have no problems using it on my face, around my eyes and neck area. I have had no problems applying sunscreen directly after and didn&#x27;t end up with a greasy mess on my face.  I like the price, too, which is affordable. This product is available at Walmart, as well.</li>
            <li> Love this product.....I saw a difference in just 2 days.</li>
            <li> I love Amazon. The amount of items I found this year at reasonable prices and fast shipping made my holiday shopping a breeze. I love this cream and I got it at a great price..thanks so much.</li>
            <li> I was looking for some real good moisturizer when I decided to buy this. The description and the reviews I read before buying it made me decide to try it, but unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work for me. Perhaps, it depends on the type of skin, as they say... I don&#x27;t know. I used it a few times and now it is sitting there. I am not using it any more. For me, not worth buying..</li>
            <li> I bought for my mom.  She loves L&#x27;Oreal lotion so much that she do not want to use other products.  I also bought for my wife.</li>
            <li> I was searching everything for a facial cream that can keep the moisture all day. and I found this on Amazon which L&#x27;oreal was my favorite brand also. So I take a step in and try this. It was so great! Its larger than my expected size and come with very good favor of smell. You can feel its cream are very smooth. Whenever I cleaned my face after the cleaner, few mins go, my face will start feeling dry and uncomfortable. But after I applied this on, wow~ I can say that is very soft. This product non-like others sticky after you put on your face, it&#x27;s very creamy. People! If you are searching a kind of hydrate facial cream for day and night. You should try this, it&#x27;s not very expensive. Non like others are expensive but did not worth much! I given 5 stars for this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t give out a review usual, but this one is really good and make me want to share with you guys!</li>
            <li> This is a basic moisturizer that works! I switched from clinique Dramatically Different moisturizer to this one as it is more affordable. It keeps the skin well moisturized for hours even in winter. A little goes a long way so it&#x27;s very economical too.  I use make up after apply this cream and have never had issues with dryness or cakeing of the make up or bronzer. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  No false promises or fancy ingredients and I am constantly asked how I keep my skin looking amazing at 48.</li>
            <li> I have been religiously using this product for about three or maybe four years. When I started using Retin A my skin was a mess and I needed something to combat the red, peeling skin. This stuff is seriously hydrating. My skin wakes up glowing and my foundation looks beautiful when applied in the morning. It has never broken me out, but ymmv.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only criticism is that it is a small amount and doesn&#x27;t last long, about a month applying it twice daily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very suitable for my skin. I&#x27;m from Indonesia, a tropical country with high humidity. So, when I came to SF the climate is very dry for me. I use Garnier when I was in Indonesia. I was using it as well during in SF and it was working fine. Then I tried Loreal and it&#x27;s working better for me because it&#x27;s more moist than my previous product. I love it because I think I need more moisturizer in SF and Loreal could provide moisturizer that I need.</li>
            <li> I love this for the winter. There is absolutely nothing better. If you have dry skin but you don&#x27;t want that greasy feeling and look, then you want to try this.</li>
            <li> the product came sooner then expected in its boxes neat and stacked. Sealed correctly and I am very happy buying from this customer. The product is exactly as stated.  thanks again.</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely dry this puts hydration back in my skin. It also provides a wonderful base for my moisturizer and hydration by L&#x27;Oreal</li>
            <li> Good moisture, but find the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Collagen Moisture FIller a little better,, like the fact has the collagen . You pay more for it&lt;br /&gt;and it has a little more moisture.</li>
            <li> Great moisture cream.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and texture of this creme, a very small amount goes a very very long way. The smell is simply clean and makes you feel good, and I am very sensitive towards fragrances in lotions especially on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I did try this out under my make up, when i wear my Mac Studio Fix, I prefer to use Mac&#x27;s prep and prime , as with only the moisturizer it seems to make my make up just a bit uneven, not badly, but i saw a bit of a difference.&lt;br /&gt;Might try it under the Prep and Prime as I am not sure if the Prep and Prime will give my dry prone face enough moisture.&lt;br /&gt;But i do love using this moisturizer to use with my cinema secrets creme foundation pallet, (must try ladies, and amazing beauty product)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I love the creme, will definitely re order, and for my break out sensitive prone skin, no issue either. Definitely recommend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product every morning for 30 years...and love it!  I have very dry skin, but this keeps my skin soft and smooth all day, without a greasy feel... and it has such a light pleasant fragrance.  It&#x27;s become more &amp; more difficult to find this product in the stores, so I was delighted when I found I could order it through Amazon!!</li>
            <li> This cream captivated me, leaves the skin very soft, and the price is the best ... would buy again and again .... the face is very soft, highly recommend, you will not regret, tamnien smells good.</li>
            <li> First time using this product....works well, smells good and rubs in easily with a soft skin affect. Will definitely order this again.</li>
            <li> I really like that this is not a heavy cream on my face especially at night time.  The scent is very suttle as well.</li>
            <li> I Love! Hydra Renewal - It is such a fully hydrating cream that is not heavy or greasy. Also, I am highly sensitive to anything scented and this product is without smell.  Just a wonderful product</li>
            <li> this product really work for me had no rash on my skin or bump..i notice about week using this product really skin change different..the seller ship it real good and fast too had no prob ...</li>
            <li> This moisture cr&amp;egrave;me is okay. Very thin consistency. I use at night, as it is so light on my face.</li>
            <li> A must-have product to maintain youthful, healthy skin.  Applies both day and night.  For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
            <li> The only face cream that keeps my dry skin hydrated without making it oily after a long day. Works great under my makeup also.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion because my face gets dry but I don&#x27;t want it to be soaked in an oily film like some face lotions I have encountered in the past. I like this one because I feel I can apply it anytime of the day when my face is feeling a little dry. It does not make my face shiny and it smells good. For a cheaper lotion, I think this is a winner.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive skin, but I didn&#x27;t get any troubles. It&#x27;s super moisturizing, a must buy for winter!</li>
            <li> This is the third time I have purchased this product through Amazon. I find it absolutely perfect for my skin and at such a reasonable price.  I have tried more expensive creams only to be disappointed.  I keep coming back to this product and its still lovely.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and love how smooth it makes my skin feel. Does not clog my pores, no greasiness. Makes my skin very soft and elastic. I highly recommend this product. A little goes a long way, easy to apply. Feels very creamy.</li>
            <li> I love this cream. I&#x27;s very good for my skin. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for years because it doesn&#x27;t make me break out like just about everything else does, and it keeps my face nicely hydrated all day.</li>
            <li> This is my go to cream during the summer.  It&#x27;s light and refreshing. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin looking oily or greasy.  I have very sensitive combination skin so I have to be very careful about what I pick out.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face every nite before bed.Been using this product for a couple years.I love loreal products</li>
            <li> I love to use this cream when my face is feeling especially tight and dry.  Also, I use a needling roller on my face which will sometimes cause the skin to dry and flake off (which is a good thing!)...this cream is very good to rehydrate during this period.  For any price this would be a great moisturizer...so it&#x27;s an especially great bargain at the Amazon price!</li>
            <li> Best Moisturizer ever</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I did a bit of research before buying it, and I&#x27;m so glad it works with my skin. I have very dry skin on my cheeks and nose; it gets sensitive, too. I have yet to find makeup that doesn&#x27;t irritate my cheeks, so I&#x27;m always very wary of getting face cream. This stuff hydrates so well. My cheeks (that were usually flaky) are always baby smooth, and I rarely have to exfoliate my face now. It feels fresher and healthier. I highly recommend trying this if you have easily irritated skin and struggle with dry spots.</li>
            <li> This cream is by far my favorite moisturizer, it is light, smells good, penetrates the skin fast and is a wonderful moisturizer. Price is also very decent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about a year now, I&#x27;m 44, and due to an immune disorder, I have Vitiligo, a VERY mild version of it, meaning, I&#x27;m still fairly pale but my skin is uneven and my face is darker than it used to be.  I used to have peaches and cream skin (Irish, German &amp; Italian heritage) but when I moved to Texas, it seemed like my skin disorder was activated.  Anyway, even tho&#x27; growing up I wanted darker skin and tanned (I grew up in Long Island), as I got older I really realized the natural beauty of your true skin color. Well, too late ;-( about 12 years after running around Lady Bird Lake here in Austin, I came home and my skin was a yellowish tint.  It was almost as if I&#x27;d gotten a sunburn but it didn&#x27;t really go away ;-(&lt;br /&gt;I immediately started to exfoliate as much as I could, and did my best to stay out of the sun but long story short, my skin was permanently darkened because my immune system was compromised.  So back to this cream, Loreal has always been a good product and reasonably priced but I particularly like this cream because&lt;br /&gt;1. It feels very cooling and soft when it goes on&lt;br /&gt;2. No filmy feel to it on your skin&lt;br /&gt;3. I actually like that it&#x27;s a little heavy in the sense it can make my skin a little oily looking but I prefer that to dry and cakey looking&lt;br /&gt;4. It&#x27;s cheap!&lt;br /&gt;5. It seems to help with my slight discoloration and does NOT add to my yellowish tone that I have acquired&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do NOT get this product if you like your skin very matte or a bit dry - or IF you get this - you&#x27;ll need foundation/powder - I don&#x27;t use foundation powder - as much as I struggle with my skin color (mostly I notice it - not too many others) I don&#x27;t like foundation.  I like feeling natural and free with my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Overall? This is my favorite day cream.</li>
            <li> Not too great for me, but it might work for other people.</li>
            <li> This is great if you have normal to dry skin as I do. I think for the price its great, and doesn&#x27;t make me break out and only have to put it on once and I am hydrated the rest of the day!</li>
            <li> I have recently been suffering from dry skin and my face looked so dull. I changed up my cleanser and added this amazing moisture cream and its like I have new skin. It absorbs quickly and the results are amazing. Its made a definite positive impact on the look and feel of my skin. I put it on auto-delivery, cause I don&#x27;t ever expect to have to look for another moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin and will break out with the drop of a hat, but this moisture cream works wonders. A little goes a long way without being heavy on my skin.</li>
            <li> I use this at night after washing my face with a salycilic acid cleanser. It stings a tiny bit (I have sensitive skin) but prevents peeling from the cleanser. It leaves my skin soft and moist without being greasy. Non-pore-clogging, intense moisturizing creams can be very hard to find, but this is a great, cost-effective option.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit greasy but I like it.  I have very dry skin and I crave lots of moisture.  This does it for me, for the most part. I use a tiny bit morning and night and there is still a lot left in the tube. It will last a very long time. This is one of the very few products that I would probably buy again.</li>
            <li> I have ALWAYS used super expensive department store moisturizers.  I am 53 and was on vacation and forgot my creams.  I wanted an inexpensive moisturizer just to get me through until I got home.  I went into Amazon and MakeUpAlley.com to check reviews of drug store creams.  This one seemed popular and moisturizing (my necessity).  I fell in love after my first use.  I may even make this my HG moisturizer. I know my husband would be happy, lol.  It is very creamy, but not greasy and I do have older skin, but am not sure how younger, oily skin would take to it.  But drugstores and amazon give 100% refund.  I suggest you give it a try.</li>
            <li> Despite super dry skin it sinks in with one quick application and the scent fades to nothingness</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical when I placed the order for this cream.  I hadn&#x27;t used it before, but I guarantee you I will purchase again.  It leaves me skin feeling soft and pliable, not greasy or oily.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I had been using Hydra renewal moisture cream years ago. I couldnt find it in anywhere in Canada in recent years. I am lucky to find it at Amazon.com. The moisture of it last whole day. And the price is not expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this before at the drugstore and used it until it was gone.  The smell is light, the formula is light; it was just a good option for using a dab to stay hydrated without feeling greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem is, either they changed the formula or I got a bad batch.  Now, even if I apply the thinnest layer to my face, using a dot smaller than the size of a pencil eraser, I get this weird greasy feeling all over.  Shortly after that is what I call \\&quot;the water stage,\\&quot; where as if by magic, my entire face seems to have a fine sheen of water just sitting right on top.  I seriously have to go pat dry with a towel, because it looks like I&#x27;ve worked up a sincere sweat.  I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s wrong with this product, and I&#x27;m holding onto it to try in the dry winter months, but I&#x27;m not optimistic.  At this point, I would not order it again.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin...this definitely helped me...I am not used to cold weather and my face was constantly dry...whenever applying any foundation my dry skin made it look horrible but thanks to this product my skin is never dry...and I can apply my makeuo without my skin looking so dry...</li>
            <li> I am very disapointed with this product. When I purchase face cream I expect it to have a creamy base, but it is runny almost as if it has been deluted with water, or somthing. It has a stong perfummy smell, which I do not like, either.  It feels like I am putting perfume on my face. It made my face burn a little, stopped using it. I am usally a big fan of loreal products, but this particular product did not desearve any stars!</li>
            <li> I am 37 years old and have extremely dry skin.  I love this cream because it keeps my skin hydrated ALL DAY.  I noticed in the comments that some people didn&#x27;t like this cream because it&#x27;s greasy.  It does look a bit shiny on your skin but I don&#x27;t wear makeup (foundation or powder) so I don&#x27;t mind the shine.  I would rather have shiny, hydrated skin than the awfully dry skin that I normally have!  The best part:  this cream is only around $6, which is way less than I&#x27;ve paid in the past for other lotions that don&#x27;t work as well!</li>
            <li> This is a staple of my morning and night routine, its non greasy, sets into the skin well, and of course is very moisturizing!!</li>
            <li> This is a good product which moisturizes well.&lt;br /&gt;It is relatively inexpensive and therefore is a good buy for the money.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have used this product for years. I was really delighted to find it here.</li>
            <li> Just what I need for protecting my face from the cold and dry weather. It works well for neutral skin.</li>
            <li> I am very happy wtth this product because it is impossible toi find in any stores near me and this is the only cream I like....</li>
            <li> Nothing miraculous, but applying it to a freshly washed face gives me a temporarily supple feeling. It&#x27;s lightweight so it absorbs more thoroughly than I hoped for. I think my face LOOKS like I just applied it for the whole day, but it doesn&#x27;t feel that way to the touch. Not a bad product but I won&#x27;t be rushing to buy once I run out.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer isn&#x27;t as good as other ones I&#x27;ve tried (leaves a weird residue, causes breakouts if I use it more than a couple times a week), but the pot packaging made it seem fancy and expensive, and thus effective. 5 stars for outstanding placebo effect!</li>
            <li> good price good product good presentation i recommend the product you can buy it several times excellent bran and you can be confident</li>
            <li> we like this product a lot!</li>
            <li> ok I know that we should use SPF but anytime I do that, it stings my eyes for hours. unless I apply lotion like they do on TV. Who has time for that? Ive been using this cream for years now and it&#x27;s just the best.</li>
            <li> I had given up finding this cream and am thrilled to find it on Amazon.  It is wonderful and seals in the moisture.  I wear it under my tinted moisturizer and under my makeup.  Smooth surface after applying the cream.</li>
            <li> This product is wondderfuum designed. Creamy and moist. It radiates the skin and keeps it glowing. You will love the results.</li>
            <li> Must have a skin allergy to this as my skin developed a rash from it.</li>
            <li> Bought this product because I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere! I Had used the product before, and had been pleased with it! PROS: It has a pleasant scent, it has a creamy texture, and I did notice a positive change in my skins appearance after only a few uses. CONS:    There was subtle tingling on face once applied. Not sure if it was because I had sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Good product for ladies skin - my GF is happy using it and will recommend to my friends. Besides price is affordable.</li>
            <li> I have tried many moisturizers but none keep my face looking as good as this one.  It lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Perfect day and night cream! Smells nice. I love it. Would recommend it and buy it again! So far the best loreal cream.</li>
            <li> This cream really let me down. I expected more because it was loreal. It was very watery and didn&#x27;t do anytching for my dry face.</li>
            <li> At 71 years old I have tried dozens of facial moisturizers in all price ranges and keep coming back to Hydra-Renewal.  It dissolves into my skin and leaves a nice dewy finish.  My skin feels plumper and firmer after application and it is a good make-up base. I have very dry skin and many other brands work for the moment, but leave me feeling dry again in seconds.  It is hard to find in my area and more expensive when I can find it.  On Amazon I get a better price and have the auto delivery option so I never run out.  I know that Lancôme makes L&#x27;Oreal, and I have used their Absolue cream at ten times the price.  While it is an excellent product, I have to use too much to feel hydrated and cannot afford it on an ongoing basis.  It is wonderful that their lower price line does not diminish the quality of their products.  I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> It has taken me a couple of years of trying different products to find something that really works on my skin.  All of the other products that I tried dried my skin out and some made me break out.  With just a small amount, my skin is moisturized and feels great.  The first time I bought it was at Wal mart but I had a hard time finding it anywhere else.  Wal mart stopped carrying it too.  With a little research on the L&#x27;Oreal website, I found out that its a 30 year old product so that explains why I couldn&#x27;t find it.  Thank you amazon because it really works and I need it.  I&#x27;ll just have to keep buying it online.  My skin is finally soft and not all dried out.  I am 46 years old so this is really important at my age.</li>
            <li> Well i bought this cream because its have vitamin B5 and i used a similar cream with that vitamin and it was the best its just that i cant find it anymore, however about this Loreal&#x27;s cream ummm it help u to recover ur skin after any treatment like microdermobrasion the problem is that its greasy so that is why  i recommend to use it at night. Nothing special really... i wont buy it again.</li>
            <li> Do not like this product. The wrinkles are reduced but my face turned bright red splotchy. Like I was allergic. NO THANKS!</li>
            <li> No dryness, no oily feel...very good and perfect for combination skin especially in winters! It has relieved the dryness making skin smooth and feeling clean!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay but not great; it serves better in the summer time.</li>
            <li> I love this product.This is much better than some of the expensive moisture creams I have used. Light and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> This product makes my face look dull and my make up cakes on the morning after I wear it at night.  Its thin and watery. I accidently rubbed it in my eyes and they burned for 30 minutes.  I purchased because of the good price.  Won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> I like this product as it is quite moisturizing without leaving a heavy residue. This works best for slightly dry skin. It has no smell and it is absorbed quite easily.</li>
            <li> First bought this cream a year ago and now I&#x27;m needing a third jar (I do alternate with another cream). I&#x27;ve grown to love it - leaves my extremely dry skin nicely moisturized. And it feels light. Can&#x27;t find it everywhere, glad to see it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Of all the facial moisturizers that I&#x27;ve tried this is the only one that works with my facial skin the best. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, heavy or scratchy at all. It does look shiny so I put facial powder on top of it ;)</li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t feel moisturized after using this product. It does feel greasy though. I&#x27;ve also noticed more breakouts recently.</li>
            <li> I have used this moisturizer for years.  It is the best for me.  Never seen a need to change.  Keeps my skin soft and supple even at age 71!</li>
            <li> I have used L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Hydra-Renewal Cream for at least 14 years, maybe longer.  I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of other moisturizing creams and always go back to this one.  The reasons? Because, (1) works great on my sensitive skin that can easily develop a red rash with other creams, (2) keeps my aging skin in good condition, (3) the price, (4) this cream doesn&#x27;t affect my eyes.  So many others will work their way into my eyes during the day and burn like heck.  Never with Hydra-Renewal.  I also send jars of it to my daughter who lives in the far east.  She has extremely sensitive skin and this is one of the very few creams that does not give her an allergic reaction.  My problem is, this product is becoming harder and harder to find on store shelves.&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE L&#x27;Oreal, don&#x27;t stop making Hydra-Renewal.</li>
            <li> i love this moisture cream and decent price. it is very useful for winter and summer. Decent price! yay !</li>
            <li> Somewhat sticky, does not have a good smell. Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I will use this cream forever if it&#x27;s made that long!  I&#x27;ve been using this for three years and I&#x27;m thrilled.  I&#x27;m 67, live in the desert Southwest and experience many months of dry, dry heat and it is the ONLY cream that helps my skin.  I&#x27;ve given up Este Lauder, Clinique, Elizabeth Arden and all the department store and QVC products!  High prices aren&#x27;t necessary for quality skincare products.</li>
            <li> My favorite cream. I re-order everytime I am running low and never have to worry about having it. Excellent product and great, fast service/ thanks</li>
            <li> Love this face cream. Thick but not greasy.</li>
            <li> This smells wonderful light and not overpowering, a soft floral or rose... It was economical about 8 bucks! It contains Shea Butter and my skin feels very moist. I live in a desert climate and this is a god-sent. Please keep it in stock for others to enjoy! Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li> This is a amazing moisturizing cream.. I use it in Winter as well as in summer... its very smooth to apply... I ordered it 4 times now... an will order many more..:)</li>
            <li> good price, my wife like it..</li>
            <li> This cream is absolutely The Very Best!!! I discovered it by accident, well after a months daily use twice a day I&#x27;ve noticed and feel a big difference in my skin. I&#x27;ve had friends and family notice the improvment on my skin as well. My neck, chest and face look smoother with less lines from years of sun damage. It absorbs into your skin without greasy or heavy residue, yet it deeply moisturizes leaving your skin feeling fresh and new! I would recommend this product to anyone, 40 plus years old, but I feel the women in the 50 plus years catagory, as I am, would greatly benefit the most. This is worth the money. At least give it a try, then come back and share your review.  I&#x27;m sure people that try this will agree this is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> Love this cream...not sticky, does not cause zits, not oily.  It blends in well, hydrates well. Have had ppl tell me they never thought I was my age since using this...happy bout that!</li>
