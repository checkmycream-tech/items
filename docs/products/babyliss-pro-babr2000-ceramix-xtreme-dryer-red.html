            <li>Love this blow dryer!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>The volume of air isn&#x27;t as good as I was hoping, given the greater wattage.  </li>
            <li>so I had to get my own. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied and the price was right!!</li>
            <li>Pros:  Powerful, good locations of switches,</li>
            <li>Need I say more?</li>
            <li>I thought I would try a better quality hair dryer this time, and chose this one based on the reviews and the price.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just OK.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced and a time saver!!!!</li>
            <li>We&#x27;d strongly recommend this dryer.</li>
            <li>I personally LOVE the bold color.</li>
            <li>It has many settings and it dries my hair so quickly.</li>
            <li>Works great and is quiet!!!!!</li>
            <li>Seems OK but don&#x27;t really see where it is better than $20 hairdryer.  </li>
            <li>But so far, so good.</li>
            <li>Very powerful unit.</li>
            <li>She tells me it&#x27;s rubberized coating makes it easy to hold and the heat is quick and adequate.</li>
            <li>It is holding its own as far as durability</li>
            <li>It really, really does shorten drying time!!</li>
            <li>lots of power and hot, but doesn&#x27;t burn hair...love it!</li>
            <li>and it is powerful.  </li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>Powerful..</li>
            <li>just right.  </li>
            <li>It blow drys my hair very fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for several days now, and have to say it&#x27;s just OK.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had this for a couple weeks now, but I love it.</li>
            <li>It dries fast, but not necessarily because it pushes out more air than others.</li>
            <li>Amazing what a few extra bucks can buy :)</li>
            <li>Make sure to understand that you are comparing this to other &amp;#34;like&amp;#34; dryers.</li>
            <li>I assume this one will be just as lovely as the previous one.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like it as well as my older ConAir.  </li>
            <li>WOW!!</li>
            <li>The wattage is higher, which seems to be why the hottest heat setting is the hottest I&#x27;ve ever had in a dryer, which really isn&#x27;t necessary.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to say this baby dries my hair in less than HALF THE TIME!!!</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>This puts out a very major blast of air.</li>
            <li>A bit heavy but quick work</li>
            <li>This has a ceramic element to it which is a completely different &#x27;drying experience&#x27; to the old electric elements.</li>
            <li>Normally it would take me forever to blow dry but this item cuts that time to about 7-8 min tops.</li>

            <li> Normally it would take me forever to blow dry but this item cuts that time to about 7-8 min tops.</li>
            <li> controls are flat buttons with a groove in each.  </li>
            <li> You can read the technical details in other reviews, but for about $10 more than the cheaper alternatives, I think you&#x27;d be silly not to choose the BaByliss Pro.</li>
            <li> The cord is very long, but I don&#x27;t need it to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cold shot button works fine, as expected.  </li>
            <li> quiet, narrow air flow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  </li>
            <li> (Her&#x27;s is pink.)  </li>
            <li> I have had this problem with other dryers</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m disappointed as I wanted this to be better than it is.  </li>
            <li> I have thick coarse 4b hair.</li>
            <li> but I have purchase this dryer before in black as a Christmas gift for sister.</li>
            <li> I have very long very thick hair that is a pain to dry.</li>
            <li> A bit on the heavy side however.</li>
            <li> My only regret is I have a hard time turning it on and off with the way the on/off switch is so flush to the handle!!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re slick (shiny plastic) and flush with the handle.</li>
            <li> I have thick hairs so the heat works for me well.</li>
            <li> They can be a little difficult to use, you have to press against them</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very difficult to use the buttons.  </li>

            <li> It works well but it&#x27;s very difficult to use the buttons.  They&#x27;re slick (shiny plastic) and flush with the handle.</li>
            <li> It really, really does shorten drying time!! WOW!! I personally LOVE the bold color. My only regret is I have a hard time turning it on and off with the way the on/off switch is so flush to the handle!! I have had this problem with other dryers so wonder if I just have slippery fingers in the morning? Still, can&#x27;t give it 5 stars when I struggle to turn it on/off.</li>
            <li> Took 8 minutes off my drying time.</li>
            <li> Love this blow dryer!</li>
            <li> lots of power and hot, but doesn&#x27;t burn hair...love it!</li>
            <li> Gave as a gift and the recipient loved it. Said it added lots of volume to her hair and loved the crimson/red color!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife Christmas &#x27;14 and she really loved it.  It works great and all of the women in her family ask to use it when they stay with us.  It is holding its own as far as durability and it is powerful.  My wife mentioned that it has shortened her drying time.</li>
            <li> Good hair dryer.  A bit on the heavy side however.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my wife. She loves it. She had a different brand and it did not work as well.</li>
            <li> Pros:  Powerful, good locations of switches, quiet, narrow air flow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Heavier than I like.</li>
            <li> I got this for the wife and she&#x27;s delighted. Need I say more? She tells me it&#x27;s rubberized coating makes it easy to hold and the heat is quick and adequate. The unit is quite and gets the job done in good fashion. We&#x27;d strongly recommend this dryer. Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Love it! Works great and is quiet!!!!!</li>
            <li> Seems OK but don&#x27;t really see where it is better than $20 hairdryer.  Maybe it will last longer.</li>
            <li> Great power, very good product. It&#x27;s only been a week since I received it, so I can&#x27;t talk about its longevity. But so far, so good.</li>
            <li> Very powerful unit. A bit heavy but quick work</li>
            <li> Love the dryer it is great everything you would want.</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing!  My hair cutter has one.  (Her&#x27;s is pink.)  This puts out a very major blast of air.</li>
            <li> Wow. I have very long very thick hair that is a pain to dry. I&#x27;m happy to say this baby dries my hair in less than HALF THE TIME!!! Amazing what a few extra bucks can buy :) trust me ladies, . This is a great blow drier!!  Powerful.. Reasonably priced and a time saver!!!!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is wonderful. It has many settings and it dries my hair so quickly. I&#x27;m very satisfied and the price was right!!</li>
            <li> I thought I would try a better quality hair dryer this time, and chose this one based on the reviews and the price.  I&#x27;ve used it for several days now, and have to say it&#x27;s just OK.  I don&#x27;t like it as well as my older ConAir.  The wattage is higher, which seems to be why the hottest heat setting is the hottest I&#x27;ve ever had in a dryer, which really isn&#x27;t necessary.  It tends to make my hair staticy.  The volume of air isn&#x27;t as good as I was hoping, given the greater wattage.  Maybe I just don&#x27;t understand wattage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The controls are flat buttons with a groove in each.  They can be a little difficult to use, you have to press against them just right.  I find the on/off switch is easier to move than the temperature switch.  The cold shot button works fine, as expected.  The cord is very long, but I don&#x27;t need it to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m disappointed as I wanted this to be better than it is.  It&#x27;s just OK.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, and won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> My daughter requested the dryer for Christmas.  This is her 2 and one.  She loves it.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this product. I have thick hairs so the heat works for me well.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten to use this item yet but I have purchase this dryer before in black as a Christmas gift for sister. I ended up being the one who used that product all the time. It blow drys my hair very fast. I have thick coarse 4b hair. Normally it would take me forever to blow dry but this item cuts that time to about 7-8 min tops. I assume this one will be just as lovely as the previous one. I had to purchase another because sister is moving so I had to get my own. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it. I&#x27;ve only had this for a couple weeks now, but I love it. Make sure to understand that you are comparing this to other &amp;#34;like&amp;#34; dryers. This has a ceramic element to it which is a completely different &#x27;drying experience&#x27; to the old electric elements. You will notice the difference immediately. It dries fast, but not necessarily because it pushes out more air than others. You can read the technical details in other reviews, but for about $10 more than the cheaper alternatives, I think you&#x27;d be silly not to choose the BaByliss Pro.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and seller.</li>
