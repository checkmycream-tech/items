    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, Barbasol shaving cream is truly the best shaving cream in town.</li>
            <li>I was told by a registered nurse that Barbasol Shaving Cream--in a tube only--is the best thing to use for pressure ulcers (bed sores.)  </li>
            <li>a wonderful shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the best cream for any kind of rashes.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Glad I found this here on Amazon because it&#x27;s the best shave cream out there period.</li>
            <li>I picked up this Barbasol non-Aerosol to use as a back-up after hearing good reviews, and to use if my face ever seems like it could use a break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>If anybody has used alum before you know that a good shave is one where the alum doesn&#x27;t sting at all, and that&#x27;s what I keep getting.</li>
            <li>like I&#x27;ve had some kind of healing therapy.  </li>
            <li>best thing about this product is the handsome, smart looking plastic tube container.</li>
            <li>I leaves my face closely and smoothly shaved and pleasant</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a convenient, quick, and very effective backup</li>
            <li>The old formula was perfect for Sunburn, this formula does not come close.</li>
            <li>I used to be able to find this at Walgreens and CVS - not anymore...</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>Glad I could still get this item</li>
            <li>Many years ago when I was a baby, the doctor recommended this to my mother for diaper rash.</li>
            <li>and I realize that may well be why most people are coming here to look at the review.</li>
            <li>I decided to give the Barbasol a try and it is relieving the peeling skin and itching better than anything.</li>
            <li>Its theraputic properties heal bedsores better than the prescription</li>
            <li>Is more of a face cream than others.</li>
            <li>Better than canned barbasol by a mile.</li>
            <li>For many years I used Palmolive brushless shave cream until it was discontinued.</li>
            <li>Well, the better feeling was not my imagination.</li>
            <li>I tried it for a couple shaves and threw it away.&lt;br /&gt;There are way better products out there.</li>
            <li>so i resorted to buying online -- GREAT SHAVE for sensitive skin....</li>
            <li>I used this years ago when it came in a tub and had more of a light lilac scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard the scent is like the original 1940s barbasol (as opposed to the cans, which smell more like a 1970s barbershop with plenty of talcum powder and soap).</li>
            <li>will notice that there is a very mild scent to this shaving cream.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>Worked great when traveling extra light in low-flying aircraft when aerosols were not recommended.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also very easy to work and makes for a smooth yet fast shave.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as good as Keihl&#x27;s White Eagle non-foaming cream or Malin + Goetz Vitamin E Menthol non-foaming cream.  </li>
            <li>This caveat holds true for all brands of shaving creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this shaving cream.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s affordable; it can fit into an overnight carrying bag; the cap stays on so the cream can&#x27;t dispense itself and ruin whatever is close to it; the cream stays fresh for a very long time and it does indeed help greatly to moisturize and lubricate your sensitive skin just before and during your shave.</li>
            <li>Whatever you do, don&#x27;t forget to wet your skin first with warm water before putting on the shaving cream and shaving!</li>
            <li>SMILE</li>
            <li>Barbasol makes an excellent shaving cream for us men with sensitive skin who need to shave off that facial hair we always seem to inevitably grow.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a new way to shave every single day, be it switching from canned foam or soap and brush, then you may find yourself pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As per the directions you need to have a wet face before you spread it on, and the cream only rinses off easily if it&#x27;s got a good ratio of product to water.</li>
            <li>suppose that this could be used by ladies who want to shave their legs if their legs have sensitive skin; but I think that this type of shaving cream by Barbasol is primarily geared toward men&#x27;s shaving needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first day I used this Barbasol</li>
            <li>really can&#x27;t attest to its shaving properties as I use an electric razor</li>
            <li>Be sure your face is wet</li>
            <li>I would not use any other product on his skin, and its good if skin is getting red and irritated, wish you could buy it anywhere</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other brushless creams before like Creamo and Kiss My Face, but neither were able to give me a shave like Barbasol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After using it, my face doesn&#x27;t feel particularly moisturized or</li>
            <li>The scent is classic 1970s manly uncle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>WOuld highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It also has some quite a few dubious industrial ingredients, which isn&#x27;t surprising since this is the original formulation from the first half of the 20th century.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would have preferred a simple flip top that could be operated with a single hand.</li>
            <li>Does not lather and lacks the original scent I expected from the brand.</li>
            <li>Even way back then (70&#x27;s) it wasn&#x27;t readily available but only in select drug stores.</li>
            <li>got it to put on my 92 year old dads skin.</li>
            <li>Barbasol wants to notch this up to the mythical six stars, put it back in the tub.  </li>
            <li>This is a decent, basic non-foaming shave cream on par with the King of Shaves line.  </li>
            <li>Great for bed sores and broken down skin.</li>
            <li>If you are allergic to scents or perfumes you may want to try another similar brand of shaving cream for men with sensitive</li>
            <li>color me surprised when I ended up using it once, then the next day, then the next day after that, and the next day after that!</li>

            <li> keeps skin from breaking down when skin gets old</li>
            <li> even though I was wearing a long sleeve shirt</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving using traditional wet shaving methods and equipment for quite a while.</li>
            <li> problems are that it&#x27;s pretty heavy, so it&#x27;s hard to get all of it off your face.</li>
            <li> It might burn slightly just a bit for a few minutes but it does give you major relief!</li>
            <li> I guess you could say by using it to soften rough skin</li>
            <li> Not very lubricating, nothing therapeutic about it.</li>
            <li> recently got into some poison oak trying to cut down a dead tree.</li>
            <li> Sometimes shaving soap can be a little harsh, no matter how &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; the ingredients are it&#x27;s still soap that strips the oils from your face and breaks down the acid mantle with low pH.</li>
            <li> so you can dilute it a little bit, otherwise it could clog your razor.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little odd that I would end up using something so un-traditional!</li>
            <li> skin, sensitive skin, thin beard, thick beard, get this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I use it for dry skin, cracked knuckles and hands from working in the cold outside.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little hard to find, so we buy it by the case.</li>
            <li> My complaints are that the tube it comes in is actually a little clumsy when you have to screw the cap off and on during the shave.</li>
            <li> It can also be a little hard to rinse off your razor if you spread it on your face too thick.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but tried it--and it works like a miracle for my 92-yr-old mother, who is bedridden.  </li>
            <li> Stock up today and you&#x27;ll never be sorry!</li>

            <li> I used to be able to find this at Walgreens and CVS - not anymore...Maybe Kinney&#x27;s is the last holdout so i resorted to buying online -- GREAT SHAVE for sensitive skin....</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I use it for dry skin, cracked knuckles and hands from working in the cold outside. Great for bed sores and broken down skin.</li>
            <li> This is a decent, basic non-foaming shave cream on par with the King of Shaves line.  It&#x27;s not as good as Keihl&#x27;s White Eagle non-foaming cream or Malin + Goetz Vitamin E Menthol non-foaming cream.  By the way, we wonder what&#x27;s \\&quot;therapeutic\\&quot; about this Barbasol cream.  After using it, my face doesn&#x27;t feel particularly moisturized or like I&#x27;ve had some kind of healing therapy.  The scent is classic 1970s manly uncle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about this product is the handsome, smart looking plastic tube container.</li>

Whatever you do, don&#x27;t forget to wet your skin first with warm water before putting on the shaving cream and shaving! You&#x27;ll cut yourself all over if you don&#x27;t! This caveat holds true for all brands of shaving creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that THAT&#x27;S out of the way, I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this shaving cream.

            <li> love it. got it to put on my 92 year old dads skin. keeps skin from breaking down when skin gets old it is so fragile. I would not use any other product on his skin, and its good if skin is getting red and irritated, wish you could buy it anywhere</li>
            <li> This product is used by my family in caring for our mother.  She is prone to bedsores, and Barbasol aids in the prevention and healing of them.</li>
            <li> The old formula was perfect for Sunburn, this formula does not come close.</li>
            <li> Glad I could still get this item</li>
            <li> Many years ago when I was a baby, the doctor recommended this to my mother for diaper rash. Even way back then (70&#x27;s) it wasn&#x27;t readily available but only in select drug stores. This was a staple at our house although it was in a metal toothpaste-like tube back then with red, white and blue coloring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really can&#x27;t attest to its shaving properties as I use an electric razor and I realize that may well be why most people are coming here to look at the review. I can attest to the medicinal properties I mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently got into some poison oak trying to cut down a dead tree. A quite itchy proposition! All over my arms even though I was wearing a long sleeve shirt. I&#x27;ve been using Benadryl cream, aloe gel, etc. I decided to give the Barbasol a try and it is relieving the peeling skin and itching better than anything. It might burn slightly just a bit for a few minutes but it does give you major relief!</li>
            <li> I was told by a registered nurse that Barbasol Shaving Cream--in a tube only--is the best thing to use for pressure ulcers (bed sores.)  I was skeptical but tried it--and it works like a miracle for my 92-yr-old mother, who is bedridden.  Its theraputic properties heal bedsores better than the prescription Calmaseptine we&#x27;d been using!  Now the one sore she had is practically healed.</li>
            <li> I use it off label I guess you could say by using it to soften rough skin</li>
            <li> I used this years ago when it came in a tub and had more of a light lilac scent. Glad I found this here on Amazon because it&#x27;s the best shave cream out there period.The scent is different now, but the results are the same -  a wonderful shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also very easy to work and makes for a smooth yet fast shave.  I leaves my face closely and smoothly shaved and pleasant residual scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normal skin, sensitive skin, thin beard, thick beard, get this stuff.  Stock up on it.  You won&#x27;t regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Barbasol wants to notch this up to the mythical six stars, put it back in the tub.  Perfection.</li>
            <li> Item as described - I just didn&#x27;t feel like the shaving performance was there.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used canned Barbasol for years and this didn&#x27;t measure up to those standards.&lt;br /&gt;If I ever have bed sores I&#x27;ll revisit this purchase...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine. Too overpriced!!</li>
            <li> This is the best cream for any kind of rashes. Our peditrician recommended this to use in place of Desitine. Kids are grown and have been using it ever since for pricly heat, rashes from legs rubbing together. Great product. You must buy the therapeutic cream. WOuld highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Is more of a face cream than others. Does not lather and lacks the original scent I expected from the brand.</li>
            <li> Better than canned barbasol by a mile. Brushless, so don&#x27;t try to lather. I&#x27;ve heard the scent is like the original 1940s barbasol (as opposed to the cans, which smell more like a 1970s barbershop with plenty of talcum powder and soap). Be sure your face is wet so you can dilute it a little bit, otherwise it could clog your razor. But once you&#x27;ve got it ride, it provides plenty of cushion, and leaves your skin feeling and smelling great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only problems are that it&#x27;s pretty heavy, so it&#x27;s hard to get all of it off your face. It also has some quite a few dubious industrial ingredients, which isn&#x27;t surprising since this is the original formulation from the first half of the 20th century.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a curiosity and you might like it.</li>
            <li> For many years I used Palmolive brushless shave cream until it was discontinued. The first day I used this Barbasol I felt a difference. It gave me a smoother and closer shave. Well, the better feeling was not my imagination. I&#x27;ve used it for several weeks now and it indeed makes my shaving easier and cleaner. I get fewer nicks too.</li>
            <li> Worked great when traveling extra light in low-flying aircraft when aerosols were not recommended.</li>
            <li> My husband loves the way this stuff goes on. It&#x27;s a little hard to find, so we buy it by the case.</li>
            <li> Not very lubricating, nothing therapeutic about it. I tried it for a couple shaves and threw it away.&lt;br /&gt;There are way better products out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving using traditional wet shaving methods and equipment for quite a while. I use the works: shaving soap, shaving brush, double-edge safety razor, alum block, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it&#x27;s a little odd that I would end up using something so un-traditional! Sometimes shaving soap can be a little harsh, no matter how &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; the ingredients are it&#x27;s still soap that strips the oils from your face and breaks down the acid mantle with low pH. There just isn&#x27;t such thing as a &amp;#34;pH balanced&amp;#34; soap, otherwise it wouldn&#x27;t be &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; at all. I picked up this Barbasol non-Aerosol to use as a back-up after hearing good reviews, and to use if my face ever seems like it could use a break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well color me surprised when I ended up using it once, then the next day, then the next day after that, and the next day after that! All the fancy soaps and scents I have and I keep reaching for Barbasol. If anybody has used alum before you know that a good shave is one where the alum doesn&#x27;t sting at all, and that&#x27;s what I keep getting. I&#x27;ve used other brushless creams before like Creamo and Kiss My Face, but neither were able to give me a shave like Barbasol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a convenient, quick, and very effective backup then I can&#x27;t recommend Barbasol enough. If you&#x27;re looking for a new way to shave every single day, be it switching from canned foam or soap and brush, then you may find yourself pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four out of five stars. My complaints are that the tube it comes in is actually a little clumsy when you have to screw the cap off and on during the shave. I would have preferred a simple flip top that could be operated with a single hand. It can also be a little hard to rinse off your razor if you spread it on your face too thick. As per the directions you need to have a wet face before you spread it on, and the cream only rinses off easily if it&#x27;s got a good ratio of product to water.</li>
