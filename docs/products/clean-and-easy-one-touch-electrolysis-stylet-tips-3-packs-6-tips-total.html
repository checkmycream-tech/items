    <ol>
            <li>Product is inconsistent in quality at best.</li>
            <li>I thought I had found the perfect solution for permanent hair removal at home.</li>
            <li>This package was the best value for the money.</li>
            <li>Excellent to use!</li>
            <li>This product works great after getting used to it.</li>
            <li>A great machine</li>
            <li>These replacement tips are great.  </li>
            <li>I already used them and it was ao nice!</li>
            <li>They work good</li>
            <li>I was delighted because I had assumed nobody made them anymore.  </li>
            <li>For what they are, they are good.  </li>
            <li>This is a really good product for home use.</li>
            <li>I was glad to find them at a great price after all the years that had passed since I purchased my machine.</li>
            <li>I love the tips, they are verry good for electrolysis.</li>
            <li>Worthless...needle retracts very easily, and thus doesn&#x27;t penetrate to hair root&#x3D;</li>
            <li>Most of the tips were bent when I received the order</li>
            <li>I love the machine.</li>
            <li>One touch should come with a lot of needles or they should make a better stronger one.</li>
            <li>Also, I was able to gift five packages and she loves them too.</li>
            <li>You will be needing to purchase some of these if you are going to be using the Clean + Easy Deluxe Home Electrolysis machine.  </li>
            <li>but they sometimes tend to bend easily</li>
            <li>I would consider myself carefull, yet they still bent/kinked easily, Hence</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;d understood the technique &amp; found it somewhat easy to perform, I knew it works as there was no resistance tweezing the hair out after being treated (@</li>
            <li>They do bend easily</li>
            <li>Very good customer service highly recommend , thanks A++++++</li>
            <li>You go through a lot of needles trying to get one to not bend or even fit through the stylet tip without bending.</li>
            <li>It works but the needles break or bend very very easy and they can&#x27;t be fixed.</li>
            <li>I never was able to find a new one to replace it with until I did a search on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>but polish you technique by practice, and have patience - from what I&#x27;ve heard hair growth cycles determine the success of your treatments more than anything, so regular treatments and correct aftercare will produce results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would and will buy both the machine &amp; the Stylets Again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>arrived in a timely manner and exactly what I needed</li>
            <li>They are pretty fragile and can be bent easily.  </li>
            <li>was doubhtful that result&#x27;s would be positive, though determined to give it a thourough attempt.&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li>The company will not only sell you defective, and possibly used products - which can pass on contagions to you - but when notified, will not respond in any coherent relevant way.</li>
            <li>Ok but not a very good value considering how easy they break.</li>
            <li>BUT THE ONLY STYLETS AVAILABLE</li>
            <li>They are very sturdy and each one lasts for quite a while.  </li>
            <li>but I have not been as steady in use as I should have been.</li>
            <li>This one works exactly as my old one did, and it really DOES ITS JOB</li>
            <li>If you have the machine and need new tips, be forewarned: they aren&#x27;t what they used to be.</li>
            <li>They certainly do not make exchanges easy, or even possible.</li>
            <li>Recently, all the stylet tips we&#x27;ve received have been too short to be useful.</li>
            <li>have used this system for many years and it really works, but had a difficult time finding the stylet tips so thank you Amazon.</li>
            <li>The hair is trimmed with scissors between treatments as no other hair removal apart from shaving is permitted (or Electroylisis will not be Effective).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>These are pretty flimsy but can last a while if you are really careful with them.  </li>
            <li>They are not long enough to do the job intended.  </li>

            <li> have yet to open the third Stylet pack, and hope it wont have those shorter Stylets as mentioned in other review&#x27;s, as I understand how this would be counter</li>
            <li> Previously they were consistently an appropriate length Because of this change to the stylets, I have been unable to continue using the machine.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these years ago at a major department store and used the thing (for at least 20 years) until it finally &amp;#34;died&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> And it is lets just say tolerably painful and occasionally more than tolerable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;BYPLE has absolutely no business being supported by Amazon.</li>
            <li> I will buy this product again in other time</li>
            <li> These are just as described I have not had to change one yet because of a problem with the other product</li>
            <li> but without decent needles its useless.</li>
            <li> Somme of the tips were shorter than standard length, no good.</li>
            <li> These needles bend and stay deformed after a few seconds of use.  </li>
            <li> Also the needles are embedded in a base that doesn&#x27;t hold them securely.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my One Touch for a few years now.</li>
            <li> the broken unit was the last straw.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A WASTE</li>
            <li> I am not able to use them.</li>
            <li> The process was long and tedious and there were a lot of design flaws.</li>
            <li> You will be damaging the stylet tips not matter how hard you try not to do so.  </li>
            <li> TO PURCHASE ITS A WASTE NOT HAPPY</li>
            <li> They must be fixed in their base to prevent rotation and torsion while they are used.  </li>
            <li> poor quality.</li>
            <li> While it is time consuming and mildly painful, the One Touch has seen a lot of use in my house.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> You might have to electro the same hair 10times to kill it, might take you a year of working every single night to get it done, maybe even longer.</li>
            <li> arrived in a timely manner and exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> These needles bend and stay deformed after a few seconds of use.  They are defective.  They should be made from a stronger metal like titanium.  Also the needles are embedded in a base that doesn&#x27;t hold them securely.  They must be fixed in their base to prevent rotation and torsion while they are used.  Don&#x27;t these companies have an engineer to design these things properly?!!!</li>
            <li> have used this system for many years and it really works, but had a difficult time finding the stylet tips so thank you Amazon.</li>
            <li> These tips have been revamped and are smaller/shorter.  They are not long enough to do the job intended.  I am not able to use them.</li>
            <li> No results seen over 3 seperate sessions using these. And it is lets just say tolerably painful and occasionally more than tolerable.</li>
            <li> Product is inconsistent in quality at best. Some tips are actually defective, and will not be long enough once installed correctly in the appliance. Others have defective springs - you&#x27;ll get one use, maybe two. If you do buy these - and they do work, when manufactured correctly - do NOT buy from BYPLE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BYPLE has absolutely no business being supported by Amazon. The company will not only sell you defective, and possibly used products - which can pass on contagions to you - but when notified, will not respond in any coherent relevant way. They certainly do not make exchanges easy, or even possible. Either the people at BYPLE cannot speak English well or simply do not care.</li>
            <li> I thought I had found the perfect solution for permanent hair removal at home. While it is time consuming and mildly painful, the One Touch has seen a lot of use in my house. Recently, all the stylet tips we&#x27;ve received have been too short to be useful. Previously they were consistently an appropriate length Because of this change to the stylets, I have been unable to continue using the machine. If you have the machine and need new tips, be forewarned: they aren&#x27;t what they used to be.</li>
            <li> I love the tips, they are verry good for electrolysis. I already used them and it was ao nice! I will buy this product again in other time</li>
            <li> These are just as described I have not had to change one yet because of a problem with the other product</li>
            <li> You will be needing to purchase some of these if you are going to be using the Clean + Easy Deluxe Home Electrolysis machine.  You will be damaging the stylet tips not matter how hard you try not to do so.  This package was the best value for the money.</li>
            <li> Finally can take care of unwanted facial hair permanently - even in rural Nevada!</li>
            <li> They work good but they sometimes tend to bend easily and then you cannot use them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my One Touch for a few years now. It is slower than traditional electrolysis but I have not been as steady in use as I should have been. My Beauty Supply had stopped carrying the stylus. And I only remembered the actual product name recent and looked on the internet. Hooray for ordering online. I can now finish my legs.&lt;br /&gt;The stylus is a little delicate so odd angles can cause a kink, so it is handy to have spares.</li>
            <li> poor quality. mine broke after only 4 months. the cord detached from the needle. The process was long and tedious and there were a lot of design flaws. the broken unit was the last straw. Do not buy this item. you are wasting your money.</li>
            <li> They arrive bent out of the box.</li>
            <li> Most of the tips were bent when I received the order</li>
            <li> I bought the Machine Which had a Spare Stylet, But Wanted Extra Styles to hand &amp; I Purchased These.&lt;br /&gt;I was doubhtful that result&#x27;s would be positive, though determined to give it a thourough attempt.&lt;br /&gt;Yes the Tips Have a short life! I would consider myself carefull, yet they still bent/kinked easily, Hence the 4 Star Review.&lt;br /&gt;By the Time I changed my initial two Stylets, which came with the machine, I&#x27;d understood the technique &amp; found it somewhat easy to perform, I knew it works as there was no resistance tweezing the hair out after being treated (@ L3)&lt;br /&gt;Re Growth began to look finer, slower to grow and &#x27;Damaged&#x27;  after Treatment 4 (4th cycle of Electroylisis) I have brown hair of medium coarseness in the area being treated... The hair is trimmed with scissors between treatments as no other hair removal apart from shaving is permitted (or Electroylisis will not be Effective).&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to open the third Stylet pack, and hope it wont have those shorter Stylets as mentioned in other review&#x27;s, as I understand how this would be counter productive.&lt;br /&gt;The machine works - Fact! but polish you technique by practice, and have patience - from what I&#x27;ve heard hair growth cycles determine the success of your treatments more than anything, so regular treatments and correct aftercare will produce results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would and will buy both the machine &amp; the Stylets Again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this help&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> BREAK BREAK BREAK OR BEND THIS IS A WASTE BUT THE ONLY STYLETS AVAILABLE TO PURCHASE ITS A WASTE NOT HAPPY</li>
            <li> This product works great after getting used to it. Do it yourself or pay someone big bucks to do it for you.</li>
            <li> Very good customer service highly recommend , thanks A++++++</li>
            <li> Somme of the tips were shorter than standard length, no good.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these years ago at a major department store and used the thing (for at least 20 years) until it finally &amp;#34;died&amp;#34;.  I never was able to find a new one to replace it with until I did a search on Amazon.  I was delighted because I had assumed nobody made them anymore.  This one works exactly as my old one did, and it really DOES ITS JOB well!</li>
            <li> For what they are, they are good.  They are pretty fragile and can be bent easily.  However, I haven&#x27;t found any alternatives so this will have to do.</li>
            <li> I love the machine. It works but the needles break or bend very very easy and they can&#x27;t be fixed. You go through a lot of needles trying to get one to not bend or even fit through the stylet tip without bending. One touch should come with a lot of needles or they should make a better stronger one. A great machine but without decent needles its useless.</li>
            <li> Excellent to use! I was glad to find them at a great price after all the years that had passed since I purchased my machine. Also, I was able to gift five packages and she loves them too.</li>
            <li> These are pretty flimsy but can last a while if you are really careful with them.  They do bend easily</li>
            <li> These replacement tips are great.  They are very sturdy and each one lasts for quite a while.  This is a really good product for home use.</li>
            <li> Worthless...needle retracts very easily, and thus doesn&#x27;t penetrate to hair root&#x3D;you fry your skin and not the root&#x3D;wound with hair still there sticking out of it</li>
            <li> Ok but not a very good value considering how easy they break.</li>
