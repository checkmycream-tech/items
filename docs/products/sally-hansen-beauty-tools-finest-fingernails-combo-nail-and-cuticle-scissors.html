            <li>Very satisfied with the quality of the product.  </li>
            <li>Nice finish.</li>
            <li>I had lost my original of these and was delighted to find a replica</li>
            <li>What more do I need to say?</li>
            <li>- I needed more words</li>
            <li>I use it mostly for toe nails even though it is recommended for finger</li>
            <li>The finish is beautiful, and it cuts well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to collect scissors like this to leave in several places so they&#x27;re handy when I need them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very good but when compared to making the purchase locally.  </li>
            <li>Much better than some of cheap, no-name options.</li>
            <li>They appear to be made of a nice grade stainless.</li>
            <li>had some good quality nail scissors that lasted me more than 15 years, but they began to show their age recently.</li>
            <li>Item was a good price and currently works well.  </li>
            <li>I use them for my nail stickers and they work really great and are sharp.</li>
            <li>kits\\&quot; in colorful packages.</li>
            <li>shape instead of a more normal oval shape) is probably the main cause.</li>
            <li>I believe my previous good quality scissors were a LaCross brand, but I decided to go with the Sally Hansen</li>
            <li>So far everything fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using my old scissors and keeping this for mild tasks.</li>
            <li>these are really great little fingernail scissors, especially when using them on kids</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have a need for \\&quot;manicure</li>
            <li>and then one of the blades broke off, an obvious sign that cheap metal was used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is sharp and very precise.</li>
            <li>This is the main flaw with these scissors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a high quality product.  </li>
            <li>Not as sharp as I had hoped...or maybe my nails are too strong.</li>
            <li>Instead, they at best snap pieces of fingernails leaving ugly serrated cut line.&lt;br /&gt;Returning them.</li>
            <li>I went on Amazon looking for a pair of higher quality scissors at the cheapest price possible.</li>
            <li>My fingers barely fit into them, I have average sized \\&quot;Large\\&quot;</li>
            <li>As expected, quick shipping.</li>
            <li>I just need some nail scissors and a basic nail clipper for my own use, which is usually once per week for hands and twice per month for feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>comfortable and have remained sharp for a long while now.</li>
            <li>The blades bend easily and then just fold over anything you&#x27;re trying to cut and squeezes it between the two dull blades.</li>
            <li>It does seem to take more effort to cut the nail than it should, so I am wondering whether they are as sharp as they could be(like the previous reviewer), then again my toe nails are thicker than my finger</li>
            <li>These Sally Hansen scissors are obviously made by a country near Japan where quality production hasn&#x27;t been seen since imperial times.</li>
            <li>They are too massive and clumsy to make smooth cuts.</li>
            <li>it was not thin enough to grom my stash and other facial hair.</li>

            <li> it was not thin enough to grom my stash and other facial hair</li>
            <li> These are only good for cutting eyebrows and not much else.</li>
            <li> A little bigger than I expected, but very well made!  </li>
            <li> I settled on 2 possible choices: the LaCross Extra Long Scissors and the Sally Hansen Finest Fingernails Combo Scissors.</li>
            <li> The steel is terrible quality, soft and the precision of the manufacturing is shoddy at best.</li>
            <li> These scissors are a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Not high quality scissors; not very sharp and a too stiff to open and close.</li>
            <li> steel quality seems better than my previous replacement, it has survived several nail cutting sessions.</li>
            <li> these scissors fail for any reason within a year I will update this review and will likely buy more expensive scissors, so far they are still functioning as expected.</li>
            <li> Will need to see how long blades stay sharp.</li>
            <li> These are solid little scissors.  </li>
            <li> I bought these scissors to replace a pair that had been unfortunately confiscated by airport security (Thanks a lot, Israel!).</li>
            <li> The blades do not touch each other.</li>
            <li> was not happy, tip is very blunt and thick, definitely NOT for cuticles</li>
            <li> Dull, thick, and not sharp.</li>
            <li> They could be a little sharper</li>
            <li> Have used them for a few months and they are still tight and stiff to use.</li>
            <li> They have a thick blade and absolutely do not cut nails.</li>
            <li> not sure why..</li>
            <li> Terribly dull.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite dull.</li>
            <li> They are very dull and way too thick to cut fingernails.</li>
            <li> but they have hard time cutting my nails.  </li>
            <li> will have to buy another brand as these are useless to me.</li>
            <li> Extremely difficult to cut nails.  </li>

            <li> This is a high quality product.  I could not find another like it in any of the stores where I shop.  Very satisfied with the quality of the product.  I would shop this vendor again.</li>

            <li> As expected, quick shipping. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Very good but when compared to making the purchase locally.  Appear to be well made making it an excellent bargain.</li>
            <li> Piece of junk. Don&#x27;t cut, tip is bent. No wonder they were so inexpensive.</li>

            <li> Dull, thick, and not sharp. I bought these scissors to replace a pair that had been unfortunately confiscated by airport security (Thanks a lot, Israel!). I had bought a pair in Japan twenty years ago and like everything made in Japan, it was a work of quality and durability. These Sally Hansen scissors are obviously made by a country near Japan where quality production hasn&#x27;t been seen since imperial times. AVOID! These are only good for cutting eyebrows and not much else.</li>
            <li> These are solid little scissors.  They could be a little sharper however they do the job and I still give them 5 stars.  They appear to be made of a nice grade stainless.</li>
            <li> it was not thin enough to grom my stash and other facial hair. it was not thin enough to grom my stash and other facial hair</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re cutters and they work. What more do I need to say? These things are a great value, would buy again.</li>
            <li> Not as sharp as I had hoped...or maybe my nails are too strong.</li>

My fingers barely fit into them, I have average sized \\&quot;Large\\&quot; hands(again I&#x27;m a guy). It does cause some discomfort, and the way the openings are designed(egg shape instead of a more normal oval shape) is probably the main cause. This is the main flaw with these scissors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If these scissors fail for any reason within a year I will update this review and will likely buy more expensive scissors, so far they are still functioning as expected.</li>
