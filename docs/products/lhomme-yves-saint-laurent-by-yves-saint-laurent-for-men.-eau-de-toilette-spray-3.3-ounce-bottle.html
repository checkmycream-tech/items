            <li>Bought it for my husband and it was the best present</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ever gotten him - since it benefits me the most.</li>

            <li>He&#x27;s all mine! :)</li>
            <li>personally enjoyed the purchasing price for this ounce size as well.</li>
            <li>Well, I read many reviews before I bought this item.</li>
            <li>The smell is not over whelming but has an alluring factor, it kinda of draws you in wanting more.</li>

            <li>Bought as a gift and it was a success!</li>

            <li>He usually bathes in colognes but it doesn&#x27;t take very many sprays from this to get engulfed in the scent (in a good way).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not intimidating but rather clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>It arrived super fast, two business days after I placed the order, way to go Amazon!</li>

            <li>It is not over bearing, it is smooth, but classy smelling.</li>
            <li>This is the first time bought this YSL product.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27; smell as strong as the macys one I bought last year.</li>
            <li>Normally I would get this at a big retailer and pay an extra 30 dollars, good deal on here.</li>
            <li>I have never bought this before, this I believe is the real deal.</li>
            <li>Combined with the right masculine smell the ladies might become erotically giddy.</li>
            <li>When i was going to buy this fragrance, i was afraid about the originality; But its original, have a great smell and the longevity on my skin lasts a lot.</li>
            <li>however, all of my other online purchases done though amazon have been 100% authentic.</li>
            <li>Again, since I bought this while I still had some of the original left, I can spray them side by side and smell the difference.</li>

            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>thinking that although the occasional person seemed to get a fake bottle, Amazon&#x27;s got a great return policy, right?</li>
            <li>He has been hinting around to wanting a new bottle, and I couldn&#x27;t resist the savings found on Amazon.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s fake like some people have stated they did a really good job of making just like the real L&#x27;homme. ;</li>

            <li>are all very different from the real product.</li>
            <li>Really like it, have for a long time</li>
            <li>This is my first frangrance purchase off Amazon, so I am a little bit nervous because I don&#x27;t want to get a \\&quot;fake\\&quot; product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I always get a compliment whenever I am wearing this cologne, women just want to know who makes it. One of my top 10 favorites ever, the other ones being: Channel Bleu, Gucci Guilty, Valentino, Allure Sport, Spicebomb, Terre by D&#x27;Hermės, Aqua di Parma, Dior Homme, Gentlemen Only Givenchy.</li>
            <li> Really like it, have for a long time</li>
            <li> This is something you can wear during the day that won&#x27;t be overpowering or offensive to others. It&#x27;s a very light fragrance. If you&#x27;re looking for something that projects this is not a good choice. It last on my skin about 4hrs.</li>
            <li> came within a few days of placing the order. good price and i love the scent. it is light, fresh, and clean scent perfect for girls (me) or guys.</li>
            <li> Smells great and the ladies love it! ;-)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend after smelling it on my friend. He loved it! It&#x27;s not intimidating but rather clean and fresh. The aroma is suitable for a work environment but smells delicious enough for a date.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my fiance as a belated birthday gift, not much savings but enough to buy on amazon. I had gotten a sample of this from a sephora order and had to get it! Smells so good!</li>
            <li> Paid a nice price for the product and it was delivered on time and exactly like described. I think I paid even cheaper than duty free prices.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift and it was a success! It smells so good. Very masculine yet not too over powering.</li>
            <li> Normally I would get this at a big retailer and pay an extra 30 dollars, good deal on here. Will buy more for sure!!!!</li>
            <li> I loved it. I feel&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s more of a unisex scent which inables it to be a really sexy . It&#x27;s the best of both world.</li>
            <li> When i was going to buy this fragrance, i was afraid about the originality; But its original, have a great smell and the longevity on my skin lasts a lot.</li>
            <li> The smell of this cologne is amazing. Bought it for my husband and it was the best present I&#x27;ve ever gotten him - since it benefits me the most. I love it. The price is great and it seems to last him awhile too. He usually bathes in colognes but it doesn&#x27;t take very many sprays from this to get engulfed in the scent (in a good way). Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> This is my first frangrance purchase off Amazon, so I am a little bit nervous because I don&#x27;t want to get a \\&quot;fake\\&quot; product. however, all of my other online purchases done though amazon have been 100% authentic. my purchase should be here in a few days! My boyfriend loves this fragrance, every gal should get this for the men in their life!</li>
            <li> All women love this cologne. I get compliments. Wish it lasted longer (alcohol based) because halfway through the night it wears off. Oh well. The price is right, too.</li>
            <li> Great scent, not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> Exactly like the bottle I had that ran out.  If it&#x27;s fake like some people have stated they did a really good job of making just like the real L&#x27;homme. ;-D&lt;br /&gt;Smell fantastic and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband at Macys a couple of years ago after smelling a sample. We both absolutely loved it. He got so many compliments. (Good thing I&#x27;m not the jealous type!) He has been hinting around to wanting a new bottle, and I couldn&#x27;t resist the savings found on Amazon. I would recommend this to any woman wanting to buy a gift for the guy in her life... and to any man who likes attention. ;-)</li>
            <li> The cologne smells great.. but my package was somewhat opened.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this cologne...it&#x27;s the sexiest smell that I&#x27;ve ever experienced.  I bought this for my fiance Chris...and have enjoyed it ever since.  Women stop him all the time and tell him he smells amazing.. but Back off girlies!  He&#x27;s all mine! :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this product specifically for my Son he truly adores it !!&lt;br /&gt;I personally enjoyed the purchasing price for this ounce size as well.</li>
            <li> I bought L&#x27;homme from Amazon thinking that although the occasional person seemed to get a fake bottle, Amazon&#x27;s got a great return policy, right? WRONG. You can&#x27;t return cologne. And this one&#x27;s definitely a fake - the size, shape, and dispenser are all very different from the real product. I know because I still have the original I bought in a department store. What&#x27;s worse, the smell dissipates almost immediately. Again, since I bought this while I still had some of the original left, I can spray them side by side and smell the difference. I won&#x27;t be buying cologne from Amazon again, even if it&#x27;s \\&quot;sold and shipped\\&quot; by Amazon. Clearly not worth the risk.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27; smell as strong as the macys one I bought last year.</li>
            <li> This may be fake. The scent does not linger at all . .</li>
            <li> Very happy with my order.</li>
            <li> Well, I read many reviews before I bought this item. Some said it might not be authentic or generic. It arrived super fast, two business days after I placed the order, way to go Amazon! Product had plastic wrapping around, so I know it was not tampered with. It was bottled in a heavy glass bottle and on the bottom had a sticker with a product number saying it was made in France. I have never bought this before, this I believe is the real deal. The smell is not over whelming but has an alluring factor, it kinda of draws you in wanting more. It is not over bearing, it is smooth, but classy smelling. It does not smell cheap or cheesy. Combined with the right masculine smell the ladies might become erotically giddy. This is the first time bought this YSL product. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> If I could use a fragrance to reflect what I felt represented the smell of a man, this would be it.  I bought this for my husband and I simply love smelling him and the room where he sprays it. It&#x27;s not at all overwhelming and it lasts.</li>
    </ol>
