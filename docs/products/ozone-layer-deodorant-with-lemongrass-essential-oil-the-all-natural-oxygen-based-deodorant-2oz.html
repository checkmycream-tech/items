    <ol>
            <li>this stuff is amazing!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Kind of a bleachy-soapy smell.</li>
            <li>The lemongrass is nice.  </li>
            <li>This does have a very strong smell.  </li>
            <li>I know it is not the best smell, but that is it&#x27;s natural smell, and I have been able to work w/ it.  </li>
            <li>This product works all day and is great for hot climates.</li>
            <li>But would love to be able to try the product.</li>
            <li>My husband says it smells better than the deodorant I was using before, and I think it works better, too.</li>
            <li>Works OK.</li>
            <li>Still much better than the peeling rash.</li>
            <li>This was one of many deodorants that I tried.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ll appreciate it more.</li>
            <li>More Stains, Odors Or Rashes</li>
            <li>I am sure it works well, but could not handle the smell.</li>
            <li>With deodorant, I tend to prefer unscented as most scents make me nauseous.</li>
            <li>and I was very excited to try the product and see how it worked but can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>if shea butter is a good deodorizer than you are better off just using pure shea butter alone as the scent is much better than this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am excited!</li>
            <li>This scent, though not my favorite, is fine and doesn&#x27;t make me nauseous.</li>
            <li>I wish I could have given it five stars because it does seem like a great product but just not for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Seems to work great so far.</li>
            <li>(A confirmed lie.)</li>
            <li>If you enjoy that smelling like floor cleaner then this is for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, this might not be a good product for you.  </li>
            <li>I knew the scent seemed familiar (and trust me</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a deodorant that will not break me out, cause itching, and that is Earth friendly.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a more natural option that works and so far this seems successful.</li>
            <li>someone w/ super sensitive skin who doesnt want to buy cancer-causing deodorant, I am VERY pleased.  </li>
            <li>Worked good but should have gotten a different scent.</li>
            <li>It disappated quickly though.</li>
            <li>New to this safe deodorant world.</li>
            <li>Good idea, very strange execution.</li>
            <li>I think the scent is a very light lemon scent (and I have a sensitive sense of smell).</li>
            <li>Plus, I&#x27;m so self-conscious about the freshly applied sent</li>
            <li>B.O. is better :-O  </li>
            <li>The price wasn&#x27;t great and since I will have to apply multiple times daily</li>
            <li>So when I first got this, I smelled it and it smells like lemongrass.</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s only 3 ingredients.</li>
            <li>The first deodorant I bought gave me a rash under my armpits and smelled like it had a lot of cologne in it.</li>
            <li>Hopefully as things progress they will be able to make a larger or cheaper version.</li>
            <li>Its great if you are not a highly active person, but I would not recommend for a person who is active</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s just very impractical.</li>
            <li>I really want to like this product</li>
            <li>So I really wanted something like this to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Absolutely everything irritates my underarms, except for this.  </li>
            <li>I put this on underneath a light long sleeve shirt and a peacoat and went out and drove.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>True, you have to like the smell of ozone (think what the outside air smells like after a wild thunder storm &#x3D; ozone!  </li>
            <li>because; I really like the concept of the product and that its all natural,</li>
            <li>I have tried a ton of natural deodorants and none of them really worked until this product.</li>
            <li>I smelled this on me on the car ride the whole way and also in a restaurant as I sat self conscious</li>
            <li>This brand is much smoother and so far (3days)</li>
            <li>I was worried about hating the smell because of other reviews, but it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>Smaller than what I thought it would be, but it does work pretty well when I&#x27;m not working out.</li>
            <li>I do hot Bikram yoga and used to (smell) in the middle of it using my long-time friend, the crystal.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still better than spreading all those chemicals all over your lymph nodes to marinate all day and potentially cause problems down the road.</li>
            <li>Even my two year old can smell it</li>
            <li>; when I come near him after applying.</li>
            <li>and I put a natural scent on after that (lavender)</li>
            <li>If you want a natural deodorant, try Lavilla.</li>
            <li>This eliminates sweat odor completely, and continues to work, and work and work.  </li>
            <li>better--I find that if I can now put the Tom&#x27;s Calendula over the Ozone (a light layer of each) and I have no more burning or scarring now.  </li>

            <li> Since Its Dead Of Winter...</li>
            <li> And It&#x27;s Not Full Of Chemicals!</li>
            <li> After I put it on, that&#x27;s when I noticed the odd smell everyone complained about.</li>
            <li> and it usually does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No More Aluminum Stains</li>
            <li> At least it didn&#x27;t for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Not Sure How It Performs In The Heat!</li>
            <li> What I had been using before was the LEAST irritating Toms Calendula.  </li>
            <li> The smell was horrible and it didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my product came broken, the twist at the bottom of the bottle is broken off</li>
            <li> so I am unable to push the deodorant up out of the tube to use it.</li>
            <li> this smelled terrible &amp; I sent it back.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this did not work for me at all.</li>
            <li> Creates an awful smell in your under arms, very embarrassing!  :(</li>
            <li> I think one thin layer doesnt smell bad</li>
            <li> a bad review cause</li>
            <li> /&gt;We will never have any idea of how well this deodorant works because the scent is not just bad, it&#x27;s revolting.  </li>
            <li> - that&#x27;s how bad it is.</li>
            <li> I HATE the smell.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Im giving this item a four star review b because; I really like the concept of the product and that its all natural, and I was very excited to try the product and see how it worked but can&#x27;t. Unfortunately my product came broken, the twist at the bottom of the bottle is broken off so I am unable to push the deodorant up out of the tube to use it. I don&#x27;t want to give the product a bad review cause I understand that sometimes things like this happen! But would love to be able to try the product.</li>
            <li> The smell is horrible !!!!</li>
            <li> this smelled terrible &amp; I sent it back.  It had no likeness to any lemongrass scent I&#x27;ve ever smelled!</li>
            <li> I have tried a ton of natural deodorants and none of them really worked until this product. I think the scent is a very light lemon scent (and I have a sensitive sense of smell). I can wear this all day and don&#x27;t need to reapply. I can also apply this later in the day and it stops the smell.</li>
            <li> So when I first got this, I smelled it and it smells like lemongrass. After I put it on, that&#x27;s when I noticed the odd smell everyone complained about. Kind of a bleachy-soapy smell. It disappated quickly though. My husband says it smells better than the deodorant I was using before, and I think it works better, too. I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to have to give this a two star. I HATE the smell. My husband says he can&#x27;t smell it, but he also says that I don&#x27;t snore. (A confirmed lie.) Even my two year old can smell it but he says he likes it. (He&#x27;s also a known liar). My brother says &amp;#34;what smells damp?&amp;#34; when I come near him after applying. To me, it just smells funky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that I do think it removes odor if you put it on when you already somewhat smell. However on me it only seems to last a few hours it&#x27;s as if I would have to apply it two or three times a day and that&#x27;s just very impractical. Plus, I&#x27;m so self-conscious about the freshly applied sent but I wouldn&#x27;t want to do that. I really want to like this product I&#x27;m just wondering if the lemongrass scent doesn&#x27;t work for my body. I think I will try another scent.  If you don&#x27;t like lemongrass, definitely don&#x27;t try this one.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for, a deodorant without harsh chemicals and perfume smell.  This product works all day and is great for hot climates.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this did not work for me at all. An hour after taking a shower, I already start smelling of body odor.</li>
            <li> The smell was horrible and it didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking for non-aluminum deodorants for my fragrant 9-year-old and trying everything.  So I really wanted something like this to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will never have any idea of how well this deodorant works because the scent is not just bad, it&#x27;s revolting.  B.O. is better :-O  We had to shower my daughter to get the scent off.  I knew the scent seemed familiar (and trust me, it&#x27;s not lemongrass).  When I asked my sister to smell it, bingo:  Murphy&#x27;s Oil Soap.  If you enjoy that smelling like floor cleaner then this is for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to the drawing board, Ozone Layer.  Good idea, very strange execution.</li>
            <li> SO BAD! Creates an awful smell in your under arms, very embarrassing!  :(</li>
            <li> Works OK. Love that it&#x27;s only 3 ingredients. Its sooooo rough when putting it on. It rips out my armpit hairs.</li>
            <li> Absolutely everything irritates my underarms, except for this.  What I had been using before was the LEAST irritating Toms Calendula.  This does have a very strong smell.  My son says it smells like either lemon soap or rotten lemon soap.  You sort of get used to it.  I think one thin layer doesnt smell bad and I put a natural scent on after that (lavender) and it usually does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even better--I find that if I can now put the Tom&#x27;s Calendula over the Ozone (a light layer of each) and I have no more burning or scarring now.  This stuff protects the skin.  A little sticky, but doesn&#x27;t mess up my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone w/ super sensitive skin who doesnt want to buy cancer-causing deodorant, I am VERY pleased.  I know it is not the best smell, but that is it&#x27;s natural smell, and I have been able to work w/ it.  Still much better than the peeling rash.</li>
            <li> This was one of many deodorants that I tried. Its great if you are not a highly active person, but I would not recommend for a person who is active</li>
            <li> If I could give it zero stars, I would. This smell is unbearable. You would think that you could roll this on your armpits and forget about it but no. I put this on underneath a light long sleeve shirt and a peacoat and went out and drove. I smelled this on me on the car ride the whole way and also in a restaurant as I sat self conscious wondering if people around me could smell the unpleasantness. This is made up on three ingredients - shea butter, beeswax (which I suspect is the cause (or combination with the shea butter) of the horrid scent) and &amp;#34;oxygen&amp;#34; (how&#x27;s that for a marketing ploy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three ingredients...if shea butter is a good deodorizer than you are better off just using pure shea butter alone as the scent is much better than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what it is about the combination of these three ingredients but the scent is EXTREMELY OFFENSIVE and I used it once and will now have to throw it out. Yes $11 in the garbage - that&#x27;s how bad it is. Wanted to like it because it&#x27;s natural!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company should consider adding something to it...perhaps a lavender oil.</li>
            <li> New to this safe deodorant world. The first deodorant I bought gave me a rash under my armpits and smelled like it had a lot of cologne in it. This brand is much smoother and so far (3days) I have no rash. I don&#x27;t feel it gives me all day protection and I don&#x27;t care for the lemongrass smell. The price wasn&#x27;t great and since I will have to apply multiple times daily I&#x27;m not sure the small size will last more than 2-3 weeks. Hopefully as things progress they will be able to make a larger or cheaper version. It&#x27;s still better than spreading all those chemicals all over your lymph nodes to marinate all day and potentially cause problems down the road.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, this might not be a good product for you.  I have been searching for a deodorant that will not break me out, cause itching, and that is Earth friendly.  I wish I could have given it five stars because it does seem like a great product but just not for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ll appreciate it more. It does work.</li>
            <li> Smelled much too weird for me. If you want a natural deodorant, try Lavilla.</li>
            <li> Got them lemongrass one. Worked good but should have gotten a different scent. Had an odd smell sometimes</li>
            <li> Smaller than what I thought it would be, but it does work pretty well when I&#x27;m not working out.</li>
            <li> Yup... No More Aluminum Stains In The Shirts! It Takes A Couple Uses To Get Acclimated, But, It Does What It Says, At Leat For Me! No More Stains, Odors Or Rashes And It&#x27;s Not Full Of Chemicals! Since Its Dead Of Winter...(Groundhogs Lie!) I&#x27;m Not Sure How It Performs In The Heat!</li>
            <li> I am sure it works well, but could not handle the smell. smells identical to Murphy Oil Soap. No Bueno</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing!  it works!  I do hot Bikram yoga and used to (smell) in the middle of it using my long-time friend, the crystal.  This eliminates sweat odor completely, and continues to work, and work and work.  True, you have to like the smell of ozone (think what the outside air smells like after a wild thunder storm &#x3D; ozone!  Brings life to the air we breathe.)  The lemongrass is nice.  Highly recommend.  Pity the local folk where this was created -- at the Farmers Market each week I pause at Ozone Layer&#x27;s booth as I pass by and tell my story to anyone who is stopped there, adding, &amp;#34;You gotta try it!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work. At least it didn&#x27;t for me so I tossed it out after trying it for a 3 days.  Your mileage may vary...</li>
            <li> I love it! This one works! And no Aluminum. I like the smell of it too and it has been protecting me in the Florida heat. Have tried many other non-aluminum deodorants before and was just frustrated that they didn&#x27;t work. This one does. I am excited!</li>
            <li> Seems to work great so far. I was looking for a more natural option that works and so far this seems successful. I was worried about hating the smell because of other reviews, but it&#x27;s fine. With deodorant, I tend to prefer unscented as most scents make me nauseous. This scent, though not my favorite, is fine and doesn&#x27;t make me nauseous.</li>
