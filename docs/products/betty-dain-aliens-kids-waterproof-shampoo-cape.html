            <li>Good product, as advertised.</li>
            <li>Do it your self kind of mom here, and this is good for what I need it to do.</li>
            <li>does exactly what it should great quality great price.</li>
            <li>My son really liked this for his haircuts</li>
            <li>I cut my own son&#x27;s hair at home.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, good price.</li>
            <li>Works perfect for my 3 yr old</li>
            <li>Good fit.</li>
            <li>Love the aliens.</li>
            <li>My kiddy clients love this cape</li>
            <li>Thank You :)</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>My 3 year old son loved this!</li>
            <li>They work great and the children live them.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for all the little kiddos!</li>
            <li>Perfect for my little boys!</li>
            <li>I had a hard time finding one that I thought would fit my needs - this is the perfect one!  </li>
            <li>I end up having to wash it off in the bathtub after every use instead of just shaking it clean.</li>
            <li>Velcro neck fastener is key--it will fit many necks, even a small(ish) adult.</li>
            <li>Its made pretty cheaply</li>
            <li>My son loves his new cape...makes him excited for me to cut his hair!</li>
            <li>He likes the colorful patterns and the Velcro closure works well.</li>
            <li>Now if we could just get him used to the noise of the clippers ;)</li>
            <li>It is very entertaining, and the right size for the little ones.</li>
            <li>Makes cutting my 4 year Olds hair, more pleasant.</li>
            <li>but I reckon next time I might just secure it with a safety pin or masking tape.</li>
            <li>I have also used it on my husband that has a very large neck (comically large), and it fits him (barely).</li>
            <li>I use this with the neck wraps I also purchased on Amazon and my son has not complained about getting haircuts since.</li>
            <li>It wraps fully around the body of my 7 year old.  </li>
            <li>It fits my 4yo a little loosely, but mostly did the job.</li>
            <li>Aside from that arrived super early and unlike what other reviews said....was the same print as the picture.</li>
            <li>Unlike professional salon capes, this one is a different material that, although slippery, has a lot of &#x27;cling&#x27;.</li>
            <li>For the price it is good and I likes the design and size but the actual neck area is badly made in the sense that nobody thought let&#x27;s put the velcro in a place to make it humanly possible actually make use of it.</li>

            <li> I am not a professional, but wanted something to stop the hair from getting down the back of his neck.  </li>
            <li> We use it for haircuts, and when my six-year-old is doing messy crafts at home.</li>
            <li> Works well for my 2 year old when cutting his hair.  </li>
            <li> Serves the intended purpose but annoying how much hair sticks to it by the end</li>
            <li> For a kid who hated having his hair cut because of the &#x27;itchies&#x27;, it has really saved the day.</li>
            <li> Not for hair cutting.</li>
            <li> I had to return this because of the bad plastic smell.</li>
            <li> instead they&#x27;re plastic, i wanted something washable, i&#x27;m disappointed.</li>

            <li> It fits my 4yo a little loosely, but mostly did the job. For a kid who hated having his hair cut because of the &#x27;itchies&#x27;, it has really saved the day. I have also used it on my husband that has a very large neck (comically large), and it fits him (barely). So I know that it will work for years to come on the entire family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like and why I gave it 3 stars, the hair sticks to the material. Unlike professional salon capes, this one is a different material that, although slippery, has a lot of &#x27;cling&#x27;. I end up having to wash it off in the bathtub after every use instead of just shaking it clean.</li>

            <li> Awesome! My 3 year old son loved this!</li>
            <li> Its made pretty cheaply</li>
            <li> I ordered this item for a children&#x27;s salon that I work in.  They work great and the children live them.</li>
            <li> does exactly what it should great quality great price.</li>
            <li> Love this. Works perfect for my 3 yr old</li>
            <li> Thought they were nylon instead they&#x27;re plastic, i wanted something washable, i&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this cape. My kid finally sat through a haircut without screaming. Yay!</li>
            <li> Not for hair cutting.</li>
            <li> It works.  My son does not complain about &amp;#34;itchy hair&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Makes cutting my 4 year Olds hair, more pleasant. Good fit.</li>
            <li> Our son loves the cape and wears it when we do our at home hair trims. Now if we could just get him used to the noise of the clippers ;)</li>
            <li> Works like it should.</li>
            <li> For the price it is good and I likes the design and size but the actual neck area is badly made in the sense that nobody thought let&#x27;s put the velcro in a place to make it humanly possible actually make use of it. I ended up having to almost twist the collar in a way around the neck so the two halls of Velcro could meet and be attached. Only using it every month or so to cut my son&#x27;s hair but I reckon next time I might just secure it with a safety pin or masking tape. Aside from that arrived super early and unlike what other reviews said....was the same print as the picture. Priced well for what you get.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my little boys!</li>
