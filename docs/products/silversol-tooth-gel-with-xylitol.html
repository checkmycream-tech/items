            <li>Original Review: Jan 9, 2015  </li>
            <li>I was excited to try this tooth gel with Xylitol and no abrasive ingredients nor glycerin that is suspected of coating teeth and inhibiting re-mineralization.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to clean my teeth.</li>
            <li>My teeth so not fee clean after using it</li>
            <li>not like any other toothpaste I&#x60;ve ever experienced.</li>
            <li>The flavor is mild.  </li>
            <li>will powerful silver fighting bacteria in the mouth.</li>
            <li>it just doesn&#x27;t feel as fresh when your finished.</li>
            <li>Jelly like substance does not leave your mouth with a fresh feeling.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have tried a tooth gel with silver as an antibacterial and I am pleased with it so far.</li>
            <li>WE LIKE IT VERY MUCH, BUT IT IS A BIT PRICY.</li>
            <li>I like the SilverSol tooth gel very much.</li>
            <li>so I use this first then finish with a neem and tea tree toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Very tasty toothpaste !</li>
            <li>It feels different from a tooth paste as does any tooth gel, but I love this product.</li>
            <li>I first notice one to the day it&#x27;s gone.  </li>
            <li>First off let me say that I have deducted one star because of the mint flavour.</li>
            <li>Silver sol has been fabulous for me in every form I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gel, so be aware of the texture.</li>
            <li>The gel contains carbomer, a by product of gasoline production that is used to give products a smooth consistency and which is highly acidic, and anyone who&#x27;s researched the effect of acid from sugars and carbohydrates on teeth knows that it&#x27;s the main cause of enamel erosion and tooth decay, in fact the reason I wanted a tooth product with Xylitol is for the neutralizing effect it has on the acids produced by sugars.</li>
            <li>Really makes diamonds and and gemstones sparkle.</li>
            <li>I have never believed in a product this much before.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I actually like the way it makes my teeth feel clean, and even though it&#x27;s not a perfect alternative, I believe it&#x27;s a pretty good alternative for the reasons I listed in my original review.</li>
            <li>I love this tooth paste because it has no additives, no fluride and has the potential to actually kill mouth bacteria that causes gum disease, etc.</li>
            <li>I AM ALTERNATING IT WITH ANOTHER NATURAL TOOTHPASTE, WHICH IS MUCH CHEAPER.</li>
            <li>Normally it takes about 14 days from the day</li>
            <li>First time purchasing a toothpaste with silver, always used natural pastes without fluoride.&lt;br /&gt;Has a very mild mint flavor, not strong like regular toothpastes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve increased my rating from my original one star to a three star since I do like using it but haven&#x27;t used it long enough to determine it&#x27;s effectiveness.      </li>
            <li>Ingredients: SilverSol Solution (deionized water and purified silver), xylitol, carbomer, TEA, natural coloring and peppermint oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would buy it again based on my experience so far.</li>
            <li>The fact that this tooth gel has no fluoride, no SLS, no parabens and no harsh abrasives.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s just this weird sticky goo that just doesn&#x27;t feel good in my mouth.</li>
            <li>I actually use the wound care gel primarily on my dog when he chews himself raw.  </li>
            <li>I brushed my teeth with the SilverSol and the next day, not only had the sore not gotten worse, but actually felt better!  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really mix with water or saliva very well and leaves a weird coating that I really have to rinse out.</li>

            <li> It is different then other toothpastes.</li>
            <li> I also use it in conjunction with other toothpastes such as those containing bee propolis and tea tree/manuka oil, or after I have done a 20-minute coconut oil-pulling session.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to it, basically silver water, xylitol, and carbomer, with peppermint oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I believe it works to keep the bacteria in my mouth down.</li>
            <li> bland perhaps?  </li>
            <li> I was initially disappointed when I first received this product and noticed that it contained carbomer and TEA as noted in my initial review below.</li>
            <li> like the fact that it is toothpaste with silver in it, and that it&#x27;s free of all the other crap that&#x27;s in a lot of toothpastes, but the carbomer ruins it for me.</li>
            <li> I even mixed it with baking soda still not good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting canker sores since I was a little girl.  </li>
            <li> We need natural ingredients, not just chemicals made to fake us into feeling cleaner than it makes us.</li>
            <li> So unfortunately I can&#x27;t comment on the efficacy of this product because I&#x27;m afraid to put it in my mouth, and I&#x27;m very disappointed that what at first looked like a healthy alternative to conventional tooth paste</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure I realized that it didn&#x27;t have fluoride in it.</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to at first, but that&#x27;s just because it doesn&#x27;t have those nasty ingredients that make it foam up.  </li>
            <li> It felt so weird and watery in my mouth.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever had one, you know they are very painful!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It felt so weird and watery in my mouth. I threw it away.</li>
            <li> ORDERED THIS FOR MY MOTHER &amp; MYSELF. WE USE THE REGULAR GEL FOR THE SKIN WITH GOOD RESULTS, SO WE&#x27;RE TRYING THE TOOTH GEL. WE LIKE IT VERY MUCH, BUT IT IS A BIT PRICY. I AM ALTERNATING IT WITH ANOTHER NATURAL TOOTHPASTE, WHICH IS MUCH CHEAPER. I LOVE THE FEEL OF MY MOUTH AFTER USING THIS TOOTH GEL.</li>
            <li> I love this tooth paste because it has no additives, no fluride and has the potential to actually kill mouth bacteria that causes gum disease, etc. I haven&#x27;t been to the dentist since I began using the tooth paste, however, my gums feel better and my mouth feels cleaner.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to clean my teeth. It&#x27;s like brushing with jello. And contains TEA which can kill dogs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Triethylamine&lt;br /&gt;121-44-8&lt;br /&gt;Hazard Summary-Created in April 1992; Revised in January 2000&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acute (short-term) exposure of humans to triethylamine vapor causes eye irritation, corneal swelling, and halo vision etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ref: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triethylamine</li>
            <li> First time purchasing a toothpaste with silver, always used natural pastes without fluoride.&lt;br /&gt;Has a very mild mint flavor, not strong like regular toothpastes. Will be purchasing again because I&lt;br /&gt;really like knowing I have a toothpaste will powerful silver fighting bacteria in the mouth.</li>
            <li> Verdict still is out because I feel like my gums feel healthier but I feel like it doesn&#x27;t clean as well as most toothpaste so I use this first then finish with a neem and tea tree toothpaste. The health benefits are there it just doesn&#x27;t feel as fresh when your finished. My gums do look healthier</li>
            <li> I like it as it&#x27;s safer than traditional toothpaste.</li>
            <li> A great product for gum disease - and the killing of mouth bacteria - recommend</li>
            <li> We like it!!!  New experience and a good one!!!</li>
            <li> I like this toothpaste alot.</li>
            <li> It makes toothbrushing reajjy easy</li>
            <li> Also great for cleaning fine jewelry. Really makes diamonds and and gemstones sparkle.</li>
            <li> Very tasty toothpaste !</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff now for several weeks. I use it every day. It doesn&#x27;t foam or anything, but it doesn&#x27;t have the SLS which I believe is what causes that and that is a good thing in my opinion. We need natural ingredients, not just chemicals made to fake us into feeling cleaner than it makes us. It feels different from a tooth paste as does any tooth gel, but I love this product. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Ingredients: SilverSol Solution (deionized water and purified silver), xylitol, carbomer, TEA, natural coloring and peppermint oil.&lt;br /&gt;So I will not reorder, but make my own. Their liquid silver is the best as far as I am concerned!</li>
            <li> Best toothpaste in the world!</li>
            <li> I believe it works to keep the bacteria in my mouth down. I would buy it again based on my experience so far.</li>
            <li> i love it does what it says thank you.</li>
            <li> It is different then other toothpastes.</li>
            <li> No way to tell if or how effective it is.  But I add it alongside my regular toothpaste, use it regularly, and have ordered it repeatedly.</li>
            <li> I was given a tube of SilverSol Tooth Gel when I purchased some of their Armor Gel wound care gel.  I actually use the wound care gel primarily on my dog when he chews himself raw.  As soon as I apply the ointment he stops chewing immediately and the wound is healing over within 3 days.  So, when I got a canker sore in my mouth I though Oooh!  I&#x27;ll try the tooth gel.  I&#x27;ve been getting canker sores since I was a little girl.  Normally it takes about 14 days from the day I first notice one to the day it&#x27;s gone.  If you&#x27;ve ever had one, you know they are very painful! I brushed my teeth with the SilverSol and the next day, not only had the sore not gotten worse, but actually felt better!  I could not believe it.  On the morning of the 4th day the sore was gone!  I called the company and asked them if I could write a testimonial for them.  I have never believed in a product this much before. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I love silver product allergies to many toothpaste not this</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the taste and I&#x27;m not sure I realized that it didn&#x27;t have fluoride in it. I like SilverSol get just fine but not this tooth gel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like brushing your teeth with acrylic paint or something. It doesn&#x27;t create any foam, it&#x27;s just this weird sticky goo that just doesn&#x27;t feel good in my mouth. There&#x27;s not much to it, basically silver water, xylitol, and carbomer, with peppermint oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that it is toothpaste with silver in it, and that it&#x27;s free of all the other crap that&#x27;s in a lot of toothpastes, but the carbomer ruins it for me. It doesn&#x27;t really mix with water or saliva very well and leaves a weird coating that I really have to rinse out.</li>
            <li> I like the SilverSol tooth gel very much. It cleans my teeth and freshens my breath. It is sweetened with xylitol which is a safer sweetener. I wish the toothpaste offered a variety of flavors like cinnamon without sacrificing its purity.</li>
            <li> My teeth so not fee clean after using it I even mixed it with baking soda still not good</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t like the taste, yet it&#x27;s better than most others I&#x27;ve tried, and NO Floride! Pineally good.</li>
            <li> not like any other toothpaste I&#x60;ve ever experienced. Jelly like substance does not leave your mouth with a fresh feeling.</li>
            <li> Love the concept!  Can&#x27;t call it gross...bland perhaps?  Niche market for sure</li>
            <li> First off let me say that I have deducted one star because of the mint flavour. While mint taste is okay I would prefer to have the choice of something else like cinnamon. The fact that this tooth gel has no fluoride, no SLS, no parabens and no harsh abrasives. It is a great plus and because of that I must add one star for each. This is the first time I have tried a tooth gel with silver as an antibacterial and I am pleased with it so far. I have just started to use it prior to taking Premier Research&#x27;s DentaVen tooth and gum support. I also use it in conjunction with other toothpastes such as those containing bee propolis and tea tree/manuka oil, or after I have done a 20-minute coconut oil-pulling session.</li>
            <li> I personally enjoy silver products and I like this toothpaste too. I don&#x27;t have any gum or oral problems but I use it as a preventive measure.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste because it&#x27;s great for cleaning my teeth and breath, but it&#x27;s not over-flavored so it doesn&#x27;t make my mouth sting like most toothpastes do. I also have healthier gums and no bleeding when I floss, so I think it has to be healthier than those I&#x27;ve used before. Silver sol has been fabulous for me in every form I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> I use this after brushing with xylitol.  I feel it keeps my teeth and gums clean and removes any bacteria left behind. It&#x27;s a gel, so be aware of the texture. The flavor is mild.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Updated Feb: 15, 2015  I was initially disappointed when I first received this product and noticed that it contained carbomer and TEA as noted in my initial review below. After some consideration and further research I realized that I&#x27;d been brushing with those same ingredients in standard commercial tooth paste all my life so I decided to try this. I actually like the way it makes my teeth feel clean, and even though it&#x27;s not a perfect alternative, I believe it&#x27;s a pretty good alternative for the reasons I listed in my original review. I&#x27;ve ordered my second tube, and am using it regularly. I&#x27;ve increased my rating from my original one star to a three star since I do like using it but haven&#x27;t used it long enough to determine it&#x27;s effectiveness.      Original Review: Jan 9, 2015  I was excited to try this tooth gel with Xylitol and no abrasive ingredients nor glycerin that is suspected of coating teeth and inhibiting re-mineralization. My excitement faded when I received my order and began researching the items listed as ingredients. The gel contains carbomer, a by product of gasoline production that is used to give products a smooth consistency and which is highly acidic, and anyone who&#x27;s researched the effect of acid from sugars and carbohydrates on teeth knows that it&#x27;s the main cause of enamel erosion and tooth decay, in fact the reason I wanted a tooth product with Xylitol is for the neutralizing effect it has on the acids produced by sugars. So to neutralize the effect of carbomer, TEA (triethanolamine) is added which is suspected of causing immunotoxicity, respiratory toxicity and asthma. So unfortunately I can&#x27;t comment on the efficacy of this product because I&#x27;m afraid to put it in my mouth, and I&#x27;m very disappointed that what at first looked like a healthy alternative to conventional tooth paste turned out to be anything but.</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to at first, but that&#x27;s just because it doesn&#x27;t have those nasty ingredients that make it foam up.  I love the stuff and will keep on using.  It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  Can&#x27;t wait to see what the dentist says.</li>
