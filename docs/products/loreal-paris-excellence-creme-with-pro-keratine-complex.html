            <li> It colors all my grey hair a rich dark shade of brown.</li>
            <li> The dark brown shade is natural looking.  </li>
            <li> how long the color last.</li>
            <li> I am a male and this is my go-to for managing grey coverage.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long though.</li>
            <li> According to my friend, the color doesn&#x27;t last very long and the picture is misleading in regards to hair color.</li>
            <li> Hard floors won&#x27;t stain if you clean up the mess</li>
            <li> I tried Excellence (dark brown) instead of the regular Preference (natural black).</li>
            <li> My hair can only be described as black and I use the #4.</li>
            <li> I use the add-on here on amazon and it saves me a little bit than buying locally.</li>
            <li> Boxes were starting to arrive a little banged up.</li>
            <li> Im surprised to read the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> There are a few extra steps with this application (the preconditioner, and the longer application time).</li>
            <li> The other is the &amp;#34;To-Go 10-minute&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> color came out just as expected!</li>
            <li> Not sure how this can be possible....</li>
            <li> Always leaves my hair feeling silky and doesn&#x27;t drip like some other brands.  </li>
            <li> I feel dark brown is not really my color.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find that L&#x27;oreal hair color lasts longer than any other hair color out there....</li>
            <li> Used before, at least the last two yrs.</li>
            <li> I have been using L&#x27;Oreal Excellence Creme in the dark brown color for years now.</li>
            <li> My hair is dark brown to begin with.</li>
            <li> have long hair, just past my shoulders.</li>
            <li> Does the job but color seemed dull and flat.  </li>
            <li> It dyed my hair BLACK.</li>
            <li> This never happens with the black color.</li>
            <li> Seemed too harsh.</li>
            <li> , after a few washes, the dark brown kinda loses the color and gets a bit dull.</li>
            <li> I find that I need a hair trim at least twice a year to keep the ends from frying and looking tired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had bad results with other brands.  </li>
            <li> I ordered it based on the descriptive title and got the WRONG product.  </li>
            <li> quality issues or wrong packing...really disappointed</li>

            <li> Beautiful, rich color and ask the necessary items to achieve good, overall color including a comb to assist with the color.</li>
            <li> Used before, at least the last two yrs. I really like the color &amp; how long the color last.</li>
            <li> I am a male and this is my go-to for managing grey coverage. This product lasts from 2-3 weeks for a pompadour cut. Easy application and a pretty affordable price. I use the add-on here on amazon and it saves me a little bit than buying locally.</li>
            <li> on behalf of my wife. She buys this product all the time.</li>
            <li> This hair color is able to cover my very resistant grey.  I have had bad results with other brands.  The dark brown shade is natural looking.  I purchase this product as an Amazon.com subscription monthly.  Fully satisfied with product and delivery.</li>
            <li> Love Loreal hair color all the time.</li>
            <li> My mother asked me to order this. Is the only thing she would use - The color is very natural and does not wear off.</li>
            <li> There are two similar products from L&#x27;Oreal.  One of them requires a 30 minute application.  The other is the &amp;#34;To-Go 10-minute&amp;#34; product.  This IS NOT the To-Go 10-minute product.  I ordered it based on the descriptive title and got the WRONG product.  Now I want to return it but Amazon says the product is not returnable.</li>
            <li> color came out just as expected!</li>
            <li> I got three 3 boxes of this product and 2 were fine to use. The last box which I used to color my hair did not worked and I have to use entire color in one go to make sure the hair does gets colored. But it was not. Not sure how this can be possible....quality issues or wrong packing...really disappointed</li>
            <li> I love it.less $$ thru amazon</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and have always had great results.  The color is a true, very dark brown</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years.  Always leaves my hair feeling silky and doesn&#x27;t drip like some other brands.  Excellent!  :)</li>
            <li> This was a gift. According to my friend, the color doesn&#x27;t last very long and the picture is misleading in regards to hair color.</li>
            <li> I have been using L&#x27;Oreal Excellence Creme in the dark brown color for years now. I love the thick, easy to apply cream lotion. The color lasts the full 6 weeks. I usually buy it at Target, but many times they are out of my color. I have searched Amazon repeatedly, but the only one coming close to it was the To-Go 10 min. Version. I thought I would try it out, but when it arrived, it was the product that I had been searching for, and it is $3 cheaper than at Target. I have it on scheduled delivery now. Second delivery was the same excellence Creme that I love.</li>
            <li> Does the job but color seemed dull and flat.  My hair did not feel the same after using this product.  Seemed too harsh.</li>
            <li> It dyed my hair BLACK.</li>
            <li> 4 dark brown is my favorite hair color to cover my grey hair. It works well.  Recommend it!</li>
            <li> I love this color, plus with the added highlights that you get adds to the highlights you might put in and you get your self a double highlight. Or you can use just that color and it looks like you have highlights already.</li>
            <li> I have always used L&#x27;oreal hair color. I tried Excellence (dark brown) instead of the regular Preference (natural black). I feel dark brown is not really my color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, after a few washes, the dark brown kinda loses the color and gets a bit dull. This never happens with the black color. Maybe it is just me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a good product, and I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and during that time used \\&quot;professional color\\&quot; too. By far this product is superior to others I have used. It colors all my grey hair a rich dark shade of brown. I leave it on for 30 minutes. I ordered 4 but think I will get the subscription service.</li>
            <li> This has been my go-to hair color for about 10 years now. I have a ton of grey hair and have always had great results. My hair is dark brown to begin with. Im surprised to read the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> Looks nice! I bought it for my mom. My mom looks much younger with this color:)</li>
            <li> I have used this for years, great gray coverage. I was glad to be able to get it on subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> I find that L&#x27;oreal hair color lasts longer than any other hair color out there....I will keep using this product from now on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Giovanna</li>
            <li> Love It. Makes my color back to my original hair Color. It does not harm my hairs quality,This is the reason i will recommend this.</li>
            <li> I went to the salon the first time I decided to cover my greys because I was nervous about doing it myself. After $175 (no joke) I figured there had to be a better way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After some consultation with Google this brand seemed to be the best for grey coverage. I am not a hair care professional so I cannot comment on the quality of ingredients. I can comment on results, ease of use and hair condition after using this regularly every 4-6 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long hair, just past my shoulders. If I want to make sure I have enough for all my hair I get three packs. However at this time I&#x27;m only doing my roots, so one is enough. The instructions are in English and Spanish. They are easy to follow and it comes with handy gloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with two applicators a pointed one and a forked one. I use the pointed one because it seems to be more precise and less messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve dropped some dye on the floor in the bathroom and in my carpet. The carpet stain never came out. Hard floors won&#x27;t stain if you clean up the mess right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dye comes with the best hair conditioner! I love it and try and stretch it as long as I can. It keeps my hair soft and manageable. I find that I need a hair trim at least twice a year to keep the ends from frying and looking tired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend for easy diy grey coverage at home. I included a before/after photo. My hair can only be described as black and I use the #4.</li>
            <li> Boxes were starting to arrive a little banged up. So I just decided to go au naturel.&lt;br /&gt;Mrs Hambone</li>
            <li> There are a few extra steps with this application (the preconditioner, and the longer application time). I&#x27;ve been using the 10-minute ones to cover grays, but decided to try this on a whim. I&#x27;ve used it a few times since, and love how soft it leaves my hair. It doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long though. The difference is about a week, so that isn&#x27;t a deal-breaker. I just end up avoiding hair-parting that last week before reapplication.</li>
