            <li> I got this for my wife, who is the foremost Betty Boop fanitic. I did not expect her to wear it, thought it just to be an addition to her collection. Funny thing was it smelled great. She wears it and is a classic little statue sitting on her dressing table.</li>
            <li> I love Betty Boop so I had to get this parfum spray and I am so glad I did!  Other than the bottle looking cute, I got it at a great price, with free shipping!  And it smells GREAT!!  THANK YOU!!</li>
            <li> A perfect gift for someone very special.</li>
            <li> smelled nice-love the decanter bottle-going to order other 3 w/different Betty Boop poses-gave it five stars for beauty and great fragrance</li>
            <li> My mother loves the smell.</li>
            <li> This was great I love Bettyboop and this was a great addition to my collection !!!!!!</li>
            <li> Fragrance smells like wild flowers being choked out by weeds. I dont like it at all. The bottle is very cute though. Im a BB collector, so I&#x27;ll keep it to add to my collection and just not use the horrible cologne</li>
            <li> I got this as a present for my mom, and she loved it! she said it was so cute and looked just like the picture shown. She also loved the way it smelled although it was a tad strong, other than that its awesome!</li>
            <li> It came earlier than it was suppose to &amp; its very good quality, I would definitely order it &amp; othwr things from here again</li>
            <li> Betty boop looks bigger in the picture. But its cute anyways</li>
            <li> I love the bottle and is smell good  I enjoy my bettyboop. Im going to put it in my collection of bettyboop</li>
            <li> My mom literally has a room with Betty Boop and Alpha Kappa Alpha knick knacks etc. and she never even knew about the perfume. shes happy and im happy. it looks exactly what it looks like and smells sweet cant quite describe it. i guess the closest i can describe is lady calvin klien but sweeter. it got here fast EXACTLY on V-DAY perfect timing. 5/6</li>
            <li> Sister in-law love this gift she is obsessed with Betty book and didn&#x27;t even know the had this perfume.  She was so surprised and happy</li>
            <li> This is awesome if your a Betty Boop fan you will love this smell and the bottle is soooo cute it sits on my jewelry box. I&#x27;m so pleased with how cute they made the doll. It looks just like the picture. I&#x27;m getting all of the Betty Boop perfumes now!</li>
            <li> Got this for my Sister-in-Law; when we opened the package the box (actual perfume box) was smashed. I wasn&#x27;t going to give it to her but it was for her so I did. The perfume does not have a smell to it.  I would not recommend this purchase if you are looking for actual perfume smell. If you want it for décor then its good for that.</li>
            <li> This was for my mum who is a huge boop collector. I wouldn&#x27;t think she would have any interest in the perfume, but I liked that it looked like a figurine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s actually a rubber/plastic piece on top of a small container of perfume, and while it shipped fast the head was broken off when it arrived.  I was able to glue it with crazy glue and it looked fine otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not high end by any means but for the price  it was acceptable, and since the head twists on, I would think this might be an issue for others purchasing it, but it&#x27;s cute to put on a dresser as a showpiece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The perfume was rancid smelling seriously. I dumped that out an added her favorite perfume to it instead. I would recommend that for others who purchase also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cute and unique but again not high end or well made, so if that&#x27;s what you are looking for, keep looking.</li>
            <li> Despite what some say the fragrance smells nice just depends on your preference. the figure was much bigger than I expected. this was a gift for my best friend she&#x27;ll love it</li>
