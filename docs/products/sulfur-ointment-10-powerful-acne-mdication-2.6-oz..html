            <li>This ointment works great in conjunction with the Sulfur Acne Soap.</li>
            <li>: do a spot treatment with sulfur ointment (FYI ,sulfur ointment works GREAT for ingrown hairs in your bikini area)&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been working great for that as well.&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>Great for curing skin fungus.</li>

            <li>Great product for the price, and delivered at noted in the invoice.</li>
            <li>Wish I knew about it many years ago!!</li>
            <li>This stuff is very effective..</li>
            <li>Nice ointment use it twice a day!  </li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>I bought this ointment once before, and loved it then.</li>
            <li>good to have in medicine cabinet...</li>
            <li>My skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good since I was a kid.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and ordered this product after reading some good reviews but it doesn&#x27;t work for</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my purchase of the sulfur ointment.  </li>
            <li>The Proactiv mask was one of my favorite products, and Mario Badescu&#x27;s healing lotion has been a great spot treatment for me (but a bit</li>
            <li>I am so glad I ordered De La Cruz Sulfur Ointment! 1.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>this product is amazing.</li>
            <li>i tried it out and omg its amazing.</li>
            <li>amazing you can even use it to exfoliate.&lt;br /&gt;what</li>
            <li>that, I use the Vitaville argan oil, which has amazing anti-aging and anti-inflammatory properties.</li>
            <li>does what it says ive used everything perscription an over the counter an this was as good or better than any</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything and am thrilled to have found this product.  </li>
            <li>thayer&#x27;s witch hazel rose</li>
            <li>It has a wonderful texture and does not add oil to my skin and has been very beneficial for pimples.</li>
            <li>I wonder if the company could look for another medium to deliver medication that works just as effective.</li>
            <li>do read the reviews, but I am judicious in forming my own opinion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found Bye Bye Blemish 10x more effective.</li>
            <li>Didnt use it, was too strong!</li>
            <li>I have tried many face creams for acne treatment and this is buy far one of the best products!</li>
            <li>It works great and doesn&#x27;t take very much to use.</li>
            <li>My skin peeled for the first week or two but has been great since.  </li>
            <li>More time.</li>
            <li>better results in my eyes.</li>
            <li>It seems that it has gotten even better.</li>
            <li>It works okay.</li>
            <li>Nothing works for acne but a healthy lifestyle</li>
            <li>you may want to order more than one.</li>
            <li>My experience has been, if it&#x27;s used daily it will work wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Works okay for what it is intended.</li>
            <li>So it made for more work.</li>
            <li>I have used the proactiv sulphur mask and I love using it on occasion.</li>
            <li>:)&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this product does something,</li>
            <li>love it too.</li>
            <li>I love it, but I don&#x27;t like the chiggers.</li>
            <li>They sure love me though.</li>
            <li>Most products, I&#x27;ve had to apply, reapply, reapply, reapply...</li>
            <li>Yes, the smell does linger a bit for more than 1 day.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it and what it does for my skin.</li>
            <li>- you might find it better to apply during day.</li>
            <li>Proactiv was helpful in some ways, but I realized it was mostly because it exfoliated my skin and cleaned my pores.</li>
            <li>I read more reviews about people leaving it on overnight</li>
            <li>so I thought I would give this a try, and I am sure glad I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li>i&#x27;d been suffering from severe acne since my teenages years, i had tried proactive, benzol peroxide &amp; many more products out there in the market, within a week</li>
            <li>and i will continue to order more of your product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s was so greasy, I was worried about having more blemishes just from using the product.</li>
            <li>This stuff works like magic for close to the surface acne and blackheads.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>I have really oily skin and since using this product I don&#x27;t need any foundation/makeup which is great.  </li>
            <li>I have more infected acne</li>
            <li>and I did get better.  </li>
            <li>So after 3 weeks I began to breakout more, so I have stoppped using it.</li>
            <li>the product is very effective, however, it also costed so much.</li>
            <li>this product and its great because its natural!!</li>
            <li>: 25-34&lt;br /&gt;Climate: warm, humid, very hot weather&lt;</li>
            <li>When I first began to use this I spread a very light coating of it all over my face and neck area for 15-20 minutes at night and again in the morning, washing it off withjust warm water.</li>
            <li>I have had better luck with with the sulfur soap that I bought here on amazon, then using witch hazel as an astringent and then using Mario Badescu - Drying Lotion Glass - 1 oz available on amazon for spot treatment.</li>
            <li>wash face with olay pro-x brush + exfoliating creme (right now I&#x27;m using korres rose scrub)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I learned this very quickly.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s easy to apply, and it works.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does have a strong sulfur smell, but I didn&#x27;t mind it if it was going to help me w/</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend trying.</li>
            <li>It also has a strong odor.</li>
            <li>At this point I am able to use it overnight at full strength on any existing pimples with no redness or irritation to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At about 2 days, my face was amazingly clearer and softer, but my face did start to peel, it turned into a sunburn-like texture on certain areas of my face.</li>
            <li>I suffer from CYSTIC ACNE and heard such great things about &amp;#34;sulfur&amp;#34;, that I also bought the Dr. Kaufmann Medicated Sulfur Soap to use for my face in the shower..</li>
            <li>A great price and actually works.</li>
            <li>, I just didn&#x27;t know I could get it so cheaply until amazon.</li>
            <li>The next morning my skin feels great.</li>
            <li>It was a smooth transaction, the product was well packaged.  </li>
            <li>It was so cheap</li>
            <li>and it is FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I will update if this helps clear my acne for good T.T fingers</li>
            <li>This works great for anyone with acne that has found that sulfur helps their acne (many other treatments dont work for her.)  </li>
            <li>Pretty miraculous!!</li>
            <li>I thought it was worth a shot!</li>
            <li>so worth the money!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and well worth the price.</li>
            <li>It adds no oiliness to your skin though, and washes completely clean with water.</li>
            <li>and I went online to amazon and review many products to do wound care on this dog and this stuff worked amazingly to keep the wound moist as I had to debris it 2 times daily for a month.</li>
            <li>it (along with the sulfur soap) works amazingly well to keep my adult acne to a minimum.</li>
            <li>Works great but be careful as it dries up Everything: nails,hair, and skin.</li>
            <li>But what the heck, rather glowing skin and a bit smell then full face of pimples, which I used to have</li>
            <li>/&gt;Knowing that sulfur was effective in treating adult acne, and hormonal acne, I searched Amazon for sulfur acne products that might just be that miracle that I was wishing existed for my skin...</li>
            <li>/&gt;- wash face gently with sulfur soap (I think my face likes to be very clean, but</li>
            <li>I had originally bought it to use on hormonal acne, but haven&#x27;t had success with it for that.</li>
            <li>It dries up the pimples quickly and leaves no scar.  </li>
            <li>quickly heals and exfoliates the skin 3.</li>
            <li>I have tried many, many different acne products, spent hundreds of dollars and this is by far the BEST product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Order dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>I travel to Iceland often, and whenever I am there, my skin quickly improves.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with how fast my face is clearing up, brightening, soft, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t use it much because of how strong it is on my face.</li>
            <li>The negative reviews often talked about teens or people who maybe didn&#x27;t follow the directions exactly as stated, or sulfur just wasn&#x27;t the best ingredient for their treatment.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great at drying up a pimple-one I didn&#x27;t mess with and get all inflamed.</li>
            <li>I believed the positive reviews seemed more detailed and the explanations were clearly thought out.</li>
            <li>It is worth a try for the price.</li>
            <li>so worth the money</li>
            <li>Totally worth it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>If you are someone that can overlook these, this product is worth it.</li>
            <li>Right after washing, I put this on for 10 mins and rinse away.</li>
            <li>It is powerful, I usually apply oil after showering with the soap, but it works great.</li>
            <li>I normally use Cetaphil and a cheap drug store product&lt;</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyhow, this revision seems to do the job just as good as the previous one, but without drying my skin out.</li>
            <li>tried so many products and many just dried out but</li>
            <li>Only drawback is the strong odor, but you get used to it quickly.  </li>
            <li>First I will give you some background about me and my acne case.  </li>
            <li>For the first 5-10 days I used it, my skin would feel warm/irritated/itchy before rinsing it off.</li>
            <li>Works very well!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I never write reviews, but this stuff really works!</li>
            <li>Additionally, the smell is a bit off putting at first, but once you wash off the ointment the smell doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li>But this thing really works!</li>
            <li>for real!</li>
            <li>Pretty viscous stuff.</li>
            <li>first started using this product as a mask 2 times a week, just as suggested by the label.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>When I first got this product I did not read the directions and used it as a spot treatment at night, not rinsing it off.</li>
            <li>My mother has the same issue, so I know that blemishes will be an issue for me in my future, so I figure I will try different products to see what works best.</li>
            <li>I first used the product as directed, washed my face at night with CeraVe</li>
            <li>At first I was taken aback.</li>
            <li>First time I tried this</li>
            <li>The first time I used it my face started to peel but that lasted for about 1 week max.  </li>
            <li>My skin is smooth, soft, no inflammation.  </li>
            <li>and I was only able to find it in the Walmart in Miami.  </li>
            <li>After the my first application it began to itch</li>
            <li>First the product was very oily.  </li>
            <li>Listen, people: For the first time since I was quite young, I can leave my house with no makeup at all, even when my hormones should be reeking havoc on my face, and my skin looks clear, my pores are clean and tiny, and my skin tone is pretty darn even considering the acne scarring I have on my chin area from picking at my skin when I was too young to know better (don&#x27;t do it, kids!).</li>
            <li>It can also be mixed with moisturizer easily (in an amount about 4:1 moisturizer to sulfur ointment), to use on the face or areas all day.  </li>
            <li>has helped my face clear up greatly, plus no more peeling skin.&lt;br /&gt;hope</li>
            <li>/&gt;Yes, this product smell, but hey, it has 10% sulfur in it, that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s effective for black heads and pimples.</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s dog got bit by something and was loosing his fur in patches until he had a huge wound on his back.</li>
            <li>product is very gooey and sticky.  </li>
            <li>but not as fast as I heard.</li>
            <li>On the flip side though, it does really work to heal acne</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had problems with my ski for years and this stuff has really been working.</li>
            <li>I already had this product, but hadn&#x27;t really started using it because you have to put it on, wait and rinse it off</li>
            <li>my skin is really clearing up.</li>
            <li>Very sticky and didn&#x27;t want to stay on skin.</li>
            <li>But, it really dries up my face.</li>
            <li>It is very oily and makes my face oily as well.</li>
            <li>I was worried about putting something so greasy/oily on my face, but it really works...</li>
            <li>When I put it on it is very sticky and never seems to \\&quot;absorb\\&quot; in.</li>
            <li>up with lots of sulfur on my pillows.... not so much on my face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- wipe face gently with cotton ball</li>
            <li>works really well at clearing scars, like acne scars</li>
            <li>It is Oily, but it does the job if used twice a week it really helps control breakouts and reduce black/white heads.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t really help.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I put on a very think layer and leave it in.</li>
            <li>It just made my face really itchy and did not do that much.  </li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve been using this, the areas aren&#x27;t really as oily.</li>
            <li>I have had acne my whole life.</li>
            <li>and when I use a sulfur mask and then put this on any acne it really helps.  </li>
            <li>I already use 2/3 of it, didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li>I like it, but it&#x27;s really greasy.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>It does not cure scabies, but it worked very well with the prescription I was on, Ivermectin.  </li>
            <li>Leave it on 10 minutes and wash off with warm water, or sometimes leave it on for a few hours.  </li>
            <li>This is the only product that has been able to clear up and keep pimples from my face.  </li>
            <li>since my skin is quite used to acid and retinols, I started experimenting using it every other night over my forehead, where I have most of my stuborn breakouts.</li>
            <li>The next morning, my skin was significantly clearer.</li>
            <li>&quot; Professional \\&quot; don&#x27;t even carry higher then  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it now!</li>
            <li>This seems to be doing a decent job.</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;ve experienced far worse in a face mask.</li>
            <li>Hormonal acne didn&#x27;t seem to have a quick fix, and I tried everything topical, as well as oral vitamins and probiotics.</li>
            <li>My acne is also &#x27;hormonal&#x27;, I suspect, and is mainly around my chin area.</li>
            <li>After using it twice daily for about 3 months, I began to only use it once daily in the morning for 15-30 minutes, with the same great effects.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>, I think it may be highly abrasive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I highly recommend it to anyone who is NOT allergic to the sulfur.</li>
            <li>Sure, it&#x27;s a little sulfur-y</li>
            <li>, I wouldn&#x27;t mind spending a little more for that amount.</li>
            <li>The odor isn&#x27;t too strong like other Sulfur products I&#x27;ve tried ...</li>
            <li>started getting acne again about 5 years ago and as an adult, this is really embarassing and I hatted it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Clears my breakouts and prevents new ones form coming in.</li>
            <li>it seriously sucks out all the puss and yuck from your pimple and reduces redness.&lt;br /&gt;also good for ance that is deep into the skin.</li>
            <li>Yes, sulfur does stink, but if you have big pores, oily skin and some acne, you&#x27;ll probably just want to overlook that tiny detail if you want smooth, glowing skin.</li>
            <li>a week I also use a fruit peel, which helps to get rid of dead skin, which is important so that all the products really can penetrate into the skin and not just sit on the surface.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am so glad I took a chance on an unknown product that just seemed way too affordable to actually work on my skin!</li>
            <li>The swelling and redness had improved, and within a week, my face was almost completely clear!</li>
            <li>Both the scented and non-scented have worked exactly the same.  </li>
            <li>I am not sure how they were able to do that.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s a given), the consistency (it is fairly sticky and doesn&#x27;t seem to dry), and that it can dry out your skin pretty bad if overused (which is also obvious, but I had such great results I wanted to keep using it).</li>
            <li>She is so soft to touch, and what man doesn&#x27;t want a soft woman to hold by his side?!</li>
            <li>It has help clear some of my pimples and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve known sulfur to clear up acne for years</li>
            <li>My face isn&#x27;t 100% clear yet, but I&#x27;m hoping it will get there.</li>
            <li>My face isn&#x27;t 100% clear yet, but I&#x27;m hoping it will get there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 days and my face is almost clear.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Everytime we go to Disney it would clear up.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if my face is ultra sensitive  but even with the lightest coat of this sulfur ointment on the affected area, my fact literally feels as though it is burning</li>
            <li>I do not recommend if you have sensitive or acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>I have adult acne that I have been battling and was hoping this would help.</li>
            <li>With 10% it&#x27;s the highest I&#x27;ve seen with out having to buy professional &amp; even then some \\</li>
            <li>No side effects for me, just amazingly soft skin.</li>
            <li>I am 34 yrs old and suffer cystic acne along with blackhead n whitehead.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really sensitive using this,</li>
            <li>first tried using a Bye Bye Blemish type of ointment a long time ago.</li>
            <li>Iam 30 years old and for probably 15 years I&#x27;ve been trying to clear my acne.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like too much is that for an acne medication it is greasy which you would think would be something you don&#x27;t want on oily skin.  </li>
            <li>Hey, I didn&#x27;t mind getting some exfoliation going on my face, but it was very peely and very red!</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 weeks now</li>
            <li>I recommend that you use it at night before you go to bed, also when you wash it off of you, use an old raggedy wash cloth.</li>
            <li>So after you&#x27;re done, put on an old t-shirt.</li>
            <li>have very oily skin and various types of acne.</li>
            <li>I looked up treatmeny for rosacea and adult acne and found out about using sulpher based creams.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ve already tried everything else, why not give it a whirl, you&#x27;ll be surprised</li>
            <li>I am 51 years old and still suffer from acne flare-ups.  </li>
            <li>So I thought I would try this product, since it was natural.</li>
            <li>The previous reviews convinced me that this ointment was powerful but it was just heavy, gritty and strong odor!</li>
            <li>It will dry the skin and speed up the natural exfoliation where applied and might have a slight burning or warm sensation so use just a tiny amount and rub in well to spread.</li>
            <li>clears dark marks and scars 200% better than any of those high priced \\&quot;dark spot correctors\\&quot; 4.</li>
            <li>Be aware that over use of it can cause your skin to become very dry.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s crazy cheap, easy to use</li>
            <li>do have to be careful of NOT over drying your skin, thus the proper moisterizing of your skin is super important.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>tub only contains 2.5 ounces, so if you&#x27;re planning on using it on large areas (back, bum, etc.)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had, on my face/chest/back, and continue to have, moderate acne, mild nodular acne, aggressive acne due to prednisone use, and blackheads of all types.  </li>
            <li>We live in a rural, wooded area.</li>
            <li>in fact if you use it too much it will dry out your face.</li>
            <li>The label does recommend use up to 3 times a day, which would dry out my skin way too much, but for those with oily skin, that may be an option.</li>
            <li>This stuff is very greasy consistency, but believe be it works well to dry out pimples.  </li>
            <li>This sulfur based product is the first thing that has worked for me with my decade long problem with acne (and I&#x27;m only 21).</li>
            <li>That irritating feeling has gone away completely for me, and I&#x27;m able to leave it on without any irritation now.  </li>
            <li>Whatever is left over in the skin is doing its job to clear your acne</li>
            <li>After rinsing it off I use a daily face moisturizer to avoid excess dryness (Eucerin Q10 Anti-Wrinkle sensitive skin crème).</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive, oily, and acne prone skin and have been suffering with moderate acne for years.</li>
            <li>If you have adult acne try this one last thing.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s important to be patient, stick with it, start slow, and work your way up to leaving it on for longer periods.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it has the consistency of thin Vaseline mixed with a very fine grained sand.</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t dry up existing pimples, I use a different cream for that.</li>
            <li>It has the same active ingredient as proactive, but a whole lot cheaper!</li>
            <li>This product appears to work well, but as the other reviewers said, it&#x27;s really sticky.  </li>
            <li>I have really oily skin, so you might have to adjust and use every other day according to your skin type.</li>
            <li>Does not dry my skin.  </li>
            <li>does not excessively over dry the skin 5.</li>
            <li>Not long after getting home I broke out again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff cleared y face up completely, haven&#x27;t had one break out in a long time!</li>
            <li>The sulfur ointment can be applied directly  to existing pimples to treat them and quickly dry them up.</li>
            <li>This little container should last a long time if used sparingly and if it&#x27;s too strong you might want to use every other day for a while.</li>
            <li>This stuff stinks, but it works, it really does, on very mild back acne that I bought it for, it got the job</li>
            <li>My colleagues and other family members have now noticed and complimented my new look.</li>

            <li> This ointment works great in conjunction with the Sulfur Acne Soap.</li>
            <li> : do a spot treatment with sulfur ointment (FYI ,sulfur ointment works GREAT for ingrown hairs in your bikini area)&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been working great for that as well.&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> Great for curing skin fungus.</li>
            <li> (my dermatologist recommended it, and it is a great cleanser) and apply the sulfur ointment for 10 mins.</li>

            <li> This stuff is very effective..</li>
            <li> Nice ointment use it twice a day!  </li>
            <li> Good product.  </li>
            <li> I bought this ointment once before, and loved it then.</li>
            <li> good to have in medicine cabinet...</li>
            <li> My skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good since I was a kid.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and ordered this product after reading some good reviews but it doesn&#x27;t work for</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my purchase of the sulfur ointment.  </li>
            <li> The Proactiv mask was one of my favorite products, and Mario Badescu&#x27;s healing lotion has been a great spot treatment for me (but a bit</li>
            <li> I am so glad I ordered De La Cruz Sulfur Ointment! 1.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> this product is amazing.</li>
            <li> i tried it out and omg its amazing.</li>
            <li> amazing you can even use it to exfoliate.&lt;br /&gt;what</li>
            <li> that, I use the Vitaville argan oil, which has amazing anti-aging and anti-inflammatory properties.</li>
            <li> does what it says ive used everything perscription an over the counter an this was as good or better than any</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything and am thrilled to have found this product.  </li>
            <li> thayer&#x27;s witch hazel rose</li>
            <li> It has a wonderful texture and does not add oil to my skin and has been very beneficial for pimples.</li>
            <li> I wonder if the company could look for another medium to deliver medication that works just as effective.</li>
            <li> do read the reviews, but I am judicious in forming my own opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found Bye Bye Blemish 10x more effective.</li>
            <li> Didnt use it, was too strong!</li>
            <li> I have tried many face creams for acne treatment and this is buy far one of the best products!</li>
            <li> It works great and doesn&#x27;t take very much to use.</li>
            <li> My skin peeled for the first week or two but has been great since.  </li>
            <li> More time.</li>
            <li> better results in my eyes.</li>
            <li> It seems that it has gotten even better.</li>
            <li> It works okay.</li>
            <li> Nothing works for acne but a healthy lifestyle</li>
            <li> you may want to order more than one.</li>
            <li> My experience has been, if it&#x27;s used daily it will work wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Works okay for what it is intended.</li>
            <li> So it made for more work.</li>
            <li> I have used the proactiv sulphur mask and I love using it on occasion.</li>
            <li> :)&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this product does something,</li>
            <li> love it too.</li>
            <li> I love it, but I don&#x27;t like the chiggers.</li>
            <li> They sure love me though.</li>
            <li> Most products, I&#x27;ve had to apply, reapply, reapply, reapply...</li>
            <li> Yes, the smell does linger a bit for more than 1 day.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it and what it does for my skin.</li>
            <li> - you might find it better to apply during day.</li>
            <li> Proactiv was helpful in some ways, but I realized it was mostly because it exfoliated my skin and cleaned my pores.</li>
            <li> I read more reviews about people leaving it on overnight</li>
            <li> so I thought I would give this a try, and I am sure glad I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li> i&#x27;d been suffering from severe acne since my teenages years, i had tried proactive, benzol peroxide &amp; many more products out there in the market, within a week</li>
            <li> and i will continue to order more of your product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s was so greasy, I was worried about having more blemishes just from using the product.</li>
            <li> This stuff works like magic for close to the surface acne and blackheads.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li> I have really oily skin and since using this product I don&#x27;t need any foundation/makeup which is great.  </li>
            <li> I have more infected acne</li>
            <li> and I did get better.  </li>
            <li> So after 3 weeks I began to breakout more, so I have stoppped using it.</li>
            <li> the product is very effective, however, it also costed so much.</li>
            <li> this product and its great because its natural!!</li>
            <li> : 25-34&lt;br /&gt;Climate: warm, humid, very hot weather&lt;</li>
            <li> When I first began to use this I spread a very light coating of it all over my face and neck area for 15-20 minutes at night and again in the morning, washing it off withjust warm water.</li>
            <li> I have had better luck with with the sulfur soap that I bought here on amazon, then using witch hazel as an astringent and then using Mario Badescu - Drying Lotion Glass - 1 oz available on amazon for spot treatment.</li>
            <li> wash face with olay pro-x brush + exfoliating creme (right now I&#x27;m using korres rose scrub)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I learned this very quickly.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s easy to apply, and it works.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have a strong sulfur smell, but I didn&#x27;t mind it if it was going to help me w/</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend trying.</li>
            <li> It also has a strong odor.</li>
            <li> At this point I am able to use it overnight at full strength on any existing pimples with no redness or irritation to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At about 2 days, my face was amazingly clearer and softer, but my face did start to peel, it turned into a sunburn-like texture on certain areas of my face.</li>
            <li> I suffer from CYSTIC ACNE and heard such great things about &amp;#34;sulfur&amp;#34;, that I also bought the Dr. Kaufmann Medicated Sulfur Soap to use for my face in the shower..</li>
            <li> A great price and actually works.</li>
            <li> , I just didn&#x27;t know I could get it so cheaply until amazon.</li>
            <li> The next morning my skin feels great.</li>
            <li> It was a smooth transaction, the product was well packaged.  </li>
            <li> It was so cheap</li>
            <li> and it is FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I will update if this helps clear my acne for good T.T fingers</li>
            <li> This works great for anyone with acne that has found that sulfur helps their acne (many other treatments dont work for her.)  </li>
            <li> Pretty miraculous!!</li>
            <li> I thought it was worth a shot!</li>
            <li> so worth the money!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> It adds no oiliness to your skin though, and washes completely clean with water.</li>
            <li> and I went online to amazon and review many products to do wound care on this dog and this stuff worked amazingly to keep the wound moist as I had to debris it 2 times daily for a month.</li>
            <li> it (along with the sulfur soap) works amazingly well to keep my adult acne to a minimum.</li>
            <li> Works great but be careful as it dries up Everything: nails,hair, and skin.</li>
            <li> But what the heck, rather glowing skin and a bit smell then full face of pimples, which I used to have</li>
            <li> /&gt;Knowing that sulfur was effective in treating adult acne, and hormonal acne, I searched Amazon for sulfur acne products that might just be that miracle that I was wishing existed for my skin...</li>
            <li> /&gt;- wash face gently with sulfur soap (I think my face likes to be very clean, but</li>
            <li> I had originally bought it to use on hormonal acne, but haven&#x27;t had success with it for that.</li>
            <li> It dries up the pimples quickly and leaves no scar.  </li>
            <li> quickly heals and exfoliates the skin 3.</li>
            <li> I have tried many, many different acne products, spent hundreds of dollars and this is by far the BEST product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Order dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> I travel to Iceland often, and whenever I am there, my skin quickly improves.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with how fast my face is clearing up, brightening, soft, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t use it much because of how strong it is on my face.</li>
            <li> The negative reviews often talked about teens or people who maybe didn&#x27;t follow the directions exactly as stated, or sulfur just wasn&#x27;t the best ingredient for their treatment.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great at drying up a pimple-one I didn&#x27;t mess with and get all inflamed.</li>
            <li> I believed the positive reviews seemed more detailed and the explanations were clearly thought out.</li>
            <li> It is worth a try for the price.</li>
            <li> so worth the money</li>
            <li> Totally worth it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> If you are someone that can overlook these, this product is worth it.</li>
            <li> Right after washing, I put this on for 10 mins and rinse away.</li>
            <li> It is powerful, I usually apply oil after showering with the soap, but it works great.</li>
            <li> I normally use Cetaphil and a cheap drug store product&lt;</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyhow, this revision seems to do the job just as good as the previous one, but without drying my skin out.</li>
            <li> tried so many products and many just dried out but</li>
            <li> Only drawback is the strong odor, but you get used to it quickly.  </li>
            <li> First I will give you some background about me and my acne case.  </li>
            <li> For the first 5-10 days I used it, my skin would feel warm/irritated/itchy before rinsing it off.</li>
            <li> Works very well!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I never write reviews, but this stuff really works!</li>
            <li> Additionally, the smell is a bit off putting at first, but once you wash off the ointment the smell doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li> But this thing really works!</li>
            <li> for real!</li>
            <li> Pretty viscous stuff.</li>
            <li> first started using this product as a mask 2 times a week, just as suggested by the label.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> When I first got this product I did not read the directions and used it as a spot treatment at night, not rinsing it off.</li>
            <li> My mother has the same issue, so I know that blemishes will be an issue for me in my future, so I figure I will try different products to see what works best.</li>
            <li> I first used the product as directed, washed my face at night with CeraVe</li>
            <li> At first I was taken aback.</li>
            <li> First time I tried this</li>
            <li> The first time I used it my face started to peel but that lasted for about 1 week max.  </li>
            <li> My skin is smooth, soft, no inflammation.  </li>
            <li> and I was only able to find it in the Walmart in Miami.  </li>
            <li> After the my first application it began to itch</li>
            <li> First the product was very oily.  </li>
            <li> Listen, people: For the first time since I was quite young, I can leave my house with no makeup at all, even when my hormones should be reeking havoc on my face, and my skin looks clear, my pores are clean and tiny, and my skin tone is pretty darn even considering the acne scarring I have on my chin area from picking at my skin when I was too young to know better (don&#x27;t do it, kids!).</li>
            <li> It can also be mixed with moisturizer easily (in an amount about 4:1 moisturizer to sulfur ointment), to use on the face or areas all day.  </li>
            <li> has helped my face clear up greatly, plus no more peeling skin.&lt;br /&gt;hope</li>
            <li> /&gt;Yes, this product smell, but hey, it has 10% sulfur in it, that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s effective for black heads and pimples.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s dog got bit by something and was loosing his fur in patches until he had a huge wound on his back.</li>
            <li> product is very gooey and sticky.  </li>
            <li> but not as fast as I heard.</li>
            <li> On the flip side though, it does really work to heal acne</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with my ski for years and this stuff has really been working.</li>
            <li> I already had this product, but hadn&#x27;t really started using it because you have to put it on, wait and rinse it off</li>
            <li> my skin is really clearing up.</li>
            <li> Very sticky and didn&#x27;t want to stay on skin.</li>
            <li> But, it really dries up my face.</li>
            <li> It is very oily and makes my face oily as well.</li>
            <li> I was worried about putting something so greasy/oily on my face, but it really works...</li>
            <li> When I put it on it is very sticky and never seems to \\&quot;absorb\\&quot; in.</li>
            <li> up with lots of sulfur on my pillows.... not so much on my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- wipe face gently with cotton ball</li>
            <li> works really well at clearing scars, like acne scars</li>
            <li> It is Oily, but it does the job if used twice a week it really helps control breakouts and reduce black/white heads.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really help.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I put on a very think layer and leave it in.</li>
            <li> It just made my face really itchy and did not do that much.  </li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using this, the areas aren&#x27;t really as oily.</li>
            <li> I have had acne my whole life.</li>
            <li> and when I use a sulfur mask and then put this on any acne it really helps.  </li>
            <li> I already use 2/3 of it, didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li> I like it, but it&#x27;s really greasy.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> It does not cure scabies, but it worked very well with the prescription I was on, Ivermectin.  </li>
            <li> Leave it on 10 minutes and wash off with warm water, or sometimes leave it on for a few hours.  </li>
            <li> This is the only product that has been able to clear up and keep pimples from my face.  </li>
            <li> since my skin is quite used to acid and retinols, I started experimenting using it every other night over my forehead, where I have most of my stuborn breakouts.</li>
            <li> The next morning, my skin was significantly clearer.</li>
            <li> &quot; Professional \\&quot; don&#x27;t even carry higher then  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it now!</li>
            <li> This seems to be doing a decent job.</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;ve experienced far worse in a face mask.</li>
            <li> Hormonal acne didn&#x27;t seem to have a quick fix, and I tried everything topical, as well as oral vitamins and probiotics.</li>
            <li> My acne is also &#x27;hormonal&#x27;, I suspect, and is mainly around my chin area.</li>
            <li> After using it twice daily for about 3 months, I began to only use it once daily in the morning for 15-30 minutes, with the same great effects.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> , I think it may be highly abrasive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I highly recommend it to anyone who is NOT allergic to the sulfur.</li>
            <li> Sure, it&#x27;s a little sulfur-y</li>
            <li> , I wouldn&#x27;t mind spending a little more for that amount.</li>
            <li> The odor isn&#x27;t too strong like other Sulfur products I&#x27;ve tried ...</li>
            <li> started getting acne again about 5 years ago and as an adult, this is really embarassing and I hatted it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Clears my breakouts and prevents new ones form coming in.</li>
            <li> it seriously sucks out all the puss and yuck from your pimple and reduces redness.&lt;br /&gt;also good for ance that is deep into the skin.</li>
            <li> Yes, sulfur does stink, but if you have big pores, oily skin and some acne, you&#x27;ll probably just want to overlook that tiny detail if you want smooth, glowing skin.</li>
            <li> a week I also use a fruit peel, which helps to get rid of dead skin, which is important so that all the products really can penetrate into the skin and not just sit on the surface.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am so glad I took a chance on an unknown product that just seemed way too affordable to actually work on my skin!</li>
            <li> The swelling and redness had improved, and within a week, my face was almost completely clear!</li>
            <li> Both the scented and non-scented have worked exactly the same.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure how they were able to do that.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s a given), the consistency (it is fairly sticky and doesn&#x27;t seem to dry), and that it can dry out your skin pretty bad if overused (which is also obvious, but I had such great results I wanted to keep using it).</li>
            <li> She is so soft to touch, and what man doesn&#x27;t want a soft woman to hold by his side?!</li>
            <li> It has help clear some of my pimples and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve known sulfur to clear up acne for years</li>
            <li> My face isn&#x27;t 100% clear yet, but I&#x27;m hoping it will get there.</li>
            <li> My face isn&#x27;t 100% clear yet, but I&#x27;m hoping it will get there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 days and my face is almost clear.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Everytime we go to Disney it would clear up.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if my face is ultra sensitive  but even with the lightest coat of this sulfur ointment on the affected area, my fact literally feels as though it is burning</li>
            <li> I do not recommend if you have sensitive or acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I have adult acne that I have been battling and was hoping this would help.</li>
            <li> With 10% it&#x27;s the highest I&#x27;ve seen with out having to buy professional &amp; even then some \\</li>
            <li> No side effects for me, just amazingly soft skin.</li>
            <li> I am 34 yrs old and suffer cystic acne along with blackhead n whitehead.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really sensitive using this,</li>
            <li> first tried using a Bye Bye Blemish type of ointment a long time ago.</li>
            <li> Iam 30 years old and for probably 15 years I&#x27;ve been trying to clear my acne.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like too much is that for an acne medication it is greasy which you would think would be something you don&#x27;t want on oily skin.  </li>
            <li> Hey, I didn&#x27;t mind getting some exfoliation going on my face, but it was very peely and very red!</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 weeks now</li>
            <li> I recommend that you use it at night before you go to bed, also when you wash it off of you, use an old raggedy wash cloth.</li>
            <li> So after you&#x27;re done, put on an old t-shirt.</li>
            <li> have very oily skin and various types of acne.</li>
            <li> I looked up treatmeny for rosacea and adult acne and found out about using sulpher based creams.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ve already tried everything else, why not give it a whirl, you&#x27;ll be surprised</li>
            <li> I am 51 years old and still suffer from acne flare-ups.  </li>
            <li> So I thought I would try this product, since it was natural.</li>
            <li> The previous reviews convinced me that this ointment was powerful but it was just heavy, gritty and strong odor!</li>
            <li> It will dry the skin and speed up the natural exfoliation where applied and might have a slight burning or warm sensation so use just a tiny amount and rub in well to spread.</li>
            <li> clears dark marks and scars 200% better than any of those high priced \\&quot;dark spot correctors\\&quot; 4.</li>
            <li> Be aware that over use of it can cause your skin to become very dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crazy cheap, easy to use</li>
            <li> do have to be careful of NOT over drying your skin, thus the proper moisterizing of your skin is super important.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> tub only contains 2.5 ounces, so if you&#x27;re planning on using it on large areas (back, bum, etc.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had, on my face/chest/back, and continue to have, moderate acne, mild nodular acne, aggressive acne due to prednisone use, and blackheads of all types.  </li>
            <li> We live in a rural, wooded area.</li>
            <li> in fact if you use it too much it will dry out your face.</li>
            <li> The label does recommend use up to 3 times a day, which would dry out my skin way too much, but for those with oily skin, that may be an option.</li>
            <li> This stuff is very greasy consistency, but believe be it works well to dry out pimples.  </li>
            <li> This sulfur based product is the first thing that has worked for me with my decade long problem with acne (and I&#x27;m only 21).</li>
            <li> That irritating feeling has gone away completely for me, and I&#x27;m able to leave it on without any irritation now.  </li>
            <li> Whatever is left over in the skin is doing its job to clear your acne</li>
            <li> After rinsing it off I use a daily face moisturizer to avoid excess dryness (Eucerin Q10 Anti-Wrinkle sensitive skin crème).</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive, oily, and acne prone skin and have been suffering with moderate acne for years.</li>
            <li> If you have adult acne try this one last thing.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s important to be patient, stick with it, start slow, and work your way up to leaving it on for longer periods.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it has the consistency of thin Vaseline mixed with a very fine grained sand.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t dry up existing pimples, I use a different cream for that.</li>
            <li> It has the same active ingredient as proactive, but a whole lot cheaper!</li>
            <li> This product appears to work well, but as the other reviewers said, it&#x27;s really sticky.  </li>
            <li> I have really oily skin, so you might have to adjust and use every other day according to your skin type.</li>
            <li> Does not dry my skin.  </li>
            <li> does not excessively over dry the skin 5.</li>
            <li> Not long after getting home I broke out again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff cleared y face up completely, haven&#x27;t had one break out in a long time!</li>
            <li> The sulfur ointment can be applied directly  to existing pimples to treat them and quickly dry them up.</li>
            <li> This little container should last a long time if used sparingly and if it&#x27;s too strong you might want to use every other day for a while.</li>
            <li> This stuff stinks, but it works, it really does, on very mild back acne that I bought it for, it got the job</li>
            <li> My colleagues and other family members have now noticed and complimented my new look.</li>
            <li> I have been using proactiv for a number of years with little to no results and in less than 6 months from using this product my face has cleared up tremendously.</li>
            <li> I also get a little mild tingling if I put it on my face but only lasts a few seconds.</li>
            <li> I have past acne blemishes &amp; in certain spots</li>
            <li> It also left a pungent smell that lingered for a long time and seemed to not go away after washing.</li>
            <li> I do get a few blemishes, however they are not deep and painful and come to the surface so easily and disappear quickly.</li>
            <li> I am 45 years old and could not go without foundation due to my acne, not now!</li>
            <li> It cannot be left on for long - you just want to wash it off!</li>
            <li> I have tried it all (and i mean really ALL!)</li>
            <li> This will last a very long time for me...</li>
            <li> Maybe the skin is just less sensitive there.</li>
            <li> Recently, I had bites on top of my feet that were just driving me crazy.</li>
            <li> In my experience, this product will dry existing pimples, bring underlying pimples to a head, stop pimple production, help exfoliate the skin, lighten dark marks and scars, and make the skin clear and evenly toned.  </li>
            <li> There was no further support within the package, so when it got to me the entire bottom had a single crack down the middle.</li>
            <li> I tried this weird, cheap stuff</li>
            <li> another problem is whiling spreading it around your body, there is a strange odor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to always keep this in stock and wish that I&#x27;d discovered it long ago.</li>
            <li> I only use it as a spot treatment every other day...</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t overly dry out my skin, just made the pimple go away.</li>
            <li> sometimes every day until I notice the spot getting dry.</li>
            <li> I do a spot treatment and let that dry up the pimples overnight.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry...</li>
            <li> After rinsing, I pat dry and use Dr. Brandt&#x27;s Acne</li>
            <li> and I did not see any difference in what it claims which is to dry up the acne.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but it never absorbs in or gets dry...  </li>
            <li> The only change has been the pomade de azufre- worth every penny, which it isn&#x27;t expensive either.</li>
            <li> My advice would be, start slow, test your boundaries, use daily, moisturize,  DO NOT get it near your eyes, and tell your friends and family.</li>
            <li> No new pimples.</li>
            <li> The coconut oil slowed things down a lot, even though it healed my face, so I might go back to just sulfur ointment and use coconut oil as a spot treatment.</li>
            <li> The coconut oil slowed things down a lot, even though it healed my face, so I might go back to just sulfur ointment and use coconut oil as a spot treatment.</li>
            <li> There is only a slight whiff of sulfur if it is around your nose.</li>
            <li> Within a week from using my black head/ white head reduced in quantity...</li>
            <li> It only leaked slightly, so I used it anyway.</li>
            <li> Everyone is different, and I know from experience that typical ingredients alone, like salicylic acid, don&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s super expensive.</li>
            <li> This is what she said- &amp;#34;This product works better than the expensive professional treatments that I have had done or any other product I have ever tired.</li>
            <li> They always catch me off-guard the first few times, before I figure out I better use spray repellent.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s stinky, greasy and a little bit gritty</li>
            <li> A few drops on my hands, rub, and dab on the entire face.</li>
            <li> Product works as expected.  </li>
            <li> (that product has sulfur in it, but not much).</li>
            <li> I have spent THOUSANDS of dollars on everything.  </li>
            <li> Guess I should have expected that from an ointment vs. cream product.  </li>
            <li> It was absolutely hormone-related, which I hoped would clear up completely when I was a &amp;#34;grown up.&amp;#34; I&#x27;m 35 now, and in the past two years I began getting the painful cystic type of acne along my jawline.</li>
            <li> I have seen fewer white and black heads and definitely less pimples.&lt;br /&gt;Beside</li>
            <li> I am like every other acne suffers that tried everything was either short term success or no success.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s unfortunately, because I don&#x27;t like using moisturizers (they&#x27;re full of toxic chemicals), and it&#x27;s tricky to use aloe vera-based products without getting dried scummy-looking marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only drawback is the ointment is messy and if you are a neat freak, you will need to try extra hard not to touch and spread to places</li>
            <li> Other than that...</li>
            <li> I have always had acne due to my oily skin.</li>
            <li> I researched in amazon and tried nature&#x27;s cure, some other creams with benzoil peroxide or salycic acid, none ever worked for me.</li>
            <li> I put a small amount on each bite - instant relief.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Sulfur is the active ingredient.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all in the active ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it everyday because it can over dry your skin even oily skin like mines.</li>
            <li> but I cut down on the usage to every other day and that helped.</li>
            <li> It even took my red scars away little by little and dried out my pimples.</li>
            <li> I have lots of dark spots on my cheeks and this helps alot.</li>
            <li> my face looks clearer, my acne has drastically reduced, and even my dark spots are lightening up.</li>
            <li> I am a 34 year-old female that has been struggling with acne since my late twenties.</li>
            <li> My skin has broken out off and on throughout my adult years.</li>
            <li> Had high hopes after reading other reviews but made my daughters acne worse!</li>
            <li> It is has an odd smell to it but that wouldn&#x27;t bother me if it worked for my face.</li>
            <li> High hopes but sadly did not work.</li>
            <li> so sometimes when i use this overnight it doesnt seem to help my acne might go down a little</li>
            <li> Gets rid of little pimples that pop up and hurt.  </li>
            <li> Just a little dab.</li>
            <li> I was a little leery of putting &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; on my combination skin, but don&#x27;t let the fact that it&#x27;s ointment deceive you.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products containing sulfur in the past</li>
            <li> it has help clear up my acne and some weird rash</li>
            <li> Powerful 10% ointment works well with Acne AND Folliculitis, which is a painful infection in the hair follicles and it is inexpensive too</li>
            <li> Before, it did wonders with clearing my skin: preventing pimples and bumps before they start, and helping the ones that I already have go away faster, but it also dried my skin out after each use.</li>
            <li> never even dried on my face.</li>
            <li> I will edit my review to comment on efficacy after it&#x27;s been a few weeks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is not available anywhere in stores in my area.</li>
            <li> It broke me out and dried my skin.</li>
            <li> I feel this product is just too heavy and doesn&#x27;t work well on my skin.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a lot because you only need a thin sheet to rub on the affected area(s)</li>
            <li> It did dried out my face a bit</li>
            <li> It completed dried out the itch.</li>
            <li> AFTER that I use this sulfur ointment and my skin does NOT get dried out.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> I have whitehead acne with a few of those under the skin bumps from time to time.</li>
            <li> but it comes back worse</li>
            <li> this also got rid of my black heads and whiteheads!</li>
            <li> I dab a small amount on the breakout every night and rinse off in the morning.</li>
            <li> Still some small blemishes here and there sometimes, but no clusters of cysts (no clusters at all), and blackheads are clearing.</li>
            <li> Not sure how to explain this product.</li>
            <li> I like having small pores and a glowing complexion, of course, but I was still getting the cystic acne monthly, and Proactiv is harsh and their auto shipping and billing is obnoxious!</li>
            <li> I have gone to a dermatologist in the past and was on antibiotics and</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as supposed to or as described, waste!</li>
            <li> No More toner, and finish off with Cetaphil moisturizer.</li>
            <li> wish I could get my money back after this failed trial and error.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has been scaling, itching, vety red, very broken out.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really not very strong.  </li>
            <li> Works well, of course the smell is not very pleasant.</li>
            <li> hard to tell what its doing</li>
            <li> But a little moisturizer and it&#x27;s a blessing!!</li>
            <li> The odor is NOWHERE NEAR as bad as I was expecting given that it&#x27;s 10% sulfur.  </li>
            <li> but I would like at least a 4oz per container</li>
            <li> I read the directions, (duh), and started using it for 10 minutes at a time, cleansing with Cetaphil after the 10 minutes were up.</li>
            <li> have been using this since late November, and I am just now getting close to needing to reorder.</li>
            <li> donall these places have in common?</li>
            <li> but seams to be doing the trick, just slowly and hopefully permanent.</li>
            <li> I can see them slowly fading.</li>
            <li> not much more you could ask for!</li>
            <li> Very harsh product!</li>
            <li> I just dab a very small amount on the area I need and by morning they will be dryed out...</li>
            <li> I have really bad oily skin, especially on my nose, forehead, &amp; chest.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this ointment is that it smells really bad.</li>
            <li> So... That will m ake your skin peel andturn red like crazy!</li>
            <li> I am in my late 20&#x27;s, and still tend to breakout like a teenager!</li>
            <li> no great relief from acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so your skin becomes addicted...</li>
            <li> Once I ran out, I do think my acne was worse.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall product performed poorly and not as indicated.</li>
            <li> Seriously!</li>
            <li> It does have a bit of an unpleasant smell, but at least you know it&#x27;s working.  </li>
            <li> Lately I have been extremely stressed anf have had horrible skin.</li>
            <li> i put it on my troubled areas at night and just sleep with it on.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical cause of the price</li>
            <li> I have battled bad acne, including cystic acne, for years with a horrible flare up the past few years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent thousands of dollars over the years with (besides Accutane which had horrible side effects)</li>
            <li> I was really desperate when i ordered this one and didn&#x27;t think it would work either</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also inconvenient to have to wash this stuff off after 10 mins instead of leaving it on your skin.</li>
            <li> but when you apply it to your face it smells like rotten chicken and drys out your skin.</li>
            <li> But before you know it, you&#x27;re itching like crazy.</li>
            <li> You never feel them biting, and they&#x27;re impossible to see.</li>
            <li> but smells bad.....</li>
            <li> Results can take a while to apply to an inflammation (eg pimple) but the smell isn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have bad acne, but I do workout  and run a lot</li>
            <li> and it is painful to touch.</li>
            <li> About 14 months ago, after a health issue, I had to use a prednisone steroid which worsened my acne condition and caused me to seek out something that I&#x27;ve never tried because I was really desperate for help!  </li>
            <li> and it drove me crazy!</li>
            <li> The smell is horrible.</li>
            <li> And, when I tried to stop using it, my skin broke out horribly!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s AWFUL!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this product is amazing. I have lots of dark spots on my cheeks and this helps alot. They are lightening by the day. I like applying it before I get in the shower and leave it on for about a hour. More time. better results in my eyes. I bought the soap today so hopefully it works together. You can find it in CVS for like 5 bucks. totally recommend</li>
            <li> does what it says ive used everything perscription an over the counter an this was as good or better than any</li>
            <li> Good product.  Helpful when nothing else was.  Easy to use and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this ointment once before, and loved it then. It seems that it has gotten even better. Before, it did wonders with clearing my skin: preventing pimples and bumps before they start, and helping the ones that I already have go away faster, but it also dried my skin out after each use. That&#x27;s unfortunately, because I don&#x27;t like using moisturizers (they&#x27;re full of toxic chemicals), and it&#x27;s tricky to use aloe vera-based products without getting dried scummy-looking marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, this revision seems to do the job just as good as the previous one, but without drying my skin out. I&#x27;ve used it several days in a row several times without noticing any dryness.</li>
            <li> It works okay. It isn&#x27;t much different than salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide. The smell wasn&#x27;t all that noticeable. It is worth a try for the price.</li>
            <li> I suffer from CYSTIC ACNE and heard such great things about &amp;#34;sulfur&amp;#34;, that I also bought the Dr. Kaufmann Medicated Sulfur Soap to use for my face in the shower.. I was so disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;It does have a strong sulfur smell, but I didn&#x27;t mind it if it was going to help me w/my cystic acne.&lt;br /&gt;This sulfur ointment did NOTHING for me. I&#x27;d leave it on overnight, and in the morning it&#x27;d still be &amp;#34;jelly&amp;#34; looking, like it never even dried on my face. I never saw a difference.&lt;br /&gt;still trying to find something that will help me w/my cystic acne.</li>
            <li> good to have in medicine cabinet...</li>
            <li> Dried my face extremely fast. Does nothing for my acne. Nothing works for acne but a healthy lifestyle</li>
            <li> Great product. Does cause some skin peeling after 2-3 days consecutive use. I also get a little mild tingling if I put it on my face but only lasts a few seconds. Does not burn or irritate my skin. Have been using it for a month and my skin is a lot clearer!</li>
            <li> i believe i was allergic too it when i put it on it immediately starting itching.</li>
            <li> I use this ointment when I have occasionally breakouts.  It dries up the pimples quickly and leaves no scar.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> This works great for anyone with acne that has found that sulfur helps their acne (many other treatments dont work for her.)  Also a very good price for what you get.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. The previous reviews convinced me that this ointment was powerful but it was just heavy, gritty and strong odor! I don&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li> I will edit my review to comment on efficacy after it&#x27;s been a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is very gooey and sticky.  It&#x27;s a bit like putting honey on your face.  Since you only leave it on for ten minutes, though, it&#x27;s not a big deal.  I wouldn&#x27;t want to wear it around all day.  The odor is NOWHERE NEAR as bad as I was expecting given that it&#x27;s 10% sulfur.  Sure, it&#x27;s a little sulfur-y but it&#x27;s really not very strong.  There&#x27;s no perfume or fragrance added.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tub only contains 2.5 ounces, so if you&#x27;re planning on using it on large areas (back, bum, etc.) you may want to order more than one.</li>
            <li> it works. but not as fast as I heard. but seams to be doing the trick, just slowly and hopefully permanent. but smells bad.....but i like it.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my purchase of the sulfur ointment.  It has help clear some of my pimples and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if my face is ultra sensitive  but even with the lightest coat of this sulfur ointment on the affected area, my fact literally feels as though it is burning and it is painful to touch. That is with only doing this about 1x/wk and washing it off after 10 minutes. On the flip side though, it does really work to heal acne but I can&#x27;t use it much because of how strong it is on my face. It seems to work well on my shoulders though if i have acne and it doesn&#x27;t burn. Maybe the skin is just less sensitive there.</li>
            <li> I have used this for several months, here and there. Though sticky when applied, very good for acne. Great results after a month. I use it overnight as well even though the instructions is for some minutes. will recomend to acne prone skins.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great at drying up a pimple-one I didn&#x27;t mess with and get all inflamed. I dab a small amount on the breakout every night and rinse off in the morning. By night three it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> Gets rid of little pimples that pop up and hurt.  No smell.  It didn&#x27;t overly dry out my skin, just made the pimple go away.</li>
            <li> I have tried many face creams for acne treatment and this is buy far one of the best products! Great price too</li>
            <li> First I will give you some background about me and my acne case.  I&#x27;ve been dealing with acne of varying degrees for almost 30 years now. I&#x27;ve had, on my face/chest/back, and continue to have, moderate acne, mild nodular acne, aggressive acne due to prednisone use, and blackheads of all types.  I&#x27;ve tried tons of products, both over the counter and prescription including Accutane, minocin, benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, Retin-A Micro, Differin, and plenty of others. I&#x27;ve spent thousands of dollars over the years with (besides Accutane which had horrible side effects) no great relief from acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  About 14 months ago, after a health issue, I had to use a prednisone steroid which worsened my acne condition and caused me to seek out something that I&#x27;ve never tried because I was really desperate for help!  I came across DeLa Cruz Sulfur Ointment on Amazon and started reading the rave reviews and comments.  I figured, what could I lose at this price?  Well I have to say this is the VERY BEST acne product that I have EVER used in 30 years!  Of course nothing will block ALL acne pimples or blackheads and I have one or two show up on occasion, but with daily use, this product: 1. clears my acne problem 2. quickly heals and exfoliates the skin 3. clears dark marks and scars 200% better than any of those high priced \\&quot;dark spot correctors\\&quot; 4. does not excessively over dry the skin 5. does not stain bedding or clothing. Pretty miraculous!! Also, this product is NOT sticky at all. I&#x27;d say it has the consistency of thin Vaseline mixed with a very fine grained sand. It adds no oiliness to your skin though, and washes completely clean with water. Whatever is left over in the skin is doing its job to clear your acne problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  My regimen: I have been using this product for around 14 months. When I first began to use this I spread a very light coating of it all over my face and neck area for 15-20 minutes at night and again in the morning, washing it off withjust warm water. For the first 5-10 days I used it, my skin would feel warm/irritated/itchy before rinsing it off. Your skin will build a tolerance for the product over time so it&#x27;s important to be patient, stick with it, start slow, and work your way up to leaving it on for longer periods.  That irritating feeling has gone away completely for me, and I&#x27;m able to leave it on without any irritation now.  After using it twice daily for about 3 months, I began to only use it once daily in the morning for 15-30 minutes, with the same great effects. After rinsing it off I use a daily face moisturizer to avoid excess dryness (Eucerin Q10 Anti-Wrinkle sensitive skin crème). The sulfur ointment can be applied directly  to existing pimples to treat them and quickly dry them up. It can also be mixed with moisturizer easily (in an amount about 4:1 moisturizer to sulfur ointment), to use on the face or areas all day.  My experience has been, if it&#x27;s used daily it will work wonderfully. At this point I am able to use it overnight at full strength on any existing pimples with no redness or irritation to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  In my experience, this product will dry existing pimples, bring underlying pimples to a head, stop pimple production, help exfoliate the skin, lighten dark marks and scars, and make the skin clear and evenly toned.  I have noticed this comes in a scented variation also.  Both the scented and non-scented have worked exactly the same.  The scent has not bothered my skin at all.  My advice would be, start slow, test your boundaries, use daily, moisturize,  DO NOT get it near your eyes, and tell your friends and family. This product is not available anywhere in stores in my area. No one I know has ever heard of this product.  In my opinion it should be on shelves in every store selling skin care products (in the actual acne section and not in the \\&quot;ethnic\\&quot; section which makes no sense at all).</li>
            <li> Sulfur is the active ingredient. It goes from yellow to invisible when you apply it. There is only a slight whiff of sulfur if it is around your nose. The sulfur smell gets stronger when you shower it off. The product helps prevent the chemicals from forming to create acne breakout. It really doesn&#x27;t dry up existing pimples, I use a different cream for that. I use this as a change of pace from my prescription roseca meds. Works okay for what it is intended. No miracle cure.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!!  It cleared up my acne within 8 days.  This is great to use in conjunction with the Sulfur soap.  The only thing your face gets used to it, so you have to switch regimens.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with my ski for years and this stuff has really been working. i put it on my troubled areas at night and just sleep with it on.</li>
            <li> Very harsh product! The smell is horrible. It broke me out and dried my skin. I am returning it. I do not recommend if you have sensitive or acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great when it comes to drying up acne and ridding the pores of dirt and oil. Be aware that over use of it can cause your skin to become very dry. I learned this very quickly. I use it three times a week before bed and my skin loves it!</li>
            <li> This stuff definitely works. I have battled bad acne, including cystic acne, for years with a horrible flare up the past few years. I did recently go to the dermatologist...she put me on an antibiotic, gave me sulfo-lo soap (you can get that on Amazon), and a topical retinol cream. I already had this product, but hadn&#x27;t really started using it because you have to put it on, wait and rinse it off so I hadn&#x27;t incorporated it into my routine at that time. After finishing the antibiotics, using the sulfo-lo soap day and night, this product during the day, and putting the retinol on at night...my skin is really clearing up. Still some small blemishes here and there sometimes, but no clusters of cysts (no clusters at all), and blackheads are clearing. This stuff does stink...and the stink lasts all day. I don&#x27;t think others can smell it, but I get whiffs of it throughout the day. If I will be in a situation where I will be close to people, I likely skip the application that day. Other than that...it works and I will deal with the stink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just FYI, I tried almost everything else. Proactiv, yes, and the ingredients are horrendous. I did use it for over a year and it did work, but I am a naturalist and the ingredients just didn&#x27;t jive with my personal convictions. Plus, it&#x27;s super expensive. And, when I tried to stop using it, my skin broke out horribly! I think they put crack in it or something so your skin becomes addicted...I noticed that it seemed to age me too...that&#x27;s likely because of the ingredients! But, I&#x27;m not reviewing that...just letting you know I DID try just about everything.</li>
            <li> bought this cause a friend told me her dad used it in mexico for when he had acne .&lt;br /&gt;so i tried it out and omg its amazing. it seriously sucks out all the puss and yuck from your pimple and reduces redness.&lt;br /&gt;also good for ance that is deep into the skin. the trick to thhis is keep applying it onto the pimple until everything comes out!&lt;br /&gt;love this product and its great because its natural!! this also got rid of my black heads and whiteheads! amazing you can even use it to exfoliate.&lt;br /&gt;what this product does is shed a layer of your skin so its great for exfoliating and reducing redness.! loooooove it!</li>
            <li> High hopes but sadly did not work. Very sticky and didn&#x27;t want to stay on skin. I also thought it was a spot treatment but you had to wash it off after  already washing your face.  So it made for more work.</li>
            <li> This product appears to work well, but as the other reviewers said, it&#x27;s really sticky.  It cannot be left on for long - you just want to wash it off!</li>
            <li> I have tried many, many different acne products, spent hundreds of dollars and this is by far the BEST product I have ever used. I would highly recommend it. I am 45 years old and could not go without foundation due to my acne, not now! It&#x27;s crazy cheap, easy to use and it works, not much more you could ask for!</li>
            <li> Works very well! I was skeptical cause of the price but it works great! Don&#x27;t wear jewlery with it on. Any time I feel like im going to break out I put this on!</li>
            <li> I have used the proactiv sulphur mask and I love using it on occasion. But, it really dries up my face. So, I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. it didn&#x27;t work well on my skin. It is very oily and makes my face oily as well. It is has an odd smell to it but that wouldn&#x27;t bother me if it worked for my face.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that has worked for my acne! It has the same active ingredient as proactive, but a whole lot cheaper! It is best used as a spot treatment because it is kind of greasy. I was worried about putting something so greasy/oily on my face, but it really works... in fact if you use it too much it will dry out your face. I only use it as a spot treatment every other day... sometimes every day until I notice the spot getting dry. If I have a cluster of pimples I will use it all over the cluster and it works great.</li>
            <li> Nice ointment use it twice a day!  It seems to be making the marks disappear, or getting smaller to the point, where I can coneal them without it looking flakey!</li>
            <li> Works well at keeping blemished in check.  Leave it on 10 minutes and wash off with warm water, or sometimes leave it on for a few hours.  Does not dry my skin.  Only drawback is the strong odor, but you get used to it quickly.  Order dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit smelly, and you have to wear it for about 10 minutes before you rinse it off.  If you do that twice a day, it actually does improve acne.  And I don&#x27;t remember it being drying either.  Once I ran out, I do think my acne was worse.  But I switched to a different product.</li>
            <li> This along with a sulfur based soap took care of the rash and eruptions,when the ointment prescribed by dermatologist did not!</li>
            <li> I have always had acne due to my oily skin. I ve tried everything like proactive..obagi creams and even went to the dermatologist only to use prescription medications. Until one day a regular customer at my coffee stand suggested this product to me and ive been using it for 2 months now..I started seeing results in 2 weeks. It even took my red scars away little by little and dried out my pimples. Its honestly the best acne medication ive ever used. A great price and actually works.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s dog got bit by something and was loosing his fur in patches until he had a huge wound on his back. The vet we took him was no help. So, I am a nurse and I went online to amazon and review many products to do wound care on this dog and this stuff worked amazingly to keep the wound moist as I had to debris it 2 times daily for a month. I recommend this product faithfully.</li>
            <li> Not sure how to explain this product. I bought it because of all of the great reviews. The directions say to put it on for only 10 minutes however a lot of the reviews say that people have left it on over night. I am not sure how they were able to do that. When I put it on it is very sticky and never seems to \\&quot;absorb\\&quot; in. I have adult acne that I have been battling and was hoping this would help. I have had better luck with with the sulfur soap that I bought here on amazon, then using witch hazel as an astringent and then using Mario Badescu - Drying Lotion Glass - 1 oz available on amazon for spot treatment. This seems to be doing a decent job. I feel this product is just too heavy and doesn&#x27;t work well on my skin.</li>
            <li> As an Esthetician for the last 13 yrs , I&#x27;ve been using this product for Clients that have acne , along for personal use . With 10% it&#x27;s the highest I&#x27;ve seen with out having to buy professional &amp; even then some \\&quot; Professional \\&quot; don&#x27;t even carry higher then  6% it&#x27;s Wonderful .. Sulfur stops the oil production and This Stuff rocks. The odor isn&#x27;t too strong like other Sulfur products I&#x27;ve tried ... :)&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck to All&lt;br /&gt;Happy Skin Brings Happy Life&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Arrived expediently and works great. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I never write reviews, but this stuff really works! I have extremely sensitive, oily, and acne prone skin and have been suffering with moderate acne for years. I leave the ointment all over my face for 10 minuntes then rinse, and if I&#x27;m having severe breakouts I do a spot treatment and let that dry up the pimples overnight. Additionally, the smell is a bit off putting at first, but once you wash off the ointment the smell doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li> This ointment works great in conjunction with the Sulfur Acne Soap. Right after washing, I put this on for 10 mins and rinse away. I would give it a 5 star if there was a larger longer lasting quantity. You don&#x27;t need a lot because you only need a thin sheet to rub on the affected area(s) but I would like at least a 4oz per container, I wouldn&#x27;t mind spending a little more for that amount.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s stinky, greasy and a little bit gritty but i&#x27;ve experienced far worse in a face mask. it (along with the sulfur soap) works amazingly well to keep my adult acne to a minimum.</li>
            <li> I bought this after I ran out of the proactive sulfur face mask, looking for a replacement. I&#x27;m sure this product does something, just not what I want it to do.&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for something to leave on my face over night. I don&#x27;t reccomend you try it with this stuff. It doesn&#x27;t dry... at all.&lt;br /&gt;Woke up with lots of sulfur on my pillows.... not so much on my face.</li>
            <li> I am only 25 and have suffered with acne since i was probably 14. I have tried it all (and i mean really ALL!) my dermatologist recommended accutane as a last resort, i refused to take pills for acne. I researched in amazon and tried nature&#x27;s cure, some other creams with benzoil peroxide or salycic acid, none ever worked for me. I was really desperate when i ordered this one and didn&#x27;t think it would work either but BOY!!!!! IT DOES!!!! my face looks clearer, my acne has drastically reduced, and even my dark spots are lightening up. The only thing i would suggest is to try not to use it every day AFTER you start seeing results because it peels your skin off every time and it burns! I felt like i was having &amp;#34;mini-peels&amp;#34; each time i used it 3 days in a row. But this thing really works! for real! I am happy!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend. This is what she said- &amp;#34;This product works better than the expensive professional treatments that I have had done or any other product I have ever tired. No side effects for me, just amazingly soft skin. Amazing.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I love it too. She is so soft to touch, and what man doesn&#x27;t want a soft woman to hold by his side?!</li>
            <li> it has help clear up my acne and some weird rash I had on my lower leg this product rock so worth the money</li>
            <li> I am 34 yrs old and suffer cystic acne along with blackhead n whitehead. I am like every other acne suffers that tried everything was either short term success or no success. This product works without a doubt. It did dried out my face a bit but I cut down on the usage to every other day and that helped. Within a week from using my black head/ white head reduced in quantity... my face exfoliated a lot which I didn&#x27;t like but I used vita e constantly to moisturize. It does works... I strongly recommend trying.</li>
            <li> Works well, of course the smell is not very pleasant.</li>
            <li> 1. I&#x27;ve known sulfur to clear up acne for years, I just didn&#x27;t know I could get it so cheaply until amazon. You don&#x27;t need a $30 drying lotion. This stuff does the trick. It&#x27;s all in the active ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Yes, sulfur does stink, but if you have big pores, oily skin and some acne, you&#x27;ll probably just want to overlook that tiny detail if you want smooth, glowing skin.</li>
            <li> This ointment smells like a jar of farts! Seriously! It&#x27;s AWFUL! They don&#x27;t camouflage the sulfur smell AT ALL in this product. It&#x27;s also inconvenient to have to wash this stuff off after 10 mins instead of leaving it on your skin. Just didn&#x27;t like it at all!</li>
            <li> This product has 10% sulfur (great), but is in a greasy Vaseline type base. Not what you want to be putting on our face if your fighting acne and oily face. It may work somewhat, but I can&#x27;t handle the greasy feeling on my skin. I&#x27;m trying to take the oily shine off my face, not add to it. I&#x27;ve found Bye Bye Blemish 10x more effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything and am thrilled to have found this product.  I will order it again!  This cream is wonderful!</li>
            <li> update 10/5/2014&lt;br /&gt;This is my skin regimen now:&lt;br /&gt;daily:&lt;br /&gt;- take off makeup with boscia makeup breakup oil, it washes off with water&lt;br /&gt;- wash face with philosophy purity cleansing soap&lt;br /&gt;- wash face gently with sulfur soap (I think my face likes to be very clean, but gently)&lt;br /&gt;-&gt;&gt;weekly: wash face with olay pro-x brush + exfoliating creme (right now I&#x27;m using korres rose scrub)&lt;br /&gt;-&gt;&gt;weekly:  aztec indian clay mask, 1 tbsp clay + 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar is enough for me&lt;br /&gt;- wipe face gently with cotton ball and well soaked thayer&#x27;s witch hazel rose toner&lt;br /&gt;- put on moisturizer: Dior hydra life creme sorbet&lt;br /&gt;-&gt;&gt;nightly: do a spot treatment with sulfur ointment (FYI ,sulfur ointment works GREAT for ingrown hairs in your bikini area)&lt;br /&gt;This has helped my face clear up greatly, plus no more peeling skin.&lt;br /&gt;hope this helps. I&#x27;m very satisfied with how fast my face is clearing up, brightening, soft, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I also use it for my bikini line to reduce in-grown hairs and it&#x27;s been working great for that as well.&lt;br /&gt;Note, my face has been burning recently b/c it&#x27;s really sensitive using this, so now I&#x27;ve been doing the, leave on for 20min and rinse off. I will update if this helps clear my acne for good T.T fingers crossed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works really well at clearing scars, like acne scars, I think it may be highly abrasive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first tried using a Bye Bye Blemish type of ointment a long time ago. I was always amazed how well sulfur worked for my acne, but that was only a spot treatment. I bought the sulfur soap w/ lanolin as well. My regimen was like this:&lt;br /&gt;1. I bought an olay pro-x cleaning brush, so I used the sulfur soap and the cleaning brush on my face and let it sit for 10min. Then I rinse off and put the ointment on my face and sleep with it all night. At about 2 days, my face was amazingly clearer and softer, but my face did start to peel, it turned into a sunburn-like texture on certain areas of my face. So I started doing a coconut oil + sulfur ointment treatment at night and that helped a lot. My face isn&#x27;t 100% clear yet, but I&#x27;m hoping it will get there. The coconut oil slowed things down a lot, even though it healed my face, so I might go back to just sulfur ointment and use coconut oil as a spot treatment. I also use the aztec clay mask, and I like it a lot.nd that helped a lot. My face isn&#x27;t 100% clear yet, but I&#x27;m hoping it will get there.

            <li> Had high hopes after reading other reviews but made my daughters acne worse!</li>
            <li> This shipped from within the US, in a basic media envelop (6x4 with inner lining bubble wrap). There was no further support within the package, so when it got to me the entire bottom had a single crack down the middle. It only leaked slightly, so I used it anyway. Results can take a while to apply to an inflammation (eg pimple) but the smell isn&#x27;t bad, it&#x27;s easy to apply, and it works.Pretty viscous stuff.</li>
            <li> the product is very effective, however, it also costed so much. another problem is whiling spreading it around your body, there is a strange odor.</li>
            <li> It is Oily, but it does the job if used twice a week it really helps control breakouts and reduce black/white heads.</li>
            <li> Iam 30 years old and for probably 15 years I&#x27;ve been trying to clear my acne. Believe me when I say I&#x27;ve tried everything. This product is a miracle in a bottle. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 days and my face is almost clear. The only issues is in the bottle there is no noticeable smell but when you apply it to your face it smells like rotten chicken and drys out your skin. But a little moisturizer and it&#x27;s a blessing!! Totally worth it</li>
            <li> The best acne medication. Clears my breakouts and prevents new ones form coming in. I don&#x27;t use it everyday because it can over dry your skin even oily skin like mines. But it does work great!!!</li>
            <li> Chiggers. They are not your friend. We live in a rural, wooded area. I love it, but I don&#x27;t like the chiggers. They sure love me though. They start coming out in May and last through the summer. They always catch me off-guard the first few times, before I figure out I better use spray repellent. You never feel them biting, and they&#x27;re impossible to see. But before you know it, you&#x27;re itching like crazy. I&#x27;ve tried everything for itch relief. Most products, I&#x27;ve had to apply, reapply, reapply, reapply... And these chigger bites are everywhere! Recently, I had bites on top of my feet that were just driving me crazy. I had this stuff out on my counter. I put a small amount on each bite - instant relief. I went to sleep that night. The next morning, no itch whatsoever! And the bites were fading away. It completed dried out the itch. In ONE application! I&#x27;m about to purchase another one, so wanted to write a review. I had originally bought it to use on hormonal acne, but haven&#x27;t had success with it for that. But thank goodness I&#x27;ve discovered this for chigger bites. It&#x27;s worth the price. Just a little dab.</li>
            <li> Didnt use it, was too strong!</li>
            <li> This product did wonder for my acne.&lt;br /&gt;I started getting acne again about 5 years ago and as an adult, this is really embarassing and I hatted it.&lt;br /&gt;I tried so many products and many just dried out but didn&#x27;t really help.&lt;br /&gt;I first started using this product as a mask 2 times a week, just as suggested by the label.&lt;br /&gt;But since my skin is quite used to acid and retinols, I started experimenting using it every other night over my forehead, where I have most of my stuborn breakouts. I put on a very think layer and leave it in. The next morning my skin feels great. I have seen fewer white and black heads and definitely less pimples.&lt;br /&gt;Beside this product, I also use the Peter Thomas Roth acne gel.&lt;br /&gt;You do have to be careful of NOT over drying your skin, thus the proper moisterizing of your skin is super important.&lt;br /&gt;For that, I use the Vitaville argan oil, which has amazing anti-aging and anti-inflammatory properties. A few drops on my hands, rub, and dab on the entire face. AFTER that I use this sulfur ointment and my skin does NOT get dried out.&lt;br /&gt;Once a week I also use a fruit peel, which helps to get rid of dead skin, which is important so that all the products really can penetrate into the skin and not just sit on the surface.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, this product smell, but hey, it has 10% sulfur in it, that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s effective for black heads and pimples. For that reason I only this this product at night time. Yes, the smell does linger a bit for more than 1 day. But what the heck, rather glowing skin and a bit smell then full face of pimples, which I used to have and it drove me crazy!</li>
            <li> I have whitehead acne with a few of those under the skin bumps from time to time. This sulfur based product is the first thing that has worked for me with my decade long problem with acne (and I&#x27;m only 21).</li>
            <li> hard to tell what its doing</li>
            <li> I was a little leery of putting &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; on my combination skin, but don&#x27;t let the fact that it&#x27;s ointment deceive you. It has a wonderful texture and does not add oil to my skin and has been very beneficial for pimples. I absolutely love it and what it does for my skin. I&#x27;m going to always keep this in stock and wish that I&#x27;d discovered it long ago. I can&#x27;t live without it now!</li>
            <li> It just made my face really itchy and did not do that much.  It also left a pungent smell that lingered for a long time and seemed to not go away after washing.</li>
            <li> Product works as expected.  It was a smooth transaction, the product was well packaged.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like too much is that for an acne medication it is greasy which you would think would be something you don&#x27;t want on oily skin.  I wonder if the company could look for another medium to deliver medication that works just as effective.</li>
            <li> Boyfriend has discoloration/pigmentation on his face, and heard sulfur works to rid of it...seems to work great! It beats him using Selsun Blue shampoo on his face?! (that product has sulfur in it, but not much).</li>
            <li> Great for curing skin fungus.</li>
            <li> Powerful 10% ointment works well with Acne AND Folliculitis, which is a painful infection in the hair follicles and it is inexpensive too so I highly recommend it to anyone who is NOT allergic to the sulfur. It will dry the skin and speed up the natural exfoliation where applied and might have a slight burning or warm sensation so use just a tiny amount and rub in well to spread. This little container should last a long time if used sparingly and if it&#x27;s too strong you might want to use every other day for a while. The only drawback is the ointment is messy and if you are a neat freak, you will need to try extra hard not to touch and spread to places you don&#x27;t want it. I use a bandage to cover places where contact might occur. Healing begins almost overnight and I feel the best time to apply is at bedtime - you might find it better to apply during day.</li>
            <li> My skin has broken out off and on throughout my adult years. It was absolutely hormone-related, which I hoped would clear up completely when I was a &amp;#34;grown up.&amp;#34; I&#x27;m 35 now, and in the past two years I began getting the painful cystic type of acne along my jawline. Hormonal acne didn&#x27;t seem to have a quick fix, and I tried everything topical, as well as oral vitamins and probiotics. Proactiv was helpful in some ways, but I realized it was mostly because it exfoliated my skin and cleaned my pores. I like having small pores and a glowing complexion, of course, but I was still getting the cystic acne monthly, and Proactiv is harsh and their auto shipping and billing is obnoxious! I have always known sulfur-based acne products have worked on my skin. The Proactiv mask was one of my favorite products, and Mario Badescu&#x27;s healing lotion has been a great spot treatment for me (but a bit harsh).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knowing that sulfur was effective in treating adult acne, and hormonal acne, I searched Amazon for sulfur acne products that might just be that miracle that I was wishing existed for my skin... I am so glad I ordered De La Cruz Sulfur Ointment! 1. It was so cheap I thought it was worth a shot! 2. After the extensive research I have conducted, the ingredients seemed to make sense for acne treatment. 3. Um... It was under eight dollars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do read the reviews, but I am judicious in forming my own opinion. I believed the positive reviews seemed more detailed and the explanations were clearly thought out. The negative reviews often talked about teens or people who maybe didn&#x27;t follow the directions exactly as stated, or sulfur just wasn&#x27;t the best ingredient for their treatment. Everyone is different, and I know from experience that typical ingredients alone, like salicylic acid, don&#x27;t work for me. When I first got this product I did not read the directions and used it as a spot treatment at night, not rinsing it off. So... That will m ake your skin peel andturn red like crazy! Hey, I didn&#x27;t mind getting some exfoliation going on my face, but it was very peely and very red! I read the directions, (duh), and started using it for 10 minutes at a time, cleansing with Cetaphil after the 10 minutes were up. I sometimes use it twice a day now. Listen, people: For the first time since I was quite young, I can leave my house with no makeup at all, even when my hormones should be reeking havoc on my face, and my skin looks clear, my pores are clean and tiny, and my skin tone is pretty darn even considering the acne scarring I have on my chin area from picking at my skin when I was too young to know better (don&#x27;t do it, kids!). I don&#x27;t need concealer, I can use a tinted moisturizer if I want to even out my complexion, and not foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this since late November, and I am just now getting close to needing to reorder. I do get a few blemishes, however they are not deep and painful and come to the surface so easily and disappear quickly. I say you should give this a shot, since you really only have about eight bucks to lose! I am so glad I took a chance on an unknown product that just seemed way too affordable to actually work on my skin!</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 weeks now and I already see a difference in my skin. I have really bad oily skin, especially on my nose, forehead, &amp; chest. Since I&#x27;ve been using this, the areas aren&#x27;t really as oily. I have past acne blemishes &amp; in certain spots I can see them slowly fading. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this ointment is that it smells really bad. I recommend that you use it at night before you go to bed, also when you wash it off of you, use an old raggedy wash cloth. Even after washing my wash cloth and shirts, I can still smell it. So after you&#x27;re done, put on an old t-shirt.</li>
            <li> As someone who has struggled with acne for years, I have tried a myriad of products out there. I am in my late 20&#x27;s, and still tend to breakout like a teenager! My mother has the same issue, so I know that blemishes will be an issue for me in my future, so I figure I will try different products to see what works best. I have gone to a dermatologist in the past and was on antibiotics and Retin-A and benzoperoxide treatments which did work, but I wanted to see if any over the counter products would work as well, as the Rx medications can get pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very oily skin and various types of acne. My acne is also &#x27;hormonal&#x27;, I suspect, and is mainly around my chin area. I first used the product as directed, washed my face at night with CeraVe (my dermatologist recommended it, and it is a great cleanser) and apply the sulfur ointment for 10 mins. I read more reviews about people leaving it on overnight so I tried that. The next morning, my skin was significantly clearer. The swelling and redness had improved, and within a week, my face was almost completely clear! I have tried other products containing sulfur in the past, that were much more expensive so I thought I would give this a try, and I am sure glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downsides for me are the smell (but it&#x27;s sulfutr so that&#x27;s a given), the consistency (it is fairly sticky and doesn&#x27;t seem to dry), and that it can dry out your skin pretty bad if overused (which is also obvious, but I had such great results I wanted to keep using it). If you are someone that can overlook these, this product is worth it. If you are going to wear it overnight, I recommend a washcloth or something on your pillow, and only applying 2-3 times per week, because of the drying effects.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as supposed to or as described, waste!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;d been suffering from severe acne since my teenages years, i had tried proactive, benzol peroxide &amp; many more products out there in the market, within a week or so i had notice those big bumps not braking out as often. Im really happy and i will continue to order more of your product</li>
            <li> This stuff stinks, but it works, it really does, on very mild back acne that I bought it for, it got the job done,&lt;br /&gt;nothing else needed</li>
            <li> This stuff cleared y face up completely, haven&#x27;t had one break out in a long time! And if a pimples coming up all I have to do is put this stuff on it an its gone the next day.</li>
            <li> I am a 34 year-old female that has been struggling with acne since my late twenties. I travel to Iceland often, and whenever I am there, my skin quickly improves. Using the logic that their water has sulfur I it, I looked for a product that contains it.  I came across this and it is FANTASTIC. Within one use, my husband even noticed an improvement with my skin. I use it once in the evening- I leave it on for 8-10 minutes (after cleansing my face with Olay face wipes). After rinsing, I pat dry and use Dr. Brandt&#x27;s Acne No More toner, and finish off with Cetaphil moisturizer. The only change has been the pomade de azufre- worth every penny, which it isn&#x27;t expensive either. The label does recommend use up to 3 times a day, which would dry out my skin way too much, but for those with oily skin, that may be an option. My colleagues and other family members have now noticed and complimented my new look. Love it!</li>
            <li> This product was so greasy and I did not see any difference in what it claims which is to dry up the acne.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could get my money back after this failed trial and error.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall product performed poorly and not as indicated. I believe it was too greasy to be drying. It&#x27;s was so greasy, I was worried about having more blemishes just from using the product. Felt like I was putting Vaseline on my face.</li>
            <li> I have had acne my whole life. My dermatologist told me I habe rosacea. Lately I have been extremely stressed anf have had horrible skin. It has been scaling, itching, vety red, very broken out. I looked up treatmeny for rosacea and adult acne and found out about using sulpher based creams. At first I was taken aback. How couldnsulpher help?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I thought about the times I had very good skin. When I stayed at my grandmothers my soin cleared in anfew days. I thought it was her soap so I switched to it. After I got home I broke bavk out almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I wpuld go to my mother-in-law&#x27;s it wouodnclear up so I bought her soap. Very shortly after returning home it was back tonawful red bumpy skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everytime we go to Disney it would clear up. Thisnlast yime I hoarded soap to bring home. Not long after getting home I broke out again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What donall these places have in common? Well water with a sulphur scent. I bought the sulphur ointment and in fout days my skin is clearing. No new pimples. The redness has faded dramatically. I think I finally figured this thing out. Only took 43 years.</li>
            <li> First time I tried this and it seems to work well.  I have acne flair ups and when I use a sulfur mask and then put this on any acne it really helps.  I have really oily skin, so you might have to adjust and use every other day according to your skin type.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that has been able to clear up and keep pimples from my face.  I have been using proactiv for a number of years with little to no results and in less than 6 months from using this product my face has cleared up tremendously. The first time I used it my face started to peel but that lasted for about 1 week max.  After that it was just great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin type: Combination&lt;br /&gt;Skin Tone: Tan, medium&lt;br /&gt;Age: 25-34&lt;br /&gt;Climate: warm, humid, very hot weather&lt;br /&gt;Use: mornings and at nights&lt;br /&gt;Use with: Moisturizer and an exfoliating scrub- I normally use Cetaphil and a cheap drug store product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to buy my second bottle today</li>
            <li> This stuff works like magic for close to the surface acne and blackheads.  It won&#x27;t work for acne vulgaris or deep cysts.  Quitting dairy helped me there.</li>
            <li> I already use 2/3 of it, didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li> Within two weeks my face cleared up. This stuff is very effective.. Wish I knew about it many years ago!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.  I have suffered from acne for 20 yrs.  I have spent THOUSANDS of dollars on everything.  I tried this weird, cheap stuff and it&#x27;s fantastic.  My skin is smooth, soft, no inflammation.  My skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good since I was a kid. I leave it on for 10-20 min each night and rinse.  My skin peeled for the first week or two but has been great since.  I have really oily skin and since using this product I don&#x27;t need any foundation/makeup which is great.  If you have adult acne try this one last thing.  You&#x27;ve already tried everything else, why not give it a whirl, you&#x27;ll be surprised how well it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware:  It stinks---sulfur/matchstick smell.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any staining of my clothes/hair/towels.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, it arrived promptly and was packaged great. It is powerful, I usually apply oil after showering with the soap, but it works great.</li>
            <li> I like it, but it&#x27;s really greasy.  Guess I should have expected that from an ointment vs. cream product.  It also has a strong odor.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It works great! I use it for spot treatment before bed. I don&#x27;t have bad acne, but I do workout  and run a lot so I am prone to some...I have combination skin. This stuff is very greasy consistency, but believe be it works well to dry out pimples.  I just dab a very small amount on the area I need and by morning they will be dryed out...a little goes a long way! This will last a very long time for me...so worth the money!</li>
            <li> I have more infected acne so sometimes when i use this overnight it doesnt seem to help my acne might go down a little but it comes back worse</li>
            <li> If you have acne problems this is the stuff for you! It works great and doesn&#x27;t take very much to use.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and ordered this product after reading some good reviews but it doesn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;I left it on over night for a week  but it never absorbs in or gets dry...  Stays sticky till I wake up in the morning...&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend .</li>
            <li> This product worked great along side with the sulfur soap.  Helped relieve itchy red bumps from scabies. It does not cure scabies, but it worked very well with the prescription I was on, Ivermectin.  It does have a bit of an unpleasant smell, but at least you know it&#x27;s working.  It will take about 3-5 days, but with prolonged use, you will see a difference in about a week.  I kept using it well up to one month after I took my prescription and I did get better.  The product is great and I was only able to find it in the Walmart in Miami.  When I returned to Texas I could only find it on Amazaon.  Great product for the price, and delivered at noted in the invoice.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews on this product before my purchase.  I am 51 years old and still suffer from acne flare-ups.  So I thought I would try this product, since it was natural. First the product was very oily.  After the my first application it began to itch and I knew it would not agree with my skin type. (extememly oily in T-zone area)  So after 3 weeks I began to breakout more, so I have stoppped using it.</li>
            <li> Works great but be careful as it dries up Everything: nails,hair, and skin.Best for targeted applications.</li>
    </ol>
