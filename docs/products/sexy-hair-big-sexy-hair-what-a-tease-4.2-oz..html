            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I have fine limp hair and this eliminates the need for a ton of hairspray to lift my hair.</li>
            <li>In stores this sells for around $20, which is pretty steep for such a small bottle but this stuff works and is very worth it.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s costly, but lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> This product transformed my fine, limp hair into a serious Lana Del Rey-style bouffant in under a minute, with just a little help from a teasing brush.</li>
            <li> Not worth it, wish i could return it.</li>
            <li> Does slightly increase volume, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend and won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li> It volumized my hair very, very little.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and heavy.</li>
            <li> It gets so sticky on my hair and hard.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I am a little disappointed about the speediness.</li>

            <li> This product is absolutley the best if you love big hair! Just wish they made a bigger bottle of it!</li>
            <li> I really had high hopes for this spray. I have fine hair, and i try minimize my damage by not teasing it as often. I saw a youtube video on this spray, and the person loved it. It gets so sticky on my hair and hard. Might as well just get hairspray, because it does the same thing except it leaves your hair crunchy. I tried to use it a couple of times, different ways to see if i got different results but i didn&#x27;t. It volumized my hair very, very little. Not worth it, wish i could return it.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I have fine limp hair and this eliminates the need for a ton of hairspray to lift my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hairspray! It hold so well and it really is a \\&quot;backcomb in a bottle\\&quot; It does such an amazing job lifting my roots, its almost like magic! In stores this sells for around $20, which is pretty steep for such a small bottle but this stuff works and is very worth it. I was ecstatic when I found it on here for $13. I HIGHLY recommend</li>
            <li> Fabulous product for girls that like big hair styles.  I totally love this stuff.  It&#x27;s costly, but lasts a long time.  Buy it!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is the bomb. You really do get the tease without the task. It does make your hair tangly, but, that&#x27;s what teasing is.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for getting volume right at the roots!  Just spray and rat with a fine tooth comb, then smooth down for a clean look.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair spray.  I always buy this.  Once you spray it you can comb right through your hair.  I an reviewing this even though I have not received my purchase yet.  Needless to say, I am a little disappointed about the speediness.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I was expecting but it really was just super hold hairspray. It didn&#x27;t help my hair out in the volume department at all.</li>
            <li> Wow! This product transformed my fine, limp hair into a serious Lana Del Rey-style bouffant in under a minute, with just a little help from a teasing brush. I never imagined it would work THIS well, but boy, does it! I can&#x27;t believe I have this much volume in MY REAL hair without even using a Bump-It. I am hooked!</li>
            <li> Works like it says.  Great Product</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It isn&#x27;t hair spray, or so they say. Mobutu, it makes styling  so easy. My hair is thick and heavy. I love how I can style it and it holds using this.</li>
            <li> This product is good to use at the root of your hair. It gives it that day old washed look so more volume.</li>
            <li> Love the hold and lift that this gives styles, be it wedding or photo shoot the results are always fantastic !!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Gives my hair great volume and not to mention the price is great</li>
            <li> This is the best hairspray I have ever used.  You don&#x27;t have to backcomb your hair anymore to get the lift.  Just spray underneath you hair and use your fingers to add volume.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair tangle-y.  Does slightly increase volume, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend and won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li> Spray it on, It really looks like you just teased your hair. I&#x27;ll have to say that this product delivers just what it says it will.</li>
            <li> My daily beauty regime now includes What a Tease. I could not be without it. I have a short angled stack haircut and it gives it just the lift I need. You dont NEED a teasing comb but if you use this stuff with a teasing comb, its magical.</li>
