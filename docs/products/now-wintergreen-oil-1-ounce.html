            <li>The oil itself is fine</li>
            <li>This one didn&#x27;t instead the seller wrapped it in some cheap gummy peel away plastic to make it look tamper proof.</li>

            <li>It gives my mouthwash, lip balms and healing salves just the right invigoration I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Most of the oils have a black lid with a dropper in the top.  </li>
            <li>I have a pretty good collection of now oils and every bottle I have has a black lid</li>
            <li>The bottle really ought to come with some kind of drop-dispensing top, since a spill is such a nuissance, even a potential hazard.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really want to pay for the more expensive brands and the brand has great oils for the price.</li>
            <li>This is exactly how wintergreen should smell.</li>

            <li>the first to review this product</li>
            <li>To sum up; the oil seems good, but I would never buy this bottle again as the open top is a riduculuous means of dispensing the potentially poisonous essential oil.</li>
            <li>Great for loosening tough rusty bolts (the navy knows this)</li>
            <li>Works great for bolts that won&#x27;t come off put a drop or so on and a few minutes later presto!!</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Wintergreen Oil is very helpful for joints that ache - specifically knees.  </li>
            <li>This wintergreen really helps alleviate hardcore body aches for me.</li>
            <li>After using it for awhile, it isn&#x27;t as potent as expected.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had some success using a toothpick to get drops, but when using essential oils you want to be pretty precise, so not having proper control on how much comes out</li>
            <li>Good item, it is strong and very minty, i had to buy some Menthol crystals to make my mix cold.</li>
            <li>Now the review in itself isn&#x27;t anything against the now brand but this particular seller.</li>
            <li>I called the company and they sent me a replacement that smells exactly the same.</li>
            <li>I have been dealing with chronic pain and began a personal quest to become familiar with essential oils.</li>
            <li>I have not used it enough to really rate it fully.</li>
            <li>Not like the old fashioned oil of wintergreen--</li>
            <li>Maybe I just got an old batch, or it was&lt;br /&gt;sitting</li>
            <li>in a hot warehouse way too long.</li>
            <li>works wonders for runners knee you can use with lotion or directly apply</li>
            <li>Whatever you do, don&#x27;t bathe in it or put it directly on your body.</li>
            <li>I only have to add a few drops because it&#x27;s so strong.</li>
            <li>I would not be surprised if someone accidentally overdosed as a result of the poor choice of bottle top.  </li>
            <li>:-(&lt;br /&gt;I ended up buying another wintergreen from another company and that one smelled beautiful - like wintergreen.</li>
            <li>The oil is good as far as I can tell, but shipping a semi-dangerous, self-adherent essential oil in an open-mouth container is nothing short of idiotic.  </li>

            <li> :-(&lt;br /&gt;I ended up buying another wintergreen from another company and that one smelled beautiful - like wintergreen.</li>
            <li> The oil is good as far as I can tell, but shipping a semi-dangerous, self-adherent essential oil in an open-mouth container is nothing short of idiotic.  </li>
            <li> I have used very expensive oils that are watery and don&#x27;t smell like they should or don&#x27;t last any time at all, while finding oils from companies like Now that cost much less, work well, smell great and last.</li>
            <li> This bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because Now oils are so reasonably priced and it&#x27;s true we usually get what we pay for, but over the last several months I have experimented with several brands/price ranges and have found that the oils vary with every single company.</li>
            <li> To my knowledge I don&#x27;t know a single person affiliated with essential oil companies or anyone who is linked to oils in any way.</li>
            <li> And as wintergreen oil is basically super-concentrated liquid aspirin, using anything more than a drop or three can be dangerous (or fatal in some cases).  </li>
            <li> I am going to try it in candles and lotions, perhaps soaps, the uses are endless and I can&#x27;t wait to experiment further.</li>
            <li> it will leak and eat through any packaging and you loose some of the oils.</li>
            <li> the lid went flying off and does not really stay on.</li>
            <li> This product was what I expected...</li>
            <li> But when I opened it to add to defuser, I lost 1/3 of the bottle because there was no restricter (the plastic control devise all my other scents have in the bottle neck) on the bottle.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed because I love NOW oils.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the oil is reacting with the aluminum in the cap cover as it&#x27;s not a standard drip cover that comes with this bottle.</li>
            <li> I also purchased two other types of oil</li>
            <li> But be careful not to spill this oil!</li>
            <li> All the other</li>
            <li> br /&gt;or refrigerate to preserve the active compounds.</li>
            <li> Obviously they have tried hard to hide that fact.</li>
            <li> and I only have one complaint:</li>
            <li> the bottle I received in the mail did not have a black lid</li>
            <li> I have a neighbour with the now wintergreen and even hers had a black lid.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me, that meant a spill that required new laminate flooring...</li>
            <li> At the very least, there should be a giant warning label on the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Each attempt I&#x27;ve made to get a small quantity out has resulted in excess oil running all down the bottle and my hand and splashing about on my countertops.  </li>
            <li> For some reason, this batch didn&#x27;t seem that potent.&lt;br /&gt;In addition, the aroma was somewhat dull compared&lt;br /&gt;to other purchases.</li>
            <li> It reacts badly with some plastics, dissolving them much the way acetone does, leaving a sticky melty mess.</li>
            <li> I use it on my painful joints and it really helps a lot.</li>
            <li> I always buy NOW essential oils when possible and have not been disappointed yet.</li>
            <li> There is no way to get oil out of the bottle in small quantities.  </li>
            <li> but the bottle does not have any type of dropper, which is very inconvenient for essential oils.</li>
            <li> both safety seals were broken.  </li>
            <li> That is not to say that this product or its company is bad just that I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Now the quality of the oil itself; it smells disgusting this isn&#x27;t wintergreen, if I were to make an educated guess</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The oil itself seems to be of excellent quality, but the bottle does not have what I&#x27;ve come to know as the standard &#x27;dropper&#x27; style cap, it just pours out. I&#x27;ve had some success using a toothpick to get drops, but when using essential oils you want to be pretty precise, so not having proper control on how much comes out makes this product a bit sub-par for me.</li>
            <li> Great oil, I use in a mix for arthritis. I buy this oil a lot and I only have one complaint: NOW does not put a stoppers in there product before sealing with tamper proof seal. The sellers do there best to package but when this oil is laid on it&#x27;s side it will leak and eat through any packaging and you loose some of the oils.</li>
            <li> Use this in my diffuser to cover some of the oils that do not smell so good.  Wonderful fresh smell.</li>
            <li> Spilled gas in trunk of car. could not get rid of the odor. Two drops of wintergreen oil  presto odor gone.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because of an article I saw in a magazine.  Mixing it with lotion suppose to ease the soreness in your back muscles.  I have not used it enough to really rate it fully.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of now essential oils. I don&#x27;t really want to pay for the more expensive brands and the brand has great oils for the price. Now the review in itself isn&#x27;t anything against the now brand but this particular seller. What they are selling you is not wintergreen essential oils. I have a pretty good collection of now oils and every bottle I have has a black lid the bottle I received in the mail did not have a black lid but instead a white one. I have a neighbour with the now wintergreen and even hers had a black lid. Every now oil I have ever received has a tamper proof seal. This one didn&#x27;t instead the seller wrapped it in some cheap gummy peel away plastic to make it look tamper proof. The lid they put on it does not even properly fit the bottle and when I was wiping off the oil that had leaked out the lid went flying off and does not really stay on. Now the quality of the oil itself; it smells disgusting this isn&#x27;t wintergreen, if I were to make an educated guess I would say these sellers are just filling bottles with chemicals and selling them online. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT FROM THIS SELLER!!!! THEY ARE SCAMMERS!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent price and quality</li>
            <li> Great for loosening tough rusty bolts (the navy knows this)</li>
            <li> Great Product!  Great Price!  Will buy again</li>
            <li> Not like the old fashioned oil of wintergreen-- wish I could find some</li>
            <li> I received the bottle of wintergreen oil with the safety foil seal on the bottle unsealed.  As I didn&#x27;t know if it was a manufacturing defect or if someone tampered with the contents, I discarded the bottle unused.</li>
            <li> I always buy NOW essential oils when possible and have not been disappointed yet.</li>
            <li> Very nice and a good price.</li>
            <li> Love wintergreen. Delivered quickly. But when I opened it to add to defuser, I lost 1/3 of the bottle because there was no restricter (the plastic control devise all my other scents have in the bottle neck) on the bottle. I was watching to make sure I did not get liquid in the motor portion of the defuser, but dumped too much without the restricter being in place.</li>
            <li> Everything is great except the oil does not come with a droplet top for using one drop at a time.</li>
            <li> Now is my favorite EO brand!!</li>
            <li> For some reason, this batch didn&#x27;t seem that potent.&lt;br /&gt;In addition, the aroma was somewhat dull compared&lt;br /&gt;to other purchases. Also, upon topical application&lt;br /&gt;there wasn&#x27;t any analgesic effect like wintergreen&lt;br /&gt;usually has. Maybe I just got an old batch, or it was&lt;br /&gt;sitting in a hot warehouse way too long. Essential&lt;br /&gt;oils should be stored at below room temperature&lt;br /&gt;or refrigerate to preserve the active compounds.</li>
            <li> vary strong. a good thing!</li>
            <li> Despite having &amp;#34;foods&amp;#34; in the brand name, this is &amp;#34;not for internal use&amp;#34;. Obviously they have tried hard to hide that fact.</li>
            <li> Love this product I have bought Wintergreen from another company and it was not the real deal. This is the real deal I could smell the difference!!!! Thanks I will be buying this product again!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely impressive! My knee pain was relieved almost instantly. I recommend  it to every body!</li>
            <li> Am very pleased with the freshness and quality of all Now products, and this wintergreen is no exception.  It gives my mouthwash, lip balms and healing salves just the right invigoration I was looking for.  Will purchase again.  I am going to try it in candles and lotions, perhaps soaps, the uses are endless and I can&#x27;t wait to experiment further.</li>
            <li> This product was what I expected...It smells good and I use it in my vacuume and it makes my whole house smell great... quick shipping</li>
            <li> Never has advertising been so true. This is exactly how wintergreen should smell. Also, it lasts forever. If you want a long lasting, delicious tasting fragrance, this is it. Warning, it may make you want to by wint-o-green lifesavers by the bag full. Like it did for me.</li>
            <li> Really wonderful.  Just perfect.</li>
            <li> This has a nice strong minty aroma. I use this in my homemade mouth wash. I only have to add a few drops because it&#x27;s so strong. This bottle will last a long time. It&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li> No drop cap is included. You will need to have your own dropper which is not that convenient.  Other than that everything was great.</li>
            <li> works wonders for runners knee you can use with lotion or directly apply</li>
            <li> Very effective... that spells good quality.</li>
            <li> I AM A ESSENTIAL OIL FREAK.......I LOVE MIXING AND MAKING MY HOME AND FAMILY FEEL GREAT.</li>
            <li> I love it. Good quality. i will recomend this product. Be the first to review this product .Be the first to review this product</li>
            <li> The smell is foul - like rot - not at all like wintergreen. I was so disappointed because I love NOW oils. It smells like something is rotten. Not sure if the oil is reacting with the aluminum in the cap cover as it&#x27;s not a standard drip cover that comes with this bottle. I called the company and they sent me a replacement that smells exactly the same. :-(&lt;br /&gt;I ended up buying another wintergreen from another company and that one smelled beautiful - like wintergreen.</li>
            <li> I enjoy NOW essential oils, good value, quality product.</li>
            <li> Good item, it is strong and very minty, i had to buy some Menthol crystals to make my mix cold.</li>
            <li> Works great for bolts that won&#x27;t come off put a drop or so on and a few minutes later presto!!</li>
            <li> Good quality, potent, still experimenting with ratio and blending.</li>
            <li> Very useful to keep in anyone&#x27;s medicine cabinet.  I use mine daily for best results.</li>
            <li> Normally I love Now Foods oils but this was upsetting.  Most of the oils have a black lid with a dropper in the top.  These had a white lid with safety seals.  When they arrived (2 one oz. bottles) both safety seals were broken.  Some had spilled from the white lid and was on the plastic wrapping.  I&#x27;ve never used wintergreen oil before so I have nothing to compare the smell to but it is extremely potent. I think I&#x27;ll start ordering a different brand if their lids are going to be changing like this.</li>
            <li> I chose to rate this product with one star because the use that I had for this product was dashed when I received it and learned that it was NOT for consumption. That is not to say that this product or its company is bad just that I was disappointed. I also purchased two other types of oil and I learned the same thing with them as well.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping and great price.</li>
            <li> The oil itself is fine but the bottle does not have any type of dropper, which is very inconvenient for essential oils.</li>
            <li> The smell is what I was expecting, but this bottle ships without a reducer cap. Unlike any NOW EO I have seen. If you buy this, keep your pipettes handy, or transfer to another bottle.</li>
            <li> Bought this to diffuse and am pleased with the fragrance. My knees were aching, rubbed some oil in my hands and applied to my knees and slept with no aches. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Now always has the best essential oils at a great price too!</li>
            <li> I love the aromatherapy as well as the cooling effect for my clients. I use it on towels for my foot towels</li>
            <li> Not the best smelling wintergreen, but the price is right.</li>
            <li> Wintergreen Oil is very helpful for joints that ache - specifically knees.  Once applied the relief is almost immediate.The &#x27;pain relief&#x27; can last two to three hours.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me, that meant a spill that required new laminate flooring...</li>
            <li> Whatever you do, don&#x27;t bathe in it or put it directly on your body. Will be a sensational burn/tingle for a while.</li>
            <li> This oil works perfectly well for my needs. I was skeptical because Now oils are so reasonably priced and it&#x27;s true we usually get what we pay for, but over the last several months I have experimented with several brands/price ranges and have found that the oils vary with every single company. It seems to be hit or miss.  I have used very expensive oils that are watery and don&#x27;t smell like they should or don&#x27;t last any time at all, while finding oils from companies like Now that cost much less, work well, smell great and last. This wintergreen really helps alleviate hardcore body aches for me. I use it alone or with helichrysum and within 20-30 minutes I&#x27;m feeling significant relief. I do not have a blog. No one is paying me to say anything or review products. To my knowledge I don&#x27;t know a single person affiliated with essential oil companies or anyone who is linked to oils in any way. I have been dealing with chronic pain and began a personal quest to become familiar with essential oils. Wintergreen will be a staple in my home, and this brand holds its own very well.</li>
            <li> I use it to make toothpaste.  If you want to do that you must mix it with a carrier oil.  I use coconut.</li>
            <li> I love Now Brand Wintergreen oil.  I use it on my painful joints and it really helps a lot.</li>
            <li> fast delivery- good product</li>
            <li> I use this oil for transfering toner from paper to rubber-stamp material. But be careful not to spill this oil! It reacts badly with some plastics, dissolving them much the way acetone does, leaving a sticky melty mess. The bottle really ought to come with some kind of drop-dispensing top, since a spill is such a nuissance, even a potential hazard.</li>
            <li> After using it for awhile, it isn&#x27;t as potent as expected.</li>
            <li> Quality is very good.That I like.I would recommend to my friends.I trust the amazon</li>
            <li> The oil is good as far as I can tell, but shipping a semi-dangerous, self-adherent essential oil in an open-mouth container is nothing short of idiotic.  There is no way to get oil out of the bottle in small quantities.  And as wintergreen oil is basically super-concentrated liquid aspirin, using anything more than a drop or three can be dangerous (or fatal in some cases).  Each attempt I&#x27;ve made to get a small quantity out has resulted in excess oil running all down the bottle and my hand and splashing about on my countertops.  The oil sort of holds to itself and then clings to the contours of the bottle until it drips off your fingers and the bottle bottom; it doesn&#x27;t just pour out like water.  All the other Now Foods mint oils have the standard dropper tops included.  Why on earth they didn&#x27;t include it on this one is especially baffling.  I would not be surprised if someone accidentally overdosed as a result of the poor choice of bottle top.  At the very least, there should be a giant warning label on the bottle.  Wintergreen Oil is to be used a drop at a time... not a splash at a time.  To sum up; the oil seems good, but I would never buy this bottle again as the open top is a riduculuous means of dispensing the potentially poisonous essential oil.</li>
