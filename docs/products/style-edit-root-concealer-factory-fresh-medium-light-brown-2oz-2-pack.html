            <li> This is my new favorite hair care product. It works perfectly between colorings to conceal my gray roots. The color match to my hair is spot on and blends really well. I can now extend the time between going to the hair stylist for color and save money by doing so.</li>

            <li> This is a great hair spray for touching up gray!  Easy to use, and blends extremely well with your natural hair color.  I would suggest it to anyone who has gray hair.  I go to a salon every 6 weeks faithfully to cover my gray and this spray is beneficial since the gray begins to show in 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff - saves me when I can&#x27;t get to the salon. Easy spray on, blends in well although important not to get to close to scalp because it makes the hair look wet or greasy if too close. Wipes off skin with just water.</li>
