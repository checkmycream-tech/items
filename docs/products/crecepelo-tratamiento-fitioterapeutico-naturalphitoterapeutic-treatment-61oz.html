            <li>It also has a very nice small to to the conditioner.</li>
            <li>Item exactly as described.</li>
            <li>If i choose to buy this product again i will do so from a different seller who hopefully packages their products better.</li>
            <li>My first jar lasted me about 9 months.  </li>
            <li>I used this conditioner for the first time on Sunday evening.  </li>
            <li>Thick moisturizing conditioner, great size for the money, I&#x27;ll reorder.</li>
            <li>I have bought this product before and KNOW there are different formulas that are good, and that they also sell a different version.</li>
            <li>Awesome stuff, especially for folks with thick hair.</li>
            <li>I use this as a deep conditioner and my hair feels nice and soft and moisturized after using it.  </li>
            <li>If you have dry hair this conditioner will leave your hair looking healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li>Overall i am very satisfied and do definitely recommend it!!</li>
            <li>I was looking for a good deep conditioner to use on my girls hair highly recommended especially if you are going to straighten your hair and use heat afterwards protects it from heat damage.</li>
            <li>But I certainly feel it working when I use it.  </li>
            <li>I use this in a spray bottle with water as a detangler and this makes my routine so much easier.  </li>
            <li>coming from very damage chemical</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t need in my hair</li>
            <li>Damn does the trick my whole familia lives it if this is like the formula I use to get this seller has a sold  customer</li>
            <li>This is helping with the porosity of her hair leaving it very moisturized.  </li>
            <li>ITS VERY SOFT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a coarser hair texture, this is very drying.</li>
            <li>To the point my hair tangles so much during wash outs.</li>
            <li>My hair feels very soft after the first use.</li>
            <li>So far I have purchased 2 large containers of this conditioner because my hair loves this stuff!</li>
            <li>IT BLOW DRY EASY AND STRAIGHTER.</li>
            <li>I usually either sit under a steamer or warm the condition before I put it on.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for thick, coarse or curly hair (this is especially good for Afro-American or Mixed hair textures).</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t buy it quick enough in Florida</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This Conditioner was one of  the highly rated.</li>
            <li>The product is semi thick and kind of foams/lathers with application ...</li>
            <li>I tried this product last week, and boy did it make my hair super soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I am a person whose hair does not grow as rapidly or regularly as most, and just witnessing my hair grow 3 inches in less than two months tells me that these natural ingredients are doing their job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>THESE PRODUCTS ARE AFFORDABLE AND FANTASTIC FOR DRY-DAMAGED HAIR DUE TO OVER-PROCESSING AND COLORING</li>
            <li>Very thick hair conditioner, great as leave-in conditioner or as a deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have course thick African American hair, and this great product is working miracles on my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very natural, of pure african descent.</li>
            <li>Style it up with your favorite finishing products, and you&#x27;ll hardly notice it yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, you can use this as the final step after shampooing because it literally leaves your hair so soft that there really isn&#x27;t much to detangle afterwards.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair extremely soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Once you put it on your hair your hair will feel so soft.</li>
            <li>Hydration, no frizz, lots of slip and softness is what you will experience on 4C natural hair.</li>
            <li>like I was a budding flower.</li>
            <li>My bff frequent Dominican hair salons.</li>
            <li>We are all natural</li>
            <li>I have natural 4c hair and this conditioner</li>
            <li>CRECEPELO TRATAMIENTO FITIOTERAPEUTICO NATURAL</li>
            <li>This conditioner makes my hair soft, and manageable after a wash.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll have bouncy soft shiny curls.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased my 2nd large jar with no hesitation.  </li>
            <li>It left my hair supperr soft and it helped untangle my hair.</li>
            <li>My natural was dry and frizzy</li>

            <li> You&#x27;ll have bouncy soft shiny curls.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased my 2nd large jar with no hesitation.  </li>
            <li> It left my hair supperr soft and it helped untangle my hair.</li>
            <li> My natural was dry and frizzy</li>
            <li> minor drawback for me was that the perfume scent a bit overpowering for my liking but it is definitely nothing that will cause you irritation or promote any breathing discomfort.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see growth</li>
            <li> I DID NOT HAVE TO FLAT IRON IT.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not available in the city I live in.</li>
            <li> My low porosity hair drinks it in and is no longer dry or frizzy.  </li>
            <li> My hair was completely de tangled while I only used a small amount.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s growing, but not sure if it&#x27;s only this since I&#x27;m also using wild growth hair oil</li>
            <li> My regimen is rinse, condition, wrap and hood dry my hair.</li>
            <li> but  I recommend if you have dry hair.</li>
            <li> MY HAIR IS THICK,BROKEN-OFF,DAMAGED,BRITTLE, AND DRY.</li>
            <li> A must buy for those with dry relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> Total bait and switch not worth the money</li>
            <li> very little was left in the jar that i could actually use.</li>
            <li> its past the middle of my back.</li>
            <li> My hair is very dry, brittle, 4c.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product a few times and my hair has grown out a lot.  </li>
            <li> Because of the answers on here, I went and bought this product and was extremely dissapointed.</li>
            <li> I do feel its effect wears off after 3 or 4 days, but that could be from other products that I use.  </li>
            <li> This makes any hair soft but for a person like myself who suffers from sebum problems this stuff never left my hair feeling oily or sticky.</li>
            <li> I have thick natural hair that is very hard to moisturize/detangle.  </li>
            <li> anyways I couldn&#x27;t say this before , all the tears from crying as I had my husband shave it</li>
            <li> its thick..</li>
            <li> and since I have thick hair, it helped me a lot with fizziness.</li>
            <li> This Sucks!</li>
            <li> It is very thick.</li>
            <li> My hair was so broken.</li>
            <li> This item was horribly packaged.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I work out a lot. My hair is short, semi colored and permed. My regimen is rinse, condition, wrap and hood dry my hair.Shampoo maybe once a week. I tried this product last week, and boy did it make my hair super soft and shiny. It has a most delicious aroma to it. Smells great. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Because of the answers on here, I went and bought this product and was extremely dissapointed. Instead of receiving the good formulation, I received the formulation that contained silicones, drying alcohols, hydrolyzed protein, and propelyne glycol. This Sucks! I have bought this product before and KNOW there are different formulas that are good, and that they also sell a different version. So I was dissapinted to spend $20, after trying to double check that the ingredients would be the correct ones. To still recieve this crappy version of the creco. Another thing is the creco pelo I received, despite buying it with this picture thumbnail, has a completely different style sticker on it but with the same name.  I&#x27;m beginning to wonder of it is the seller, selling different formula. I bought the one from the Keratin Shop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; water purficated, cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, cetrimonium chloride, behentrimonium methosulfate, isopropyl myristate, propylene glycol, peg-12 dimethicone, hydrolyzed silk, parfum, panthenol, glycerin, polyquaternium-11, quaternium-80, dmdm hidantion, disodium edta, cistic acid.</li>
            <li> This is a rip off made with cheap ingredients while claiming to be the version made with good ingredients.  Total bait and switch not worth the money</li>
            <li> Lasted a year great  deep treatment</li>
            <li> This product actually works wonders! I am a person whose hair does not grow as rapidly or regularly as most, and just witnessing my hair grow 3 inches in less than two months tells me that these natural ingredients are doing their job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I actually purchased the entire line of this product but after using each I felt that my hair was responding best to the actual treatment. This makes any hair soft but for a person like myself who suffers from sebum problems this stuff never left my hair feeling oily or sticky. Instead I&#x27;m left with manageable, flowy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, you can use this as the final step after shampooing because it literally leaves your hair so soft that there really isn&#x27;t much to detangle afterwards. I can only see that become a problem for those with hair longer than shoulder length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The minor drawback for me was that the perfume scent a bit overpowering for my liking but it is definitely nothing that will cause you irritation or promote any breathing discomfort. Style it up with your favorite finishing products, and you&#x27;ll hardly notice it yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the money and the storage space!</li>
            <li> Wonderful deep conditoner.</li>
            <li> Been using this for over 4 years now as a co-conditioner. My hair grows super fast with this stuff. Conditions well, keep hair shiny, moisturized, and I simply will not try another conditioners after finding this awesome stuff. By the way it last me about 6 months. Awesome stuff, especially for folks with thick hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. I have thick natural hair that is very hard to moisturize/detangle.  I use this in a spray bottle with water as a detangler and this makes my routine so much easier.  You also can&#x27;t beat the price for this huge container.  Definitely recommend for 4C chicks!</li>
            <li> Item exactly as described. Arrived on time.....love the product</li>
            <li> It smell good, big bottle for the prince but about making my hair longer and stronger I haven&#x27;t seen it yet, maybe if I stare using it every 2 days, but over all a good product if used as conditioner.</li>
            <li> Very thick hair conditioner, great as leave-in conditioner or as a deep conditioner. Keeps my hair moisturized, and smells wonderfully.. but very strong flower scent.</li>
            <li> Great for hair growth and moisturizing. Nice clean scent that lingers for days. This product works best under heat for 30 mins on relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hooked. So far I have purchased 2 large containers of this conditioner because my hair loves this stuff!</li>
            <li> The smell is awesome, but not very subtle.  This is great for deep conditioning.  I use it for co-washing.  Awesome.</li>
            <li> My Dominican hairdresser recommended this to me and I absolutely LOVE IT! It makes my hair extremely soft and manageable. It also nourishes it and helps it grow. This is the ONLY moisturizer I use now and it&#x27;s not available in the city I live in.</li>
            <li> Love my crece Pelli believe this help my shaved hair grow better after shaving it bald I&#x27;m now 5-7 coming from very damage chemical I really didn&#x27;t need in my hair anyways I couldn&#x27;t say this before , all the tears from crying as I had my husband shave it, Menopause didn&#x27;t help it but this works for mi won&#x27;t use the shampoo strips my fine  frizzy curls but the deep conditioner a rinse Damn does the trick my whole familia lives it if this is like the formula I use to get this seller has a sold  customer 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍</li>
            <li> This item was horribly packaged. it wasn&#x27;t sealed and the conditioner ended up all over the box. very little was left in the jar that i could actually use. If i choose to buy this product again i will do so from a different seller who hopefully packages their products better.</li>
            <li> Item was as advertised.</li>
            <li> If you have dry hair this conditioner will leave your hair looking healthy and shiny. Once you put it on your hair your hair will feel so soft.</li>
            <li> My hair feels very soft after the first use. It also has a very nice small to to the conditioner.</li>
            <li> My natural was dry and frizzy no matter what deep conditioner I put on it until I purchased CrecePelo.  My low porosity hair drinks it in and is no longer dry or frizzy.  I used this conditioner twice a week in conjunction with the Maximum Hydration Method on YouTube.  All conditioners are not made alike. My first jar lasted me about 9 months.  I recently purchased my 2nd large jar with no hesitation.  Hydration, no frizz, lots of slip and softness is what you will experience on 4C natural hair.</li>
            <li> I think this product may be better than silicon. It is very thick. But please do not go outside with this product. I decided to sit out side instead of under a dryer and forgot about all of the plant extract that is in this product and insects began to follow my like I was a budding flower.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  This is the best for long tangled hair.  My hair was completely de tangled while I only used a small amount.  The smell is also wonderful..  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I used this conditioner for the first time on Sunday evening.  It softened my hair.  I will continue using it for hair growth.</li>
            <li> I have been without a relaxer for about 7 years. My bff frequent Dominican hair salons. There isn&#x27;t one in my area. I started researching and watching/reading reviews. This Conditioner was one of  the highly rated. I see why, I love the scent, consistency, and the slip. My hair type I don&#x27;t need the rinse condish but  I recommend if you have dry hair. I&#x27;m ordering some more. I  love Dominican hair products. My hair was @ my shoulders  last Spring now its past the middle of my back.</li>
            <li> Really nice smell it was recommended by my Panamanian girlfriend who swears by it. I was looking for a good deep conditioner to use on my girls hair highly recommended especially if you are going to straighten your hair and use heat afterwards protects it from heat damage. My Dominican hair dresser mixes it with the silicon Bambi mix for extra protection. We are all natural</li>
            <li> Amazing conditioner!!  I purchased this for me and my daughter.  Her hair was having a &#x27;thirsty&#x27; look to some parts of her head.  This is helping with the porosity of her hair leaving it very moisturized.  The product is semi thick and kind of foams/lathers with application ... Im sure it depends on how much you use.  I don&#x27;t think that the scent is for everyone ... But that would not deter me from not our hasing this product again and again!</li>
            <li> will buy again!a really great read who would have known. but it was a good read loved it and would look for similar</li>
            <li> Excellent!  I plan to repurchase.</li>
            <li> This is my second order.  Good for natural and perm hair!</li>
            <li> Only used it twice, but it is awesome when you mix it with silicon mix and olive oil. This stuff is amazing  quick shipping as well</li>
            <li> This stuff is life food for my hair.  My hair is very dry, brittle, 4c.  This stuff gives my hair the moisture boost it needs before I put everything else in.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff!! I have natural 4c hair and this conditioner definitely helps with softness and conditioning my hair.  I do feel its effect wears off after 3 or 4 days, but that could be from other products that I use.  But I certainly feel it working when I use it.  Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see growth but I will stick with it. Great product, I will purchase again.  Thanks Crecepelp!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for thick, coarse or curly hair (this is especially good for Afro-American or Mixed hair textures). It provides superior moisture and detangling.</li>
            <li> CRECEPELO TRATAMIENTO FITIOTERAPEUTICO NATURAL (PHITOTERAPEUTIC TREATMENT)IS FANTASTIC. I JUST USED THE TREATMENT 1-HOUR AGO, AND I CAN&#x27;T BELIEVE HOW HEALTHY,MANAGEABLE,SOFT,SILKY MY HAIR IS. I CAN FEEL MY HAIR RESPONDING TO THIS TREATMENT ALREADY AFTER JUST ONE USE. MY HAIR IS THICK,BROKEN-OFF,DAMAGED,BRITTLE, AND DRY. I DID NOT HAVE TO FLAT IRON IT. IT BLOW DRY EASY AND STRAIGHTER. IT SHINES AND ITS VERY SOFT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WILL BE ORDERING TONS. I ALSO USED THE ENTIRE LINE TO GET THESE RESULTS. I USED THE SHAMPOO,TREATMENT,RINSE,AND THE LEAVE-IN. THESE PRODUCTS ARE AFFORDABLE AND FANTASTIC FOR DRY-DAMAGED HAIR DUE TO OVER-PROCESSING AND COLORING</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 6 months. My hair is doing fabulous. It&#x27;s growing, but not sure if it&#x27;s only this since I&#x27;m also using wild growth hair oil.. I have 4b/C thick coily wonderful hair but it can get tangled and frizzy. This detangles excellently and leaves my hair soft and manageable. Sometimes I mix it with Henna/herbal powders and oils. My last wash I mixed Crece Pelo + with shea moisture monoi deep conditioner + castor oil + henna powders and ACV and the results were awesome! Definitely try this product and make your own concoctions for great results..</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite.....</li>
            <li> great deep conditioner.  I&#x27;m very natural, of pure african descent. I have the coarsest hair ever.  This conditioner makes my hair soft, and manageable after a wash.  I can actually put a comb through it. Must have!!</li>
            <li> I LOVEEE this!!! It left my hair supperr soft and it helped untangle my hair. And well I bleached the bottom of my hair, my hair felt fried. Once I used this my fried hair felt so much softer and silkier, I love how it added shine to it too. I am for sure going to purchase this product again. It smells good...its thick..and since I have thick hair, it helped me a lot with fizziness. I truly recommend this. I have no regrets purchasing this. :)</li>
            <li> My hair was so broken. I have course thick African American hair, and this great product is working miracles on my hair. I&#x27;ve only used this product a few times and my hair has grown out a lot.  It&#x27;s amazing. Try it! Cheaper in stores.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;Purchased this from the world&#x27;s popular bidding site. I used my bucks and received the 16oz for free. I have relaxed hair and this stuff is amazing. It moisturized my hair better than the Silicon Mix. A must buy for those with dry relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> I have a coarser hair texture, this is very drying. To the point my hair tangles so much during wash outs. However when I use it on my extensions it doesn&#x27;t tangle them, it&#x27;s actually pretty good. My own hair just requires a lot more moisture. I&#x27;ll try silicon mix next. Also, curly girls, coconut oil is your friend deep condition with it. If you like this conditioner mix a larger amount of it with your conditioner. You&#x27;ll have bouncy soft shiny curls.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It met all of my expectations. It works on any type of hair. I love the smell. I can&#x27;t buy it quick enough in Florida the product is always out of stock. Glad I was able to find it on Amazon.com</li>
            <li> It smells so good and leaves your hair soft and moisturized!</li>
            <li> Ingredients in this size are not the same as the smaller jar. However it is great deep conditioner especially when used with a hooded dryer.</li>
            <li> I just got mine im so happy to try it on my hair.it smells so good i will keep a update 😍</li>
            <li> My hair loves this stuff.  I am African American with 4c low porosity hair.  I use this as a deep conditioner and my hair feels nice and soft and moisturized after using it.  I usually either sit under a steamer or warm the condition before I put it on.</li>
            <li> This product has definitely surpass my expectations. I been using it for the past month and my hair feels very very silky, soft and more manageable, it looks shinier and it leaves an amazing aroma for days! It stopped falling which had been for months and also it no longer breaks, and is also helping with my split ends. Overall i am very satisfied and do definitely recommend it!! &amp;#60;5 stars&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> Thick moisturizing conditioner, great size for the money, I&#x27;ll reorder.</li>
            <li> We absolutely love this conditioner ....we have used it for over a year&lt;br /&gt;this company quickly delivers and the consistency...AMAZING along w/the results</li>
