            <li>superb moisturization quality: no ashy flakes in sight!</li>
            <li>This was a great deal!</li>
            <li>A bit greasy for my hands but perfect for all over body.</li>
            <li>/&gt;One of the BEST lotion we have ever tried.</li>
            <li>The lotion itself is wonderful and was a great price.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, this lotion accommodates my needs wonderfully...</li>
            <li>This is a great lotion and does the job.  </li>
            <li>Great lotion.</li>
            <li>Not too oily which is great</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>Price is great</li>
            <li>Great scent.  </li>
            <li>It feels good and makes my skin look great.</li>
            <li>I was looking for an affordable  lotion with shea butter because shea butter is a good skin moisturizing element to have in a lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and she loved it.</li>
            <li>Smells good but not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>This product does have a nice scent</li>
            <li>BUT.... I like how it made my legs look shinny though after a nice shave</li>
            <li>Nice texture to the lotion.  </li>
            <li>I love the pricing because it was a great amount of product for the price and free shipping.</li>
            <li>However, after trying this lotion for the very first time, I noticed a great improvement in the elasticity of my skin, an improvement that increases with each use.</li>
            <li>I have been a Nivea loyalist for 30 years or so and always have loved the clean fragrance as well as the moisturizing effectiveness.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>Much more so than the Aveeno Lavender (plus Ylang-Ylang and more).</li>
            <li>think I&#x27;ll be buying more of this Nivea soon.</li>
            <li>No greasy oily film..........only a nice smooth lubricated skin.</li>
            <li>Love Nivea products.</li>
            <li>She has used a variety of lotions, including ones from Bath &amp; Body Works, but this Nivea lotion is her favorite.</li>
            <li>I was ok.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for a lot of years and am glad to get it once again.</li>
            <li>I have loved the nivea brand products for quite a few years, but this one seems to be the best at this time.</li>
            <li>It relieves dryness of the skin in a nice and mild way.  </li>
            <li>It has a really nice, soft fragrance that smells really good.</li>
            <li>Should have been more securely packaged.</li>
            <li>Plus as winter goes on, people should really invest in a good lotion.</li>
            <li>and I say &#x27;surprisingly&#x27; because I have tried many and various lotions, but to no avail (honestly).  </li>
            <li>This is hands down the BEST body lotion I have been able to find in both supermarkets as well as department stores:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was excited to try their shea butter product as I really love the way shea butter smells and moisturizes.</li>
            <li>But the fragrance of their forumula is incredibly strong and \\&quot;perfumey\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I like this lotion because it has a very light fragrance, is absorbed well, and is not sticky.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;- smooth texture:</li>
            <li>I have to say Nivea Smooth Sensation has a lightweight application on the skin.</li>
            <li>Therefore, it&#x27;s important to wash my hands often.</li>
            <li>This product keeps my skin looking moist and ASH FREE...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Nivea Smooth Sensation for years.</li>
            <li>I purchased this lotion primarily because of its inclusion of Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li>But This product helped a lot and now my skin feels smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, creamy, and leaves my skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m with my boyfriend he always asks how how my  legs are so smooth.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t aware that I actually purchased 3 bottles, very good price.</li>
            <li>Very smooth and easy to put on skin, without feeling sticky, and very calming smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This lotion is great for dry skin and leaves the skin moist, fresh, and smooth all day.</li>
            <li>comes out of the pump easily, rubbs on body easily and evenly;&lt;br /&gt;- fast absorption</li>
            <li>very very smooth on skin, i wish the bottle was little more user friendly</li>
            <li>This is my favorite lotion by far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>cause I always manage to get my hands on everything right after I apply some lotion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazingly smooth and easy to apply on the entire body.</li>
            <li>Have been using it for years and was worried that I wouldn&#x27;t like the new formulation, but it&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li>Consequently, I have been searching for products that have a culmination of ingredients that could work effectively together to moisturize my dry skin from the inside out.</li>
            <li>This lotion keeps my hands nice and soft, when I tell this work wonders on my skin, my skin is now baby soft and not ashy looking.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and skin allergies, and my dermatologist recommended Nivea Smooth Sensation lotion.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is EXTREAMLY SMELLY, the girly smell to be precis, so be aware of that before you buy it.</li>
            <li>I recommend this for anybody who want to have smooth and soft skin.</li>
            <li>And specially living in a dry area needs a lotion that makes my skin smooth but not oily.</li>
            <li>first impressions is that the Nivea lotion is very lightweight.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly (when used in reasonable quantities) and leaves skin silky soft.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel super soft and it&#x27;s very hydrating.</li>
            <li>it is sofisticated, clean and barely there...will not overpower your perfume;&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Its wonderful, thick and creamy, and really soothes dry, damaged skin.  </li>
            <li>I really do feel like this is a steal.  </li>
            <li>looked and felt real regardless of my friends comments</li>
            <li>--can&#x27;t really tell the difference.</li>
            <li>The lotion is fast absorbs and dont leave your skin feeling sticky and greasey.</li>
            <li>Though I love the pump, it is clearly too short to get all the lotion out.</li>
            <li>The perfume is a bit overwhelming when you first apply the product, but it wears off after about half an hour or so.  </li>
            <li>but I am willing to pay to have a bottle in nearly every room of the house and at my office desk because it really helps me.</li>
            <li>This product is silky smooth and lasts for a long time.  </li>
            <li>: you can almost watch it soak into your skin, leaving NO film residue behind;&lt;br /&gt;- non-greasy quality: makes your skin dewey, but not oily; your clothes and stockings are safe; I put it on directly after a shower/bath (when my skin is still slightly damp) and then let my body air dry while I progress with my morning routine; within minutes it is safe to put your clothes on;&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>We both have dry skin and have found Nivea Smooth Sensation just what the name implies.  </li>
            <li>normally cost me 10 bucks at the drugstore.  </li>
            <li>The texture is not thick and not watery, it is in the middle and feel just right on the skin.</li>
            <li>I live in NYC and one bottle of this lotion</li>
            <li>Used it at night but by morning my skin felt SUPER dry still.</li>
            <li>There is no heavy scent, and no left-over oily feeling.  </li>
            <li>As you know washing your hands repeatedly will take a toll on the natural moisture of your hand&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>My hands feel soft and moist afterwards.</li>
            <li>(anywhere) become soft and moist again.</li>
            <li>Living in Arizona makes finding the correct moisturizing cream/lotion vital.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin soft .&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it since a year.</li>
            <li>but it does not bother my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this product was so much better than anything I have used in the past and especially for the price.</li>
            <li>, no other complains so far , works for me</li>
            <li>This lotion keep my skin smooth and soft not only in winter but all year round.</li>
            <li>As an adult, it took me a while to go back to that brand, maybe because the association with my parents made me consider Nivea too old fashioned?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Nivea for years (15 at least) and never found a better body lotion although I try different ones periodically.</li>
            <li>Skin is left soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Its thick and not the non volatile creams that are usually available.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the Aveeno lotion like the Nivea is non-greasy, and gives good moisture to dry skin like Nivea as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>no other creams help me restore the skin&#x27;s moisture instantly after a shower as Nivea does.</li>
            <li>When I first moved here in December 2014, my skin start to dry and felt rough.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick but absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Lotion was all over the bottles, had to be wiped clean with wet and dry cloth, it was a mess after cleaning the bottle and reclosing the one that was open</li>

            <li> Lotion was all over the bottles, had to be wiped clean with wet and dry cloth, it was a mess after cleaning the bottle and reclosing the one that was open</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much less greasy than the Nivea Essentially Enriched lotion, which makes this one great for everyday but probably not great if your skin is very dry or rough.</li>
            <li> extremely dry skin and Shea Butter has been one of the few &#x27;natural&#x27; remedies that accommodates the needs of my skin; however, recently, my skin has become increasingly dry.  </li>
            <li> Too bad: shea butter is so nice.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll  begin to see the effect of the lotion on your dry hands or dry skin</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and lotion after a shower is a must.</li>
            <li> I bought this nivea lotion for dry skin because in the winter time my skin tends to get extremely dry and this lotion keeps my skin from drying out.</li>
            <li> I am a person with VERY dry skin and will appear ashy if lotion is not applied immediately after showering.</li>

            <li> Growing up in Europe, I used to see my parents using Nivea creams a lot. As an adult, it took me a while to go back to that brand, maybe because the association with my parents made me consider Nivea too old fashioned? Shame on me. This is hands down the BEST body lotion I have been able to find in both supermarkets as well as department stores:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- smooth texture: comes out of the pump easily, rubbs on body easily and evenly;&lt;br /&gt;- fast absorption: you can almost watch it soak into your skin, leaving NO film residue behind;&lt;br /&gt;- non-greasy quality: makes your skin dewey, but not oily; your clothes and stockings are safe; I put it on directly after a shower/bath (when my skin is still slightly damp) and then let my body air dry while I progress with my morning routine; within minutes it is safe to put your clothes on;&lt;br /&gt;- superb moisturization quality: no ashy flakes in sight! leaves skin plump!&lt;br /&gt;- boutique scent: it is sofisticated, clean and barely there...will not overpower your perfume;&lt;br /&gt;- price: I found the 400 ml size for about 6 bucks; CANNOT beat that!&lt;br /&gt;- bottle with a pump: makes it easier to use when your hands are wet; can be locked for travel;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- Though I love the pump, it is clearly too short to get all the lotion out. I HATE when manufacturers do that (I would take away half a star for that, if I could). And so, I end up cutting the bottle in half to get the last bit out...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and skin allergies, and my dermatologist recommended Nivea Smooth Sensation lotion.  Its wonderful, thick and creamy, and really soothes dry, damaged skin.  If you&#x27;ve got psoriasis or exzema, this is for you!</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion and does the job.  There is no heavy scent, and no left-over oily feeling.  Skin is left soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> This was a great deal! My fiancee uses Nivea everyday and it saved us a few dollars buying in bulk!</li>
            <li> I bought this a little over a week ago and I&#x27;ve been using it interchangeably with the Aveeno Lavender Lotion. I have to say Nivea Smooth Sensation has a lightweight application on the skin. I bought these lotions because I wanted restore some moisture after several hours of washing my hands repeatedly because I work with food and serve food. Therefore, it&#x27;s important to wash my hands often. As you know washing your hands repeatedly will take a toll on the natural moisture of your hand&#x27;s skin. I was looking for an affordable  lotion with shea butter because shea butter is a good skin moisturizing element to have in a lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impressions is that the Nivea lotion is very lightweight. It absorbs well into the skin after you massage it into the finger tips. My hands feel soft and moist afterwards. You&#x27;ll  begin to see the effect of the lotion on your dry hands or dry skin (anywhere) become soft and moist again. It has a really nice, soft fragrance that smells really good. I love the smell. Much more so than the Aveeno Lavender (plus Ylang-Ylang and more). Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the Aveeno lotion like the Nivea is non-greasy, and gives good moisture to dry skin like Nivea as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ll be buying more of this Nivea soon. Plus as winter goes on, people should really invest in a good lotion. I would say Aveeno and Nivea are the two favorites of mine. Great lotion.</li>
            <li> It feels good and makes my skin look great. Not too oily which is great cause I always manage to get my hands on everything right after I apply some lotion. No smell either.</li>
            <li> This product is silky smooth and lasts for a long time.  The perfume is a bit overwhelming when you first apply the product, but it wears off after about half an hour or so.  This lotion is great for dry skin and leaves the skin moist, fresh, and smooth all day.</li>
            <li> Living in Arizona makes finding the correct moisturizing cream/lotion vital.  We both have dry skin and have found Nivea Smooth Sensation just what the name implies.  No greasy oily film..........only a nice smooth lubricated skin.</li>
            <li> Its thick and not the non volatile creams that are usually available. The non volatile creme, you should go for the white one. Love Nivea products.</li>
            <li> I really do feel like this is a steal.  I live in NYC and one bottle of this lotion normally cost me 10 bucks at the drugstore.  I can&#x27;t give this price alone nothing but 5 stars for 3 bottles.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion by far. I have dry skin and lotion after a shower is a must. It absorbs quickly (when used in reasonable quantities) and leaves skin silky soft. A bit greasy for my hands but perfect for all over body.</li>
            <li> My Wife loves the smell of this Nivea cream. She has used a variety of lotions, including ones from Bath &amp; Body Works, but this Nivea lotion is her favorite. Very smooth and easy to put on skin, without feeling sticky, and very calming smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the BEST lotion we have ever tried.</li>
            <li> I am a person with VERY dry skin and will appear ashy if lotion is not applied immediately after showering. This product keeps my skin looking moist and ASH FREE...</li>
            <li> Packaging poor, it was loose in a plastic bag, one of the lotions was opened probably from bumping around in the box with the other products I ordered. Lotion was all over the bottles, had to be wiped clean with wet and dry cloth, it was a mess after cleaning the bottle and reclosing the one that was open I was ok. Should have been more securely packaged. I did not sign up for that! The lotion itself is wonderful and was a great price.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin soft .&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it since a year. Would recommend this for dry skin. !!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this product was so much better than anything I have used in the past and especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nivea Smooth Sensation for years. It&#x27;s thick but absorbs quickly. I have very dry skin and this is the only lotion that I can use winter and summer. It&#x27;s a little pricey compared to other lotions you find in stores but I am willing to pay to have a bottle in nearly every room of the house and at my office desk because it really helps me. This product does have a nice scent but it does not bother my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother in law for Christmas and she loved it. I love the pricing because it was a great amount of product for the price and free shipping.</li>
            <li> This lotion is EXTREAMLY SMELLY, the girly smell to be precis, so be aware of that before you buy it.</li>
            <li> Make your skin softer, smoother, leave no sticky surface after use. I would definitely order again after finishing this batch.</li>
            <li> looked and felt real regardless of my friends comments</li>
            <li> Works great. Price is great</li>
            <li> I like this lotion because it has a very light fragrance, is absorbed well, and is not sticky.  It relieves dryness of the skin in a nice and mild way.  Have been using it for years and was worried that I wouldn&#x27;t like the new formulation, but it&#x27;s fine--can&#x27;t really tell the difference.</li>
            <li> I purchased this lotion primarily because of its inclusion of Shea Butter.  Also, the Nivea line was recommended by family. I have extremely dry skin and Shea Butter has been one of the few &#x27;natural&#x27; remedies that accommodates the needs of my skin; however, recently, my skin has become increasingly dry.  Consequently, I have been searching for products that have a culmination of ingredients that could work effectively together to moisturize my dry skin from the inside out. Surprisingly, this lotion accommodates my needs wonderfully...and I say &#x27;surprisingly&#x27; because I have tried many and various lotions, but to no avail (honestly).  However, after trying this lotion for the very first time, I noticed a great improvement in the elasticity of my skin, an improvement that increases with each use. So, I give this PRODUCT 5 STARS WITHOUT HESITATION...and I hope that if you do decide to try this product (which currently has the &#x27;subscribe and save&#x27; discount option), that you achieve the same results, if not better!</li>
            <li> very very smooth on skin, i wish the bottle was little more user friendly, no other complains so far , works for me</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t get the job done. Used it at night but by morning my skin felt SUPER dry still. Did not moisturize enough. BUT.... I like how it made my legs look shinny though after a nice shave</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nivea for years (15 at least) and never found a better body lotion although I try different ones periodically. I use this lighter version during warmer seasons and the very heavy one during winter. It&#x27;s amazingly smooth and easy to apply on the entire body. I usually have dry skin and no other creams help me restore the skin&#x27;s moisture instantly after a shower as Nivea does.</li>
            <li> I am a big a fan of Nivea. I&#x27;ve been using it since I was teenager either whitening lotion, regular lotion or bath foam. and until now it didn&#x27;t disappoint me. And specially living in a dry area needs a lotion that makes my skin smooth but not oily. and This one helps a lot. When I first moved here in December 2014, my skin start to dry and felt rough. But This product helped a lot and now my skin feels smooth. and by the way it takes 5 months for me to finish the 13.5 fluid ounce in a pack of 3. It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a lot of years and am glad to get it once again. I have loved the nivea brand products for quite a few years, but this one seems to be the best at this time.</li>
            <li> Nice texture to the lotion.  Great scent.  Wasn&#x27;t aware that I actually purchased 3 bottles, very good price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, creamy, and leaves my skin feeling smooth. When I&#x27;m with my boyfriend he always asks how how my  legs are so smooth.</li>
            <li> I bought this nivea lotion for dry skin because in the winter time my skin tends to get extremely dry and this lotion keeps my skin from drying out. This lotion keep my skin smooth and soft not only in winter but all year round. I think it is the shea butter and the vitimin E in the lotion , that works wonders on the skin. The lotion is fast absorbs and dont leave your skin feeling sticky and greasey. The texture is not thick and not watery, it is in the middle and feel just right on the skin. This lotion keeps my hands nice and soft, when I tell this work wonders on my skin, my skin is now baby soft and not ashy looking. I recommend this for anybody who want to have smooth and soft skin.</li>
            <li> OMG! Perfection! Makes my skin feel super soft and it&#x27;s very hydrating. Love it!</li>
            <li> I have been a Nivea loyalist for 30 years or so and always have loved the clean fragrance as well as the moisturizing effectiveness. I was excited to try their shea butter product as I really love the way shea butter smells and moisturizes. But the fragrance of their forumula is incredibly strong and \\&quot;perfumey\\&quot;. Definitely not a unisex product! I will be returning mine to Target and getting the traditional formula. Too bad: shea butter is so nice.</li>
            <li> Smells good but not overpowering.  It&#x27;s much less greasy than the Nivea Essentially Enriched lotion, which makes this one great for everyday but probably not great if your skin is very dry or rough.</li>
