            <li>Great stuff and the ladies seem to really like to fragrance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for more than 40 years.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Had to order me one more.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>New design bottle is attractive.  </li>
            <li>I was glad to see this mens fragrance available again.</li>

            <li>Fragrance does not seem to last as long as the original scent, it still smells exactly the same otherwise.</li>
            <li>I am truly surprised that Aramis would change the product without changing the name.</li>
            <li>Its either old or reformulated.</li>
            <li>smell it is not like old Aramis 900.</li>
            <li>It still has the same fragrance but seems watered down and not as \\&quot;aggressive\\&quot; as the original Aramis 900.</li>
            <li>It looses it&#x27;s &amp;#34;power&amp;#34; after the first half an hour.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great stuff and the ladies seem to really like to fragrance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been written before! Something has changed from the original Aramis 900 which I loved. It still has the same fragrance but seems watered down and not as \\&quot;aggressive\\&quot; as the original Aramis 900. I am truly surprised that Aramis would change the product without changing the name. This is potentially misleading to consumers who buy the same product (from an brand of international repute) because they want the same thing again - not something different.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for more than 40 years.&lt;br /&gt;I like it very much.&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit worried if I was going to get a fake product,&lt;br /&gt;but it wasn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s genuine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> I researched this product on the internet thoroughly  and couldn&#x27;t find the exact answer if it was still manufactured today. It looses it&#x27;s &amp;#34;power&amp;#34; after the first half an hour. I found and wore it religiously in the 1990&#x27;s. Back then I loved it so much because of the scent  and how long it lasted. Its either old or reformulated. It does not last &amp;#34;(  Oh well I tried.</li>
            <li> An older gentleman&#x27;s smell.</li>
            <li> I have had Aramis 900 before (some time ago) but this does not stay with you at all. You spray it on and it smells good but after or about couple hours you can hardly smell it.</li>
            <li> Fragrance does not seem to last as long as the original scent, it still smells exactly the same otherwise. white lightning</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 20 years, I an very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, great fragrance.</li>
            <li> smell it is not like old Aramis 900. it does not stay for long time.</li>
            <li> We got this for my father in law and he loved it- we loved the prompt service and the price!!  Keep up the good work and thank you  for making his bday special</li>
            <li> I used to get this product at the World Market whenever they had a coupon of $10 off for $30 purchase. Lately they did not send this coupon so often so I looked for other ways and found it here - better price and constant supply every 3 months, plus no gas expenses... Can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> I was glad to see this mens fragrance available again. Although I found it to be a little heavier than I remember it still had that fresh smell that made me call it the best mens cologne ever. Just a litle spray.</li>
            <li> Looked for years for this cologne finally found it. Had to order me one more. Love it.</li>
            <li> As advertised.  New design bottle is attractive.  The only reason it doesn&#x27;t get five stars is that Aramis no longer makes the After Shave version and the Eau de Cologne spray is now the only choice.  Fragrance is still just as good though - I get lots of compliments on it.</li>
            <li> I love it! I had it before</li>
            <li> all excellent, this is just what I was looking for and arrived sooner than expected, I recommend a 100 percent</li>
