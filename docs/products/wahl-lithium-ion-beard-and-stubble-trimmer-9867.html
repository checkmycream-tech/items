            <li>Great price that met the needs.</li>
            <li>But for trimming hair it works great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The reason for 4 stars and not 5 is that the body of the buzzer has a rubber coating on it which is great for the hand to keep a hold of it, but all the hair that you cut gets stuck all over the body of the trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for my husband and he said it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>This product work great  </li>
            <li>foil shaver is great.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s the power from the motor, but this foil shaver does a great job.</li>
            <li>That is a great feature for those days where the battery dies onyou before work</li>
            <li>So great long-life too.</li>
            <li>Great quality.</li>
            <li>Great value.</li>
            <li>Great shaver..........</li>

            <li>Wahl is a great brand.</li>
            <li>Great razor...</li>

            <li>The rest of it looks great.</li>
            <li>also it has great power</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>The trimmer itself works great</li>
            <li>but Wahl is a great brand.  </li>
            <li>Great battery life and power</li>
            <li>thing is great.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;VE HEARD GREAT THINGS ABOUT THE BRAND.  </li>
            <li>This thing holds a charge great, too.  </li>
            <li>As a beard trimmer, it&#x27;s great; but if I had it to do all over again, I&#x27;d have saved the money and just bought a trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>Great for \\&quot;whole\\&quot; body grooming.</li>
            <li>But this kit works great for trimming just about everywhere else if you&#x27;re not into gorilla-type body hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All in all this was a great purchase - $24.95 for what imo</li>

            <li>I ordered the part from www.wahl-store.com and inserted it into the handle (the battery operated thing) and the clippers work great now.</li>
            <li>Read great reviews on this trimmer but have had nothing but problems.</li>
            <li>great trimmer</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>Also great for pre trimming before shaving with a razor.</li>
            <li>Great price for a great product.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is great, the attachments and stand are not.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>Excellent Product, it works amazingly well</li>
            <li>It was a great investment</li>
            <li>Its a great trimmer, and all attachments work great with the exception of the shaver.</li>
            <li>Great trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Although gift hasn&#x27;t been opened, I&#x27;m happy to say it came in perfect condition, original box and packaging- which made me so happy!</li>
            <li>this is a very nice and functional trimmer with great attachments and it is made in the USA.</li>
            <li>Glad I bought it!!</li>
            <li>For trimming the edges of his beard, or hair elsewhere, this is a very nice trimmer.    </li>
            <li>This is a very nice trimmer for the price.  </li>
            <li>This is very nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a very nice trimmer.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a very nice shaver.</li>
            <li>It was very nice to see the comment from Wahl (below).</li>
            <li>This is a very nice trimmer.</li>
            <li>receommend highly!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>in all, a very good and nice looking trimmer.</li>
            <li>What an amazing convenience!</li>
            <li>This trimmer is amazing!</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>the good side it has a great battery life and its a workhorse.</li>
            <li>I love the power and the attachments, they all work perfectly.</li>
            <li>Outstanding response, and wonderful service.</li>
            <li>The trimmer works great and the close shaver gets surprisingly close.</li>
            <li>This is remarkably the trimmer men can get.</li>
            <li>The duel-foil attachment performs like most foil shavers- not that impressive.</li>
            <li>More incredibly, when it ran out of juice and tried to use it by plugging it, it would not run!</li>
            <li>I knew Wahl made good products, so combining them with Lithium batteries would be great.  </li>
            <li>nice quality!</li>
            <li>Nice job, Wahl!  </li>
            <li>a great one I got is as a gift for Christmas and my hubby loved it..</li>
            <li>Excellent Product, I am really pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is Made in the USA, the best, and so competitively priced!</li>
            <li>Not the best product out there for sure.</li>
            <li>Excellent product.. love the attachments  </li>
            <li>I like how handy this product is!</li>
            <li>great product at good price</li>
            <li>Works great and good price.</li>
            <li>Great product if you are looking for a good trimmer for your beard</li>
            <li>Trimmer is great, some good attachments.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Nice job of not changing a winner!</li>
            <li>Once it arrived I was even more impressed.  </li>
            <li>At best they lie on top of the tray, but not with any degree of security; one jostle and they&#x27;re scattered across your counter.</li>
            <li>With impeccable care?  </li>
            <li>My husband has had a mustache for about 10 years, and declared this the best and most efficient trimmer</li>
            <li>/&gt;In summary: a very nice trimmer showing that Wahl&#x27;s engineering is good</li>
            <li>The guides are easy to install and the device is an excellent trimmer between hair cuts and for eyebrows and cleaning up the neck.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is easily the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Easily the best trimmer I&#x27;ve used ever.</li>
            <li>Excellent battery life, with a very quick charge time.</li>
            <li>I have been extremely happy with this Wahl trimmer, and to top it off, it is Made In America by U.S. workers!</li>
            <li>great trimmer,even better price and customer support,cant beat wahl!</li>
            <li>very good trimmer and now has even more options.</li>
            <li>This machine works great and it has an amazing battery life.</li>
            <li>The stand it good</li>
            <li>I have good experience with purchase</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a rechargeable trimmer for a couple of years that was doing a good job, but I was noticing the recharge life was getting shorter and shorter, then the charger died.</li>
            <li>The rubber grip feels good in the hand, and with the attachements you get with it, you can trim every place on your body.</li>
            <li>The box was not in good condition.</li>
            <li>, it would be fair to guess that I may have received a defective trimmer.  </li>
            <li>A fair trade-off in my book.  </li>
            <li>The handle made of something that doesn&#x27;t feel so good and hair stick to it</li>
            <li>Wahl is a really good brand.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise it was a good product.</li>
            <li>I keep them all in the tray on my countertop and it works fairly well.</li>
            <li>It was a good one</li>
            <li>not as good as the norelco but a good buy nonetheless...</li>
            <li>Good accessories.  </li>
            <li>Does a good job on trimming beards etc.  </li>
            <li>I have NEVER had good luck when it comes to these types of razors.</li>
            <li>it is a good deal, and it travels well.</li>
            <li>It gives a good trim, but on durability, I give it a ONE star.</li>
            <li>Will soon learn how good Wahle&#x27;s customer service is.</li>
            <li>He loved it and kept telling me how good it was, so I purchased one for myself.  </li>
            <li>Good value for the money.  </li>
            <li>Surprisingly he received the gift Christmas eve</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it is a good trimmer.</li>
            <li>When it worked it was good</li>
            <li>It is a good trimmers with lots of options for variety of purposes.</li>
            <li>This is a good trimmer when it was working.</li>
            <li>Father&#x27;s Day gift for good ol pops.</li>
            <li>Feels good in the hand.</li>
            <li>I loved the way the lightweight trimmer felt in my hand.  </li>
            <li>Good for 5 years.</li>
            <li>It cuts well and looks good.  </li>
            <li>Also the blades were rusting even though I took good care of them.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a goatee for going on 15 years now, so I&#x27;ve been through my fair share of trimmers/detailers.</li>
            <li>This is good for trimming a beard and stuff like that.</li>
            <li>is a good beard and body trimmer - four star.</li>
            <li>after warranty, mail the problem piece to them and they will fix or replace at fair</li>
            <li>However I decided to increase the rating as the company made good on replacing the item with a brand-new boxed Wahl Lithium Ion Trimmer.</li>
            <li>It was good when it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>,it is deffinately a good product and would recomend to any one looking for a good trimmer service and delivery was prompt</li>
            <li>good product.</li>
            <li>Was good when it worked...after 4 months of use it quit working</li>
            <li>These clippers are well built, versatile, good features &amp; dependable</li>
            <li>Wahl has a good trimmer that just needs some refinements.  </li>
            <li>Wahl doesn&#x27;t have good customer service or warranty return service and their web site support is a joke.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good buzzer itself, just the battery is a POS.  </li>
            <li>Like I said, works good while it lasts...</li>
            <li>WAHL Lithium-Ion All in One Trimmer is a reasonably good all-in-one trimmer.</li>
            <li>There is no cover for it or a travel bag, which would have been the most ideal solution.</li>
            <li>Fair price.</li>
            <li>However that&#x27;s good as they are clipper attachments for those who shave their hair.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, when you&#x27;re finished just give the trimmer you&#x27;re using a good blow of air to get the hair out</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re using a good blow of air to get the hair out</li>
            <li>Son loved it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It did good when it did work</li>
            <li>It has a good variety of attachments.  </li>
            <li>This will be put to good use around our household.</li>
            <li>yu have to keep changing out the blades to get a good close cut.</li>
            <li>It was a good trimmer</li>
            <li>Good product and compact design.</li>
            <li>Good quality for a good price.</li>
            <li>Probably good hygiene anyways.</li>
            <li>I chose the Wahl Power Pro corded trimmer as my replacement model, because I didn&#x27;t have a good experience with the battery version.</li>
            <li>I notched my review up one star because of the good customer support.</li>
            <li>Fair price.</li>
            <li>Then how good it works.</li>
            <li>Has met all my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;- Good battery life;&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Bought this trimmer for my boyfriend, he charged it once in February and has used it fairly often.</li>
            <li>This is a really good trimmer comes with a lot of attachments.</li>
            <li>Has good battery life.</li>
            <li>I thought the Wahl all in 1 trimmer was a good choice for me since I have plenty of nose and ear hair.</li>
            <li>Good luck finding one made in the USA.</li>
            <li>good shave to some with peach fuzz for hair.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>Good buy in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Good for you</li>
            <li>Good but works on electricity 110</li>
            <li>Seems to work good, and have a number of components to use with it.  </li>
            <li>* Battery life, while it must be guessed at, is nevertheless quite good.    </li>
            <li>Loved the accessories that came with it.</li>
            <li>, the attachments seem to be in good condition, and it works well.</li>
            <li>I waited for 8 months to write this review so that I could give it a fair assessment</li>
            <li>Runs fantastic and cuts great!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairly knowledgeable when it comes to electronics and battery technology and assumed the battery&#x27;s safety mechanism got tripped so it would no longer charge.</li>
            <li>The functionality of this trimmer is good.  </li>
            <li>Good product/ good price</li>
            <li>Otherwise good power.</li>
            <li>This may or may not be a good thing.</li>
            <li>Great for beards and hair of any kind.</li>
            <li>This clipper set is of good quality.</li>
            <li>A good buy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always known Wahl as a good company, but hadn&#x27;t used any of their products.</li>
            <li>The product I received matched the description and was a good price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good if you are on a budget.</li>
            <li>I wont lie, its a good clipper for what I need it for.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a good beard/head trimmer.</li>

            <li>It worked good for while.</li>
            <li>My son loved this gift.</li>
            <li>It would also be good to have some sort of indicator lights to show if it is charging or needs charging.  </li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>Works really good</li>
            <li>The idea of Interchangeable heads is great but dont get the Idea just because it is Lithium Ion Battery that is has alot of power but inorder for trimmers to be effective</li>
            <li>Trims great, stays charged, and I&#x27;ve honestly had no problems with the blade clips staying in place (and on the blade.)</li>

            <li>I guess I could have been more successful by unscrewing it and reassembling it,</li>
            <li>The recipients love them!</li>
            <li>So many attachments and uses, all without wires!</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t exactly sure what kind of trimmer to order my boyfriend, but he loves it!</li>

            <li>/&gt;Conclusion: I love this razor!</li>
            <li>This \\&quot;new\\&quot; trimmer is so much better than the Wahl it replaced!</li>
            <li>for sure!</li>
            <li>I have been extremely satisfied with this product; it does what it needs to do, but the battery holds its charge sooooo well!</li>
            <li>BUT - this is a throw away piece, one in which Wahl did not intend the user to ever be able to change the battery!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re willing to do all of this, then it&#x27;s a great trimmer!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>the most aggravating thing was it kept pulling the hairs from my chin (OUCH!)</li>
            <li>The Lithium Ion batteries are so much better!  </li>
            <li>i am completely satisfied with this product!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>Wahl Corp. Love it!</li>

            <li>Strong and great battery life.</li>
            <li>Feels great in your hands and easy to use.  </li>

            <li>It looks really nice and there are so many attachments!  </li>
            <li>The shaver adapter doesnt trim great but does work fine if ur in a pinch.</li>
            <li>Found all were very good with a quality, powerful power unit to run them all.  </li>
            <li>but &amp;#34;all&amp;#34; of the pieces included for trimming a beard are excellent, including the actual trimming razor...  Very pleased!</li>
            <li>Battery life on this is amazing.</li>
            <li>The Wahl LiIon is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Just as important, the teeth are close together &amp; I experienced no grabbing of skin or hair.    </li>
            <li>This product performed great for 7 months, with being used about 5-6 times a month for light trimming.  </li>
            <li>The unit is amazing, I&#x27;ve had mine awhile,maybe 2 months, I&#x27;ve charged it once.</li>
            <li>Its amazing.</li>
            <li>An amazing product.</li>
            <li>The number of accessories that come with this is amazing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;it is amazing .</li>
            <li>works amazingly well for all shaving /trimming needs</li>
            <li>The attachments it came with all seem to work great with the exception of one: the close rolling razor attachment doesn&#x27;t really fit well into the trimmer, and doesn&#x27;t shave close anyway.</li>
            <li>It has an amazing battery life and it trims well.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my boyfriend and when he used it it did a great job and gave him a close shave leaving him with a baby smooth face.</li>
            <li>Amazing value.</li>
            <li>The shaver doesn&#x27;t do that great of a job, but I like having all of the attachments and the fact that the set is so compact, which is important for my travel needs.</li>
            <li>Wahl has amazing customer service.  </li>
            <li>It was amazing.</li>
            <li>The battery life on this is amazing.</li>
            <li>The battery life of this trimmer is amazing.</li>
            <li>There are an amazing variety of attachments.  </li>
            <li>Just with the trimmer it is an amazing deal.</li>
            <li>This trimmer has worked amazingly since day one.</li>
            <li>The battery life is amazing as well.</li>
            <li>Battery life seems amazing to me.</li>
            <li>amazing thing -</li>
            <li>it may not be your choice as a primary tool but would be great for styling.</li>
            <li>I used it to trim and shave my beard and to clip my head, the battery is amazing.</li>
            <li>It felt very &amp;#34;weak&amp;#34; and not the best quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shaver has a nice grip.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>It comes with a ton of attachments so you can trim everything up nicely.  </li>
            <li>To each his own.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Although lacking an adjustable trimmer attachment, this device is still an excellent trimmer, with a rock solid motor and great battery.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Compare this to the norelco and make your own decisions based on the features.</li>
            <li>His beard is nice and tidy and he is not a man that will not tolerate a crappy piece of equipment.</li>
            <li>It is nice to have your oil and brush</li>
            <li>WAHL is making the BEST and most POWERFUL rechargeable all in one groomer</li>
            <li>Thanks for the great deal!</li>
            <li>(Who uses this where there is no outlet handy?)  </li>
            <li>Nice product all the way around.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely the greatest clippers I have ever purchased.  </li>
            <li>I cut my own hair and it takes me about 40 - 45 minutes, this because I also trim my bread.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s nice, maybe they&#x27;ll get used sometime.</li>
            <li>, it was way shorter than I would have liked (almost a buzz cut).  </li>
            <li>Shame because I really liked this product.</li>
            <li>The clippers are nice but the kit came with a bunch of attachments that I didn&#x27;t need.  </li>
            <li>Concerning the comments of those who choose to nitpick what they perceive as shortcomings -- perhaps the comments of those who shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to own mechanical devices of any kind -- this is my take on that criticism.</li>
            <li>Wahl trimmers don&#x27;t look as nice as the Conair line of beard trimmers.</li>
            <li>Wahl includes a nice array of trimmers and guides.</li>
            <li>This is a nice machine.  </li>
            <li>Purchase at your own risk.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m the kind of buyer that does hours of research on a product before I make my decision and for those of you that just started looking</li>
            <li>I own</li>
            <li>I own</li>
            <li>It holds everything this time, but for me it would be nice if the tray had the charging adapter built into the bottom of the trimmer holder.  </li>
            <li>It holds everything this time, but for me it would be nice if the tray had the charging adapter built into the bottom of the trimmer holder.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m honestly blown away with this trimmer.</li>
            <li>I own both this and PHILIPS Norelco G370.</li>

            <li>I can pull each whisker out with tweezers on my own, if that&#x27;s what I want to do.  </li>
            <li>It would have been nice if it came with a bag to keep all the do dads together.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really understand why this one got reviewed as the best shaver by wirecutter.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and he loves it so much its the best one I have ever seen</li>
            <li>I bought this for my son and he liked it.  </li>
            <li>I was so thrilled because my poodle now looks like a fussy ball</li>
            <li>The tray is handy and I&#x27;ve had it for over a month now, use it twice a week</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s awesome and really makes shaving</li>
            <li>The good: a powerful cutter, great battery.    </li>
            <li>To be honest they didn&#x27;t even work well before they broke.</li>
            <li>Straight up best mechine</li>
            <li>It has all sorts of accessories and feels nice in your hand.</li>
            <li>, taht come handy.</li>
            <li>I liked the product and would buy it again.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this razor and look forward to using it because of how good of a job it does.</li>

            <li>The attachments are a nice addition.  </li>
            <li>This seems to be a nice unit.</li>
            <li>it work&#x27;s so nice that I had to buy me another set.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a cost effective trimmer, get a Wahl like this one.</li>
            <li>does NOT hold accessories effectively (</li>
            <li>The cordless lithium ion is a nice feature.</li>
            <li>I think he&#x27;s really going to like it :D</li>
            <li>lithium-ion battery life is astounding for a unit like this.</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>So i purchased it as I shave my own head, have a beard i trim and have nose hair.</li>
            <li>The stand is nice lots of adapters</li>
            <li>Purchased as gift for my son who reported that it is NICE.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to wet/dry shaving accouterments, so kind of a head slap moment.</li>
            <li>Nice size for your hand</li>
            <li>Also, I feel that it is nice to see that there is still something made in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Now the stand has a nice weight, and stays where I put it.  </li>
            <li>Now everything fits nice and neat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a battery life indicator would be a nice add on</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have a rubber grip but just change the type of rubber</li>
            <li>Nice for traveling, and home use.  </li>
            <li>cut my own Hair</li>
            <li>Nice design&lt;br</li>
            <li>The fine-toothed blades are also nice to keep you skin from getting as irritated if at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve use a buddy T blade clippers before on my face and It came out so nice</li>
            <li>Have done my own head-shaving for years now.</li>

            <li>Also in the manual it describes the handy rotary nose hair trimmer</li>
            <li>I used to own a Panasonic beard and moustache trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Nice grip and cut like it was supposed to.</li>
            <li>Carry case would be nice, considering this was not the cheapest trimmer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Holding tray doesn&#x27;t hold everything as nicely as the picture.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shopping on and off for one of these for some time, and the Wahl is quite nice.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I had looked at a number of devices, and the two that stood out to me were this one and the Remington.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s is a great trimmer for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Very powerful</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and the caddy is handy and keeps all the accessories organized!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this on Amazon at a great price.</li>
            <li>Got his to keep my beard neat and clean and it is great.  </li>
            <li>A nice carrying case instead of a cheap plastic tray would be nice!  </li>
            <li>so I am very happy with the product and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>It is high quality and does a superb job of keeping his beard tamed.</li>
            <li>Great product, easy to use, but did not come with attachments that was pictured, I was looking for a product that would cover my grooming needs, thought this was it, but now I&#x27;ll need to order more attachments.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many for body and beard, and this is my very favorite.</li>
            <li>Amazingly, I have not recharged the unit since my review and it&#x27;s still going strong!</li>
            <li>The ergonomics are very good --it is comfortable, compact, and light.  </li>
            <li>I am impressed with this new shaver.  </li>
            <li>Works Great, seems like Pro Quality and most important - does the job.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This won&#x27;t be replacing my corded Wahl, but it&#x27;s great for a quick touch-up type job.</li>
            <li>best mechine ever that i use ,stronge and yet gentle, i 100% suticfied ,i love it,recomend to everybody</li>

            <li>the screws and holes are not well made and this item is very easy to break.  </li>
            <li>this thing is very strong.</li>
            <li>He said it is very strong and works well.</li>
            <li>Also, it is very easy to shape your beard.</li>
            <li>The blades will get clogged very easily.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to switch out the attachments that it comes with.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use and keeps a charge.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use</li>

            <li>Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!</li>
            <li>And they just keep getting better and better!</li>
            <li>Great Item, very consistent, baterry never finishes</li>
            <li>Very nice unit and a great upgrade from my old Wahl.  </li>
            <li>Easily the best and most powerful I&#x27;ve used..</li>
            <li>The good:  - Strong motor with excellent battery performance (6 months old).  </li>
            <li>This trimmer is great at first,  but they have a battery problem!  </li>
            <li>very good beard trimmers trim very closely.</li>
            <li>I love the razor, very smooth, very quality and battery is SOOO great!  </li>
            <li>It cuts very smoothly and is a good, easy size to handle.</li>
            <li>So far I am extremely impressed with this trimmer.</li>
            <li>Wahl is by far the best I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>It has been by far the best trimmer I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>and I have no doubt it&#x27;s the best electric for the price by far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how much better this trimmer is compared to the NiCad Wahl version.  </li>
            <li>I have tried just about every manufactures trimmer and this one by far is the best.</li>
            <li>Eventually, after many minutes of use, some of the cutters will become warm.</li>
            <li>Well, my doubts were completely baseless - this trimmer is a wolf in sheep&#x27;s clothing with impressive performance.  </li>
            <li>Nice shaver and more attachments than I need.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect to be able to do any kind of hair styling with this thing.</li>
            <li>By far the best trimmer I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li>This thing is awesome and powerful and more importantly for me</li>
            <li>and I can truly say the Wahl Lithium Ion is by far the best.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is light and has good power.  </li>
            <li>I am also pleased with the Detailer head, and thrilled with Dual Shaver!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This thing is amazing, I have been using it for many months and it does wonders.</li>
            <li>Three months into use and so far excellent!</li>
            <li>Dependability and the brand are excellent, gives me the close edge and professional look</li>
            <li>I have used Norelco and Remington beard trimmers, but this Wahl is the best by far.  </li>
            <li>In fact, I was able to effectively shave with it.</li>
            <li>I can get many trims from one charge, which is really nice.</li>
            <li>That would sure be nice.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer is by far the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I purchased this to replace an old trimmer that I used to trim my beard and mustash, It works excellent.</li>
            <li>It has so many ways to it make your own.</li>
            <li>I found that a cheap 30 cent toothbrush removed it fairly easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so far this is the best trimmer I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li>It is certainly worth the money for this great tool.</li>
            <li>I keep this in the medicine cabinet, but still...if I can&#x27;t really fit the pieces in it, what good is it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>An excellent trimmer, as far as how it cuts.</li>
            <li>Since that is not why I bought it, I would rate it good at its primary purpose.</li>
            <li>Appears to be good quality (does not seem to be cheaply made)</li>
            <li>Gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because it might not be a good fit for my beard.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned!  </li>
            <li>This product is of great worth for its price...</li>
            <li>and attractive, easy to carry during travelling, light weight.&lt;br /&gt;Above</li>
            <li>and attractive, easy to carry during travelling, light weight.&lt;br /&gt;Above</li>
            <li>The attachments are easy to change and fit great.</li>
            <li>Pros: powerful motor; efficient blades; quick switch on attachments; excellent charging time and usage&lt;</li>
            <li>Quick charge, good power, nice attachments.  </li>
            <li>and this blade is a very fine cut........</li>
            <li>My dog has very fine Hair...</li>
            <li>Saved a bunch of money on this and it was delivered very quickly!  </li>
            <li>The motor is STRONG!</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought the Philips Norelco G370 All-in-1 Grooming System, which I think is also excellent with a GREAT battery life, but the blade on that one is NOT near as fine as the one on the Wahl trimmer........</li>
            <li>I have owned many trimmers through out the years and this is by far the best I have come across yet.</li>
            <li>I am pleased to report that as a head shaver/trimmer it is amazing and probably better than my corded Wahl I have had for years.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Feels good in your hand, well balanced and sturdy, not like a cheap, plastic contraption like so many others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Good, light , multi use , many choices .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many trimmers and this have the best power and battery life by far.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and so much better without a cord.</li>
            <li>excellent detail capability, lots of blade and comb options, which are easy to change with a flip of the thumb - I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>This is a great tool and a very reasonable price for what you are buying.  </li>
            <li>but when u know its easy, looks like the baterry its the better!,</li>
            <li>Way more options and attachments that I should ever need, but once I found the right settings it works great.</li>
            <li>Great beard trimmer and even does a pretty close shave.  </li>
            <li>However it works great and has worked exactly as I have desired it to.</li>
            <li>Worked great at first.</li>
            <li>My eyesight isn&#x27;t that great first thing.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for at a great price.</li>
            <li>A great started kit for someone who is growing their beard for the first time.</li>
            <li>The unit worked great for the first couple weeks.</li>
            <li>worked great the first time.</li>
            <li>The trimmer works great and was exactly what it was advertised as.</li>
            <li>In summary, it is not a bad trimmer and is offered at good price.</li>
            <li>is a good buy for someone who has shape and trim GoaTee&#x27;s or Full Beards.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The comb attachments fit securely and, when used with the trimming blade, do a beautiful, easy job.  </li>
            <li>It attaches to the trimmer head very securely, and holds its setting very securely too.</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>the rubberized covering on the handle, while very comfortable to grip, is like a magnet for the hair clippings.  </li>
            <li>Very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>This model is very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>very very very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>This is very important because if you&#x27;ve ever used a battery powered nose trimmer when the battery is going, you KNOW that when the battery starts to go, hair gets pulled instead of cut.</li>
            <li>[Update after 6 months of use: The stickyness wears off, leaving a very comfortable, non-slip grip.</li>
            <li>The trimmers&#x27; slim design was very comfortable in my hand and gave me the control to produce an even trim.</li>
            <li>Very light in weight too.</li>
            <li>is very light and maneuverable.</li>
            <li>item works great, holds great charge nice and sharp</li>
            <li>etc, work great, long time between charges,feels great in your hand.</li>
            <li>and it also is suitable for trimming a more creative cuts.</li>
            <li>It looks like plenty of people here have had a good experience with this trimmer while some have not been so lucky.</li>
            <li>The interchangable heads are nice and change out easily.  </li>
            <li>Why Remington for $10 10 years ago managed to give a nice strong box for the trimmer I had</li>
            <li>The shaver head is good, it makes a quick and close shave.</li>
            <li>Nice trimmer setup, easy to use and change over from one setup to another.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer fits nicely in your hand and it is easy to manipulate.</li>
            <li>Shipped quick and looks like a good quality product even though my husband hasn&#x27;t used it just yet.</li>
            <li>quick everything about this piece is really good .</li>
            <li>So it looks like I&#x27;m out of luck on this one, but it had a pretty good run until my own clumsiness did it in.</li>
            <li>I like about this trimmer is the compact size, the excellent battery life (and quick recharge time), as well as the large selection of trimmer blades and guards.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Likes: is very powerful &amp;#34;) , no hair pulling, great grip, easy and quick charging, good build quality for price, great for shaping and fine tuning esp.</li>
            <li>They do offer an accessory that gives you multiple height setting which is not the best, but other wise I am very happy I splurged a bit.</li>
            <li>Was very happy to find it available new.</li>
            <li>Except the attachments for trimming your hair to a certain length, aren&#x27;t so great.  </li>
            <li>far the charge seems to be holding very good.</li>
            <li>The battery life on this trimmer is so far outstanding, and the quality of the trimmer itself seems very good.</li>
            <li>Hasn&#x27;t snagged or pulled at all yet like many do.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally I throw it in my trash  :)</li>
            <li>I read many of the reviews and I decided to give this trimmer a try.</li>
            <li>i love it its lion</li>
            <li>A better design could keep it more simple&lt;br /&gt;Standard</li>
            <li>It was okay while it lasted, but for the amount I used it, it should have lasted a lot longer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve known the Wahl name for many years because my barbers have used them.</li>
            <li>The heads interchange perfectly, once you get the hang of it, and feel very solid.</li>
            <li>Love the fact it can be used without the cord.  </li>
            <li>I hope yours works better than mine.</li>
            <li>and that is the reason for the better power.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a cordless personal trimmer and Wahl has a reputation for being some of the best hair trimmers on the market</li>
            <li>i would have thought Wahl would be better then</li>
            <li>But for 30 bucks I find it to be an outstanding value and have no problems justifying its purchase.</li>
            <li>I agree, like most trimmers of this sort</li>
            <li>It cuts better than the Norelco because it has more power.  </li>
            <li>This is better than Philips.</li>
            <li>The improvement has made my life better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s convenient and comes with more attachments than I&#x27;ll ever need in this lifetime.</li>
            <li>I also believe it&#x27;ll be much more durable than the cheapo shaver I bought some years ago.</li>
            <li>This one took a bit more work</li>
            <li>One thing is for sure, I will never buy WAHL again.</li>
            <li>I somehow learned to settle with the results, though mostly by cleaning up the beard with a pair of scissors after.  </li>
            <li>As for the accessories: I kept the six-position Guide, Dual Shaver, Precious Detailer, and the Clipper Blade.  </li>
            <li>Had my hair trimmed with it for more than a year.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Although the battery choice is excellent, and the cutters are solid, the flaws in this device lie with the accessories.  </li>
            <li>Many cuts between charges.  </li>
            <li>could have written a better manual, better describing how to change blades.  </li>
            <li>shaving attachment is rather amazing, and useful, but don&#x27;t expect the kind of close shave that a dedicated Norelco will give.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I found this trimmer while searching the internet.  </li>
            <li>I had another clipper before this that was much better that I would have kept if it wasnt for TSA smashing my bag.</li>
            <li>Low charge time and accuracy are excellent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this trimmer a couple of months now, and really love it.</li>
            <li>This trimmer attachment does a much better job than those, and is faster.</li>
            <li>In sum - it&#x27;s outstanding for moustache/ear/nose trimming as well as shaping your beard or hair at the edges.</li>
            <li>The blades are well-machined, and the battery life is phenomenal.</li>
            <li>This is an outstanding product.</li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>plus glad I purchased it.                                      </li>
            <li>But for the price I am pleased.</li>
            <li>I have never been able to trim all my body hair</li>
            <li>DO NOT PAY MORE, DON&#x27;T LET THE PACKAGING HYPE FOOL YOU.  </li>
            <li>The Norelco groomers were much better</li>
            <li>The razor worked OK while it was operational, but OK is all I can say.</li>
            <li>Got this for my bf for christmas, im sure he will like it</li>
            <li>he will have more options</li>
            <li>So consider the #1 more like #.75 and the #2 more like a #1.5.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be better off with a plug-in model, but they don&#x27;t seem to exist in this convenient size.</li>
            <li>Like most products</li>
            <li>I never saw anything like this, this product would be a perfect travel companion, many time I&#x27;ve traveled and have to take two different clippers and there chargers and</li>
            <li>I really love this item.</li>
            <li>There are too many pieces.  </li>
            <li>I miss the adjustable trim guard that one had, but this unit provides greater on time and more flexibility with the assortment of heads.  </li>
            <li>I also like the feel in my hand; I appear to have better control.</li>
            <li>Invest in something better.  </li>
            <li>, that was so nice,very pleased with the order.</li>
            <li>My husband loved it, worth every penny bought at christmas &amp; yet never had to charge</li>
            <li>It is much better than the garbage trimmer I bought at Marshall&#x27;s for $10 a year ago.</li>
            <li>This shaver comes with more attachments than I will use.</li>
            <li>but after 3 uses it has not been able to hold a charge.</li>
            <li>and this is much better than the 1st one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it being knocked off a counter top onto a marble floor (this was about the 5th time in the course of 2 years</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s more consumer-focused.</li>
            <li>It ran better than everyone&#x27;s electrical ones.</li>
            <li>I cut many heads on one charge.</li>
            <li>Read the #1 Most Helpful Customer Review entitled, \\&quot;All</li>
            <li>Well\\&quot; By  D. R. Jeanclerc for more info.</li>
            <li>It charges fast, and works great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used various trimmer types but this is the best of them all.</li>
            <li>overall excellent product save for the foil shaver accessory.</li>
            <li>but when it works....it is my favorite rechargeable unit.</li>
            <li>The power unit is outstanding.</li>
            <li>Comes with more stuff than I needed.</li>
            <li>Almost too many parts and pieces.</li>
            <li>I cannot find a trimmer that does a better job.</li>
            <li>Too many attachments</li>
            <li>Instructions do not cover the purpose of most of the attachments.&lt;br /&gt;-  </li>
            <li>I love it,</li>
            <li>The motor seems to have significantly more power than its predecessor at our house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Unless you are planning a career as a traveling beard stylist, a six-position trimmer guide and 3 fixed-length attachment combs is probably going to be more than you will ever need.  </li>
            <li>Two words -- \\&quot;razor stubble\\&quot; -- in close contact with your most tender areas should be explanation enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fortunately, many women love it also.</li>
            <li>I currently own a Braun rechargeable foil shaver, &amp; neither provides me a skin smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I called asking about the nose trimming attachment, and they sent me one for free!</li>
            <li>When it comes to Wahl, MADE IN AMERICA means, GIVE US MORE MONEY BECAUSE WE SOLD</li>
            <li>Pleased with everything I bought</li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t be fooled; Wahl trimmers work better.</li>
            <li>This model seems to have plenty of power and came with more fancy accessories than I&#x27;ll ever need.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how anyone could ask for more.    </li>
            <li>To charge the trimmer it must be plugged in with the supplied charger which is one more thing that must be stored with this unit.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t bother with the accessories, better off buying a foil and rotary separate for that close face shave.</li>
            <li>Much to my surprise, this trimmer works great.</li>
            <li>OK, the plastic clip-on attachments aren&#x27;t all good, but a few of them are perfect.  </li>
            <li>It would be nice if it had a charging indicator light on it.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t have to worry about it dying on my when I needed it the most.  </li>
            <li>it really kicks in with great satisfaction and gives the impression that it will do the job.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the wireless feature because my apt bathroom has no outlets.</li>
            <li>Better off keeping them in a sandwich size ziploc bag.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in the market for something better.    </li>
            <li>It would be much better if it came with a closing storage case.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use more of the included oil</li>
            <li>Most men I know don&#x27;t have the patience to use it.   </li>
            <li>You have to make the jump to over $50 to get a better unit imho.</li>
            <li>But overall, an excellent unit with a five year warranty.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure everyone tried it, and it worked \\&quot;OK\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>If you want a quality trimmer you&#x27;re going to have to spend more money.</li>
            <li>Wonderful trimmer with numerous attachments.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased with the shaver attachment, which did do a close shave.     </li>
            <li>Many attachments to trim/sculpt hair.</li>
            <li>Love all the attachments and the power it has.  </li>
            <li>Built sturdy love the coreless.</li>
            <li>Cuts better and closer than the Pro Glide.</li>
            <li>- It would be a better haircut tool with an adjustable comb for the widest cutter head.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not mechanical enough to do that, I suggest go buy another product and hope for the best.</li>
            <li>Mostly the electric ones.&lt;br /&gt;Bought these to use as a beard trimmer once a week.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and he loves it uses it quite often :)</li>
            <li>and I am quite pleased.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re okay with always using one of these lengths, this trimmer is probably leaps and bounds ahead of any competition.  </li>
            <li>It worked better than the pet clippers I have</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t hold a charge for more than 2mins or so.  </li>
            <li>For 30$, I&#x27;d expect more than 4mnths use -</li>
            <li>Have had it a couple of months now, and it&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>More attachments than I need, but I can&#x27;t complain.  </li>
            <li>I love this shaver and all it&#x27;s attachments.</li>
            <li>Too many attachments</li>
            <li>The battery no longer accepts a charge for more than five minutes, so I have to use them for five minutes, then wait 10 minutes for them to recharge.  </li>
            <li>I believe the tray to hold all of the components could have been better designed.</li>
            <li>and this is a better trimmer than both in terms of power and versatility.</li>
            <li>Says it is so much better</li>
            <li>I bought more cutter blades thinking that would work.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for 5 - 6 months now and am satisfied with features and quality.</li>
            <li>(Here, I&#x27;ll also note that on the front of my unit - where the rubber meets the plastic - the upper edge of the rubber doesn&#x27;t perfectly align with the bottom edge of the plastic.</li>
            <li>I sure hope this feature keeps working for years to come.</li>
            <li>If so, then, it&#x27;ll definitely be a winning feature, in my book.&lt;br</li>

            <li>I don&#x27;t know what y&#x27;all use to trim your facial hair, but Wahl&#x27;s Lithium Ion Clipper is the best.</li>
            <li>and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Not a biggie, as with this one I was able to figure it out, but I can see some people not realizing that the front of the trimmer storage area is for storing a blade/shaver head.  </li>
            <li>This is a great trimmer for the \\&quot;semi-pro\\&quot; in you, that wants to have that chiseled look, and control body hair all over.  </li>

            <li>Example say you shave your sides with a number 4 and the top with a number 2.  </li>
            <li>the foil cutter cuts my stubble better than a $90 brawn i bought or a $200 Phillips norelco trimmer I returned.</li>
            <li>my husband love this trimmer.</li>
            <li>There are better options out there, avoid this one.</li>
            <li>and it seems to cut better -perhaps</li>
            <li>&amp; I love how It makes me look.</li>
            <li>The attachments leave a lot more to be desired.</li>
            <li>This model has a body made mostly from plastic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nicely shaped rubber handle provides a sturdy, precise feel.  </li>
            <li>As others have stated, there are a lot of attachments, almost too many.  :)</li>
            <li>Trimmer is ok.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s also stylish and sleek, if that matters to you.</li>
            <li>another excellent product from wahl - i&#x27;ve come to only trust wahl for my shaving needs.</li>
            <li>Make sure you look for the lithium ion description when you order.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;- an indicator light to show battery is being charged would be nice</li>
            <li>better instruction manual</li>
            <li>Whatever Vibraty razor and shaved myself much better and faster.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I love this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I find it works better</li>
            <li>You can pick up a spray can of blade lubricant for a couple bucks at most stores.</li>
            <li>I love using this to keep my body hair in check</li>
            <li>Cuts OK, but the battery checked out after two years.</li>
            <li>but they were selling it for $20 more at the time in store and $15 more on the website.</li>
            <li>Love it love it love it.</li>
            <li>Also, the fact that they&#x27;re cordless makes it much more convenient to use.  </li>
            <li>Clipper are OK, however they do not come with all the attachments listed in the instructions/description.  </li>
            <li>My husband and son both love this.</li>
            <li>the rubberized handle holds static and so hair sticks to it.  </li>
            <li>I can confidently tell you that this trimmer works WAY better:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>It cuts better and has a better blade.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has WAY more features.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>Seems more durable.</li>
            <li>all its MADE IN USA product not MADE IN CHINA which makes it more superior.&lt;br</li>
            <li>just want men to be aware of this remarkable product&lt;</li>
            <li>all its MADE IN USA product not MADE IN CHINA which makes it more superior.&lt;br</li>
            <li>just want men to be aware of this remarkable product&lt;</li>
            <li>I have used most all of them at some point.  </li>
            <li>and I could not ask for more.  </li>
            <li>I love the battery life and charging time.</li>
            <li>I used the nose hair detailer once and was quite satisfied.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>- Many attachments</li>
            <li>I was able to get in</li>
            <li>Love the charging time and the use between charges.  </li>
            <li>but I did expect more than one year from the trimmer.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s an excellent value.</li>
            <li>I absolutely in love with it.</li>
            <li>3rd WAHL trimmer and the best one yet.</li>
            <li>Love the power the lithium ion battery provides.</li>
            <li>I have had this for many months now.  </li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>have had this trimmer for a month and it is an acceptable value for the money; however I&#x27;m going to return it because it causes more frustration that it is worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worked ok... Died after 6 months with usage maybe two times per week</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t remember ever having a better customer service experience!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What I really love about this purchase is the battery life on the shaver.  </li>
            <li>If these parts are provided it seems that the manufacturer would provide a better holding tray for their product.  </li>
            <li>I love everything about this trimmer... except</li>
            <li>This trimmer is powerful and did a good job at trimming.</li>
            <li>Oh and btw lithium battery is light and lasts forever!  </li>
            <li>the battery died within a week, and was no longer able to hold a charge.  </li>
            <li>Cant believe you can get a nice trimmer like this for a cheap price........</li>
            <li>I am a huge electric buzzer/trimmer kind of guy.</li>
            <li>If it was just a bit more durable, I would give it a 5-star rating, but for the price I guess you do get what you pay for in terms of longevity.</li>
            <li>Good and useful</li>
            <li>Lithium batteries are much better in this type of application and should outlast the rest of the trimmer.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Look, I know that there are probably better trimmers out there, but they can&#x27;t come close to this price.  </li>
            <li>love this product, I&#x27;ve recommended it to all my family and friends, and if it ever dies, I will buy another Wahl.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use most of these attachments, but I do like the attachment approach instead of the adjustable head approach</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>I love this one.</li>
            <li>Works better as a tweezer than a trimmer.</li>
            <li>I let the trimmer run for about 10 mins and was satisfied with its performance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a much better clipper, but cost a lot more as well..</li>
            <li>It works better than I&lt;br /&gt;expected.  </li>
            <li>This is the perfect set for any man or person who needs to groom regularly.</li>
            <li>I ended up buying a pair of Panasonic trimmers that were cheaper and that cut much better.</li>
            <li>Nice &amp; light trimmer.</li>
            <li>I used the electric shaver attachment and it works okay.</li>
            <li>I was looking for hair clippers and this was more for beard and face trimming.</li>
            <li>I like how it came with so many accesories and is durable.</li>
            <li>I love my set.</li>
            <li>All In One Trimmer&lt;br /&gt;Rating: 3 1/2 stars&lt;</li>
            <li>Ive been able to get another month out of it because it would work if i plugged it in and then turned it on.</li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>I have been using this trimmer for the last 6 months and works great!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note; I see some people complain about noise and vibration, I have owned many trimmers and they all are noisy, and vibrate.</li>
            <li>I love it and makes life easier.</li>
            <li>But in my case, this gets used maybe once weekly at the most</li>
            <li>battery life on this trimmer has been phenomenal.  </li>
            <li>and I am really glad I went with this Wahl model.eps</li>
            <li>The battery life on this trimmer has been phenomenal.  </li>
            <li>and I am really glad I went with this Wahl model.</li>
            <li>I used the trimmer for 3 more years before I dropped it one night on a trip to Japan.  </li>
            <li>I kept adjusting the size lower and lower and shaved off a bit more than I intended.</li>
            <li>read many reviews before buying this.</li>
            <li>I love this product and also the name.</li>
            <li>I am highly satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>This product is more for home use (i.e. a guy trimming his beard).</li>
            <li>It works excellent and it very simply to use and the battery lasts forever!</li>
            <li>I love this trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love these trimmers.</li>
            <li>This is a must have for creative grooming. &#x3D;0)</li>
            <li>I used mine once to trim my beard with - worked okay then.</li>
            <li>Aside from this issue, I was really please with it - worked great for both beard trimming and head shaving.  </li>
            <li>It cuts okay, when it&#x27;s got power.  </li>
            <li>but many of them just don&#x27;t deliver fully.</li>
            <li>My husband is enjoying this trimmer.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used most of the attachments, but would prefer a better way to store - maybe a pouch?  </li>
            <li>I have had so many electric shavers that it&#x27;s become a joke with my wife.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that some of the attachments are one size.</li>
            <li>Lots more attachments than the ad said.</li>
            <li>I use the most.  </li>
            <li>Its OK...</li>
            <li>Why get more than one item when one does the trick.</li>
            <li>love it use it all the time</li>
            <li>I am pleased and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>I love the trimmer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the top rated product on Amazon was a Philips-norelco brand beard trimmer at the time.</li>
            <li>There were more attachments than I knew what to do with, but I found a subset I could reliably use to trim to a style I enjoyed.</li>
            <li>The Lithium battery, and related power output is its best feature.</li>
            <li>The accesories are interesting.</li>
            <li>like the most diferent attachement</li>
            <li>stand charger would have been better.</li>
            <li>I use mostly the 6-way adjustable guard to trim my beard.  </li>
            <li>#34;it has too many accessories&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>many accessories with no practical storage</li>
            <li>I have been doing this for many years</li>
            <li>and I have burned through more trimmers than I would care to recall.</li>
            <li>The included shaving attachment look ok, but I will never use it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this is a solid piece of equipment for what it does and what it costs, this thing is probably the best at what it does, hands down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use the Wahl on my dog much more than the Andis because the Whal beard trimmer does a better and quicker job than the Andis Pet shaver and is portable.</li>
            <li>, I am pleased and will continue to buy this trimmer when I need to.</li>
            <li>i was very happy with it, but it seems like there are quality control issues, possibly with the waterproofing - this thing is supposed to be used in an moist room most of the time, so</li>
            <li>I love the clipper.</li>
            <li>They could have gotten 5 stars if the quality of clipper-combs/guides and the stand were any better.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love the portability and ease of use.</li>
            <li>It started off ok and worked well.  </li>
            <li>I have had alot better luck with cheaper shavers.  </li>
            <li>I think alot of these better reviews are people reviewing after they use a month and not returning to update after it takes a turn.  </li>
            <li>Will be a repeat buyer :)</li>
            <li>It is fantastic!</li>
            <li>Overall very good product!</li>
            <li>and YES the battery is better.</li>
            <li>With the charger attached, you are still able to set it in the stand.</li>
            <li>My husband said It&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li>There are way too many parts.</li>
            <li>I love the Lithium Ion battery, more power longer life.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure they will be meet.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;d had a Wahl that he used for many years</li>
            <li>it does a great job, thanks Wahl.</li>
            <li>Comes with many attachments and all work as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Well, this one wasn&#x27;t any better.</li>
            <li>Hopefully it will be better than this one.  </li>
            <li>Well made, had many options for lengths.</li>
            <li>Needs a better tray to hold the attachments.</li>
            <li>It is not the most durable and if you want the cleanest of shaves look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>So many attachments comes with the trimmer.</li>
            <li>This trimmer has many attaachments, some of which I don&#x27;t use, but they are there if needed.  </li>
            <li>I had another Wahl trimmer for many years.</li>
            <li>It was light and nice not having a cord plugged in.  </li>
            <li>My father used a Wahl to cut my hair as a kid more years ago than I care to admit</li>
            <li>There are 3 snap-on short-hair trimming guides - 5 lengths would have been better to cover all possibilities, but I make do with the #2 guide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and we just love it.  </li>
            <li>After some messing around and shaking it out of frustration I was able to get it working again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It must be able to put some charge into the battery for it to operate.</li>
            <li>I love these clippers.</li>
            <li>Hand done the best beard, chest and back</li>
            <li>Others are just okay ( shaver )</li>
            <li>Attachments are sufficient for most any user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the battery life and the accessories.  </li>
            <li>Came in a very timely manner, works great</li>
            <li>My husband does love it. :)</li>
            <li>I bought this unit for my husband for mostly beard and neck trimming.</li>
            <li>As with many lithium ion batteries, the one in this shaver works for about two years and then will no longer hold a charge.  </li>
            <li>It is cordless and has many attachments.</li>
            <li>All in all, I love mine.</li>
            <li>All of these fit nicely into a stand.    </li>
            <li>The grooming kit is truly all in one and has many uses.</li>
            <li>Ultimately, I am extremely pleased with the grooming kit</li>
            <li>I really like how it handles, great percision.  </li>
            <li>like most of the attachments</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve finally found the perfect beard trimmer (for me).</li>
            <li>My husband will love it for Christmas.</li>
            <li>I have had a beard for about 32 years and have used many types of trimmers and the Wahl Lithium Ion</li>
            <li>you will find better one .</li>
            <li>Also I agree that there is too many accessories as well.  </li>
            <li>charge lasts me more than 1 week.</li>
            <li>The difference in price is more than made up for in convenience and quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My husband bought this in December 2013, but it cannot hold a charge more than about 10-15 seconds by September 2014.</li>
            <li>This is the best male grooming set that I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>Also I love how it has the shaving head too.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my neck and it gets nice a smooth.  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant to try the Wahl, but now I love it.  </li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;Its attachments are on the cheaper side for sure</li>
            <li>I owned an earlier Wahl for years with excellent results, so therefore bought this Wahl replacement.  </li>
            <li>Great deal, thanks</li>
            <li>Works better then</li>
            <li>make sure you keep your receipt so you can replace it.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t want to break it and the pictorial instructions didn&#x27;t make me too confident.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it could work...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have the haircut attachments in there, since I&#x27;m not ever using those, and I still can&#x27;t fit everything in it nicely.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied.  </li>
            <li>It seems to &#x27;look&#x27; okay, but it feels stubbly.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>is MUCH better, lasts 3-10 times longer.</li>
            <li>After 1.5 years of use, I still love this shaver.</li>
            <li>It is more of a shaver than a trimmer.</li>
            <li>I had a similar model for years and was very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>I had a philips trimmer that worked much more better than this one.</li>
            <li>In the beginning I was quite satisfied.  </li>
            <li>The smaller trimmer head works excellent for anything you want to do to your face.</li>
            <li>The shaver head works ok...</li>
            <li>The blades on this clipper is much better than others that I have used.</li>
            <li>I like to keep a short beard, and this groomer is perfect for this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It gets hair on the &amp;#34;grip,&amp;#34; but it lets you control the haircut a lot more.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this thing.</li>
            <li>Otherwise I love the gadget and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>..wish it was more contained (with a lid over the attatchments.)</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it has a lithium ion battery.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would recommend paying 20 or 30 dollars more for a better quality trimmer.</li>
            <li>It would be better priced at $25 though.</li>
            <li>and im satisfied with it, and</li>
            <li>/&gt;It would have been better if:&lt;br /&gt;1-</li>
            <li>This product is ok.  </li>
            <li>It has everything I could want and more.  </li>
            <li>One can be used for ears and noses and the middle one is perfect for my beard.  </li>
            <li>I was able to put the charger, trimmer and the attachments I use into the pouch and still have room.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great for travelling as it&#x27;s a very compact size.</li>
            <li>Almost too many but</li>
            <li>others have &amp;#34;complained&amp;#34; that there are too many accessories.</li>
            <li>you are OK with having a hairy trimmer</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this trimmer.</li>
            <li>Love all of the attachments...</li>
            <li>I will probably get a more reliable corded version.</li>
            <li>It would have been better to come with a docking charging station instead of a cord.  </li>
            <li>Nothing more to say.  </li>
            <li>If they would add a 1/2&amp;#34; and a 3/4&amp;#34; that would be phenomenal.</li>
            <li>I love this thing.  </li>
            <li>have to have 13 more words to be able to get this posted.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it can be a bit overwhelming, deciding which one to choose.  </li>
            <li>I should have done more research into before buying the product.</li>
            <li>The trimmer itself is okay, but the rack that is supposed to hold the accessories, etc.</li>
            <li>Again, more false/misleading advertising.</li>
            <li>But the head needs to be wider for more coverage.</li>
            <li>Great price and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it&#x27;s not the grossest thing in the world for sure, so i used it.  </li>
            <li>Close &amp; precise!</li>
            <li>Wanted something that would be &#x27;safe&#x27; for using around the jewels.</li>
            <li>It does a good job and has a number of useful attachments.</li>
            <li>purchase was an awesome upgrade from the latter.</li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied with the product and price.  </li>
            <li>Have recommended to a friend or two and they love it as well.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to oil the blade every now and then.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes with more attachments than I&#x27;ll ever need.  </li>
            <li>It has more power, trims better and holds a charge longer than any of the others.  </li>
            <li>You can wipe most of the hair off with a towel, so I still gave it a 5.  </li>
            <li>hopefully i can write another review after four more years.</li>
            <li>It has many attachments and meets any of your grooming needs.</li>
            <li>Love made in america quality.  </li>
            <li>Also has smaller trimmer attachment for the nose and ear holes that works great!</li>
            <li>It does an OK job at evening out the beard</li>
            <li>My beard looks better since I made the switch to Wahl, with</li>
            <li>Hopefully they work better</li>
            <li>So many attachments</li>
            <li>I was able to do virtually anything that I needed to do with clippers.</li>
            <li>Too many attachments.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it is ok.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>my sideburns and touching up the sides of my hair.</li>
            <li>quite simply .... the best trimmer in the world ...</li>
            <li>I shave my head and spend more time doing that than just trimming my mustache and beard</li>
            <li>Buy this trimmer you will love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it will be outstanding.</li>
            <li>I checked Wahl on-line, and I didn&#x27;t see more attachments for the 9560.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not in love with the snapping on and off of the trimmer guards and combs.  </li>
            <li>I wish I&#x27;d bought a more expensive/better trimmer</li>
            <li>Works better than others I had and lasts a&lt;br /&gt;Long</li>
            <li>Has many attachments.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>This one charges in just 5 minutes to a charge that has MORE than allowed me to finish my beard/goatee/moustache trimming</li>
            <li>I just thought it appropriate to update my review.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>- I would pay more for better quality and durability.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, I know this is a simple review, but this thing is wonderful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll have this thing for years.</li>
            <li>but I was able to deal with it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall: An OK product.</li>
            <li>For the money you should be able to find something better.</li>
            <li>unreliable and too many pieces for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i have tried many grooming products from whal, this one however just doesn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li>If you want to stand it up, you have to sit it on the charging port or or will top over.</li>
            <li>They will love it.</li>
            <li>Using it mostly on the road.</li>
            <li>The Wahl is has noticeably more power and is quieter.</li>
            <li>fact that I have to spend more money on a separate \\&quot;nose/ear\\&quot; trimmer is another 1/4-star deduction.</li>
            <li>It seems to be built better with better quality materials, and is manufactured in the United States.</li>
            <li>I was satisfied with it, but after using this Wahl I gotta give the nod to the Wahl.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a daily use trimmer, this would be your best</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Wahl for such a wonderful product in this price range!</li>
            <li>and he seemed pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>all in all he was pleased.</li>
            <li>You have to switch attachments, which is frankly very easy, though not as easy as just dialing in a 3 or 4 on one of those beard groomers.</li>
            <li>Each time in mentioning his new trimmer, he as told me it was an excellent trimmer and that all the reviews he has read have been true.  </li>
            <li>he liked the unit enough to want to purchase another but for $30 (albeit a good price!)</li>
            <li>But a very nice trimmer and charges fast and lasts awhile.</li>
            <li>and i very rarely have to charge it!</li>
            <li>Very powerful blades, hasn&#x27;t pulled my hair yet!</li>
            <li>So far so good!  </li>
            <li>The nose clipper head works perfect for your nose and the larger clipper head works pretty good for your head....</li>
            <li>It works great when it&#x27;s new!</li>
            <li>It is a great all in one trimmer, but the main reason I give it a 3 out of 5 is the fact that it has rusted in 30 days.</li>
            <li>It was metal and had great steady power, but needed to be plugged in to work.</li>
            <li>This particular trimmer was attractive also because of its rechargeable feature and the fact that it&#x27;s made in the United States.  </li>
            <li>Nice lil clean up clippers</li>
            <li>When it works it cuts great and the battery life was decent.  </li>
            <li>Good cut, good power, easy to operate and so far</li>
            <li>The classic and T-blades are just great, though.</li>
            <li>No pulling hair, just a nice, clean cut.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s long-lasting battery and powerful motor deliver exceptional results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It produces a very fast, good even cut.</li>
            <li>Does a good job, I reccomend very much</li>
            <li>Very light, easy to charge, and versatile.</li>
            <li>Took apart some of the easy bits but nothing stood out apart from very cheap parts and assembly.</li>
            <li>thanks Amazon for your amazing return policy!</li>
            <li>really good one, battery back is too good :)</li>
            <li>Pretty good shaver.</li>
            <li>The two best features, how well it trims and how long the lithium battery lasts.</li>
            <li>The battery and motor are in fact higher powered than the ones on the trimmers I&#x27;d used before and it felt good to know</li>
            <li>Cuts pretty good also.</li>
            <li>Wahl is pretty good too.</li>
            <li>The shaver attachment however, is pretty good, kinda.</li>
            <li>While the T-blade head is about a 1/4 inch narrower, it does a pretty good job.</li>
            <li>, the warranty doesnt extent to my country, but its a pretty good trimmer</li>
            <li>The charge was pretty good, no discomfort while trimming, and it cleaned up well.  </li>
            <li>This is awesome and stays charged for a long time.</li>
            <li>My experience is pretty good in this trimmer.</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved this trimmer when I first got it, but now it won&#x27;t hold a charge to even fully trim my goatee.  </li>
            <li>This is a pretty good trimmer with lots of attachments.</li>
            <li>I really loved this trimmer at first.</li>
            <li>This was after a long surcharge for best price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It did seem to work well while it lasted, rarely snagging hair, which is VERY important when manscaping!</li>
            <li>This thing works great for a pretty clean shave, or just trimming your goatee,mustache, or sideburns, etc.</li>
            <li>They have very fine teeth that move smoothly.</li>
            <li>Very nice trimmer for the money and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>So excited!  </li>
            <li>The new one is on the money, works great</li>
            <li>New one works great, too.</li>
            <li>, I think with a new charger, under warranty, and it&#x27;s been great ever since.</li>
            <li>This one feels much better in the hand and is easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much out of this trimmer based on the reviews, so I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Had nice selection of pieces, charged quickly.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is easy to use, has a powerful motor, does a good job, and the heads are easy to change.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, my clock-radio that had a 1-year warranty has been going strong for more than 10</li>
            <li>It does a good job on hair trimming, since my hair is quite short, but the shaving is not so good with the foil attachment.  </li>
            <li>It does a good job of shaving, although some parts of my face need several passes to get a fairly close shave.</li>
            <li>I have to return this product to the company because it does not work as I would have liked it to work, however it may still be useful to most buyers but it was not what I was expecting in performance.</li>
            <li>So I researched various grooming/shaving things, and Wahl seemed to get a lot of good reviews, and this product seemed to be good for an \\&quot;all in one\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;The trimming heads work as well as trimming heads should.</li>
            <li>I figure that if it&#x27;s good enough for a pro, it&#x27;s plenty good for me.&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The basic trimmer function works great, and the build quality of the blade LOOKS nice, but it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>So far, it seems to be great for trimming the edges of my beard, top of my head and those extraneous nose and ear hairs.</li>
            <li>If you enjoy having your hair forcibly ripped from your face, you will love this thing.</li>
            <li>The blades are highest quality, easily maintained, and the high torque of the motor make them great</li>
            <li>Great replacement for my old trimmer that had to stay plugged in as the batter was kaput!</li>
            <li>The storage &#x27;rack&#x27; is pretty cheap, and the pieces don&#x27;t fit all that great.  </li>
            <li>Charges very quickly and retains its power after long use, I am impressed.</li>
            <li>Good strong motor and the charge time is exactly as advertized.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to trim my beard which it worked great for, but if you don&#x27;t keep the parts oiled it will pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is much more powerful than any I&#x27;ve used before and comes with many more (too many?) attachments.</li>
            <li>Most have done the trick just fine.</li>
            <li>It does not cut clean !</li>
            <li>The shaver does, however, hold a charge remarkably well, which is its main selling point.</li>
            <li>I am happy with my trimmer, it was fairly inexpensive compared to other options and has all the attachments I need.  </li>
            <li>Works great, holds a charge for a full trim session, and on a high note, has a quick charge!!  </li>
            <li>It was easy to hold on to and I was able to easily guide it where I needed it as I was trimming my husband&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>The shave you get with it also isn&#x27;t very good he still ends up having to use a disposable razor after trimming his facial hair.</li>
            <li>Overall a very good product.  </li>
            <li>The heads are easily to change and very easy to clean</li>
            <li>I bought this trimmer for my husband and he is so happy with it,he said its the best trimmer he had so far, its clean cut and very quiet</li>
            <li>The attachments are more accurate as well.</li>
            <li>but I have more important things in life to do than to be tied to a charging routine.</li>
            <li>Works great on sensitive areas, if you catch my drift.</li>
            <li>There are many accessories that can freely remove unwanted hair from the body.</li>
            <li>This one does an excellent clean close outline above the lip and is easy to handle.</li>
            <li>I have been happy with the razor so far.  </li>
            <li>Wow, This works great.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t comment on it but for light use, it&#x27;s better than anything else I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li>far, the battery is great and</li>
            <li>I am happy so far with the trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it a lot yet, but so far it works great.</li>
            <li>so far im happy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable to hold and has many attachments.</li>
            <li>Worked great -- for about 6 months, then it stopped working completely.</li>
            <li>Works great but will have to deal with the loud noise&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I started searching around for the advanced products I was sure might exist, but found nothing that compared in quality and design.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s available from most all battery dealers.</li>
            <li>all the plastic accessories are really cheap and flimsy would be better to enhance this</li>
            <li>I got this to replace an old trimmer and it is a great deal.  </li>
            <li>Great product, replaced an old corded Wahl I had for over 8 years.</li>
            <li>The trimmer&#x27;s build quality is excellent, though the settings on the plastic adjustable trimmer head can slip if not set and used carefully.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the purchase; it is everything that I expected it to be.</li>
            <li>I have a feeling the the oil free trimmers might be more for planned obsolescence.  </li>
            <li>Had it not been for it suddenly becoming unusable</li>
            <li>But, in general, it&#x27;s a fun and excellent trimmer to have around.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good solution for that guy who wants to keep a trimmed look.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re good quality and have held up very well.</li>
            <li>Good product from Wahl, but the image shows a very compact and organized stand.</li>
            <li>Was reasonably priced and the description was good.  </li>
            <li>much which is a good thing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for very fine and very very short hair.  </li>
            <li>Charges super fast, attachments work great.</li>
            <li>There are several guides, and it was easy to find one that was ideal to trim my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This tool is also great at cleaning up my neck area as I grow a beard, easily defining lines and trimming well, without upsetting my sensitive</li>
            <li>This is the perfect tool for those quick in-between barbershop touch-ups, especially around the neck.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for pre-shave cut-down of hairs under the chin and on the neck, makes the actual shave quick and easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The battery provides more power than cadmium rechargeable batteries, &amp; having experienced Lithium Ion batteries in other products I own, I look forward to no longer wondering whether or not the battery will be there for me when I need it if I&#x27;ve not kept it plugged into the charger.</li>
            <li>High marks to this product - a very reasonable price for a very good trimmer.</li>
            <li>All in all a good buy, comes with a micro screen for shaving but don&#x27;t expect a close clean shave, good for travel, small lightweight, good trimmer, lots of attachments.</li>
            <li>Worked well for 10-months of very light duty trimming a goatee and sideburns and being kept clean and oiled up.  </li>
            <li>With that one caveat out of the way, it has been superb in every other area.</li>
            <li>When I first got it, I didn&#x27;t have to recharge the battery for greater than 6 months!</li>
            <li>I am very impressed with this product and recommend it to any man who has a beard and/or other trimming needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this and two other hair clippers, and this is the best one.</li>
            <li>I use it for full body once every 2 weeks and after 3 uses of about 15 minutes each still haven&#x27;t had to recharge it!</li>
            <li>Other than that it is a great trimmer!  </li>
            <li>Heads are sharp, easily changed and perform wonderfully.</li>
            <li>The two blades provided provided a close shave - too close for my taste, not the ideal length for that groomed, evening shadow look and you have to press hard to get a good line up.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s practical and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Charges very quickly</li>
            <li>But after browsing the instructions and realizing how easy it was to change heads and adjust accesories</li>
            <li>I fear that a piece of the plastic holder will snap off easily.</li>
            <li>, the plastic norelco used on the guides easily broke.  </li>
            <li>It would often remove the trimmer piece itself which doesn&#x27;t always snap on easily.  </li>
            <li>It does rust easy and collects hair on the handle as you shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The rubberized grip attracts hair trimmings like a magnet, which then stick and do not brush off easily.</li>
            <li>excellent battery combined with the $40 I&#x27;ve spent keeps me using this trimmer, but I&#x27;ll happily abandon it in the future for a better li-on model should one become available.</li>
            <li>Easy to hold and maneuver.  </li>
            <li>Easy Pop in/out design for the Blades</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy.</li>
            <li>I bought it for getting my Doberman ready for the show ring &amp; so far, it has worked perfectly for what I needed.  </li>
            <li>It has a great very short attachment that most models struggle with.</li>
            <li>It easily shaved his head.</li>
            <li>The heads are easy to switch out</li>
            <li>I shopped around a bit but easily decided to order another one of these.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s easy to charge (just plug the bottom in)</li>
            <li>do not like the shape of the ear/nose trimmer, attachments do not switch out easily.</li>
            <li>Receipt of Wahl trimmer states easy to use and works well.</li>
            <li>He tells me it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>the attachments switch out easily and there are tons.  </li>
            <li>Switching heads was easy.</li>
            <li>The detachable blade heads all work well and are extremely easy to assemble when switching out.</li>
            <li>The spring would be easy to replace, but they don&#x27;t sell the springs.</li>
            <li>If so, it&#x27;s easy.  </li>
            <li>One could easily duplicate that look with this tool.  </li>
            <li>Loves how changing the blades are so easy</li>

            <li>The variety of attachments is great and has so many different lengths to trim at!  </li>
            <li>Blades rust easily</li>
            <li>- Easy to switch attachments.  - Made in USA.</li>
            <li>The trimmer blades will get rust very quickly.  </li>
            <li>My dog&#x27;s hair is the thickest of any hair, located anywhere on any mammal on the Earth, so when this unit made easy work of his steel-wool mayne, I bragged it up to my three brothers and each one bought this model (when it was on sale for one weekend in November).  </li>
            <li>It wipes off easily after you are finished, but I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>Reviews said that the Wahl battery was easily replaceable and the motor was strong, so I went for it.</li>
            <li>The accessories do NOT go in the stand as easily as the picture on here would imply.</li>
            <li>really does a nice job comes with many adapters charges</li>
            <li>The blade gets quite rusty very quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s underpowered (requires many, many passes), required disassembly to clean and oil the blades EVERY use, and the rubberized exterior is a hair magnet making it a serous pain to keep clean.</li>
            <li>I like this product because it comes with four easily changeable \\&quot;blades\\</li>
            <li>This product also comes with seven guide combs that easily attach to the trimmer and can be used to help with grooming.</li>
            <li>Once charged up it does hold its charge well and is easy to recharge.     </li>
            <li>The accessories are easy to change out and provide all the options I need.</li>
            <li>Pieces rust easy.</li>
            <li>Cuts a bit easy.</li>
            <li>In my case I find it as easy as combing my hair</li>
            <li>However, the metal parts of the trimming attachment rust easily and remain corroded.</li>
            <li>I like the heads and this is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>, it feels sturdy in my hand and is easy to maneuver.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nope, nothin&#x27; close about this shave plus it breaks easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a compact device with a rubberized handle that makes it easy to hold.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, and</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s easy to charge before it dies.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to control, the blade doesn&#x27;t pull on the whiskers, and the battery holds a charge almost forever ( not quite, but close).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Trimming with this thing is easy for me, and I know nothing about beards or beard &amp;#34;hygiene&amp;#34;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lightweight, easy to handle.</li>
            <li>The attachments are easy to change and all work as advertised.</li>
            <li>The heads are easy to change,</li>
            <li>The plastic tab that you have to lift up to pop it off is not as rigid as needed and instead of popping off easily, it bends.  </li>
            <li>It works and is fairly easy to use.  </li>
            <li>So, If the clipper ever sounds like a mini chain saw and doesn&#x27;t clip well at all, it just might be the blade portion and a fix is relatively easy.</li>
            <li>It is easy to change height settings and cuts</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;- easy to change blades</li>
            <li>besides that it&#x27;s a strong machine that does it job.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommend.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.  </li>
            <li>the unit itself is strong and powerfull, and feels well built, but I have yet to find an attachment I like.  </li>
            <li>The motor doesn&#x27;t seem to be nearly as strong as the review had implied.</li>
            <li>and it is still going strong after lots of use.  </li>
            <li>you want to (The main blade is good for almost everything)</li>
            <li>that being said, the blades are good, give a nice shave and overall</li>
            <li>Hasn&#x27;t needed recharge in 3 - 4 weeks - still running strong.  </li>
            <li>The attachments are not its strong point</li>
            <li>But the motor is strong and the battery has given me no problems.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>ive used this about 3 or 4 times (which doesnt seem like alot) and the battery is still going strong.</li>
            <li>Two years and going strong.</li>
            <li>The man who this was purchased for has an incredibly strong beard and it grows like a weed.  </li>
            <li>Battery is strong and lithium.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product if you are looking for a good beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>The advertising brags at length about the battery, and I guess its a good one, and the motor seems high quality, but the blades and guides are junk.  </li>
            <li>Have had this for quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;Works very good and hold a charge for a long time.  </li>
            <li>Love it lots of attachments nice little canvas case works great.</li>
            <li>Jeanclerc\\&quot; comment in every single word, This is by far and for sure the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever had, the charge is amazing</li>
            <li>This beard trimmer is awesome and comes with so many hair cutting features and they are all great.  </li>
            <li>Li-Ion devices generally boast great power capacities and this trimmer is no exception.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, fine trimming, power to do the job.  </li>
            <li>It also works for the dog, trims his ear&#x27;s pretty nice.</li>
            <li>The  battery does not hold its charge for more than a couple minutes after a full nights charge.  </li>
            <li>Love the full array of attachments.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m LOVING this all in one trimmer!</li>
            <li>This is the first razor I can honestly say does it all for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Largest Blade:</li>
            <li>I went to use it and noticed that the handle was really warm, almost hot.  </li>
            <li>He has a full beard and was pleased with the item</li>
            <li>I tried using a depth attachment a couple times to trim my leg and chest hair (not thick at all), but found them fairly ineffective.</li>
            <li>These are the best hands down.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is hands down the best.</li>
            <li>The rubberized handle is comfortable and easy to grip, and though hair clippings tend to stick to it, they easily wipe off with a damp rag.</li>
            <li>My last trimmer had a great tray that tucked the wire in a way that I could easily pull it off and pop it on the charger, and had a tray they fit all the accessories to store them in a very clean manner.  </li>
            <li>a \\&quot;good, strong unit.\\&quot;  Now for a word of pure praise: Kudos to Wahl for their quickly interchangeable head system.</li>
            <li>(It certainly raises the \\&quot;useful\\&quot; quotient by more than a bit!)</li>
            <li>(It certainly raises the \\&quot;useful\\&quot; quotient by more than a bit!)</li>
            <li>I was very happy also that after removing the comb I was able to clean up the neckline and remove the little fine neck hairs in a Jiff.  </li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d just upgrade to a new trimmer, and this seemed like a good unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it still works as good as new.</li>
            <li>worked fine until about 2 weeks ago...</li>
            <li>The plastic guards that set the length of hair fit on and off easily and do not flex when I trim.  </li>
            <li>This works fine for the price.  </li>
            <li>Everything else is fine.  </li>
            <li>Easy to operate and smooth.  </li>
            <li>The Wahl All In One Trimmer, has worked out just fine for me.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li>When it runs, it works fine.</li>
            <li>Bottom line is that it&#x27;s light weight &amp; easy to use.</li>
            <li>The attachments, which click off and on easily, are lightly built but seem functional and not about to fall apart.</li>
            <li>Oh, it somehow manages to produce a fine dust from your skin, but the hair underneath will be almost untouched.</li>
            <li>2/21/15 Battery dies, works fine for a while</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight and feels comfortable, easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m just fine.  </li>
            <li>The battery seemed fine.</li>
            <li>and yes I checked my outlet and it works fine with wife&#x27;s blow dryer.</li>
            <li>The adjustable guide for the trim head works fine.  </li>
            <li>and it seemed to handle it just fine.</li>
            <li>Although it works fine, it has some quirks.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve worked fine every time.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no effort to seal the unit, so the electronics were covered with fine hair residue.</li>
            <li>but it does the job just fine.</li>
            <li>It still works fine</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t fit snug against the blades and seem like they could easily break.  </li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>The Phillips model shaves so smooth &amp; easy that a baby could use it.</li>
            <li>just fine.  </li>
            <li>perfect the first time I used teh product and then 2 days later the trimmer wouldn&#x27;t trun on.</li>
            <li>Compact, light, easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>: this is a 120/60hz trimmer, but it does work fine on a transformer</li>
            <li>but if the dog keeps shedding, I may fine a use for it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>then this will suit your needs just fine.</li>
            <li>A bit underpowered and doesn&#x27;t cut as fine as I would prefer (like a corded trimmer), but understandable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this Wahl trimmer for about 3 weeks now, and it works just fine for what I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The trimmer has been running just fine on a &amp;#34;factory charge&amp;#34; for 2-3 weeks now - (I am not making this up)&lt;br /&gt;a testament to:&lt;br /&gt;a)</li>
            <li>Trimmer works fine.</li>
            <li>It works just fine.</li>
            <li>The Litium Ion All in One is a fine product.</li>
            <li>This works okay for a couple months but quickly wears out.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased with how quickly this shipped and the price that I paid for the quality of the product.</li>
            <li>I love how the accessories just snap on/off quickly.</li>
            <li>The clippers are cheaply made, but they are light and easily maneuverable.  </li>
            <li>but if you use the buzz upside down it gets close enough, great battery life and perfect size.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The clippers work just fine and the motor does not make too much sound.</li>
            <li>Love the battery life but it would be much easier to manage the many attachments if it came in a case with a lid for easy storage.</li>
            <li>This was a replacement for an older trimmer and we were very satisfied.</li>
            <li>This is a nice set, I certainly recommend it.with this Wahl.</li>
            <li>This is a nice set, I certainly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Here, I wonder about the experience of most folks - as, a good, strong unit is bound to feel &amp; sound like it - especially at this price point!</li>
            <li>Here, I wonder about the experience of most folks - as, a good, strong unit is bound to feel &amp; sound like it - especially at this price point!</li>
            <li>This the best little trimmer you could ask for.</li>
            <li>The stand for all the assessories could use a little work but over all very impressed with the trimmer</li>
            <li>This is the perfect little trimmer.</li>
            <li>thanks so much!!!!!</li>
            <li>I use the accessories to help get hard to reach places safely, as well as perfect the trimming process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The clipper had a good grip, very good torque (it feels heavy and very stable) and the blade is far superior.</li>
            <li>an accurate variable length trimmer 2) had a nose hair attachment and 3)</li>
            <li>Li battery makes a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>Despite this huge shortcoming, WAHL never mentions it in the instructions or elsewhere that it&#x27;s not waterproof.</li>
            <li>He uses the trimmer on his 6 year old Braun rechargeable electric shaver for his sideburns, and it still runs perfectly after all these years, though some of the paint did flake off near the head.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t give an accurate description or account of this product because I have not used it yet.</li>
            <li>however the so called smooth shaver attachment is just abysmal.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other reviewers mentioned the stand and they are right..its not convenient nor have I found a way to make all of the attachments fit securely although there is a diagram in the manual on how to do so...</li>
            <li>Watch my review to see the cheap construction inside.</li>
            <li>And its genuinely just a tray</li>
            <li>They stayed on and snapped in place securely.</li>
            <li>Overall, a great product.  </li>
            <li>and they don&#x27;t really fit well.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it does a great job trimming the edges of your mustache above the lip, etc.</li>
            <li>Fantastic Trimmer.  </li>
            <li>No one person needs them all, but it is important to have the options to try when you receive the machine.</li>
            <li>I have always had a cheap trimmer.</li>
            <li>While it is slightly more pricey than the Ni-Cad versions it is well worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li>30 day return available</li>
            <li>spare parts available</li>
            <li>A smooth surface would solve this problem.</li>
            <li>I have purchased and replaced EVERY supposed quality BODY GROOMER and rechargeable trimmer available for years.</li>
            <li>It stopped working after one month of light use -</li>
            <li>and they replaced it promptly and cheerfully.  </li>
            <li>Fits well in your hand, comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>It was fantastic while it worked.  </li>
            <li>He liked it to much, I bought my son one also.  </li>
            <li>Really cheap stuff</li>
            <li>The multiple heads offer great flexibility for trimming and close shaving.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no need for a sticky rubber grip on a trimmer, and it&#x27;s not even that comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Powerful, with many attachments.  </li>
            <li>I bought the Wahl Lithium Ion trimmer primarily for sideburn, neck, &amp; \\&quot;nether\\&quot; region trimming purposes, as well as for the Lithium Ion battery.</li>
            <li>Given my experience, I don&#x27;t expect skin smooth shaves from a foil shaver.</li>
            <li>Done Liked it so much</li>
            <li>Overall a great value, no complaints.</li>
            <li>They are easy to clean (a damp face cloth will get the hair off the handle (for the person who gave it a one star because he had hair on the handle)).</li>
            <li>For the 3 months that it worked properly, it worked great.</li>
            <li>Great for trimming up around the ears and back of the neck.</li>
            <li>Then come back and do your shave - works great.</li>
            <li>the plastic \\&quot;chrome\\&quot; feel lends a cheap feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great price especially for the quality&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy care, just clean &amp; oil</li>
            <li>The blade is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Cheap finishing ..</li>
            <li>This is a Fantastic kit, everything you want or need in trimmer.</li>
            <li>A foil shaver attachment that actually does a great job.</li>
            <li>and they did not sacrifice any cheap material for price.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also incredibly useful for touching up brows, nose, and ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great overall product.</li>
            <li>the attachments get rusty, they are made from cheap metal.</li>
            <li>[3 week Update: I omitted this before, but, I bought this unit primarily to shave my head.</li>
            <li>Does its primary function well.</li>
            <li>dislike those adjustables for detailed work, and I often forget what setting I need, resulting in having no eyebrows for a week or two</li>
            <li>-- this is fantastic, unlike others I have used, this one does not slip around when using it.  </li>
            <li>It will save you a fortune not to mention all the time it might take to run to a hairdresser or barber, and the cordless possibilities free you up to move away from the mirror.</li>
            <li>is way to light to support everything without it falling.  </li>
            <li>it comes with cheap plastic add-ons that no one will ever use.</li>
            <li>I have owned this model before and this one is great just like the last one.  </li>
            <li>It cuts smoothly.</li>
            <li>the extra components it comes with make it a great buy.    </li>
            <li>They fit the trimmer head</li>
            <li>and it works great for personal grooming.</li>
            <li>I had the same model for about 5 years before it died and never had a problem with it and worked great.  </li>
            <li>the light weight of it will send the attachments all over the place.    </li>
            <li>worked great for the short time it worked</li>
            <li>There is no charge indicator light on the shaver to indicate charging status.  </li>
            <li>If you need a simple machine that just works, you should be happy with this Wahl.</li>
            <li>it has cheap plastic in the blades.</li>
            <li>I liked the Wahl product so much, I purchased another one</li>
            <li>It seems to be the most economical one to use.</li>
            <li>The cheap, plastic &amp;#34;organizer&amp;#34; tray that came with</li>
            <li>Keeps its charge and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>He has had a beard for most of his adult life, and has declared this trimmer as the best performing trimmer he has ever owned - definitely 5 stars!</li>
            <li>This was ordered as a Christmas gift and getting it on time was important.  </li>
            <li>However, the attachments don&#x27;t seem as accurate and precise as others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>My husband says this is comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let this deter you from buying though, the trimmer is the important part and it works great.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Compared to some of the stuff I&#x27;ve tried from Wally World it is fantastic.</li>
            <li>And, an indicator light when charging.  </li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s important information.</li>
            <li>The packaging is cheap, and there is no carrying or storage case.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a great unit.</li>
            <li>The attachments are cheaply made but they do the job, plus you get tons of attachments so there is one for whatever your need is.</li>
            <li>accessories are easy to maintain and clean.  </li>
            <li>It feels sturdy in the hand and it comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>I took a knife to the cheap rubber shrink-wrapped handle and opened the thing up.    </li>
            <li>Know that this is an extremely cheap piece of electronics.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the way everything fit together.  </li>
            <li>The cheap bum that I am purchased on Amazon vs Target to save $2...</li>
            <li>then this unit will save you lots of money by not going to the barber as it works great for short hair too.  </li>
            <li>Maybe the Lithium Ion battery makes it feel so light?</li>
            <li>compact and works quietly and does a great job</li>
            <li>Update - Wahl contacted me about my unit and is replacing it free of charge.  </li>
            <li>There is a nice youtube video that explains the whole device from Wahl</li>
            <li>Paid $34.17 - Free Shipping.</li>
            <li>Overall a great trimmer and would buy again.</li>
            <li>But, for those who travel, this trimmer is outstanding; compact, powerful, and lightweight and it works right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>then that I really enjoy this product and will choose Wahl again.</li>
            <li>Replacement heads are available from WAHL for $7.50, $5.95 shipping and $4 handling.  </li>
            <li>Although the grip is comfortable, my hair sticks to it, after I am done with the job.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use all the attachments and I primarily bought this to keep hair neat in between trips to the barber.&lt;br</li>
            <li>cheap - stuff falls out of it frequently&lt;</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, in terms of its basic function, the trimmer blade works great at trimming neck hair, sideburns, over-ear hair, etc.</li>
            <li>And theres no charge light to indicate its getting a charge.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Obviously the clipper is more powerful, so the clipper gave a faster and cleaner trim vs the trimmer.</li>
            <li>I also threw the cheap plastic stand/organizer away.  </li>
            <li>It holds a charge for what seems like forever and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight and cordless.</li>
            <li>and I have owned some cheap pieces of junk before.</li>
            <li>The free shipping can&#x27;t be beaten.</li>
            <li>this model has a great battery with several attachments.</li>
            <li>blade cuts smoothly</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried all of them yet but the height adjusters are cheap and they don&#x27;t mount that well.</li>
            <li>would give this item 5 stars if it were a lit more powerful.</li>
            <li>Great trimming kit with lots of extras: multiple heads and attachments!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need it for much, only trimming, so I don&#x27;t use the majority of the possibility it affords, but for my purposes it works great.</li>
            <li>The rubberized handle is exceedingly sticky, making for a secure grip.</li>
            <li>razor makes quite a buzzing sound.</li>
            <li>As it is, I would not recommend this product; if, however, this issue (the death of the product) were addressed in future models, it would be a great trimmer.</li>
            <li>light weight.  </li>
            <li>A friend recommended this to me, and I&#x27;ve been very impressed after a few weeks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The build quality of this is extremely cheap.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think it was available at the time.</li>
            <li>It has several widths of trimmers and the smallest is great for over the ears.</li>
            <li>sound and vibration&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it primarily as a beard trimmer and body hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Overall great</li>
            <li>Oh and everything falls out of the cheap plastic stand anytime</li>
            <li>The T-Blade head did not have an attachment with the 6 position trimming guide (like the primary Trimmer head) which would allow a variety of beard lengths.</li>
            <li>I have no idea how they fit everything in the tray.</li>
            <li>Everything (except the adjustable-length trimmer comb) still works great, and the battery charge still works over multiple beard</li>
            <li>I think this is a nice quality machine and will be appreciated by anyone with thinner beard hair than I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think this is a nice quality machine and will be appreciated by anyone with thinner beard hair than I have.</li>
            <li>Great company to do business with I would us them again if prices remain low.</li>
            <li>It also is easy to clean if you follow the instructions.</li>
            <li>the foil shaver gives a close and smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>:  Light and efficient.  </li>
            <li>that noise, that hammering sound that you hear is something... hammering.</li>
            <li>I turned mine over, filled it with BB shot (fishing aisle, Wal-Mart, $1.29) and topped it all off with Shoe Goo (also at Wal-Mart).  </li>
            <li>this cheap and acword plastic base.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Feels cheap.</li>
            <li>I was a light user with it, maybe twice a month to trim.  </li>
            <li>The battery lasts forever but the parts dont fit in the box that came with it.</li>
            <li>It pulls the hair, irritates my skin a bit, and leaves a spotty shave (some spots baby smooth and others with a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow).</li>
            <li>Cheaply made.</li>
            <li>A great edition to my necessary grooming...</li>
            <li>and  look cheap</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this guy for a few years now and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>I owned the model before this one which is not a lot cheaper than this one, but still available.</li>
            <li>The blades and engine are smooth.</li>
            <li>This is a well built, durable, and comfortable trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried (but rarely use) most of the accessories and additional trimming / clipping / shaving heads, etc -</li>
            <li>Enjoy not having to deal with the cord-tangle issues.</li>
            <li>I also use the foil shaving head on my neck occasionally, and it seems great too.</li>
            <li>I noticed a rattling sound</li>
            <li>But the rattling sound continues</li>
            <li>This is a great personal trimmer that covers all hair and beard trimming needs at a great price and a quality close to commercial trimmers.</li>
            <li>Flimsy trim heads that fall off, cheap construction, noisy motor,</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use all the attachments, but I like having them available to use.  </li>
            <li>Works great for all the necessary trimming on the face and head.</li>
            <li>but I tried to go cheap.</li>
            <li>The trimmer I have just purchased does a fantastic job trimming my beard.</li>
            <li>Heads are removeable and easy to clean by brushing the blade out.</li>
            <li>I use a blade lube with the product and to date it has done a fantastic job.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean with the included brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- blades feel smooth on the skin</li>
            <li>I purchased my trimmer in July of 2012, and use it primarily for stubble-length trimming of my beard and mustache.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>His Norelco is far superior.  </li>
            <li>Not too loud, it&#x27;s got a good torque to it.</li>
            <li>Good Razor, I am sure I will have to replace it in 3 years like the  last one</li>
            <li>So far so good, I bought it to trim my dogs face around her eyes and mouth.</li>
            <li>Yeah, this is more of a narrative than a proper review, but there is some good information to be gleaned.</li>
            <li>I bought this trimmer to keep my beard in check and so far it has been fairly usefull.</li>
            <li>Me machine is loud, but works good.</li>
            <li>I gave one to my bf for christmas and it seems to have done a good job so far.</li>
            <li>SO FAR SO GOOD....</li>
            <li>I was so happy with my previous one, it was very easy to buy another one.</li>
            <li>It works fine for it&#x27;s original design of being just a shaver.  </li>
            <li>The only things I would say is that it is mainly made out of plastic (except for the blades of course) which gives it kind of a cheap feel however it does work great.  </li>
            <li>The reason I say to make sure that you have the right lenghth, I literally shaved my eyebrows off trying to trim them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Strong motor, good attachments, easy to use, everything you want in a simple trimmer.</li>
            <li>The only one I can ever see myself using is the very nice 6 position adjustable head.</li>
            <li>Trimmer is well made and very useful.</li>
            <li>Very powerful.</li>
            <li>I have found the trimmer very useful and it has lived up to my expectations.</li>
            <li>The package contents are very useful.</li>
            <li>I would gladly pay more for this if it just had some type of water resistance...and a decent stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This trimmer has a ONE HOUR CHARGE, a quick charge function and keeps its power full on for 3 HOURS!  </li>
            <li>but if you like choices, then this one is most certainly the winner!</li>
            <li>The trimmer is a great size, is really easy to change attachments for and is, overall, an extremely useful tool.</li>
            <li>He says the cut is clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>They just give you a cheap $0.05 brush that fell apart after 5 uses -- to clean the blades.</li>
            <li>Have used many Wahl products over last 25 years &amp; have always been very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It recharges quickly and cleans easily.</li>
            <li>I liked my older Wahl because it was all metal.</li>
            <li>And even trying to do exactly what they have in the picture, I found that many of the pieces don&#x27;t really fit in their places as shown snugly.  </li>
            <li>I expected to be impressed, but sadly, I&#x27;m not.</li>
            <li>Lasts forever on 1 charge and helps me achieve my &#x27;Don Johnson&#x27; look quickly and easily every day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very practical, easy to use and most importantly it serves its purpose.</li>
            <li>Accessories change quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>Its a neat package of accessories and quick and easy snap-on cutters.</li>
            <li>The attachments themselves are all effective and high quality.</li>
            <li>Battery last for quite a while, strong motor, good attachments.  </li>
            <li>The battery works great, charges last a LOOOOOONG time and it recharges quick.</li>
            <li>The trimmer itself is strong, relatively quiet and has good battery</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still not convinced that it will replace my old school manual razor for shaving, but it&#x27;s a good quick option.      </li>
            <li>/&gt;Summary: If you want a lightweight, powerful beard trimmer that won&#x27;t leave you hanging with half a beard in the morning, this product from Wahl is an awesome buy.</li>
            <li>This is a great quality, light weight, powerful trimmer for personal use.  </li>
            <li>the clippers were OK at first</li>
            <li>I was pleased with this trimmer at first but after about 8 months it quit holding a charge.</li>
            <li>And changing trimmer heads is straightforward and snap into place with precision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>Okay everyone this is the first time I ever wrote a review on the items I purchase from amazon</li>
            <li>Original review</li>
            <li>They did not, however, offer to replace it on the phone (see below original review).</li>
            <li>It is still running on the original charge.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I read all the reviews first.  </li>
            <li>Brought this Trimmer and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>and I have been very pleased so far.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to buy a made-in-USA product ... until I used it.</li>
            <li>It works great and the charge lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>The rep was friendly and helpful.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with so far.</li>
            <li>Worked great for a year though, and had long battery life.</li>
            <li>The trimmer doesnt take long to charge, and all the accessories are great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a month now, and it&#x27;s still on the original charge.  </li>
            <li>Brought this trimmer home today excited to trim my beard and mustache.</li>
            <li>My original review is at the bottom of this entry.</li>
            <li>ORIGINAL REVIEW:</li>
            <li>Works great, holds charge for a long time without needing to be recharged.</li>
            <li>I wish that there was a light that let me know when the charger was full.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with having one item for all kinds of hair grooming.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed with the shaver,however.</li>
            <li>I was mostly interested in a better and stronger battery life, and this product meets that need.</li>
            <li>- Powerful!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve successfully rinsed the handle before, but after rinsing it recently, the trimmer quit working.</li>
            <li>the first one lasted approx 5 years or more.</li>
            <li>If you were dependent on the attachments for your needs it would rate significantly lower as the attachments are not as well made as the trimmer itself.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not sure, but it&#x27;s wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;m pretty sure I saw this at Wal-Mart</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t trim my goatee every day maybe twice a week but the power and charge is always there, never disappointed.</li>
            <li>This is the first trimmer I have owned, and still my favorite.</li>
            <li>It blows away any competitors with which I have been familiar.  </li>
            <li>For those who complain about too many accessories: Really? Just throw them away then!</li>
            <li>The long operating time between charges is great and all accesories work as advertised.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be willing to pay a lot more</li>
            <li>Seemed to work OK the first couple of weeks although it would pull hairs when using the attachments to trim my beard.</li>
            <li>Pretty sure this is planned obsolescence.</li>
            <li>These clippers are pretty much better than sliced bread</li>
            <li>I was really excited to use this when I bought it, but I do have a couple of complaints.</li>
            <li>Now fast forward 5 months it worked today and no wont turn back on awesome right.  </li>
            <li>Great little unit, more versatile than I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>&gt; say all of this because my new Wahl Lithium Ion All In One Trimmer is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>It has great power and the battery has a very long life.  </li>
            <li>If you want to clean the beard trimmings, you need to spend an hour using the provided brush.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>trimmer is indeed quite powerful, one of the most powerful on the market today.  </li>
            <li>It pulled a lot (i.e. didn&#x27;t cut cleanly).  </li>
            <li>which we did not test since Dave is clean shaven except for his mustache.  </li>
            <li>I prefer not to shave my head clean with a blade....</li>
            <li>The trimmer attachments provide a clean &amp; close trim.</li>
            <li>SUPER smooth, lightweight, and inexpensive.</li>
            <li>and I also use it to clean up my neck line which grows rapidly.  </li>
            <li>I managed to clean up my goatee, sideburns, and my eye brows in just 10 min.</li>
            <li>The attachments are flimsy and cheap, and there isn&#x27;t a good one for a short (#2) beard like mine.  </li>
            <li>but it would take hours to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li>The powerful motor in the trimmer easily cuts through hair.</li>
            <li>The 5 year warranty is great - in theory - but trying to actually ship it off for repair is a pain and with the cost of shipping it isn&#x27;t worth it.  </li>
            <li>clean, even shave.</li>
            <li>I used a damp cloth to wipe it clean, but even the fibers from the cloth somehow got stuck on the handle.</li>
            <li>and I have only had it for about a month, but so far it is excellent.</li>
            <li>Provides a quick and precise mustache trim.  </li>
            <li>It cannot line up hair and it cannot give you a clean cut.</li>
            <li>Says that it cuts nicely and loves that it has many different guard options.</li>
            <li>These have been the best clippers so far out of 6 different ones.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned several trimmers and this one by far is the best.</li>
            <li>The trimming action is great and he seems very please with the gift.</li>
            <li>As far as clipping goes, it does great and works very well for my needs.</li>
            <li>Has more accessories than you need (better than too few) and feels really nice and solid in the hand--not cheap--and the rubber grip is great.</li>
            <li>I kept it lubricated and clean.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;We used to think Wahl made the best quality clippers and trimmers, and maybe with their professional line products that may be the case, but for the consumer products, we feel they are just junk, and will try a different brand, and stick to a corded model.</li>
            <li>I wanted to use this in order to clean up about 10-12 days of beard growth.</li>
            <li>It picks up stuff on surfaces that appear to be perfectly clean.</li>
            <li>when I contacted the company about this issue they had a quick prompt response and sent out a free replacement.</li>
            <li>I use it for trimming around the neck hairline and it seems to stay relatively clean.</li>
            <li>If it is - stay clean</li>
            <li>The stand is super cheap quality.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my son who wanted to keep his hairline clean in between haircuts.  </li>
            <li>so I removed the beard guide to clean the blades -- and some sort of clip fell out of the unit.  </li>
            <li>a clean even look that I like.  </li>
            <li>I just needed it to remove nose and eyebrow hair and maybe keep my wife&#x27;s play ground clean</li>
            <li>trim all the hair on my neck and looks clean and neat all the time--thanks</li>
            <li>to keep clean , hairs stick to handle.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Worth the buy for a variety of things, and still going strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong, powerful, and reliable.</li>
            <li>On the positive, the stubble guards on this work  work better once you manage to get them on</li>
            <li>By far the most power from any trimmer I&#x27;ve owned!</li>
            <li>After reading lots of positive reviews and using the 5yr warranty as a feel good reinforcement, I decided to give the Lithium Ion a try, even with the high price tag, I figured \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made of a high grip type of rubber that does make it very easy to hold, but your trimmed hairs will stick to it.</li>
            <li>The Tray is great for holding all the blades and accessories, but the Shaver itself sits a bit loose and the charge wire doesn&#x27;t stay in place</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s pretty easy to put a drop or 2 of oil on the blades once a week, and it helps give a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great that it charges so quickly and keeps its charge for so long.</li>
            <li>The li-on battery is a great feature on this trimmer, as it lasts for a long time and charges quickly.</li>
            <li>I ordered this, but had to return it, it&#x27;s very sturdy and my skin is very sensitive, I liked the built quality but its not for me !</li>
            <li>It cuts very well, is very light weight.  </li>
            <li>thankfully it was nothing visible and stopped bleeding after a minute, but i was right to hurry because it did die very quickly.  </li>
            <li>My original title for this review was:  \\&quot;OK if you consider $40 reasonable for a disposable razor!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I like it better than my large Whal clipper.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t style it or do anything special -</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful, recharges quickly, and the attachments are easy to change.  </li>
            <li>Feels cheaply made in comparison, and my older model even now does a better trimming job.</li>
            <li>Changing the different heads is very easy and the holder is just okay.</li>
            <li>It claims more power, and it definitely delivers with a very strong motor.</li>
            <li>I shopped hard for the best price, and Amazon was lowest, including Walmart online.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve found many of these attachments very useful and of high quality.</li>
            <li>It cuts amazingly and it isn&#x27;t loud at all.</li>
            <li>When I got it out of the box I was thrilled to see it already had a pretty substantial charge and was ready to go.</li>
            <li>I got this item because it was an all in one and the reviews on it were overall good.</li>
            <li>Feels really solid in my hand and the head is well-designed, it&#x27;s easy to get a nice clean line.</li>
            <li>I figured if it&#x27;s good enough for professionals, it&#x27;s good enough for me to try out.</li>
            <li>It gave a good shave, but there are over a dozen different pieces that will probably get scattered all around some drawer.</li>
            <li>I really like the results I am able to achieve with this trimmer.</li>
            <li>Whether I have a full beard or switch it up with a goatee, this trimmer allows me to groom and style any way I want.</li>
            <li>My barber charges 10 bucks for lineups and trims in between full blown haircuts</li>
            <li>Meaning it&#x27;s just not designed to give full service haircuts.</li>
            <li>This is a cool product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a real shame because i was staring to love this thing.     </li>
            <li>When looking at the photos I figured that the trimmer would charge by placing it in the holder...not true.</li>
            <li>Charged for just over an hour when I received it, it has been running full strength ever since.  </li>
            <li>The conaire I thought was very underpowered for the beard trimmer and would require many passes to get an even cut.  </li>
            <li>After a full charge (overnight) it will run about 2-3 minutes, maybe.</li>
            <li>The dual foil shaver actually does a good job.</li>
            <li>Today after a full charge it died until I plugged it in.</li>
            <li>I had to send in the full unit with power supply.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very flimsy, looks more like a packaging tray, and if you touch anything it all falls out.  </li>
            <li>With a full beard it saves all those hours of trying to be proficient with scissors.</li>
            <li>but Amazon wants me to write more.  </li>
            <li>and this is after a full night recharge.</li>
            <li>Love the straight blade nose trimmer...</li>
            <li>It does a wonderful job on my thick beard</li>
            <li>it was 3.95 V showing a full charge.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s good enough ..  </li>
            <li>Same price, way superior battery.</li>
            <li>the unit: Seems like a good, solid buy.</li>
            <li>The only good thing about this device is that it&#x27;s a Lithium Ion battery (have not opened to confirm that).</li>
            <li>Replaceable battery would be nice -- as my old trimmer wasn&#x27;t what I would refer to as \\&quot;all used up\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Replaceable battery would be nice -- as my old trimmer wasn&#x27;t what I would refer to as \\&quot;all used up\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>A really nice, complete grooming set.</li>
            <li>The cordless feature is very convenient and provides better control.</li>
            <li>detail attachment is good because it&#x27;s not big.</li>
            <li>I have another beard trimmer that does a good job of trimming my beard but not above the lip.</li>
            <li>Batter lasts FOREVER, one sweet cut and it out performs my Norelco that I&#x27;ve owned for years.</li>
            <li>Not everyone can have a beard, but if you have been blessed with the genetics to grow one, it is your responsibility to respect and maintain it; thus ensuring many more decades of this glorious time period known as the Beard Renaissance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expected to give this trimmer 4 stars because I thought it had too many attachments</li>
            <li>A full charge lasts me for weeks of use.  </li>
            <li>it makes too much noise, the battery charge is ok.</li>
            <li>This is simply a quality product at a good price.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how good it is for facial shaving.</li>
            <li>I have also cut my own hair with their hair clippers since I was 7 years old.</li>
            <li>Plus it has the attachments that really send this over the top.</li>
            <li>the stainless body one is better.</li>
            <li>Full Práctica porque es inalámbrica, liviana, corta muy bien, le cargo la batería una sola vez al mes (increíble).</li>
            <li>There are way too many attachments for my needs, but who really cares?</li>
            <li>Will be getting the kind that just plug directly into ac power this time.     </li>
            <li>Good overall trimmer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have a full set of heads this way, 2 bases, and a bag to store it all in</li>
            <li>I was enjoying it so much</li>
            <li>I have no idea how this thing got through any testing in the Wahl company, but I hope the people responsible for this ingenious idea have been removed from a position of power.</li>
            <li>I have had a full beard and moustache since 1978.</li>
            <li>Plugged it in for a full day and still nothing.</li>
            <li>I really like that Wahl still manufactures most of their products in the USA</li>
            <li>Also, the charger is the same for this as it is for the lithium head hair clippers I have (which also has good battery life).</li>
            <li>This is absolutely true.</li>
            <li>The attachments all seem to work fairly well too, no problems with pulling/snagging of facial hair.</li>
            <li>Full voltage of a Lithium battery).</li>
            <li>This one product is really all you need to remain a well-groomed and distinguished man. :)</li>
            <li>The trimmer will not hold a charge in about 6 months,  It will not even get threw a trimming at full charge.  </li>
            <li>Its good buy but smaller than I</li>
            <li>Initially, I had a had good things to say about this product and now find myself editing this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Has a good selection of various attachments and has worked well since its purchase.  </li>
            <li>I was actually really worried as at times I was wondering whether or not I was going to be able to find the charger for it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It looks like it was made for a full size clipper and it slides sideways when trimming because it is wider than the trimmer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cool.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really ask for much more at this price.</li>
            <li>I am using this trimmer for the last 1 month and feels really good.</li>
            <li>Have a good night.&amp;#34; and told me I could send it back.</li>
            <li>find the Lithium Ion battery life to be spectacular thus far.</li>
            <li>This is now my full body hair removal tool.  </li>
            <li>Battery charge life and short time for chargning are good.  </li>
            <li>Overall this has been a good product.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t need a full size shaver, but this foil head just doesn&#x27;t cut the mustard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>some more cons I could add but when a product stops working after four months the rest really doesn&#x27;t matter.  </li>
            <li>I use the Wahl Trimmer on my full beard.  </li>
            <li>Judging from the sound, the motor is powerful and the battery holds its charge.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it will be good for someones back hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s true</li>
            <li>Stay away spend a bit more money on real quality.</li>
            <li>Good trimming initially, lots of attachments.</li>
            <li>Full compliment of trim heads</li>
            <li>But considering the product as a whole, I couldn&#x27;t give more than 4 stars, and would have given 3 1/2 if it was allowed.</li>
            <li>I really like the trimmer but haven&#x27;t used many of the attachments.  </li>
            <li>Not bad....</li>
            <li>Also pretty loud and a good bit of vibration.</li>
            <li>Customer service says no bad batch of product &amp; offer no assistance that matters.</li>
            <li>in all, it&#x27;s not a bad trimmer.</li>
            <li>Well not bad.</li>
            <li>Very powerful and a charge lasts a good long time.  </li>
            <li>The handle is a magnet for beard clippings, but a quick swipe with a damp sponge will clean it adequately.  </li>
            <li>Better than my previous Wahl rechargeable beard trimmer but not as good as they used to be.</li>
            <li>Bought this trimmer in december used it 30 times more or less on stubble now its sits not operating at all call Amazon given a 815 number to call good luck</li>
            <li>The standard against which a multiple use product like this is to be measured is NOT whether it is the best performing product at each task, but rather whether it performs well enough to replace two or more items in your bathroom or more importantly in your carry on luggage.  </li>
            <li>yeah, my wife is right, I now look civilized.</li>
            <li>Other than that, the old one was great and this new one is just as great.</li>
            <li>It charges quickly, and it holds a full charge a looooong time.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer has enought attachments and depths guides to allow easy trimming exactly the way you need it.</li>
            <li>very nice, but not what I expected.  </li>
            <li>Very cheap - I was only able to use it a handful of times before needing to get something else.  </li>
            <li>This is really the best all-in-one beard trimmer out there for this price and even better than some more expensive products out there.</li>
            <li>The foil shaver isn&#x27;t a high end electric shaver, but it is more than good enough for me.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t get a chance to use the shaver, i assume it works great according to other people&#x27;s reviews.</li>
            <li>It charges very fast, it is very powerful, and so far the charge is holding nicely.</li>
            <li>beard and other trimmer shaver attachments work great as well.</li>
            <li>Just used it the other day to cut my husbands hair and it turned out great with the clipper attachments.  </li>
            <li>All other features are great tho.</li>
            <li>Great trimmer, sharp blades, and 6 trimming levels.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I trimmed his neck with it and the sharp blades did great on those wiry neck hairs.</li>
            <li>do agree with some of the other reviewers that mention the plastic holder that everything sits in does not do a great job of keeping everything in place and</li>
            <li>all the other attachments are a great plus to.</li>
            <li>cuts great with no tugging that you get with other trimmers in this price range.  </li>
            <li>The attachments are functionable, and provide a very close trim, the precision trimmer is quite impressive but heats up a little bit after prolonged use, be hasty with the nose hairs.</li>
            <li>This little trimmer has impressed me so much, that when I replace my dog grooming clippers this summer, I&#x27;m buying Wahl.</li>
            <li>Just as an example of how powerful it is, let me tell you, if I wanted, I could easily use this thing to shave all the hair off my head, probably in about 2-3 minutes... and I have a very large and bushy head of hair.</li>
            <li>After getting the other one replaced, my new trimmer has been working perfectly.</li>
            <li>battery lasts a couple of days, the accessories are very complete, and the trim is very fine.</li>
            <li>The battery seems great, I have only had to charge it once so far and has full power every use!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had two of these now and the first one works just fine still</li>
            <li>First 6 months it worked fine and then it quit working after 7 months.</li>
            <li>Part did not work properly first time I tried to use it--requested return --printed document--trimmer works fine</li>
            <li>It worked fine at first.  </li>
            <li>worked great until almost one whole year later.</li>
            <li>It seems to have \\&quot;wore out\\&quot; rather quickly.</li>
            <li>The power of this trimmer is tremendous.  </li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and it performs just as advertized.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve gotten used to the super close #1</li>
            <li>it got there that quickly.</li>
            <li>I can quickly shave and trim my goatee in minutes.</li>
            <li>Dave trimmed up his mustache and eyebrows quickly, too.  </li>
            <li>and then I am lucky if it finishes without dieing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;In summation for a bearded or mustachioed man on the go this device CAN adequately replace everything it claims to replace with the exception of a nose hair trimmer.vacuum feature to capture hair clippings would be a nice-to-have.</li>
            <li>In summation for a bearded or mustachioed man on the go this device CAN adequately replace everything it claims to replace with the exception of a nose hair trimmer.</li>
            <li>Despite the whisker trimmings attracting rubber grip, the trimmer is adequate and the battery lasts about two months on a charge (for trimmings three times per week).</li>
            <li>trimmer provides plenty of useful attachments, some of which I&#x27;ll never use but they seem good enough.</li>
            <li>The two saving features are the quick charging lithium battery which charges the unit in one hour and</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that these people did not pay for the item and did not actively go out and search for the product they now own.  </li>
            <li>Also, if you run out of juice, it recharges quickly.</li>
            <li>Lithium Ion batteries charge quickly &amp; can charge often with no memory effects</li>
            <li>To be honest, I expected more.</li>
            <li>is that it cuts super close to my scalp because I shave my head.</li>
            <li>I emailed Wahl and got a quick response telling me to send in the shaver and charger.  </li>
            <li>My old Norelco (which died a natural death after years of great service) gave a 100% even trim at any length setting</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had the issue of my clipper&#x27;s battery dying out super quick and eventually losing it&#x27;s charging capabilities.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is underpowered, and the battery dies quickly, then within a couple months is un-rechargeable...</li>
            <li>Luckily nothing broke</li>
            <li>This particular trimmer from Wahl is my all time favorite.</li>
            <li>Came quickly.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace a quickly dying trimmer I&#x27;d owned for years.</li>
            <li>Charges fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>Started losing battery life fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>I noticed that the shaving head rusted quickly, which probably added to the friction load on the spring.</li>
            <li>The documentation is barely adequate.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s exactly what I use this product for, and for the past two years it has worked flawlessly.</li>
            <li>With occasional oiling of the head, this trimmer should give me many more years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m lucky if I get 3 minutes of use after charging it all night.</li>
            <li>Ordered this one, and got it super quick.</li>
            <li>but they never trim as well and quickly wear out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It charges quickly and holds a charge well.</li>
            <li>I will continue to be a loyal customer as a result....</li>
            <li>If you need something quick for travel I would recommend getting this trimmer.</li>
            <li>I think it would have made more sense to decrease the amount of accessories and use the saved money for a better charging function and standard auto-ranging wall-brick.</li>
            <li>i like the super rubber grip of the trimmer, but if you pull it from the tray to quick it will just pull the tray with it and all the pieces will go flying everywhere.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been through numerous trimmers of different brands and this one lasted the longest and worked the best.</li>
            <li>For a beard and extraneous hair cutter, it works adequately.</li>
            <li>Holds charge for what seems like forever (mild usage for me).  </li>
            <li>Most importantly, it just does not work as well as my old Wahl.  </li>
            <li>Additional the blades rusted quickly.</li>
            <li>It is the kind of grip you would want on a golf club or something that has a greater likelihood of slipping out of your hands.  </li>
            <li>However, I discovered that the hairs come off quickly when I blow on them, so this is no longer an issue for me.</li>
            <li>It has lots of different attachments, more than most people would ever need or use</li>
            <li>My son had, repeat, had a somewhat overgrown and mildly unkempt beard/mustache.</li>
            <li>I wanted to check the quick charge function.</li>
            <li>If it wasn&#x27;t overpriced, it was too cheap, and many of the reviews reflected that, but this appears to be the exception so far.  </li>
            <li>And, without a guard on the trimmer, it will pull your hair like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s super</li>
            <li>Trims the beard adequately.</li>
            <li>It was delivered quickly.  </li>
            <li>I just use a 1/8&amp;#34; on my head so it is super</li>
            <li>Cuts super close.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;3 minute quick charge&amp;#34; is nonexistent.  </li>
            <li>as most people (besides me) could figure out, a Van Dyke or most any beard requires maintenance / regular trimming, or you end up looking like a homeless grizzly adams</li>
            <li>Luckily it&#x27;s Li-ion</li>
            <li>quick ship.  </li>
            <li>quick charge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the capable vacuum alone makes it great</li>
            <li>Awesome trimmer, only downside that SOME people may see is that it does not have a vacuum system.</li>
            <li>this is great as a &#x27;balding&#x27; razor for a tight, clean look.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had maybe a dozen personal trimmers over the years, and for the price, this is by far the best - well-made, powerful motor, long-lasting battery, and every kind of useful attachment you&#x27;ll possibly need.  </li>
            <li>Only way to get a good 5 o&#x27;clock shadow is to use the 6 position trimmer at a right angle to face.  </li>
            <li>It was ready for use right out of the box and works much better than any</li>
            <li>Nice, sharp blades (which are ground, not stamped), clean cuts, and overall a great product.  </li>
            <li>It charges very quickly, holds a charge well, and it pretty powerful.</li>
            <li>Overall I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>If you go bald on top or wear a buzz cut, don&#x27;t spend the bucks for a larger, more powerful clipper.</li>
            <li>WAS NOT AS LOUD AS OTHER PEAPLE SAID IT IS VERY GOOD FOR PRICE!</li>
            <li>First, the chrome parts on the body feel extremely cheap.</li>
            <li>The hair cut blade also can be fit with Wahl attachments for more precise and longer hair cuts, and the 10 piece attachment kit only costs 6 dollars.</li>
            <li>Came with so many pieces and has such a great, ergonomic style and battery life that I rate this a solid 5 from Wahl.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It feels good in your hand -- not too heavy and not too light -- and comes with a huge assortment of attachments.</li>
            <li>From the moment I took it out of the box, the cheap workmanship was evident.  </li>
            <li>IS DOES A PRETTY CLOSE SHAVE FOR BEARD SHEARING,&lt;br /&gt;THE RECHARGER WORKS FABULOUS ON IT.</li>
            <li>, good feel in the hand, and lasts a long time between charges.</li>
            <li>Works good, my husband said holds a long charge, hasn&#x27;t charged it since he got it.</li>
            <li>Charge lasts a good long while.</li>
            <li>The charge lasts a long time and my hair dresser girlfreind thinks it is a good quality product.</li>
            <li>Good choice of tips/options and battery lasts as long as you keep it charged vs forgetting about it(standard batt maint).</li>
            <li>-- it seems like it&#x27;s more powerful than the older version, though both work well.  </li>
            <li>I had an older Wahl trimmer which worked great until it died recently.  </li>
            <li>While it is a lighter weight than the older one, it provides superior performance so far.  </li>
            <li>work good , the battery hold the charge for a long time , easy to handle ,small,but to much stuff i just used for a couple weeks</li>
            <li>This trimmer is very high quality and has made for easy maintenance of my beard.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;ll be sporting some new cool designs into his white hair or some great new beard designs.</li>
            <li>very powerful and would absolutely recommend!</li>
            <li>Pretty god trimmer very useful .</li>
            <li>alot better than what he has now, its just one setting and with this new one</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m sure it doesn&#x27;t hurt that I live in Los Angeles.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>fairly ok while its still new, after a month or two it just drops to the ground on its quality, \\&quot;who says no pull?\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Good trimmer with very long battery life.</li>
            <li>It is more powerful, cuts better, battery lasts longer, and is just plain better quality.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s about half the width of my corded Wahl trimmer, which is what I&#x27;ve been using to cut my hair (and does a great job).</li>
            <li>Great portable trimmer, still working after two and a half years.&lt;br /&gt;Never had any issues with it.</li>
            <li>shaver head actually works for a pretty good shave where needed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Trimmer charges quickly and is powerful.  </li>
            <li>The charger was also very quick and ready to use.</li>
            <li>It takes quite a bit of force to snap them on; making me feel pretty sure they will snap off at some point before I&#x27;m ready to be done using this product.</li>
            <li>All of the attachments are very flimsy and feel like they&#x27;ll break easily.</li>
            <li>It really helps him to keep his beard and sideburns in shape easily and neatly</li>
            <li>The super close attachment also works well to clean up the neckline after the first pass with the metal head.</li>
            <li>Accessories pop on and off easy and trimming heads are fast to swap with no tools.</li>
            <li>It keeps a charge very well and easy to operate.</li>
            <li>Battery last quite long and trims perfectly.</li>
            <li>so this is compact enough to travel with and the battery life is pretty good.</li>
            <li>The guard attachment is very flimsy and falls off easily.</li>
            <li>Powerful battery as advertised and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>Use it to trim the whole body and it&#x27;s easy as could be.</li>
            <li>It has so many attachments,  you can trim pretty much anything with this puppy.  </li>
            <li>The battery in this thing is awesome, everything else pretty much sucks.</li>
            <li>I liked the earlier version and was happy to see that basic design and weight were the same in this version with the better battery.  </li>
            <li>Strong, Very Versatile.</li>
            <li>It keeps its edge, and is fast and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very strong, charges fast, and comes with more attachments than you&#x27;re likely to use.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure the little lines were even indicators at first, until I examined all three in bright daylight.</li>
            <li>, it’s perfect and light to hold, not heavy like other brands and very quite.</li>
            <li>But 4.5 years is fair for the low price, used this trimmer head almost every day, the rest of the unit and attachments still work perfectly fine and the battery still works almost like new.  </li>
            <li>I was excited when I first got this, as it seemed to be everything I needed in a beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>Love these things so far!</li>
            <li>This trimmer offers up an excellent choice for those looking to get past the cheap trimmers with abysmal battery life.  </li>
            <li>I used this product for the first time &amp; it cut me to the point of bleeding!  </li>
            <li>: first off, this thing HURTS!</li>
            <li>The look of my beard after a brief cut so impressed my wife that she said I should have bought it a long time ago!</li>
            <li>Exactly what my hairy husband wanted!</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended !!!</li>
            <li>A company like Wahl should have paid attention to small details such as these (it&#x27;s what once made them great); instead they seem to be relying solely on their reputation and good name.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to change the attachments, though most of them seem low quality.</li>
            <li>However, so much hair will stick to the handle that I had to use the toothbrush to clean it in the sink and then clean the sink.</li>
            <li>The best and most powerful I&#x27;ve used I can&#x27;t say enough about this set compared to others I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>Luckily I found the right product.</li>
            <li>Works great has lots of power and attachment, I just hope the battery holds up heard alot of stories about the battery not lasting very long satisfied for now.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is a great device; use it just about every day until it dies and have only charged it THREE times so far!  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the quick delivery!</li>
            <li>While the rubber covering makes it easy to hold it acts like a vacuum cleaner - most of the hair you trim sticks to it.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Super powerful, light weight and fast shaves.  </li>
            <li>Powerful motor that provides a great tight clip for beard and scalp.  </li>
            <li>Though well within reason, the unit is not as quiet as a good Andis trimmer, but you get many more options for less money.  </li>
            <li>and I was replacing a much less elaborate Wahl trimmer that had given me more that ten years of good service.  </li>
            <li>Took the head off and inspected inside, very clean and the unit looks brand spanking new.  </li>
            <li>advice to a new owner is to keep it very clean and lubricated.</li>
            <li>Great little buy.</li>
            <li>the dual head shaver does a great job with little \\&quot;touch up\\&quot; grooming jobs (as in toes, and around ankles, or anywhere else that you missed when you didn&#x27;t have your glasses on, or were grooming by candlelight in the bathroom).&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>This is a great little trimmer.</li>
            <li>Great little machine.</li>
            <li>This is a great little trimmer.  </li>
            <li>This is a great little unit.</li>
            <li>Great little shaver for women and men.</li>
            <li>The little bag holds everything nicely, including the many attachments (not all of which you might use, but you can always throw them out) and the charger.</li>
            <li>this shaver is good and had long time for battery and recharge very fast</li>
            <li>If there&#x27;s one \\&quot;negative\\&quot; aspect to this model, it&#x27;s the rubber handle that seems to attract cut hair (due to static build-up), but it cleans off easily with a light brush.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than the prices available here in Australia.</li>
            <li>For this price I did not buy it expecting it to shave lots of hair away or shave my face baby smooth (haha).  </li>
            <li>Battery/motor power can sound really week but</li>
            <li>I really wish they put some sort of charging indicator light on this</li>
            <li>Especially being so hectic around the holidays for delivery, that was amazing</li>
            <li>The tray for the attachments is huge (as others here have noted) and would take up too much space on my countertop, too.  </li>
            <li>If you really want it smooth though, you&#x27;ll still need a blade.  </li>
            <li>The contacts were connected much too securely to the battery, so I melted the solder at the board and just pulled them out.</li>
            <li>So ladies and gents, don&#x27;t waste your time with the older-technology rechargeables no matter how amazing the blades are or how many toys it comes with.</li>
            <li>Very plastic-y and kinda cheap.</li>
            <li>this stays charged while not in use and charges real fast.</li>
            <li>It is very versatile and smooth.</li>
            <li>The razor is more fun, though, and it is important that rituals such as shaving, hair trimming and the like should be fun.  </li>
            <li>It is surprisingly powerful for being battery operated.</li>
            <li>But the battery is powerful, and just need to be recharged in one hour.</li>
            <li>All in all, definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I just wanted something for those emergency shaves, but most important as a daily beard and mustache trimmer and for haircut touchups.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The long-life-charge of this system is also worth the price of admission.</li>
            <li>shaver is a nice one, but I think looking back on it I would have gotten the Norelco bodygroom trimmer.</li>
            <li>Really powerful.</li>
            <li>Great so far - only had clipper for a month</li>
            <li>Useful Hair sticks to the rubber grip though.</li>
            <li>well worth the money.</li>
            <li>will actually buy a product for myself after that kind of a response.</li>
            <li>However, the battery, which was wonderful at first, will not keep a charge long enough for me to trim my beard!</li>
            <li>the motor is powerful.</li>
            <li>This product is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>They can be used interchangeably by easily snapping on or off of the main unit.</li>
            <li>But with the #1 beard guard, they cut almost nothing off my goatee with 3 days worth of growth on it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-  Powerful.  </li>
            <li>All in all, this trimmer is worth the $40.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fairly quiet which is nice because I have to shave the inside of his ears and his whiskers.  </li>
            <li>The battery alone makes it worth buying</li>
            <li>a bit powerful though.</li>
            <li>Well worth the buy.</li>
            <li>Just be nice to the plastic pieces, and it will last you.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Worth the price ..  </li>
            <li>And it is certainly powerful as promised.  </li>
            <li>Powerful trimmer but needs work.  </li>
            <li>Third, the most important attachment (to me) is the rotary blade that trims nose hair and inside the ear hear, and this is not included, it has to be ordered separately.  </li>
            <li>Certainly powerful enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It feels like it could handle most of the same jobs as a full-size plugin unit, and has the benefit of being light and nimble.</li>
            <li>but is that ever useful.</li>
            <li>but is that ever useful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It would of bee nice for Wahl to include a bag or such to keep everything inside (cord, attachments, etc.).  </li>
            <li>I had it all set up nice, used the trimmer and put it back in the stand and BAM....</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s about the only nice thing I have to say about it.</li>
            <li>Additionally, this trimmer feels as powerful as any corded/plug-in trimmer I have used.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it</li>
            <li>Whal, quality product and worth the money.</li>
            <li>Just wish it came with a nice storage box, perhaps with slots and pockets for oranizing all the individual pieces.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Not feeling the highest quality - makes loud noises after a while, maybe it needs more lubrication.</li>
            <li>I rarely charge it.</li>
            <li>Maybe someday I&#x27;ll use them all but for now I use only two and the trimmer with those two attachments does everything I need done ... effectively and efficiently.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight powerful and has lots of attachments.</li>
            <li>Powerful and diverse.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a nice Panasonic I bought to replace it that doesn&#x27;t need all the attachments because you can dial different trimmer heights.</li>
            <li>I rarely have to charge it</li>
            <li>rarely needs charging</li>
            <li>, this will replace several shavers I own, once I&#x27;ve played with all the attachments.</li>
            <li>have not had success using the 2 headed beard trimming attachment.</li>
            <li>Worth the money..</li>
            <li>They obviously don&#x27;t use their own products.</li>
            <li>The motor is powerful but the trimmer is very compact and comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is well worth $30.</li>
            <li>(a rare find these days)  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe it is worth $30-$40, however.  </li>
            <li>Comes with a useful set of attachments and</li>
            <li>Motor unreliable and alternates speeds when it feels like it, conveniently catching and chomping on your facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>There are far more attachments for varied types of trimming.  </li>
            <li>This product was worth every penny I paid for it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have ordered a replacement trimmmer as Amazon was kind enough to refund my purchase and issue a shipping label for its prompt return, even after their 30 day refund policy had expired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Powerful.</li>
            <li>He has used and own much more expensive trimmers, and He says this is as good or better than the most expensive He has ever own.</li>
            <li>Has professionally ground trimmer head, that is way better than the forged trimmer head (blades) on the cheaper units.</li>
            <li>and this thing does not control the hair length worth doo-doo.</li>
            <li>10x better then my old conair istubble.</li>
            <li>Well worth it</li>
            <li>for the second time it has been repaired and so far it is working great.  </li>
            <li>have used it quite a bit and love it so far,was surprised with the foil shaver</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m pleased.  </li>
            <li>Lets be honest, it is not very likely</li>
            <li>We liked our purchase and would recommend this to the next guy.</li>
            <li>I like that it is very durable, easy to clean, and has many different trimmers to choose from.</li>
            <li>As a male with a penchant for facial hair configurations that require constant upkeep, I have experienced my fair share of trimmers in this variety.</li>
            <li>It has a more powerful motor than the old trimmers and the Li - On batteries stay charged a lot longer.</li>
            <li>It has different attachments for lengths which is nice.</li>
            <li>Powerful, lots of trimming options, holds a charge forever.</li>
            <li>Has a powerful motor</li>
            <li>Anyway, this trimmer is worth</li>
            <li>I use the Wahl for beard/face trimming and shaving my head, and I really love this trimmer so far.</li>
            <li>Made of nice solid plastic, not flimsy at all.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>After my faithful Wahl beard trimmer finally died after 20 years of good service, I decided I&#x27;d look for something that did more than just trim beards - I wanted a combination trimmer that would also double as an electric razor.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;m sincerely surprised to see so many well received reviews</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve realized with these trimmers that there is no one shaver to rule them, but this one has been my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it every day, but it is nice not having to plug it in, like my last one once the battery no longer held a charge.</li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t remember the last time I charged it.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Kind of low rent, of</li>
            <li>And,  lastly it would be nice if all metal headed attachments had protective guards.</li>
            <li>So, rather than being able to drop the trimmer directly onto the charger, you have to plug it in, and then set it on the base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gave me a nice shave and was quiet.</li>
            <li>This unit seems to be well made and comes with useful attachments.</li>
            <li>Powerful motor</li>
            <li>I had about 3 months worth of beard growth and after using 2 attachments I was back to a nice smooth facade (the lady definitely appreciated that).</li>
            <li>Very nice little trim and worth the money.</li>
            <li>And it seems more than adequately well-made to last for many years of normal consumer use.    </li>
            <li>I have had many beard trimmers and this is the first one that easily gets through an entire trimming without slowing down.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that I have to keep the instructions right next to it on the bathroom vanity just to figure out which attachment does which kind of cut and how to connect it, etc.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, and enjoy your product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, it works right out of the box.  </li>
            <li>It is much lighter than the norelco and is very powerful.  </li>
            <li>Still works as good as the first day I bought it which includes weekly trimming of a full beard, using the T-Blade to shave/buzz my hair, and other body trimming as needed.</li>
            <li>Very sleek and contemporary design makes it visually pleasing, the rubberized gripping is a nice touch.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m impressed with how long it has held a single charge...several weeks and counting.  </li>
            <li>Good tool but not very powerful.</li>
            <li>I liked the idea of its light weight due to a lithium battery.  </li>
            <li>The only problem I have had I&#x27;m sure is unique to me.</li>
            <li>Other then that -- great product -- highly recommended!</li>
            <li>main unit is light weight and designed to be very flexible, although it does not feel cheaply made.</li>
            <li>This item arrived quickly and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>i wanted a trimmer with a long lasting battery and professional results ,and this fit the bill perfectly!</li>
            <li>The normal attachment does a great job of shaping your hair and cuts super sharp.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway I really like the unit for my application and obviously battery life is exceptional.</li>
            <li>The main reason I went with this one was for the shave attachment as that is what I use my trimmer for (not as close as a razor, but good enough for my needs).</li>
            <li>other then that it works good, not practical though</li>
            <li>The blades are sharp and they do a good job.</li>
            <li>I never write reviews - probably should - but this Wahl trimmer is so much superior to any other product out there I had to.  </li>
            <li>This gave me an extremely even trim on my beard so good that I came out bragging to my wife about how even it was.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find anything like a 6-position guide, and the only reasonable attachment suitable for a beard doesn&#x27;t really fit the trimmer.</li>
            <li>This is a very good trimmer - long lasting working time,</li>
            <li>speed zips right up when turned to non-useful angles.    </li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>if I don&#x27;t charge them right away, they lose there charge with this product you won&#x27;t have to worry about that.</li>
            <li>And indeed he&#x27;s right; warranty service worked as it should.</li>
            <li>This does your beard right.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s start right into it...</li>
            <li>They just didn&#x27;t seemed like the right item for my needs.  </li>
            <li>After charging this trimmer fully I used it right away to trim my beard and eyebrows.</li>
            <li>It takes chunks of hair out if you don&#x27;t hold it just right.</li>
            <li>and I believe I was right.  </li>
            <li>and I have to angle it to work right.  </li>
            <li>Got the job done while it lasted and came at the right price.</li>
            <li>Hoping someone can make this right.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair and this cuts right thru it with ease, I have yet to use all the attachments (it comes with a lot)</li>
            <li>Our wives/girlfriends of course requested a man-scapeing session right away, and it passed that test with flying colors (and no nicks, scrapes or scratches...</li>
            <li>it came precharged and it shaped me just right</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it three or four times a week for about eight months and it ran at full-power every time, right up to when the battery drain</li>
            <li>The price is right for what you get.</li>
            <li>Their 1/8 guard leaves just the right amount of stubble.</li>
            <li>The price is right.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s right - again.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After doing lots of online shopping, I decided to take the plunge on this guy (Wahl Trimmer All-In-One Lithium Ion) as the price was right - I paid $24.95 at the time from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, the price is just right.</li>
            <li>I have very little hair on top which means I need haircuts often to look nice.    </li>
            <li>Wahl replaced under warranty without receipt and I received an entirely new set which is still going strong.  </li>
            <li>The main unit gets the job done and has a decent motor, but the comb attachments, foil shaver and organizer are very cheap and don&#x27;t function well.  </li>
            <li>I works like a champ, holds an amazingly long charge and offers great control.  </li>
            <li>I keep it clean, oil after every use (after I blow it off with the air compressor-I really do this</li>
            <li>As expected, this doesn&#x27;t have the power of a corded trimmer, but is pretty good for a cordless.  </li>
            <li>The separate charger is brilliant solution to making the rechargeable battery last a long time.  </li>
            <li>It works great on long hair; I wanted to clear a spot around a cut on my leg</li>
            <li>Great trimmer so far long battery life.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s three years old now and it still works great, but I left the charger at home, and I&#x27;ve misplaced most of the attachments now after so many moves.</li>
            <li>Oh, the instruction booklet was intricately detailed on its trimming uses, but not on how to utilize the convoluted combs relative to the attachments, which no longer fit adequately nor stay in place for any of the combinations I attempt.  </li>
            <li>After 3 months I started to notice that it needed a lot more time to charge up and that it could only hold a full charge for one shave.</li>
            <li>It certainly was powerful and took a charge extremely quickly.  </li>
            <li>I will gladly put up with a little extra vibration from a great powerful motor.</li>
            <li>Use a little warm water and easy scrubbing &amp; it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li>The heads switch out very easily and the attachments are simple to change as well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to snap the hair-sizing attachments on and end up with them crooked.  </li>
            <li>The blade detachment design is different, but very easy once you learn how it works...don&#x27;t fear that.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had numerous Wahl clippers over the years, this is best so far, battery charge seems to last \\&quot;forever\\&quot;, well worth the money.</li>
            <li>and although I am using the replacement, I really like this new all-in-one trimmer and will use it repeatedly for many years.</li>
            <li>It still works, but the charge is only good for one or two trimmings, so I decided to get a new one.  </li>
            <li>Even though he hasn&#x27;t tried all the various attachments yet, my husband  loved his new trimmer, which was a birthday gift.</li>
            <li>its very smart and I like it...</li>
            <li>You will be best off by buying like product at a local beauty supply brick and mortar store where you can get customer service without wasting one half of a day on phone calls and returns.</li>
            <li>The top half of the instructions tell about the warranty, things to do to keep safe, how to charge the battery and how to care for the trimmer.</li>
            <li>Cuts my super course facial hair like butta and love the barbershop chrome aesthetics.  </li>
            <li>you MIGHT be able to do one quick trim over your entire beard before the charge died.</li>
            <li>To make matters even BETTER, if you DO hit the end of your battery, charging this thing for ONE MINUTE gives you five minutes of trim time (enough to do a quick shave in a pinch).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the lithium power is really what makes it worth it, cuts quickly, and i don&#x27;t have to always keep charging</li>
            <li>One full month after that same one-hour charge mentioned above, this amazing unit is still going strong.  </li>
            <li>Very precise blade and easy to use and change out for the other extensions.</li>
            <li>The not-so-good: very loud, lots of vibration, throws hair all over the place as it cuts, very cheap plastic snap-on trimmers, limited options in terms of trim length, you need to keep the blades well oiled, not so easy to keep clean.    </li>
            <li>Worth every cent of the higher cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It worked great for that one month, but not sure what happened to make it stop working.</li>
            <li>Excellent replacement for 5 year old earlier version of the same trimmer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through about five different clippers in the last six years or so, and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>I have used several different trimmers over the years, and this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>Its really amazing how long the charge lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The trimmer and accessories are great for just about any beard style, I keep mine at a medium length, just past stubble</li>
            <li>This model comes with far more attachments than most people are ever likely to use.  </li>
            <li>After around the 10th use you have to pass over your face literally 4 or more times to get all the hairs, and I barely have anything to call a beard.</li>
            <li>have only had this product for a short period of time (2 weeks), but so far I have been very impressed.</li>
            <li>The small one is great for trimming nose hairs.</li>
            <li>I take good care of my things, used on average 1.5 times a week, never dropped and I don&#x27;t travel with it.</li>
            <li>Nice trimmer with a long batter life.</li>
            <li>unit.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for a word of pure praise: Kudos to Wahl for their quickly interchangeable head system.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t &#x60;brush&#x27; the  trimmer clean as much as I should, and have oiled it once since I bought it; and it still runs like the first day I used it.  </li>
            <li>is a decent trimmer that doesn&#x27;t look or feel like cheap junk, and does exactly what I want it to do.  </li>
            <li>While we liked that Wahl is still a family-owned company, and the shaver was made in the US, the quality feels a little cheap for the price.</li>
            <li>Once you use this one you will be glad you paid a little bit more.  </li>
            <li>Great trimmer with ample power and quick long lasting charging system.</li>
            <li>Performs extremely well with exceptional battery life.</li>
            <li>I have owned many personal trimmers in the past and this one is by far the best one.</li>
            <li>What is amazing is how long a battery charge lasts: days and days!</li>
            <li>This is very lightweight but does the job faster ad better than most other trimmers.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using my new Wahl shaver/beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>The blades actually fit the model that I&#x27;ve had for years and wore out the blades and had to purchase a new clipper set.  </li>
            <li>There are accessories that are not needed for novice use I have only owned this for two months, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>It is a powerful shaver however my last trimmer did a better job of getting cleaner closer trim of my beard.  </li>
            <li>When I purchased this, I was concerned if it would be good enough to shave my head, which I do frequently.</li>
            <li>Item just as described with super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Great for facial, ear, back neck, side burn trimming.</li>
            <li>All in all this is a great product and if you take care of your personal belongings this will last you for years to come.</li>
            <li>I cleaned it up really nice, put it in a dry spot, and charged it.</li>
            <li>After a quick call to Wahl, a very helpful employee (I wish I got his name) explained the differences between the one I got and the one described in the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the battery is AMAZING, but after that you really can only use this for your beard or mustache.  </li>
            <li>Also the detachable heads fall off quite easily if you give it a smack on the side to try and clear out the hair between the blades while trimming.</li>
            <li>It has been great up until now, but am going back to a Phillips Norelco in the next month or so...</li>
            <li>Charges quickly and really holds its charge.</li>
            <li>I expect products to work properly as intended and this one greatly falls short.  </li>
            <li>I did a few tests on both the \\&quot;T-Trimmer\\&quot; included, and the regular one, and both did superbly.  </li>
            <li>It has the utilities for trimming head hair, and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s powerful enough for that.</li>
            <li>The handle tends to collect particles of cut hair, but is easy enough to clean that this is not an issue for me.</li>
            <li>Very reliable and an extremely quick charge.</li>
            <li>Charges quickly and maintains its charge very well.</li>
            <li>invest few more bucks and get something better.</li>
            <li>I actually was happy to see they still have the same model.</li>
            <li>All in all, a very handy trimmer in a small package.</li>
            <li>This really has a long lasting battery between charging and does a very good job in the power capacity to trim my beard.</li>
            <li>in all seriousness that is exactly what I use this for, slide on the 1/8 guard and you are good to go down there.</li>
            <li>I cant speak about how long it will last, but I am very happy with it, so far.</li>
            <li>If you use it daily, I am sure it needs more charging but for my usage I barely charge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great little trimmer with all the necessary addons to do some basic maintenance at a good price for li-ion.</li>
            <li>The pros include:  - Long battery life  - solid construction and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap while holding  - Good customer service.  </li>
            <li>The foil shaver is pretty good if you just want to get things looking acceptable but doesn&#x27;t get nearly as close as a razor and requires multiple passes.</li>
            <li>- The foil shaving head is great for touching up but too small for daily shaving.</li>
            <li>but in fact it is incredibly powerful, long lasting battery, and its compact size is great for traveling.</li>
            <li>Have a cheap one that is now from the dollar store 2 years old and it still cuts better&amp;#62; If I had not disposed of the packing I would have returned for a refund !</li>
            <li>We are also given a stand with the trimmer, which honestly is too small to be useful but it is a thoughtful addition.</li>
            <li>The first time trying my Norelco to see if it&#x27;d be a suitable replacement proved to be such an immediate and obvious improvement that I immediately discarded the Wahl unit and have not looked back.o settle with the results, though mostly by cleaning up the beard with a pair of scissors after.  </li>
            <li>VERY, VERY VERSITILE .</li>
            <li>I did very much like the attachment that did my mustache and edged my beard.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Recharge time is apparently very fast too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /</li>
            <li>It has a very smooth back and slices the hair off with no tug and pull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I very much disagree.  </li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>Very nice screen-shaver (screen shavers only work with short stubble).</li>
            <li>It does a very capable job of trimming.</li>
            <li>(I know - gross) is very important to me.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how long it lasted and it kept good power right up until the end.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it for that special dad  for father&#x27;s day.</li>
            <li>The blades all seem well made, they seem to be more precise than the others I have used from other makers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seems to be working fine now--I guess it just needed a complete charge__</li>
            <li>I feel this trimmer is more comfortable than all other trimmers  </li>
            <li>It comes with my many attachments, but like other reviewers, i find them cheap and</li>
            <li>Sharp blades and good power, with a ton of adapters gets a very even trim every time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this Trimmer for the past 4 years and the fact that is charges so quickly ans lasts so long makes it an excellent choice.</li>
            <li>It worked nicely, and this unit was EXTREMELY well cared-for, but: today, while I was using it, there was a distinct slowing of the motor and the thing died.  </li>
            <li>Works great but price was a little high.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Powerful, VERY long battery life - 4 months of 1-2 uses a week on one charge, light and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was originally planning to replace the battery and blades, but that would have been two-thirds the cost of a new one.  </li>
            <li>It was quick and easy to give him a short even cut using the comb attachment.  </li>
            <li>The main trimmer head comes with far too many attachments IMHO, and I don&#x27;t say that just because in mine all of the plastic attachments displayed in the box window were duplicated inside.  </li>
            <li>Being the kind of guy that goes through phases of not wanting a clean shave all of the time, I have purchased and used quite a few trimmers over the years to keep my stubble neat.</li>
            <li>a full shave after only a quick, 3-minute charge?!</li>
            <li>a full shave after only a quick, 3-minute charge?!</li>
            <li>, my beard hair tends to stick to the black part of the handle, doesn&#x27;t clean off very easily.  </li>
            <li>* Back to the tray, I think the new design is much, much better (Kudos WAHL!).  </li>
            <li>* Back to the tray, I think the new design is much, much better (Kudos WAHL!).  </li>
            <li>The smaller razor attachment is great for the ears and will fit a little inside the ear.</li>
            <li>I could of kept it seeing as how even in its &amp;#34;broken&amp;#34; state it worked better than most other trimmers but decided to get a new one.</li>
            <li>With very little practice and experimentation, I was achieving perfectly even trims at exactly the lengths I wanted (with different lengths for my beard along my chin and cheeks and for my mustache).    </li>
            <li>Light, easy to maneuver and battery lasts a VERY long time before recharge!</li>
            <li>The battery life is amazing (curious how battery life is the biggest thing touted on this -</li>
            <li>The comb rusted after the first use and</li>
            <li>This the trimmer attachment starts rusting after the first use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am aware that these devices are designed to be disposable and after about a year</li>
            <li>love the power of the razor and the lithium battery provides for weeks of daily use without recharging.</li>
            <li>I mostly use it without the attachments so that is not a big deal to me.</li>
            <li>I charged this one the first time and did not have to charge it again for 9 months.  </li>
            <li>Anyways, it was alright the first couple of weeks</li>
            <li>This Wahl uses Li-ion, besides being lightweight, is more powerful, lasts a long time between charges, and charges quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Already it won&#x27;t hold enough charge to operate for more than 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>I purchased my first unit in september</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I was instantly showing a lot more lip than I had planned on.</li>
            <li>Battery life is outstanding, and what puts it above everything else.</li>
            <li>So we had to purchase the whole kit and caboddle!  </li>
            <li>Hats off to Wahl for developing the first Lithium Ion Trimmer.  </li>
            <li>It pretty much rattles and vibrates but not much cutting.    </li>
            <li>Will it last for a year or more?</li>
            <li>POWERFUL, ULTRA FAST CHARGING, PLENTY OF TRIMMER LENGTHS, SHAVER FOILS etc, NEVER NICKED ME ONCE...</li>
            <li>I tried to turn it on out of curiosity and sure it enough it worked!</li>
            <li>The shaver attachment is useless on my face, YMMV but the beard and hair trimmers are perfect.    </li>
            <li>I purchased the first one for my son.  </li>
            <li>but why am I bothering with this in the first place?  </li>
            <li>It cuts through hair like a hot knife through butter.  </li>
            <li>This was a replacement for another beard trimmer that I had used for more than ten years.</li>
            <li>This thing is not made with staleness steel and got rusted just after the first wash.</li>
            <li>First one never worked and was returned.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Has attachments I&#x27;ll personally never use (maybe) but better to have more than not enough</li>
            <li>Over the last two months I noticed I was charging it more since it wouldn&#x27;t even turn on.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a personal grooming set, this would probably be ok, but if you&#x27;re looking for an all-in-one trimmer set that you can use for haircutting, you should probably look at something else.</li>
            <li>I bought it more than a year ago to replace two different razor sets.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about how wonderful this set is compared to others I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just funny</li>
            <li>It is so much better than the cheaper consumer brands I have owned, such as Conair and Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>not sorry at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even been able to use this for (short) hair cuts.</li>
            <li>The first thing he asked me was, &amp;#34;You know that trimmer</li>
            <li>Higher quality materials would have made this a 5 star product.</li>
            <li>This is my first beard trimmer</li>
            <li>THE FIRST TIME.  </li>
            <li>the first two I owned each lasted two years to the month then just stopped working.  </li>
            <li>I bought a Remington trimmer after my first Wahl and it broke in about two months...</li>
            <li>That was thoughtless of me, not taking into account any of the realities of doing business, even when supporting your products.</li>
            <li>The first thing that you notice is that the supplied stand is not a charging stand.</li>
            <li>but I nicked my face 3X on my first use.</li>
            <li>Until the first curve.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>First off...</li>
            <li>People, be aware of \\&quot;Vine Program\\&quot; reviewers.  </li>
            <li>This is the first trimmer I&#x27;ve owned</li>
            <li>overall I am satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>Of course it is Made in USA so it is considerably better quality than its chinese competitors.  </li>
            <li>First, I would like to point out</li>
            <li>First one lasted me about 8 years before the battery died.</li>
            <li>I wanted to make sure my next trimmer was a wahl since they are known for their quality.  </li>
            <li>Used it for the first time today.</li>
            <li>The various attachments ensure that you have the appropriate tool for any trimming job you may come across.</li>
            <li>Comes with many attachments, but you&#x27;ll only end up using two or three, over and over again.  </li>
            <li>As far as trimming goes, it does a fabulous job.  </li>
            <li>My first one lasted over eight years with weekly go-tee &amp; side-burn trimming use.  </li>
            <li>This one is light years ahead of my 8 year old model.  </li>
            <li>I am still on my first charge of the unit.</li>
            <li>a company representative admitted that the battery&#x27;s \\&quot;smart-chip\\&quot; -tasked with overcharge prevention- may also prevent any charge at all if the unit is left plugged in for more than 3 hours.</li>
            <li>a company representative admitted that the battery&#x27;s \\&quot;smart-chip\\&quot; -tasked with overcharge prevention- may also prevent any charge at all if the unit is left plugged in for more than 3 hours.</li>
            <li>I bought the Wahl in the first week of June and after about 2-3 uses per week, I have yet to charge it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a number of personal groomers and this has remained my favorite.</li>
            <li>Amazon wouldn&#x27;t post my first comment, so let me try again.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The storage is one of the great features, at least in my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The storage is one of the great features, at least in my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First, i was amazed at the number of attachments included in the set.</li>
            <li>Many different attachments.  </li>
            <li>The rubberized grip is a nice feature, even with wet hands.   </li>
            <li>I was already sold on Wahl based on the quality of my first one, but leaped at the opportunity to purchase Lithium-Ion technology based on my 30-years&#x27; experience with battery-powered hand tools and the evolution of battery technology in them.  </li>
            <li>Lithium-Ion is the current state of the art for most consumer-level products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>opened the box, read the instructions, and gave the unit its recommended 1 hour charge before first use.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what I need it to do.</li>
            <li>I bought this trimmer because my former trimmer, also a Wahl, no longer held a charge after many years of faithful service.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to replace a cheaper Remington model on which the guard I use most frequently finally broke.</li>
            <li>Many different attachments and length guards.</li>
            <li>First impression:  </li>
            <li>First week, I had to request a refund, it just stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>More for facial than hair cuts.</li>
            <li>More maintenance is required for the blade that regular trimmers.</li>
            <li>At first it was a pain switching combs.</li>
            <li>this is the best wahl shaver i&#x27;ve used for my face in the past ten years.</li>
            <li>Honestly, those six parts seem redundant with the 6-position trimming guide, or are for people as fussy as professional beard stylists... who would undoubtably use better equipment.</li>
            <li>but there are too many attachments or not enough room for all of them</li>
            <li>Worked well when I first tried it out.</li>
            <li>Initially, I had gotten this Trimmer after reading a glowing review by an outlet(I don&#x27;t remember the name of the site) that stated that out of all the trimmers they had tried, this was the most consistent.</li>
            <li>That is unfortunately not the case.</li>
            <li>First, there is no storage tray as shown in the picture.  </li>
            <li>Because beard grooming is the most desirable part of mens personality and this product simply makes your life easier.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first one was almost identical to this one.  </li>
            <li>I wind up pulling the head off first before I get the guide off.</li>
            <li>This is my first trimmer, and it does the job.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>First review:</li>
            <li>I have had many trimmers in my day and this is the only one that I feel isn&#x27;t underpowered.</li>
            <li>Broke after first shave.</li>
            <li>Within the first year a blade broke.</li>
            <li>The first one I bought at Wal-Mart 5 years ago.  </li>
            <li>pretty well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It served me for more than five years, and did a hell of a job trimming back a beard.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although it can&#x27;t get quite as close to my face as the Remington did in its prime, it gets close enough to give me a &amp;#34;I shaved 12 hours ago&amp;#34; look, which I find is acceptable in most realities nowadays.</li>
            <li>No warning no weird sounds just turned the power button on and nothing.</li>
            <li>I had to recharge it for a while first.</li>
            <li>That one use I got out of it was pretty stellar though.</li>
            <li>This is my first trimmer</li>
            <li>I love that it has several guards.</li>
            <li>Most recent one lasted 15 months.</li>
            <li>This is my first beard and thus my first beard trimmer</li>
            <li>the first time I tried using it</li>
            <li>The switch, I&#x27;m assuming, crapped out in the first three months.  </li>
            <li>But I figured it could be a simple project that keeps me from having to spend more money on a replacement or dealing with the warranty (which was probably out now that I had taken it apart).    </li>
            <li>During its first charge it&#x27;s going to sit somewhere fire-resistant just in case.    </li>
            <li>so I can trim more often than having to get out a case from under the sink, plug it in, wrap it back up in the case and stow it away.</li>
            <li>This trimmer stopped charging in first week.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be the first to admit, I ask a lot from any trimmer I purchase.  </li>
            <li>First the battery started dying quicker and quicker.  </li>
            <li>I wish they&#x27;d unbundled most of them into an optional expanded attachments set, because the only attachment I want or need is the adjustable depth trimmer guide.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Has many accessories for all your possible needs</li>
            <li>The first one I must have thrown away as I could not find it.  </li>
            <li>And if you are interested in your manscaping as well as giving yourself a haircut then this is the product for you.</li>
            <li>I charged it per the instructions when it first arrived and haven&#x27;t had to charge it again once since then (about a month as of this writing).  </li>
            <li>I charged it per the instructions when it first arrived and haven&#x27;t had to charge it again once since then (about a month as of this writing).  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Broke sometime after I used it the first time I guess, just went to shave and nothing happened.</li>
            <li>I have only used this trimmer three times now, but I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>I only had to charge it once a week at the most.</li>
            <li>but you have to look closely to be sure they&#x27;re properly seated.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my first beard/mustache trimmer</li>
            <li>The larger blade could do it, but I feel like I have more control.</li>
            <li>and I was able to get the same product.</li>
            <li>but I definitely wont buy any more of their products.</li>
            <li>To ensure this never happened again I coated all the metal contacts with hot glue to keep out the water.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer worked well for the first 6 months</li>
            <li>The battery does not stay charged for more than an hour (of non-use) and in the last three days the unit has stopped responding to the On/Off button.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what he needed, and he seemed to like it.  </li>
            <li>it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The battery in my first trimmer would not hold a charge, but Amazon replaced it promptly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only issue I have is there are to many attachments.  </li>
            <li>This is the first trimmer I have ever bought where this is not the case.</li>
            <li>This is my secong Wahl trimmer, because my first trimmer went out because I shaved feces off my dog&#x27;s butt</li>
            <li>To first put things in context I don&#x27;t use this trimmer as an \\&quot;all-in-one\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>The product is exactly as discribed.</li>
            <li>is it cuts hair pretty close to the skin.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m pleased though.</li>
            <li>The first one was a Wahl that looked just like this.</li>
            <li>So many attachment that I actually read the instructor manual....</li>
            <li>I bought my trimmer back in October and use 2-3 times a week and love it.</li>
            <li>I just had to charge it for the first time.  </li>
            <li>Should be the first thing a man buys himself.</li>
            <li>Now i have to pay for an accessory it should have had in the first place.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t needed a charge since the first.</li>
            <li>It worked well the first year, but I won&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li>My husband got one first.  </li>
            <li>More than enough attachments for every need.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Accidentally I broke the first one during a trip and I didn´t hesitate to have it again ASAP.</li>
            <li>The first lasted about 5 years</li>
            <li>After having a Wahl for many years, I decided that we would go with another one when his first finally quit working.</li>
            <li>First off I don&#x27;t have anything against Wahl.</li>
            <li>Love the battery life, I only have charged it once.</li>
            <li>I estimate that I have now enjoyed 30+ shaves without a recharge, with each shave lasting about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Item was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I contacted Wahl and they weren&#x27;t interested.</li>
            <li>I have had it for a couple weeks now and is still on its first charge.  </li>
            <li>the blade was rusty literally within the first 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li>While this isn&#x27;t a completely skin smooth shave</li>
            <li>it did the first time I used it</li>
            <li>hot glued to something, it&#x27;s going to go scattering the moment you try to place something in it and the amount of attachments are stupefying.  </li>
            <li>I have owned several wahl trimmers and I am always satisfied with the performance and durability of their products.</li>
            <li>Once we get the replacement I will update my rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Second trimmer has been much better.</li>
            <li>He has coarse beard hair and wears a beard or a goatee most of the time.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t pull the hair even after it gets hot.</li>
            <li>We find them to be pretty quiet,and do the job with ease.</li>
            <li>The type is smaller that that used on the safety instructions on the top panel</li>
            <li>I was inconvenienced and couldn&#x27;t use it in the shower, but this was my first WAHL</li>
            <li>The blades move faster, are smaller and cut much better.</li>
            <li>It gives like a day 4 stubble, where as i prefer it to be a bit more short.</li>
            <li>I recommend moving the shaver in the opposite direction of the hair growth for a better stubble</li>
            <li>Too much work!  </li>
            <li>Very solid value, but certainly more for light/medium tasks.</li>
            <li>Started having difficulty with the switch within the first month or so.. it now will not work at all..  </li>
            <li>All In One Trimmers (9854-600) as gifts…Recipients were pleased with the trimmers, overall quality, all of the attachments, and the battery life.</li>
            <li>Le complaints of this exact problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>More than enough power to manscape.</li>
            <li>and it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;m pretty pleased with the overall battery life.</li>
            <li>But, this brings me to my first issue.</li>
            <li>I actually was not expecting to be so satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I am an avid Amazon.com customer</li>
            <li>The charge lasts a long time and it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The cleaner &amp; lubricated you keep it, the better &amp; longer it will last.</li>
            <li>: Loud, cheap material, broke after 5 or 6 uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After several weeks of use I am so pleased with this trimmer.</li>
            <li>The trimmer was a good value with many attachments, but it is not ideal for edging/shaping.</li>
            <li>After using a couple of times I wasn&#x27;t satisfied, so I took it to my barber and to get his opinion, or some pointers (maybe I wasn&#x27;t using it properly).  </li>
            <li>This is light trim, no heavy duty stuff here..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had mine for 2 or 3 weeks now, and still running off of the first charge.</li>
            <li>I had to return the first one after a week, because it died.</li>
            <li>They really last and do well in many ways.</li>
            <li>the charge last thru several trims and is easy on the skin trims close and the attachment work really well, easy to use and easy to change attaments</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I imagine most people looking to buy this would be looking to use it regularly.  </li>
            <li>charge has never failed while using it.</li>
            <li>standard blade and small detail blade are excellent though with a close cut (as close as a trimmer like this can get anyway) and no snagging or nicks to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We are not sorry.  </li>
            <li>A piece broke off the first week of having the product.</li>
            <li>Had the first one for about 5 yrs</li>
            <li>The first time you charge, they recommend charging for 1 hour.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>First, the stand that this comes with is a joke.</li>
            <li>This will be my first review ever on Amazon.</li>
            <li>First off, I was looking to replace my Remington Trimmer which was a piece of trash and for the strangest reason I stuck with it for like 2yrs.</li>
            <li>the first 4 times.</li>
            <li>The accessories are one too many for the same application.</li>
            <li>Overall 3 stars mostly for the lithium battery.</li>
            <li>First off, I&#x27;ll tell you what I use it for:</li>
            <li>but, this one is so much better and such a closer shave.</li>
            <li>The electric-razor attachment seems to work pretty s***tily</li>
            <li>I bought mine 14 months ago (my first Wahl product and my first trimmer ever), and have used it about once a month since then, sometimes twice.</li>
            <li>first anyway.  </li>
            <li>First is that the cut hair seems to stick to the surface of the trimmer.  </li>
            <li>exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>First of all let me start by saying that the price is unbeatable, how did I pay under $50 for this?</li>
            <li>I love this company and the quality can&#x27;t be beat, God Bless the USA and American manufacturers like Wahl!</li>
            <li>I have used Wahl for years and was pleased with my last trimmer.</li>
            <li>Has a lot more power than the standard Ni-cad on.</li>
            <li>Bought it when I first heard about the lithium-ion batteries.  </li>
            <li>Since my first charge, I have not charged it once, nor have I noticed the need to charge it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried over several hours and made sure all connections are correct but:</li>
            <li>I will first say that, performance-wise, this is a 5-star trimmer.</li>
            <li>Wahl narrow blade head not as good for faster trims.</li>
            <li>I have full thick beard and keep it fairly</li>
            <li>The battery is good for just a few minutes</li>
            <li>As someone else noted, the grip handle is incredibly good at hanging onto hair clippings, but it&#x27;s not a huge problem.</li>
            <li>I initially replaced this with the previously mentioned Remington (which wasn&#x27;t very good).</li>
            <li>Switched to the norelco vacuum trimmer and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>The trimmer should have no trouble charging the new battery, as I made sure to splurge on a \\&quot;protected\\&quot; one which should prevent any over-charging or over-draining.</li>
            <li>This thing is very powerful, and loud when the battery is fully charged.  </li>
            <li>It is very useful for people with a busy schedule.</li>
            <li>I purchased one of these 2 years ago that got dropped in a toilet (and fortunately it was clean</li>
            <li>It cuts great, but I was surprised to find the rubber separated from the chrome part of the unit in less than a year.  </li>
            <li>Works very well, easy to maintain, complete, reliable.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s fine (but the point is to be smooth, too, right?)  </li>
            <li>wow!!!!  </li>
            <li>Instructions could be better, there is one adjustable attachment that so far I haven&#x27;t been able to adjust due to fear of breaking it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also worth noting that this trimmer is easy to clean compared to other clippers that I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I see a lot of rave reviews about the power of the battery on this, and yes that is true when the unit is new.  </li>
            <li>That 6-position trimmer attachment is what I use, and it&#x27;s fine, though adjusting it&#x27;s height requires a little more effort than it should.    </li>
            <li>It is a great little trimmer and this version is slimmer, more solid and better looking than the previous model.  </li>
            <li>These guys need to get together with some Italian and Japanese designers and make this basic motor a more versatile and more easily handling &amp;#34;All in One&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>positive first</li>
            <li>It was so sharp and everything that comes with it is amazing.</li>
            <li>To fix that, make sure you lay it flat when trimming.  </li>
            <li>The attachments don&#x27;t pinch or poke my skin and the blade is sharp, keeping everything nice and even.</li>
            <li>The Shaver attachment is useless for the most part, the detail attachment works pretty good also.</li>
            <li>+ yr&#x27;s as I&#x27;m a former long distance cyclist, &amp; you learn quickly that that area is better off smooth for cycling purposes.</li>
            <li>Ended up ordering a new battery for my Norelco 7775x and figuring out how to solder since that device works as I expect (the trimmer attachment) and is waterproof, has a charge indicator and is much easier to clean.</li>
            <li>This new one cuts much better than the old one ever did, and a battery charge lasts much longer.</li>
            <li>Another great thing about it is the ability to be able to see where I&#x27;m cutting.</li>
            <li>Great product -- the extra wide trimmer helps keep those sideburns in check with one pass.</li>
            <li>trimmer is great for keeping your facial hair neatly trimmed and if you&#x27;re used to having a military style haircut</li>
            <li>It has a powerful motor, a battery that stores a decent about of charge and loads of accessories (16).     </li>
            <li>and I love the convenience of being able to shave in less than 5 minutes instead of having to plug in my bulky old clippers.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is great but the shaver in the kit was less than usless it dosent really shave or anything it took about 10 min to \\&quot;Shave\\&quot; about a inch of facial hair,but lucky for me</li>
            <li>Makes a clean cut for the 19 yr old son.</li>
            <li>Better change you warranty to 1 year, because your product often fails to even meet that!io that had a 1-year warranty has been going strong for more than 10 years.    </li>
            <li>really like this trimmer and the attachments that come with it, as can be evidenced by the fact that I bought a second one :)  </li>
            <li>really like this trimmer and the attachments that come with it, as can be evidenced by the fact that I bought a second one :)  </li>
            <li>Cons:  Really the same cons as most clippers.  </li>
            <li>CHEAP - looks like they could make bases that are truly meant to last, and be useful.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is really a cut above all the rest, and I&#x27;m so glad I found it 5 months ago.</li>
            <li>The charge on this trimmer is impressive, seems to last at least a month.</li>
            <li>The foil shaver attachment could be better, but overall I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li>Prior to this, I had big corded Wahl clippers that lasted 10+ years before they broke, so I had a good impression of their products.</li>
            <li>The trimmer has plenty of accessories to cover multiple uses, and the shaving attachment actually works surprisingly well.</li>
            <li>: This is the major selling point; I fully charged it when I received it and have been using it off and on over the last two months ON THE VERY FIRST CHARGE, and it is still going strong!  </li>
            <li>So, for a much cheaper price, this does fine, just takes a little more time.  </li>
            <li>with cordless circular saws, cordless weed eaters, cordless vacuum&#x27;s, its probably better to just get the corded version unless you &#x27;really&#x27; need that feature.  </li>
            <li>However, Wahl has revealed itself to be a very consumer &amp; environmentally unfriendly company with this design, as most folks will simply send a good piece of machinery, &amp; a used up Li-Ion battery along with it, to their local landfill, simply because it needs a new battery!!</li>
            <li>The price for the kit was very reasonable and the delivery was fast.  </li>
            <li>, 90% of the men simply go around straight to Raser without thinking its better to first remove it with a trimmer and then use raser.. because using raser straight on a dense shave will not leave your skin with any goodness..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through many sets of clippers in the past 20 years and these are actually the BEST I&#x27;ve ever owned, probably by a wide margin.  </li>
            <li>The thing comes with tons of little add-on bits and bob, and they don&#x27;t really seems to fit into the stand in any coherent way.  </li>
            <li>For just a little bit more the Wahl  lithium ion trimmer is far better.</li>
            <li>Very powerful, long lasting charge, the multitude of interchangeable heads is quite nice and the whole trimmer feels sturdy and well built.</li>
            <li>Second, it gets hot very quickly (yes, I used blade oil).  </li>
            <li>They also say &amp;#34;Do not use the trimmer while it is charging.&amp;#34;  It only takes 1 minute for a Quick Charge to provide 5 minutes&#x27; use, they say, or 60 for a full charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>the thing that has the screens over the blades like a typical electric razor, its not really wide, but when i&#x27;m just doing my neck its great.  </li>
            <li>I see a lot of positive reviews</li>
            <li>I dont know what you guys are all positive about ?  </li>
            <li>It is competitively priced and has lots of positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Otherwise great, torque and battery life especially, and better than the several Norelco units I&#x27;ve had previously.</li>
            <li>This is a very powerful trimmer, but it has a major flaw in the design.</li>
            <li>Not a good showing for build quality, but the rest of the kit is great</li>
            <li>It make short work of the job, needs recharging only once a year, is more reliable than the Norelcos I have had, and is quite comfortable to use --</li>
            <li>The shaver attachment did not shave very well the first time I use dit.  </li>
            <li>More powerful than the plug-in versions from other manufacturers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Apart from this, the rest of my review remains pretty much in tact...</li>
            <li>As long as it&#x27;s charged (which it always is) who takes more than maybe two clips?</li>
            <li>Love the lithium battery too, lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Pretty much the two things I have learned over the years to *</li>
            <li>Only appropriate for light body hair &amp; facial sculpting.</li>
            <li>Pretty much stuck w/them now</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m bald (most of the time) and use this a lot when my hair gets to long</li>
            <li>tray sucks, its way too light and cheap, i couldn&#x27;t even figure out how all the pieces were suppose to fit in it.</li>
            <li>At first this bothered me a lot, even though I appreciated the safety value of the sticky handle.</li>
            <li>At first, it worked really well</li>
            <li>I have only used the regular trimmer and the t-trimmer so far, but everything is working great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight, but you can really feel the power the first time you shave.  </li>
            <li>thankfully i was able to shave to my satisfaction before the charge died, which wasn&#x27;t long at all.  </li>
            <li>Once I managed to attach a beard guide (not my first choice but the first one I was able to attach after three or four tries) and began shaving I noticed that the trimmed hairs stuck to the body of the unit.  </li>
            <li>I have had Wahl products in the past with good results.</li>
            <li>This is far superior to other trimmers.</li>
            <li>I got lazy and buzzed a good chunk of my goatee out with it by accident, but that was my fault.  </li>
            <li>The foil shaver head is small also, but works good for a foil shaver.  </li>
            <li>The small size makes it good for travel.</li>
            <li>It also comes with a junky miniature comb, a good cleaning brush and a small amount of oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, if you can get past that, for the money, it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>This is a fine product that works very well and has many different options and attachments to multiply its versatility.  </li>
            <li>Then bought this exact prodduct with a lithium battery which worked on an initial test, just running it but not using it, which worked fine.  </li>
            <li>It worked fine for the first month and then suddenly would not hold a charge.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure it would be easy to use and work well at first, came with lots of attachments and seemed confusing.</li>
            <li>The other reviews are right, I&#x27;m glad I trusted them.  </li>
            <li>In fact, despite offering a more consistent beard trimming experience, it actually takes more passes over my head to get the hair down to that afore-mentioned stubble.</li>
            <li>I originally didn&#x27;t think this was built any better than competing products but after more time I was proven wrong.</li>
            <li>I think this is definitely worth more $ so long as it stays alive!</li>
            <li>so well I kept it for detail dog grooming and bought my husband a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>Trimmer has a very powerful motor, But there were only 3 depth attachments, which are only good for short buzz cuts.</li>
            <li>The Remington has only one guide and an easy to use thumb wheel to adjust the length.  </li>
            <li>Personally, I find that a mute point, as it&#x27;s easy to wipe them off by hand or with a towel.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a lot of power and easily handles the basic trimming operations I use it for.</li>
            <li>The attachments are easy to interchange and simply snap on and off.</li>
            <li>The metal blades rust easily even though they were never exposed to water, only to sweat.  </li>
            <li>I bought this back in January and have yet to find an easy, reliable way to change the heads or settings.  </li>
            <li>The clipper is easy to handle and has a lot of different attachments.</li>
            <li>I find it kind of odd to have to guide the wire and plug it in separately.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find it kind of odd to have to guide the wire and plug it in separately.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The various tools are fairly easy to change, once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleaning is easy but not easier than cleaning a regular razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are several trimming heads that easily swap out.</li>
            <li>Lightweight, easy to use, battery strong enough to allow periodic use when traveling without constant charging.  </li>
            <li>I have had another batter powered trimmer for about a year, which was cheaper, and much less effective.</li>
            <li>and it comes off easy enough.</li>
            <li>I like how you can easily change from one head to the next.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like me who have this super sensitive skin and can&#x27;t shave with no type of razor</li>
            <li>It is a bit loud, particularly when you&#x27;re near (or in) your ears, but it&#x27;s not terrible.</li>
            <li>Basic and easy.</li>
            <li>It cuts and trims just like its big brother, if you trim your own hair or keep it bare, this is the item for you.</li>
            <li>As long as the person using it knows basic haircutting techniques, then your hair looks good without the expense of a salon hair stylist.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend the Wahl L/I Trimmer for your personal use or as a gift.</li>
            <li>The core unit is strong and solid in the hand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only charged it once and the motor still seems strong.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise this is a good buy for shorter beards/mustaches as there are no attachments for long facial hair.</li>
            <li>Strong motor,  fairly quiet operation.  </li>
            <li>The shaver does a good job but dosent stay charged long enough for me to finish.</li>
            <li>Good trimmer, long lasting with no problems.</li>
            <li>I promptly charged its battery, as directed, and it is still going strong two weeks later!  </li>
            <li>Look elsewhere; this is low quality junk diminishing the strong Wahl brand.  </li>
            <li>This one is a good basic trimmer as long as you take care of it</li>
            <li>I was a little nervous about this purchase as someone I know had a Wahl trimmer that they were less than impressed with.  </li>
            <li>I was not disappointed with my choice, the battery seems to be better than the original, at least as far as I can remember!</li>
            <li>About 10 months after I purchased it, the trimmer started dying before I was able to finish a single trim.  </li>
            <li>He has told me that the large trimmer attachment does well with his manscaping, while the medium attachment does well with face and neck.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The nose hair trimmer I found to be a bit large</li>
            <li>They might as well have just made it out of pure glue</li>
            <li>This item has certainly met my expectations.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to replace one of the large corded Wahl units.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would certainly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>There are two comb attachments for trimming hair to a certain height.</li>
            <li>pulls from time to time, but the reviews were largely correct</li>
            <li>certainly recommend this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer comes with a large selection of adapters.</li>
            <li>Other than that, quick easy changes from trimmer head to trimmer head.</li>
            <li>On a positive note, it trimmed really well while it worked.</li>
            <li>At that point, you are left with a clipper that is very powerful, does exactly what you need it to do, and doesn&#x27;t require a cord.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As long as you aren&#x27;t the type of guy who HAS to shave with a regular razor in order to not have scruff, the Wahl should fit most, if not all of your needs.</li>
            <li>It runs around 1/4 of the original speed and barely cuts hair at all anymore</li>
            <li>&quot; allow you to keep the length nice and even in depth, and the actual shaver head isn&#x27;t too bad either, although I use a safety razor for that, since one has to come right up to the Van Dyke to keep a clean edge, and most electric razors won&#x27;t get that task done easily.  </li>
            <li>Eg, more than 50% of the cost to buy an entire new unit.  </li>
            <li>I recently bought a new shaver (made by phillips) and it is 10x better than this electric paper weight.</li>
            <li>After my last Wahl shaver decided to give it up after a very very long time, it was time and it was more cost effective to buy a new Wahl vs getting the elderly model fixed.</li>
            <li>At first it worked fine, 3-4 weeks later it only worked if it was plugged in, then 3-4 more weeks it completely stopped working</li>
            <li>black handle is a soft, rubbery material which is good to hold onto.</li>
            <li>The lithium Ion allows me to use this trimmer for 5-10 minutes every morning for more than a week in between charges, AND the motor does not become noticeably less powerful as the charge goes</li>
            <li>This set is nice for the price and what you get, but the blade does not cut down close enough to your skin and does not leave your skin smooth (i.e., you get stubbles).</li>
            <li>(right after Christmas because Santa forgot to bring me a new trimmer).</li>
            <li>Other than that, offers plenty of attachments, easy to use, and easy to change those attachements.</li>
            <li>(I found this unit advertised at a large electronics superstore for just under $20 after buying my 4th all-in-one cordless trimmer from a large deparment store that has a 110% price guaranty, so I really found a bargain).   </li>
            <li>It is very sharp and seems to do a good job, although a bit narrow for top head hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The littlest one is the right size to go around the ears and catch the stray hairs on the top of my head without creating big bare rectangles if I accidentally touch the skin.  </li>
            <li>When it worked as new, it was very powerful but extremely loud.</li>
            <li>The upside would be that it worked pretty well for the price at first, it was better than a similiar $30-40 trimmer from another brand that I&#x27;d previously purchased(that one also quit working in under a year).</li>
            <li>There must have been a short circuit or something because the unit has worked fine ever since.</li>
            <li>I have taken this one along to places where recharging was not an option, and if worked fine for several beard trims and even touch-up haircuts.</li>
            <li>Too many parts, no decent storage, incnvenient o change heads.    </li>
            <li>The 3rd one seems to work fine.  </li>
            <li>They still work fine, but look kinda gross.</li>
            <li>I only use 2 of the attachments and both work fine.  </li>
            <li>that, I love it, compared to multiple previous trimmers, mostly Wahl:  PROS:</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty picky and use it alot, about once a week, and i&#x27;ve been through many other types.</li>
            <li>He loves the attachments included and it holds a decent charge!</li>
            <li>The biggest advancement over older Wahl models is the Li-ion battery!</li>
            <li>It was decent for the first month.  </li>
            <li>I had to used it to shave when my main clippers broke and it has done the job pretty well with zero skin irritation.</li>
            <li>Mine held its first charge decently well, through probably 5 or 6 shaves</li>
            <li>I dont really recommend it due to inconvenience, because for the price you should be able to easily just pop one head unit off and a new one on.&lt;br /&gt;otherwise, this trimmer loud, which is fine with me, and it definitely cuts hair.</li>
            <li>The swap seems well-controlled, the pieces fit tight without anything feeling cheap or flimsy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Though made specifically for men, a little experimenting convinced me that parts of the system can be used effectively for women&#x27;s grooming too.</li>
            <li>but honestly I have so little faith in this product and this company I don&#x27;t think I would take a replacement at any price.</li>
            <li>The nose trimmer is much too large to fit comfortably in a nostril, and - though it has seven guide attachments in total -- there are no guide attachments for use on eyebrows (only a hand-held comb, which is easy to move).</li>
            <li>When I first saw this product I had high expectations and maybe that&#x27;s my fault,</li>
            <li>The only good thing I have to say about it is the blades are sharp, and as long as you don&#x27;t want to use the adjustable trimmer, you should be able to suffer through it.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, that attachment isn&#x27;t very good at all.</li>
            <li>I almost didn&#x27;t buy this trimmer because of the large number of negative reviews, but took a shot anyway based on the good reviews.</li>
            <li>It is the most powerful rechargable trimmer I have ever had and charges in as little as an hour.</li>
            <li>it being a little more powerful.  </li>
            <li>This little trimmer cuts through the scraggle smoothly and comfortably with the wider trimmer blade.</li>
            <li>Wahl is perfect for cleaning up, trimming, and the little touch-ups I have to do every few days or so to keep from looking like a bum.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer is so good I hardly need my razor anymore.  </li>
            <li>and i get a good trim in those hard to get areas</li>
            <li>The spacer attachments for trimming beard/mustache length seem to grab hair quite a bit, I need some more time to mess with them, if I can&#x27;t fix that I&#x27;ll be using my old vacuum trimmer to occasionally trim length, but will still be keeping this for shaping as it works great.</li>
            <li>right there whenever you need them - otherwise I would not clean and oil it as often as I should:)    </li>
            <li>Working great as a trimmer - I&#x27;ve had it a few months and only charged once.</li>
            <li>We all have cameras on our phone and taking and providing an accurate picture is very simple.</li>
            <li>it should have a light, something, an indicator of how much charge is left.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my beard because of the advertised attachments but it only has one reasonable attachment for that and the attachment doesn&#x27;t fit the clipper.</li>
            <li>Works great, I only use a few of the attachments</li>
            <li>I put the larger trimmer attachement along with the accompaning guards to trim body hair and even give a few hair cuts with great results.  </li>
            <li>I took it few months ago and it works great with even occasional charging.</li>
            <li>get very close unless you really PUSH it into your face).</li>
            <li>so really you have to plug the cable in while the trimmer is out of the stand and then set it in after.  </li>
            <li>I dont use these clippers very often; maybe once in 2 weeks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair got caught between the plastic attachment and blade and pulls just as much hair out as it cuts.</li>
            <li>very time consuming.</li>
            <li>Maybe instead of a flimsy plastic tray filled with junk accessories they could have spent the money to make a more solid product.</li>
            <li>The blades are incredibly precise and are reminiscent of a bygone era.</li>
            <li>The attachments and stand work very well and are well designed.</li>
            <li>The nose/ear/eyebrow attachment works very well and</li>
            <li>Not so much for shaving, before work.&lt;br /&gt;-  </li>
            <li>About 6 months ago, I started noticing that the battery wasn&#x27;t holding as much of a charge as it used to.</li>
            <li>I had to ding 1 star on this one, the shaving attachment really doesn&#x27;t work that well at all.</li>
            <li>I definitely expected more from the Wahl brand.</li>
            <li>I also found cleaning the accessories and blades to be a pain, hair seems to really find a way to get tucked in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Without sounding like too much of an ad for Norelco, the Norelco guards and blades on my current unit very simply and easily provide the clean, even trimming that I had been struggling to get with the Wahl unit.  </li>
            <li>Without sounding like too much of an ad for Norelco, the Norelco guards and blades on my current unit very simply and easily provide the clean, even trimming that I had been struggling to get with the Wahl unit.  </li>
            <li>Hair clipper is very narrow.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>My husband dislikes it so much that I am looking for a replacement for him</li>
            <li>Made very cheaper.</li>
            <li>you really don&#x27;t know what goes where</li>
            <li>It retains charge very well.  </li>
            <li>(Thanks BTW)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about this product is the cheap case used to hold all the attachments and accessories.</li>
            <li>The tray gets really crowded, so I&#x27;ve take some of the attachments I&#x27;m never going to use and put them in a drawer.</li>
            <li>If this trimmer can deal with my whole body in one charge...it can handle anyones.</li>
            <li>Much easier to use  UPDATE:  </li>
            <li>I bought this ONE MONTH ago and it works well, very well.</li>
            <li>Really pisses me off b/c</li>
            <li>I will have to take the item to a service center more than 50 miles away.</li>
            <li>I really had no problem with this trimmer/razor until it just died..</li>
            <li>When it was working it did very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, I really need the foil shaver head to work.</li>
            <li>and then if I went to fast.</li>
            <li>I recommend this trimmer for it&#x27;s ease of use, variety of specialty attachments that snap on and off and for it&#x27;s superb cutting power.</li>
            <li>Well, It Does Very</li>
            <li>/&gt;Comes with too much junk -- inflates the price for cheapo plastic &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>will see how much that will cost.  </li>
            <li>but works very well.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li>but it if you really need the foil shaver part.    </li>
            <li>Come on people, really complaining that they give you too much?  </li>
            <li>Spend the 32 bucks for the trimmer and enjoy hands-on personal grooming.</li>
            <li>very professional.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for what it does as a trimmer, but woefully deficient as a detailer (hence wanting this Wahl with all the options).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>have to admit that I really appreciate the shaver/blade/accessories tray that comes with this Wahl.</li>
            <li>The adjustable trimmer guide provides more choices without switching attachments, but it is susceptible to slipping under pressure, resulting in a closer trim than you intended.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I use a blade for all of my shaving - to achieve the actual skin smooth results.    </li>
            <li>I really had my doughts about a rechargable trimmer</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s better than I expected at this price</li>
            <li>To the reviewers who whined about the stand not being a charging stand or the shaver having too much vibration:  Boo-hoo.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t replace the battery, so no matter how well the trimmer is built, once the battery goes, it is ready for the trash.</li>
            <li>This Wahl Lithium Trimmer seems to cover the whole spectrum.</li>
            <li>It shaves really close, too, which is another feature I needed.  </li>
            <li>I like it so much that I am getting one for my grandson today.</li>
            <li>It cuts very close, almost to a fault.  </li>
            <li>Rubber material covering body of unit grips TOO much.  </li>
            <li>have found Wahl to make the best cutting blades.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I said thanks for nothing.</li>
            <li>Great for travel as the charger is unnecessary to bring along.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Wahl hair trimming products!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the picture or the description really make</li>
            <li>and it really hurts.</li>
            <li>Plenty of power and the attachments work very well.</li>
            <li>- Cuts fast and the combs work well.  </li>
            <li>You can just tell when you take it out the box that it is very well build</li>
            <li>It trims reasonably well.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer is solidly built and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>of the blades included seem very well-constructed.</li>
            <li>I expected a lot more.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ready for a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My grandson really likes this trimmer.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this trimmer!</li>
            <li>Charges fast (1 hour).  </li>
            <li>Bought it here on Amazon for a very reasonble price and it was shipped really fast, the price could not be beat.</li>
            <li>Its that whole billiard ball look I sport.  </li>
            <li>on setting #2, but the length of the cut is VERY dependent upon the angle at which you hold this too your face.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t want to be thinking that much about it.  </li>
            <li>I had to refer to the instructions just to figure out how to fit everything on it, and even at that, it was a total puzzle.</li>
            <li>A real piece of junk.</li>
            <li>It is also very versatile.  </li>
            <li>the razer works really well</li>
            <li>/&gt;I expected better.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy build as well.</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this for a few months and it has held up well for me, I mostly just use the trimmers to keep facial hair under control, but the shaver is ok for every now and then.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery was a plus.</li>
            <li>I really like this Wahl shaver/trimmer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does come with a lot of accessories that I can&#x27;t really evaluate because my husband doesn&#x27;t use them.  </li>
            <li>Every time he uses it he says how great it is, how much power, and how after only a few minutes of charging, it is ready to use.  </li>
            <li>The shaver itself cuts very well.</li>
            <li>All of the attachments seem to work really well.  </li>
            <li>This turned out to work much better that expected.</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I never soak the whole trimmer - just the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t want to use 2 buzzers.</li>
            <li>Blades are extremely gentle on skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Blades are extremely gentle on skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i really like that it has the shaver part.  </li>
            <li>second point--not all the parts fit in the stand as shown.  </li>
            <li>its ok, not very close</li>
            <li>Next time shaving, your hands are filled with hair trimmings and so is the place you store it.</li>
            <li>real mans beard is another story all together.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>But it charges fast and keeps doing its job.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really comment on the functionality of this product.  </li>
            <li>Iv decided to go ahead and get the newer 9818 stainless steal one soon just because it thinner and cooler looking</li>
            <li>(I use a straight razor to cut my non-beard hairs</li>
            <li>Wahl charges $9.75 plus shipping for a replacement blade, which I think is too much.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Make available a smaller shaver attachment, along with the one here.  </li>
            <li>you for the fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Does the whole body manscaping with trimmed chest and legs and closely trimmed &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; areas.  </li>
            <li>This thing is light years beyond and solid design and construction.  </li>
            <li>Only drawback is lack of a charging status light.</li>
            <li>I get a much closer shave.</li>
            <li>Another annoyance is when I try to remove a plastic attachment the whole blade part pops off.  </li>
            <li>Charge on the battery REALLY LASTS.....</li>
            <li>Thanks Nitro</li>
            <li>was reasonable</li>
            <li>so much</li>
            <li>It is very well-made.</li>
            <li>Very well designed tool.</li>
            <li>and it really doesn&#x27;t tell you much about how to use it.  </li>
            <li>Fast forward to a month ago</li>
            <li>And for those of you who read the whole thing, I don&#x27;t recommend doing what I did, I just shared the steps for entertainment purposes.</li>
            <li>This did all as advertised and the charge held through the whole workout.</li>
            <li>If this was listed for 1.00 it would be too much.</li>
            <li>When I received this product it was fully charged and ready to go.  </li>
            <li>I really like this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>He absolutely loves it, it is convenient and well engineered.</li>
            <li>I cut my six year olds hair and as you can imagine he doesn&#x27;t sit very still for me.</li>
            <li>Expected a bit better for the price.</li>
            <li>I shave my head with a razor so the need for a trimmer really hadn&#x27;t came up with me before this beard of mine started getting out of control.</li>
            <li>so I just needed one of them but had to pay for the whole bunch.</li>
            <li>I like it very much!!Lot of clips  </li>
            <li>I would not pay too much over 30$ for this.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t use it much on my face.</li>
            <li>Better than what I expected.</li>
            <li>The shave very close,have plenty of power,and the battery stays charged.</li>
            <li>Who wants to have all that stuff sitting on their counter?</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s better than I expected, but not problem</li>
            <li>For this price, it&#x27;s a real bargain.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>improvement suggestion for future model is the trimmer needs a charge level indicator light.</li>
            <li>: They repaired my second trimmer free of charge.  </li>
            <li>I really like this shaver.  </li>
            <li>For the price, this trimmer really is all encompassing.</li>
            <li>When it did work, it worked very well.</li>
            <li>unit absolutely powers through hair.  </li>
            <li>However, the grip is very grippy and some hair may stick to it.  </li>
            <li>Problem is, it doesn&#x27;t trim very well at all.</li>
            <li>It worked reasonably well while it worked.</li>
            <li>and the whole head broke off.</li>
            <li>Second time I wanted to use it to trim my hair so changed to the replacement longer blade and doesn&#x27;t cut my hair at all despite making noise and vibrating.&lt;br /&gt;Product is cheap so if it stops working after one use don&#x27;t be surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Li-ion battery charges fast</li>
            <li>the razor works amazing.the attachments work very well.</li>
            <li>will stick to the handle, too much IMO.</li>
            <li>fast service.....</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t really make a difference from using one or the</li>
            <li>The stand is acceptable, but I didn&#x27;t really have room for everything.</li>
            <li>so I bought the whole thing again.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>The trimmer was already charged and ready to go out of the box.  </li>
            <li>Because it is a Lithium battery it needs to disposed of in an environmentally responsible manner.</li>
            <li>He really likes it.</li>
            <li>I really like the weight of this razor.</li>
            <li>I could do this probably three times (whole body and hair) before needing to recharge.</li>
            <li>I purchased this trimmer because of the numerous attachments available along with it&#x27;s affordability.  </li>
            <li>very convinient.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like the cavities in the stand weren&#x27;t really designed for the accessories that were</li>
            <li>It will always leave stubble no matter how much I tried.</li>
            <li>and he really likes it.</li>
            <li>Hubby doesnt use it all that much.</li>
            <li>The trimmer hair guides work very well</li>
            <li>Also the rubber grip attracts hair very well and sticks.</li>
            <li>used it the very night i got</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t need them as much as others so for me</li>
            <li>WELL THANKS</li>
            <li>A real bargain.</li>
            <li>was very durable.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why this happened, really.</li>
            <li>The rust in this situation is really inexcusable.</li>
            <li>Came on time, and the blade cuts very evenly.  </li>
            <li>It works, but it should fit properly.</li>
            <li>but it really doesn&#x27;t trim my husbands head very well and he is quite bald.  </li>
            <li>It has a whole myriad of attachments, I can&#x27;t imagine needing something it didn&#x27;t already come with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You have to hold it very carefully at a precise angle for it to cut properly.</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>Both of them really like this shaver.  </li>
            <li>Nothing is this close or this fast.</li>
            <li>I really like this trimmer and hope that it stands the test of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very practical.</li>
            <li>For the price you can keep replacing the whole unit.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li>light a moderate stubble.</li>
            <li>The stand is very flimsy plastic, and its like playing Jenga trying to get all the pieces in there.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be fooled into thinking this is a very durable and efficient way of organizing everything.</li>
            <li>and I really like</li>
            <li>The buzzing sound is now a bit erratic, which I interpret as the charge finally wearing off, so I&#x27;m going to plug it in for a recharge.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also know that Wahl is a very reliable brand.</li>
            <li>Said if I really wanted I could mail it in</li>
            <li>If the battery dies you cannot power this straight from AC -</li>
            <li>It trims very close.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>Really goo done</li>
            <li>I have been using this for about a month and am ready to write a review.  </li>
            <li>60 minutes on the charger and its ready to go for another eight months.  </li>
            <li>Very dissapointed in product.</li>
            <li>Hoping it will last a few years or more :)</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and it lasts my husband</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s really nothing I would change about it.</li>
            <li>It does not hold all of the accessories very well.</li>
            <li>but then again I don&#x27;t have much of a need for them anyway.</li>
            <li>This works perfectly well to trim anything that needs trimming, but you can&#x27;t plug it in and use it cold.</li>
            <li>This is the best hair cutting trimmer we have ever had.  </li>
            <li>The shaving attachment though really chewed me up.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to charge it as much</li>
            <li>He really likes his too.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get much work</li>
            <li>You have to press the blades against your skin which is very frustrating.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sharp/ powerful enough to trim the most stubborn facial hair.</li>
            <li>I really like the product.</li>
            <li>I also have used it for some \\&quot;body grooming\\&quot; and it worked very well.</li>
            <li>This thing can really cut.</li>
            <li>So much so that I&#x27;ve stopped using them all together</li>
            <li>He really likes this one.</li>
            <li>They would make the decision much easier that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>It trims very well.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>OK, I&#x27;ve used lots of hair cutters and have learned that there are somethings to be careful to look for:&lt;br /&gt;1.  </li>
            <li>I also got rid of the shaver attachment and the guards that I won&#x27;t use (there really isn&#x27;t room for EVERYTHING, so you have to choose what you will use).  </li>
            <li>But, if you&#x27;re a technically oriented person, the battery is available from Amazon:     http://www.amazon.com/Cylindrical-Rechargeable-Batteries-Philips-Electric/dp/B00ML5K2OG/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?s&#x3D;electronics&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1422152997&amp;sr&#x3D;1-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;3.7+volt+aa+battery+with+solder+tabs%27    </li>
            <li>you do a search you will find the Business development manager giving a demo that is very good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Lithium Ion Stainless Steel All-in-one Groomer]] ($50.99 Nov-2012).</li>
            <li>Vibrates too much and very noisy.</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because the comb that comes with it is very flimsy.</li>
            <li>Glad my remote control batteries on my TV don&#x27;t do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Why do you really need cordless?  </li>
            <li>also seems to hold a charge very well.  </li>
            <li>however the \\&quot;stainless</li>
            <li>charges  fast, and holds the charge very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>to the complaints about too much vibration?</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>sure what the picture is showing, but I received the 17 piece set and maybe 1/2 of the pieces fit in the provided base, and of those many not as if they were intended to actually fit...</li>
            <li>To be short the battery life on this product was fabulous.</li>
            <li>but the item looks as described and was packaged very well</li>
            <li>My husband loves his Wahl 9818 Stainless Steel Lithium Grooming Trimmer.  </li>
            <li>My only problem is that neither the charger nor the clipper has an indicator light to confirm that the clipper is charging, or to confirm that it is fully charged.</li>
            <li>Maybe the box was made in USA, but it is very misleading.</li>
            <li>the plastic tray to store the various attachments is so light that it seems almost throwaway quality.  </li>
            <li>Wahl even wants to charge you if it IS in warranty.</li>
            <li>Works very well&lt;br /&gt;Comes with plenty of attachments&lt;br /&gt;Good value</li>
            <li>The only accessory included to hold the parts is a cheap &amp;#34;bag&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>it also has the same comb attachment as the last one I had of this same model but the blade is different, it seems to sit lower and will not trim as close, 1/4 inch at best</li>
            <li>powerful unit, just like a professional trimmer set.  </li>
            <li>I keep thinking it must be ready to die soon, but it just keeps going.  </li>
            <li>so you know when it&#x27;s ready to quit.</li>
            <li>very dissapointed.  </li>
            <li>This product is really mind blowing with the price I paid for..</li>
            <li>The rubber grip attracts hair and dust and is a real pain to get off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I need it so it just sits there forever in a charged state ready to be used without needing to be charged again.</li>
            <li>The rubber handle has so much &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; to it that hair sometimes clings to it.</li>
            <li>This trimmer works really well.</li>
            <li>The order came very</li>
            <li>I really like the trimmer and accessories.</li>
            <li>The rubber grip is very sticky and consequently collects ALL clippings.  </li>
            <li>I really expected better from Wahl.</li>
            <li>However, very noisy which is a price to pay for the lightweight design of the trimmer.</li>
            <li>hassle\\&quot; customer service department ready to help fix whatever problem you may have.</li>
            <li>Works really well.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>SO MUCH</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t run stronger, just much much</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t have much use for the haircut pieces included,</li>
            <li>Works as advertised - only problem was had to eliminate some of the accessory items to get them to fit on the stand.</li>
            <li>it was very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>my only &#x27;dink&#x27; here is that this lacks a charging light.  </li>
            <li>It was smooth, quiet and did the job well.</li>
            <li>, I just needed to pull off the whole head.</li>
            <li>Makes the razor process so much</li>
            <li>Absolute garbage.  </li>
            <li>only cons are that it does not have a light to indicated when it is fully charged.  </li>
            <li>Wahl products are very dependable.  </li>
            <li>For the price - really a 4.5+.</li>
            <li>So much for the \\&quot;All-in-One\\&quot; billing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The battery died very</li>
            <li>There are better trimmers/shavers out there for nearly the same price.</li>
            <li>It is just for convenience and, considering the cost of this set, a rather nice throw-in -- especially for traveling when you don&#x27;t want a bunch of extra things to pack and carry.&lt;br</li>
            <li>docking base is a nice touch, although a cover for keeping it dust free would have been nice.  </li>
            <li>I guess I will go buy the Remington Titanium, since I already know a few people who own it and it works very well.  </li>
            <li>So far I have used it once to trim my thick goatee, using the adjustable guide and it did a great job.</li>
            <li>Far more power, smoother, quieter, and lasts longer than my similar (but cheaper) Norelco trimmer.  </li>
            <li>The rechargeable battery wore out eventually on both Norelcos, and it was really more difficult to replace than I would have liked.</li>
            <li>Same when charging it, I wasn&#x27;t sure when it was complete.  </li>
            <li>it is easy to maintain and attach the various heads to the main device.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s only because I wanna try something on more of a professional level)</li>
            <li>far superior cut/trim compared to round headed nose trimmers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Points to note:&lt;br /&gt;Superior battery performance, lasts for like 5 to 6 times, quick charge, 3hours of total run time, and as per my experience one shave dosnt last for more than 15-20mints, so one can easily use 6 times in a single charge.&lt;br /&gt;Great grip and handling while trimming&lt;br</li>
            <li>it will only shave really fine hair and have to go over many times for a real close shave but other than</li>
            <li>not bad for this price, easier to handle and use, it&#x27;s hard to clean up, but with water, it&#x27;s easier to clean</li>
            <li>like the other blades is a very precise cutter.</li>
            <li>Despite the new battery getting pretty hot during some inefficient soldering on my part, it already works at least as good as new.</li>
            <li>So far I keep Panasonic clipper, Philips groomer and Wahl trimmer each one in a separate ZIPLOCK PLASTIC BAG with attachments heaped inside!!!</li>
            <li>very powerful and quiet.</li>
            <li>I have found the different attachment heads to be very useful in maintaining a neatly groomed appearance.</li>
            <li>This single charge (and here&#x27;s the amazing part), last exactly 1 month and 7 days, or 5 weeks.  </li>
            <li>For the price, this is a great trimmer, but it has a pretty limited life-span of around 9 months in my experience if you are using it nearly everyday as I am.  </li>
            <li>Did notice that the blade did seem to rust pretty quickly, so it had to be cleaned almost daily.</li>
            <li>Made a mistake of buying another Braun due to loving their regular electric shavers but it paled in comparison to this ones battery life and powerful motor.  </li>
            <li>because it operates at higher RPM, or just that it is new.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten three years out of the first two and expect to get three years or so out of the new ones.</li>
            <li>When I was first shopping around for a new beard trimmer, I had no idea what to look for, so</li>
            <li>Despite the fact that they are not super durable, I am still happy enough with the product and its price to keep buying a new one each time it wears out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It holds a charge for a long time, and is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>It runs strong for a long time and it does not cut or catch at all.</li>
            <li>The blade was sharp and cut cleanly and quickly without any skin pinching or nicks.</li>
            <li>Seems like some sort of water issue possibly, but what good is a trimmer that cant get wet!  </li>
            <li>in all, when compared to the other brands we&#x27;ve tried, which are about the same cost, these seem superior.</li>
            <li>First of all, it&#x27;s very loud.  </li>
            <li>My second ,does a great job until the blades get dull,parts more expensive than buying a whole new razor.</li>
            <li>At first, I thought it was really cool to have all these options, but now I&#x27;m just wondering if they couldn&#x27;t have narrowed it down by using a smaller number of more adjustable items.  </li>
            <li>In other words, it trims mustaches better than anything I have used before.    </li>
            <li>Great little trimmer - long battery life - lots of accessories.  </li>
            <li>Within a day of posting this original review, I received different information from the company.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how any of the other trimmers are because I lack experience with them, but I am very much pleased with this one.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve worked better than any other brand</li>
            <li>My other Wahl trimmer has lated many years, and it&#x27;s still working.</li>
            <li>Better than any other of the cordless trimmers I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li>Hopefully this is an isolated event and other customers have a better built trimmer.</li>
            <li>Not only is the shaver visibly more powerful than the others I&#x27;ve used, but this charges in a fraction of the time it took for the others, and the charge lasts absurdly long.</li>
            <li>i used it as soon as i got home, and found a mass of tiny hairs inside the original clip.  </li>
            <li>The battery system is great - long lasting but they always seem to quit when you are in the middle of something.</li>
            <li>However, it was stressed that these blades are not water or moisture friendly, so even if you oil them, keep the blades outside of the areas you wash, bathe, shower.  </li>
            <li>The new trimmer head works great and looks a little different</li>
            <li>The high-torque means a fast and accurate trim (lesser trimmers you have to keep running over the same area over and over) and the LiOn means I don&#x27;t have to worry if I&#x27;ve got enough charge left to get a good trim.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shaver is not good but as far as trimming is concerned, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>The silicone handle on the trimmer gets covered with hair while you trim your beard and the only way to clean it</li>
            <li>I use these tools all the time, and this particular model has been very reliable.  </li>
            <li>have owned a Wahl 8900 for a long time, maybe 15 or more years; it was a gift from a professional cosmetologist family member.  </li>
            <li>The multiple attachments makes for a clean job.</li>
            <li>The lithium ion battery really does last far longer between charges and, in addition, it maintains a consistently strong speed or &amp;#34;torque&amp;#34; as Wahl advertises.  </li>
            <li>like the most is it has several heads you can change, its battery and in general it&#x27;s practical</li>
            <li>Overall, i&#x27;d say look elsewhere for an easier to clean clipper.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 71 years of age, have worked successfully as a craftsman assembling all my days, but there are too few left to play with this thing.</li>
            <li>Have to go over the same area over and over to get a clean cut.</li>
            <li>I have to say that this trimmer cuts much closer than the older one.</li>
            <li>Well it seems that way, but after about 7 weeks of normal use, light trimming and the occasional shave, never in the shower or exposed to water, it stopped working.</li>
            <li>, whats left of it.&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with the purchase and already amortized the cost of the device that I would have otherwise spent at the barber shop.</li>
            <li>but if they work as well as the main one, I&#x27;m that much happier.</li>
            <li>He stated that the blade isn&#x27;t close enough to give that clean edging</li>
            <li>The battery is amazing and neither trimmer worked long enough to need a</li>
            <li>definitely a much higher quality and worth an extra $25.</li>
            <li>Good shaver with one serious flaw.</li>
            <li>Overall, we loved this little trimmer and would certainly recommend it at this price.</li>
            <li>Its ok but power seems to wear down fast.</li>
            <li>Shaver works fine but is quite weak and requires more time to shave with.</li>
            <li>I bought the same set about 4 years ago and it is still working fine, I ordered this one in case my old one gives up, but I think I will never need it!</li>
            <li>They come off easily and as you long as you align the head correctly it goes back on quickly also.   </li>
            <li>After the first year, I started observing that the charge will not hold for more than a few minutes, steadily decreasing.</li>
            <li>, it gave my beard a nice trim, I can tell its going to last a long time, Made in USA!</li>
            <li>The quality of this one is evident right away compared to ones that are similar in cost or cheaper.  </li>
            <li>Even though this was only $32 for me, compared to my $150 remington, it cuts through the hair probably about 10 times as fast, without snagging,(when properly used,) is easier to clean, and is more solidly built.</li>
            <li>No big deal, as a quick wipe down/brush off will get it off, and I MUCH prefer the accuracy of not having it slip around in my hand.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find that if the blades are oiled regularly, this trimmer cuts very evenly and quickly.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really add much more than what everyone else has already said in previous reviews.</li>
            <li>After running it down from the quick charge, I charged it for an hour, since that&#x27;s supposedly a full charge.</li>
            <li>the new large attachment&lt;br /&gt;was</li>
            <li>My last trimmer was much more expensive and didn&#x27;t do nearly as good a job.</li>
            <li>This trimmer completely stopped working 3/4 of the way through my first trim with it.  </li>
            <li>At first, I used to have to keep my old cordless trimmer on the charger</li>
            <li>so my trimmer usually has a beard of its own.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m so use to the Andis professional clipper (heavier, noisier, get hot and reliable.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small in size so it fits nicely in my show bag, too.</li>
            <li>I almost dropped it the first time I turned it on because I was so surprised by the noise and vibration.</li>
            <li>When I used it for the first time I thought this was the closest to a professional trimmer I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>but so far it is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I have a short full beard and mustache that I&#x27;ve trimmed with this device for about three months.</li>
            <li>I took this product and used it only 2 times and this one isnt working now.it does not get switched even after full charge.faced</li>
            <li>So this has basically been kind of a bust for me, and I&#x27;m going back to my old standard Panasonic razor.</li>
            <li>Its a small flaw, though it is nice.</li>
            <li>The foil shaver is small but effective.</li>
            <li>I was able to fix mine, but the average person probably would have just thrown it away.</li>
            <li>Made a full grown man cry just wanting a simple shave&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also comes with a variety of heads which work well - including a small shave head that works nicely below my beard line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the last three months, the trimmer charge lasts under a minute after a full day of charging.</li>
            <li>After a full charge I could grab the blades while running and stop them using very moderate force.</li>
            <li>and it stayed alive the whole time!</li>
            <li>However I&#x27;m going to print the label and return the old one first</li>
            <li>I just had my beard trimmed professionally today for the first time</li>
            <li>The only issue that I had initially was the removal of the heads which after finding this very informative video by Wahl I was able to figure it out:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It only runs about 60 seconds now on a full charge.</li>
            <li>I was disappointed with this product in that it never seemed able to charge to the point where I could use it for more than a few minutes at a go, a problem compounded by the trimmer&#x27;s lack of any kind of charge-indication light that would let me know if it was fully charged, or even in the process of charging.  </li>
            <li>I have this thing for 6 months it&#x27;s already broken very cheap made it even feels cheap</li>
            <li>It works OK but two things get it knocked down.</li>
            <li>The Wahl is immediately much high quality: real metal pieces, heavy in my hand, the design allows for a much closer much more even shave.</li>
            <li>(I could not find any better trimmer than this one, some other trimers even cut and rubbed her skin!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had about a half dozen trimmers over the past 20 years and this one was by far the best yet.</li>
            <li>All in all, for $30 I can&#x27;t complain too much, but I was expecting a little more from Wahl.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve got a safe spot to sit this set on the counter, you may find yourself doing little grooming tasks that seemed too much hassle to do before.</li>
            <li>/&gt;just bought the Oster fast feed, it cost a little more</li>
            <li>It should be like the new Norelco razor platform!  </li>
            <li>There actually are too many attachments, which overcomplicate using the device and create far too many small parts that could be lost.  </li>
            <li>The different guards help with trimming hair while the different attachments like the wide blade and the shaver make it very handy  and allow you to do what you need to.</li>
            <li>Convenience makes up for this shortcoming.&lt;br /&gt;Holds a charge for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Attachments are very useful.</li>
            <li>What I found was that most of the clippers are very similar, so it&#x27;s not useful to have so many, and in any case it is a pain to always switch between the different clippers.  </li>
            <li>It is smooth, powerful, and works very well for beard and body and battery last so long, and if ever stopped working, I will reorder immediately.</li>
            <li>Wahl, on the other hand, is also quite the capable beast but where the T980 is really only good as a Trimmer, the Wahl tries to be a little of everything and in my opinion fairly well succeeds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had a nicad Wahl trimmer before this one and the difference in the length of time a charge is held is amazing and highly appreciated - I hardly ever have to charge this one.</li>
            <li>It is relatively easy to clean but has spaces that are hard to get to.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find functional, reasonably priced trimmers, so this one was a nice surprise to recieve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty sweet little workhorse - always reliable and holds a good charge for a long time even after a long time on the shelf.</li>
            <li>The plastic packaging materials can be used to hold the various accessories and parts in a primitive tray (which is what&#x27;s pictured), but the plastic molding doesn&#x27;t fit the items particularly well, doesn&#x27;t secure them at all, and is extremely flimsy.  </li>
            <li>i have to buy a whole new pack.</li>
            <li>Do I really want to buy a new trimmer head twice a year and by the end of the 5 yr warranty have paid for the product 5 times over?  </li>
            <li>The new package doesn&#x27;t include the molded upright stand, instead it just has a fabric zipper pouch (don&#x27;t care much).  </li>
            <li>The new blade really did not help.</li>
            <li>I guess I will just have to assume I buy a new one very 6 months.</li>
            <li>Truly the best trimmer ive ever owned as far as the cutting and trimming capability is concerned.</li>
            <li>but my previous trimmer was better in this regard.   </li>
            <li>Like I said previously, the unit worked OK for about 3 months (used it 10-20 times MAX).</li>
            <li>That was certainly refreshing after using some non lithium shavers previously.</li>
            <li>Odd choice of material for sure.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t find the button to depress to swivel the trimmer head, couldn&#x27;t get the 6 position guide to fit correctly on the trimmer head.</li>
            <li>Had this product for over a year and half and always enjoyed its convenience and reliability.</li>
            <li>The handle is coated with black rubber which must be for better grip but hair and beard particles stick to it.</li>
            <li>However, for those who want a slightly longer and prominent stubble this maybe the product for you.</li>
            <li>Walgreens has a much better trimmer for half the price.</li>
            <li>but it just seems odd that Wahl can&#x27;t make something with better quality</li>
            <li>For all around trimming, meaning sideburns and hairline at back of neck, it&#x27;s super.</li>
            <li>It also gives a fairly decent haircut.  </li>
            <li>It runs faster and longer than the older model I had for 10 years before the battery gave out.  </li>
            <li>I replaced an older trim unit I&#x27;ve had for 10 years.  </li>
            <li>2 sizes for cutting head and many attachments make it adept at beards, moustaches, necks and around ears.</li>
            <li>This was purchased to replace an older wahl trimmer, and I wish I had replaced it sooner.</li>
            <li>I have never seen a similar product that charged up as quickly as this one did.  </li>
            <li>Not really a big deal, considering it&#x27;s got a 1-minute quick charge ability.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this trimmer to replace a much older rechargeable Wahl trimmer.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m going to give that a try and hope that I can end my hunt for a trimmer I can be satisfied with for the next several years.</li>
            <li>- maybe it&#x27;s the same, but appears to be better quality than what was initially supplied.  </li>
            <li>The teeth on the main trimmer head started falling out or breaking off causing the product to chomp on my face.  </li>
            <li>(check out the cost of a decent dedicated shaver).</li>
            <li>the second saving feature is the quick releasing interchangeable trimming heads.</li>
            <li>Given the lithium battery it will probably do so for quite a while and take a quick charge when it runs low.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions in the package to send it in for warranty repair, I am hoping to get it back quickly.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know what happened with this particular model.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This review will be about 2 models including this particular product.</li>
            <li>It has WAY too many attachments for me - but that&#x27;s because I use it only as stated above.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested the charger and it is producing a steady 4.30 V.  </li>
            <li>I say &#x27;potentially&#x27; because, for the most part, I think the battery is a strength(!)</li>
            <li>I say &#x27;potentially&#x27; because, for the most part, I think the battery is a strength(!)</li>
            <li>The older designed tray never would hold them all, so some wound up sitting in a drawer.  </li>
            <li>It seems no one makes a decent trimmer out there anymore.</li>
            <li>, was that it&#x27;s main function for me -- the beard</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different models but I keep coming back to this one.</li>
            <li>I had it for 6 months of steady use without having to charge it.</li>
            <li>This replaced an older trimmer.</li>
            <li>I use it daily for quick touch up and it has remained charged for a month or so.</li>
            <li>I like the attachments, especially the tiny detail trimmer which is really my favorite.</li>
            <li>I bought this mainly as a beard trimmer for my husband.  </li>
            <li>last quick note on the battery-</li>
            <li>This particular model comes with attachments to meet just about any need</li>
            <li>However, with the trimmer plugged in I could get about a minute of use out of it, which was all I needed for the occasional quick touch-up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, but only last about a year or so, before the blades get worn.</li>
            <li>It has a decent amount of accessories.</li>
            <li>This is decent for body hair.</li>
            <li>This Wahl product uses a lithium battery, not the older nickel-cadmium battery technology.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Decent shaver.</li>
            <li>This the main resion for buying this model.</li>
            <li>A lot of reviews I read say this trimmer, mainly for ears/nose/eyebrows, doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li>The attachments (blades mentioned above) can be pretty tricky toput on and take off at first.</li>
            <li>We owned an older version of a Wahl trimmer.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s older counterparts.  </li>
            <li>charger is also 110V only (while most of the countries are using 220V now and a battery powered shaver is likely to be used for travelers...</li>
            <li>The cut is very close and has quiet and powerful trimmers.</li>
            <li>The powerplant in this model (Lithium vs. the older NiCad or NiMH rechargables) makes this the one to beat against all others in the sub-$60 price-range.</li>
            <li>I was warned by the reviews and not only that, some of my old attachments fit this one.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer I have is an older version 9854-L</li>
            <li>Trimmer shipped quickly and works terrific!</li>
            <li>Uses it mainly for trimming nose and ears.  </li>
            <li>The problem is that Walmart no longer carried this particular model.  </li>
            <li>I took care of it pretty well, and it took care of my facial hair pretty well, until 6 months in it just doesn&#x27;t work anymore.</li>
            <li>The motor is plenty powerful, the trimer selections are quite inclusive for most anyone&#x27;s beard, moustache, complex goattee.  </li>
            <li>Works great with thick facial hair.  </li>
            <li>The main difference is in the quality of the blades that came with this clipper.</li>
            <li>and I just stick with the main blade.</li>
            <li>The attachments are vast and very helpful in hair removal and makes trimming fun.</li>
            <li>Part of the workings in the main head broke off completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I openly gave it 5 stars in hopes that more folks will see the review, but it really only deserves 2 or 3!</li>
            <li>I have 2 main gripes.  </li>
            <li>Note: We did have to send the unit into Wahl after 3 weeks because it suddenly stopped working completely, but they replaced it free of charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>if I knew I was getting a decent</li>
            <li>The battery charge is quick and will last through two or three shaving sessions.  </li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m back to using my 5 year old cheap Norelco to trim because it doesn&#x27;t pull (go figure).</li>
            <li>I came to amazon to look for something decent that can give me a close stubble trim.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to put them back in a back or container after i use them, and with a lot of traveling, I often misplace them in bags and eventually lost two guards.</li>
            <li>the battery stopped holding a decent charge.</li>
            <li>I was particularly drawn to this product because of the lithium ion battery.  </li>
            <li>It has worked well and initially the charge lasted for several trims, so I had confidently carried it with me on business trips without the charger.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;d be nice if the warranty description that comes with the product was accurate, but given that the instruction booklet that comes with the trimmer is rather generic (describes features of other models as well), I&#x27;m guessing they haven&#x27;t updated that text in a long time.    </li>
            <li>At first I was glad to see that WAHL had finally designed a shaver with a lithium battery because the nickel-cadium battiers in their other units die out way too fast.  </li>
            <li>Again, great for fine and short hair, great to trime facial hair as well, not good for long and thick hair.</li>
            <li>They were fine for awhile, but got plugged and dull no matter what you tried to do to clean.</li>
            <li>My most recent trimmer (before getting this Wahl) is the Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum.</li>
            <li>It is very powerful and keeps its charge for a long time!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d particularly recommend this for men with beards or high maintenance haircuts that need to be trimmed every couple of days.</li>
            <li>I will try to contact Wahl&#x27;s customer service department since they seem to offer a generous warranty, but the original packaging is long gone.</li>
            <li>Very powerful, versitale, and holds charge for a very long time.</li>
            <li>The blades are sharp, and it seems that this will be a great little work horse.</li>
            <li>They worked great for the first 1.5 years, but alas, their demise has finally come.  </li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s a great little trimmer.</li>
            <li>A great replacement for my old battery operated Wahl trimmer which has work well for the past 8 years, the rechargeable battery is a vast improvement.</li>
            <li>first off, clearly amazon doesn&#x27;t check their returns before they resend it out to a new customer because mine had fingerprints all over the chrome (which i sterilized before using).  </li>
            <li>The different trimmer heads vary in quality, some feel very sturdy and snap right into place.</li>
            <li>, so the attachments more or less just lay in there against the other accessories, so even after you get everything in there all nice and organized as soon as you pick up a different accessory everything is just going to shift and move.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the previous version that came with the other kind  battery ( not li Ion) and this one definitely has a better battery life.&lt;br /&gt;Downside-</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve only had my new Trimmer/(Shaver) for one day, but I&#x27;m looking forward to 59 more days to be convinced that I&#x27;ll be happy with this purchase for at least 5 years (as per Guarantee, Warranty, and previous experience).  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The first time trying my Norelco to see if it&#x27;d be a suitable replacement proved to be such an immediate and obvious improvement that I immediately discarded the Wahl unit and have not looked back.</li>
            <li>high quality trimmer with tons of attachments.</li>
            <li>The blades are extremely high quality and it powers through any hair type without choking ever.</li>
            <li>This product seems to be high quality, and has lots of attachments.</li>
            <li>This set came highly recommended from a friend, so I bought it.  </li>

            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>All of the options provide a highly functional tool with the ability to trim any beard out there.  </li>
            <li>would highly recommend these clippers</li>
            <li>The only complaint i do have is that i like a very close shave and the shave attachment does not give as great a shave compared to an old fashioned razor.</li>
            <li>Sure enough, after only a minute of charging (after it was dead), I was able to run it for between 3-4 minutes.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li>A HIGH RECOMMEND..</li>
            <li>Does everything I want it to effortlessly and is high quality.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The foil shaver (and great torque from the motor) managed to get through nearly all of the facial hair except for a few sensitive neck areas that weren&#x27;t used to an electric trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The new Li-Ion is basically the same trimmer I&#x27;ve enjoyed using for years, but with double the power.  </li>
            <li>This definitely seems more powerful than my previous Wahl, allowing me to get an even trim on one pass over any given area.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried at least a half dozen of these rechargeable trimmers and this one is, by far, the best yet.  </li>
            <li>Lithium battery has an option for charging it just a few minutes, which forces just enough energy into it, to be able to do a quick trim.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Surprised that the blades aren&#x27;t sharper, haven&#x27;t tried other attachable blades to see if they are better yet.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the trimmer worked fine for a while, though it is not really powerful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it to anyone who is willing to invest a little more in a quality product that performs well and will last for a long time.</li>
            <li>I would like to get the rotary attachment with this, for the asking price, or just charge me a little more.  </li>
            <li>I would like to get the rotary attachment with this, for the asking price, or just charge me a little more.  </li>
            <li>I struggled a little to understand the instructions for adjusting the trimming guide, but once I understood it was pleased by its beard-trimming performance.  </li>
            <li>Then a little more effort to understand the instructions for changing heads, but they are literally a snap to change once you get it.  </li>
            <li>They can be a little challenging to set on the power unit but that gets easier with practice.   </li>
            <li>The nose hair trimmer could be shaped a little better.</li>
            <li>Could trim a little better at times, but works well.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this little guy -</li>
            <li>also use the little comb/brush to brush my hairs out of the trimmer after every use, i think the oils from the hair can wear out the trimmer quicker, which means having it to lube it more</li>
            <li>All I need now is a little more experience.</li>
            <li>This little trimmer has more than made up for its compact size.  </li>
            <li>I should of shopped around a little more.</li>
            <li>I always use the basic \\&quot;full\\&quot; trimming head, but there&#x27;s a ½ inch fine trimmer (without any trimming guides, just the bare razor head) and another head for deburring neck hair.</li>
            <li>So finally with much force it did suddenly with an alarming crack sound, and now it moves too easily.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t bother thinking it&#x27;s going to be very good for actually cutting your hair.</li>
            <li>Very good at cutting the hairs without pulling them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Battery life plays a large role in user experience with cordless trimmers (you never want to run out of juice halfway through a shave), I do not expect these to disappoint as many NiCad&#x27;s have in the past.</li>
            <li>Easy head change from one to the other</li>
            <li>Not as easy as other trimmers I have used.  </li>
            <li>And  blade is sharp and the motor is strong.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably keep it and just deal with it, but I really wish I could find a *new* one of my old Wahl trimmer!</li>
            <li>The guides that come with it are not as precise as I expected, but they get the job done.</li>
            <li>The old one had gotten to where it didn&#x27;t cut very well, and it required recharging after every use.</li>
            <li>That being said, they&#x27;re very sturdy, and they never pinch, which isn&#x27;t something I could say for my old clippers.</li>
            <li>This is one great trimmer, however it&#x27;s not perfect.  </li>
            <li>The reviews about hair clippings gathering on the rubber grip are accurate, but the issue is of no real consequence imo.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t be scared of the people that say it is loud and vibrates too much.  </li>
            <li>The plastic guides to put over the wide beard trimming blade are cheaply made.</li>
            <li>so you can hold it securely without worrying about it slipping off your hands.</li>
            <li>It really isn&#x27;t that loud compared to some of the reviews I read</li>
            <li>I spent about 15 minutes trying to figure out what went were because not all of the pieces fit.</li>
            <li>/&gt; much cheaper than the ones on the old Wahl&lt;br /&gt;clippers.</li>
            <li>He looks very presentable and professional and he enjoys that.</li>
            <li>Since I am in my seventies, it is important that I can grasp the handle without fear of it slipping in my hand.</li>
            <li>This one is much quieter than my old one.  </li>
            <li>Holds the charge really well, no battery issues so far</li>
            <li>The stainless Steel looks classy.  </li>
            <li>The tray is useless lol.</li>
            <li>Recommend this product if someone wants to replace their 2-5yr old Beard &amp; mustache trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>He really likes this, I had to replace his old one</li>
            <li>I was on hold for 10-15 minutes, but the rep that answered was very helpful, knowledgeable and clearly communicated everything.</li>
            <li>Much improved over my old trimmer.  </li>
            <li>While I haven&#x27;t been able to try out all the attachments that come with since my beard isn&#x27;t long enough I will not grade those items.</li>
            <li>I think the battery never loses charge.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ve used more than a few.    </li>
            <li>Wow...this thing pulls hair all over my face and neck while leaving many uneven hairs.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t cost more than a few dollar.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These pieces, as well of the rest of the system (11 pieces total) is an efficient way for men to get a fresh from the barber/stylist look at a fraction of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>While I can&#x27;t give it five stars, it is definitely a purchase worth considering.</li>
            <li>The razor ran on the initial charge that entire time which surprised and pleased me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always been powerful enough that it didn&#x27;t pull my beard.   </li>
            <li>but i don&#x27;t know if the plastic parts have a long life because you have to put  it on or take off depend what you want do ,loud sound when you work with it</li>
            <li>I normally use the adjustable comb at setting &amp;#34;3&amp;#34; to trim up my beard.  </li>
            <li>Even leaving it plugged in 24/7 could not trim for more than 90 seconds before it would go dead.  </li>
            <li>I use it most everyday.  </li>
            <li>When it does get low, it pretty much just stops.</li>
            <li>They have to be stacked on top of one another and look like they do not fit anywhere.  </li>
            <li>The different trimming heads are all incredibly useful.</li>
            <li>(I have purchased at least 10 trimmers over the past 10 years, and this one is the best!)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several types and this one seems to be the most solid I&#x27;ve used so far.  </li>
            <li>Could use a few more trimmer guard sizes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes with a lot of combs attachments but they&#x27;re pretty much within the same height range</li>
            <li>It has a five year warranty, it&#x27;s pretty cheap, and feels like a sturdy razor that will last a long time.</li>
            <li>It would be even more helpful with round nose attachment.</li>
            <li>I used it daily as my shaver for 10 days straight, plus gave myself and my thick-furred dog a buzz-cut before I noticed any change in the power output... straight out of the box!   </li>
            <li>What I like the most is the fact that charge takes a long time and if for some reason you need to use and no charge, a 5 min plugged to the electricity is enough.</li>
            <li>The attachments are really useful because it can be used in various ways.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m confident this one will last just as long.</li>
            <li>I do like the fact that it comes with 2 different widths of trimming heads as well as a shaving head (which is pretty much</li>
            <li>I bought this 6 full months ago, fully charged it once, and only just recharged it for the first time last week.</li>
            <li>normally don&#x27;t review products</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful enough to buzz through the thickest hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet and plenty powerful.  </li>
            <li>Usage proves the opposite.  </li>
            <li>Was a good trimmer but the plug on the unit has broken away and will not charge now.</li>
            <li>the only thing with lithium batteries is when they are dying they just quit, not much warning, but a full charge lasts a few trims, good life.</li>
            <li>It is not great, it is good.  </li>
            <li>I can get a new one from another brand for just a little bit more and no hassle or waiting.</li>
            <li>It catches hair decently well and doesn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive skin on my neck.</li>
            <li>New batteries are great and long-lasting, last for at least a dozen trims (&amp;#60;1yr old).</li>
            <li>No mess in the house, a quick, clean cut, trimmed eyebrows and groomed neck in just a few minutes.</li>
            <li>slight pressure on the switch toward off suddenly makes it sound as full power.  </li>
            <li>The unit is small and light enough that it would be easy and feasible to carry on extended trips (if one had a carrying case).    </li>
            <li>as well, in everything except battery, but unless you are a performer in the adult film industry, it will probably do an adequate job, especially if you have someone who can assist you with the underbrush</li>
            <li>I charged it once I received it, used it daily ever since, and it&#x27;s still going strong on the initial charge.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; trimmer stopped being strong enough to shave the back of my head in summer.</li>
            <li>Finally Wahl has caught on used the powerful, long lasting batteries in a great little trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Its not that loud and easy to clean (comes with a very small cleaning brush</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not even sure which attachment to use, as the single page of tiny instructions doesn&#x27;t identify them.  </li>
            <li>I have only just begun to use these trimmers, so I can not speak to their durability, but I do believe that going with the lithium ion option was the right choice.  </li>
            <li>It charges quick and run for a long time, before it needs to be recharged again.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>: Too many attachments and not easy to switch between them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The lithium ion battery charges quickly and holds the charge for a long while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It charges quick and the charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Charges quickly and the charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>The battery charges quickly and lasts for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It keeps a charge for a long time and recharges fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>suppose, I am tending to make things more complicated as they really are.&lt;br /&gt;Within the several attachments, one can choose one that is appropriate for the length of hair that needs to be cut.</li>
            <li>The Trimmer does indeed woke fine and and comes with a variety of ways to style your facial hair, it does occasionally chug when trimming.</li>
            <li>One second it was working fine, the next it was dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Second, the main head it comes with started to rust within the first 5 weeks of owning it.</li>
            <li>Replacing the one I have had for years that still works fine but wanted this same one only new.</li>
            <li>It handles beards, sideburns, and *other* areas with comfortable ease.</li>
            <li>one drawback - there should be a charging indicator light as in other models which lets you know when the unit is charging and when it has completed.    </li>
            <li>More power, battery life extra long, if there isn&#x27;t an attachment to complete the task...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I would use this for anything other than shaving, beard trimming, or doing light maintenance on my hair.</li>
            <li>I opened the box I discovered that the primary Trimmer head did not have a spring loaded vibrating mechanism like the other heads that would make that trimmer</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m going try other brands or just purchase another cheap Norelco.</li>
            <li>It holds a charge for an amazing amount of time - long enough to take it on a short trip without even bringing the charger.  </li>
            <li>However, all of the other trimmers in the market seam cheap too.</li>
            <li>It comes with 3 fixed length guides, which seem okay, but I didn&#x27;t use them because 2 were too short and 1 was too long.  </li>
            <li>Considering that a Braun shaver is quite costly, I was surprised that such a good shaver came with a small, inexpensive trimmer.</li>
            <li>Very slick and comes with own stand.</li>
            <li>Solidly built, runs a very long time with a full charge,charges quickly,comes with enough attachements to fit any trimming needs.</li>
            <li>As I suppose is a problem with quick change tip items, shaved hair gets into the mechanism and since the little shaft that does the work is in there and greased, it kind of gets messy.  </li>
            <li>I would not given this 5 stars originally if I new that this would happen&lt;br</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t live without this trimmer.</li>
            <li>it never ran again return for new one  </li>
            <li>So it is time to buy a new one</li>
            <li>Not on a new product.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll live.</li>
            <li>When it died, I didn&#x27;t want to spend the $100+ on a new razor, so I decided to try this.</li>
            <li>Well, so it may be, but not at the level I want to live with.  </li>
            <li>So new Amazon order today</li>
            <li>so I decided to just get a new one all together</li>
            <li>But with a new shaver and blade, the 10 days of growth came off in a snap.  </li>
            <li>Time for a new pair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheaper to buy a new set than a new blade.</li>
            <li>I like about this new one:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>New Li-ion battery</li>
            <li>While comparing prices on a new replacement I discovered this model.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this trimmer new in December of 2010.  </li>
            <li>A new one costs $40.</li>
            <li>hopefully I can get this replaced with a new item</li>
            <li>update got a new one and that one lasted about 2 weeks until it stopped working all together</li>
            <li>and then it&#x27;s time for a new one.</li>
            <li>Like the new ION battery</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it twice to trim my newly grown moustache and goatee.  </li>
            <li>So time for a new one.</li>
            <li>Just wish I could have gotten a new one.</li>
            <li>It still holds a charge like the day it was new, and cuts the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The new one was plugged in and it worked.  </li>
            <li>guess it&#x27;s time for a new razor\\&quot;,</li>
            <li>This lead to the purchase of this new Wahl, which outperforms</li>
            <li>will keep everyone updated with my new findings.</li>
            <li>so I could get a new one</li>
            <li>I now have to purchase something new</li>
            <li>and I just bought a new razor with the lithium ion battery</li>
            <li>I had.&lt;br /&gt;The attachments, on the new clippers, were&lt;br</li>
            <li>This morning I just set a new record for speed and height, trimming my hair.</li>
            <li>and I have a new hair trimmer on the way to me....</li>
            <li>It holds a charge for quite a while when it&#x27;s new.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update:  I&#x27;ve been using this clipper once a week for a year, and it still looks and performs as new.  </li>
            <li>cost of a new battery.</li>
            <li>and im on the search for a new trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I still need a new trimmer, if I cant find</li>
            <li>Just got a new one because one of the attachments locked up.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this product is manufactured garbage, and came used when bought new in store.</li>
            <li>Got a new ac adapter</li>
            <li>hard to get hair off of the handle, too many plastic parts that dont look very durable.</li>
            <li>I liked that it stopped, rather than draining slowly down to non-operation, but I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was broken or needed a charge.  </li>
            <li>I needed a new trimmer after my old Wahl crapped out on me, and so far, I really like this trimmer.</li>
            <li>You can not just wipe them off or brush them off, you have to use a wet towel to clean it.</li>
            <li>Not worth it to replace as it still cuts fine with the guides placed over it.</li>
            <li>The problem came when the battery finally died (it just shut off in the middle of the shave, it doesn&#x27;t have an indicator light).</li>
            <li>I expected more from an American based company.  </li>
            <li>It has quite a strong motor that has no trouble going through very coarse facial hair.</li>
            <li>I liked this trimmer when it worked, however after only a few months it refused to charge.  </li>
            <li>but the blade movements are not what they should be to be overall effective, it works but plan on a few hair pulls</li>
            <li>just random slots to toss where some may fall, but many don&#x27;t fit at all.&lt;br /&gt;Alas</li>
            <li>Not that I use the attachments much, since they&#x27;re of the same flimsy plastic as the tray, and really don&#x27;t do the job they&#x27;re designed to do.  </li>
            <li>Item was inexpensive, and not junk, works great,&lt;br /&gt;much better than expected for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Coupled with the fact it is an American Made Product...</li>
            <li>Fairly silent and good power for thick beards.  </li>
            <li>Hard to clean and maintain.&lt;br /&gt;Battery lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Invest in something better.</li>
            <li>Like with the original battery, I&#x27;m going to cycle it completely the first few times to condition the battery.</li>
            <li>The different head types (standard for trimming down facial hair, wide for haircuts, narrow for nose and precision requirements, and twin foil for a smooth shave) are great and can be interchanged fairly easily.  </li>
            <li>It got dull very quickly after the first week.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s far from high quality.</li>
            <li>The adjustable attachment very nearly broke in my hands when I tried to adjust the length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>highly recommend this thing if you&#x27;re going to use it to &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; like the late-20s, dashing, busy, rugged, testosterone-addled man that you are.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised to see all the negatives.</li>
            <li>If left unplugged for more than a couple days, and used only for a combined time of a couple minutes on a FULL charge, it would be dead.</li>
            <li>Good quality, sharp blades, handles well, but tends to pull at hair a little.</li>
            <li>It is important to remember that having a beard is not a right, but a privilege.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice anything special to justify the price which was roughly 3X</li>
            <li>especially if used in sensitive areas (get my drift?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the blades began to rust almost right away.</li>
            <li>My old ones died so quickly, this one lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Battery is exceptionally strong and long lasting.  </li>
            <li>Small super powerful.</li>
            <li>It is not as easy to get into tight places as the Norelco.  </li>
            <li>usually do not give bad reviews, as you are more than welcome to see through the thousands I have spent thought</li>
            <li>I was wanting something better and last week bought a Norelco (that was a stupid choice, now in the trash), then started reading reviews and was going to get an Andis pro model, great reviews</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>The attachment for getting a close shave works in some ways better than my everyday shaver!  </li>
            <li>More is not better.</li>
            <li>Keep shopping - there are several other trimmers under $20 that are better than this one.</li>
            <li>I received my clipper on September 11, I charged it over night and used it for the first time the next day.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t really used the other attachments yet, but hope they will be useful and as well made.</li>
            <li>pretty much only use 2 attachments.</li>
            <li>This is my second Wahl trimmer, the first one died after about 10 years.</li>
            <li>To me, it seems as if perhaps Wahl&#x27;s manufacturing standards aren&#x27;t consistent enough to keep this trimmer a guaranteed winner for all of us.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found it to be of pretty standard grade.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found it to be of pretty standard grade.</li>
            <li>The first one I had stopped working recently after 6 or 7 years.</li>
            <li>This is my second purchase of this item; the first lasted three years.</li>
            <li>It says that it has three hours of battery life which seemed too short at first.  </li>
            <li>think the small precision attachment is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>It is more effort to use than my other trimmers that have different settings for the trim.</li>
            <li>I wonder seeing most of the men vouching for Philips which is a piece of trash in terms of the sharpness of blades.&lt;br /&gt;Trimmers are simply judged by the smoothness of shave, and this has the finest blades which I havent seen in any of the other brands.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>I wish I could save that extra step and just have 1 that is well built like this Wahl and get close on the first try.</li>
            <li>Sure it&#x27;s got a warranty, and at least someone seems enthusiastic to help based on responses to some of the negative reviews, but who reallywants to hassle with the process?</li>
            <li>Finally had to give up on the first one I bought 4-5 years ago.</li>
            <li>So far a normal trimmer.</li>
            <li>Others feel cheap and take multiple tries to get them in straight.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s in quotes because apparently my idea of reasonable life span of 1+ years is excessive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Perhaps they did the math and figured that it would cost them an extra 2.5 cents, and besides, the marketing folks could trick us into thinking that the pretty stand in the picture was a charging stand.</li>
            <li>Most other trimmers can simply be used over and over again with no maintenance.</li>
            <li>How can two of these devices break in exactly the same way?  </li>
            <li>I guess if a guy sports facial hair and reaches for this product on a near daily basis the plastic organizer might be important.  </li>
            <li>I bought the first at a Wal-Mart while on a business trip that was extended into a 2nd week.  </li>
            <li>From what I&#x27;ve read, it&#x27;s a better trimmer and doesn&#x27;t have these small nuisances.</li>
            <li>Best Trimmer set out there, I have tried others and have been disappointed.</li>
            <li>I get WAAAAAY better results this way instead of the generic 10 dial adjuster other razors come with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My first one was several years ago.  </li>
            <li>I like this product due to its many attachments for different hair lengths.</li>
            <li>Nuff said, except I have to type 10 more word for review to be accepted :s</li>
            <li>And I went out and bought another Whal beard trimmer (same model) to use on my Samoyed and it works as the first one</li>
            <li>why at 4 stars, is that the grip is made of a material designed to give you a better grip, but it also tends to have small bits of hair stuck to it when you use it</li>
            <li>The first model last 3 years</li>
            <li>Now the thing won&#x27;t hold a charge and due to Amazon&#x27;s 30 day return policy it is no longer able to sent back for a replacement.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was my first and last WAHL and Ihighly recommend that you DO NOT purchase</li>
            <li>It exceeds  by far my expectations!</li>
            <li>I use regular blades and this was my first time using electric</li>
            <li>I first bought this last 2010 and now it has died on me, but it lasted 5 years!</li>
            <li>It will still be sharp, but the blades will cut ten times better when you oil them up</li>
            <li>Used it several times and haven&#x27;t even charged it but the first time when I got it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the trimmer doesn&#x27;t always trim so well on the first go over.&lt;br /&gt;Often, it takes several laps to trim the hair.</li>
            <li>For those using this unit for the first time pull the head off following the curve of the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite</li>
            <li>and he digs in his drawer and pulls out the exact same model.  </li>
            <li>It cuts pretty short, but not the shortest cut I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li>It does not come with the stand, just a bag, which though is nice for travelling, it&#x27;s not good if you want to keep it out on your bathroom shelf or vanity.</li>
            <li>but wow, its well made!</li>
            <li>I see more trimmers offer the Lithium batteries than they did a year ago, but not many in this price range.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t want to charge or discharge them too much, but Lithium batteries generally have built in safeguards against that happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time I used it to trim my beard, it pulled on my whiskers several times.  </li>
            <li>I have used it once to trim, shave, cut and put it away only for it to still have good battery life a few weeks later.</li>
            <li>Charging it only takes a few hours and you are good to go for several weeks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a pretty decent trimmer kit that is capable of all basic facial hair managment.  </li>
            <li>The little organizing rack makes it easy to keep track of all the parts on your bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>The old one&#x27;s main trimming head was getting loud,</li>
            <li>still have to use a disposable double bladed razor to clean up the forementioned neck and cheek areas outside the beard</li>
            <li>Like the tools it has, especially the smaller head to clean up under lower lip.</li>
            <li>Wahl should at least offer the option to purchase a nice, fitted organizer - either soft traveler or hard counter style (better yet, both).</li>
            <li>There are very few better bargains in the world than the 32 bucks one will pay for this comprehensive grooming kit.</li>
            <li>this walh ion help my skin to be soft and nice :), but when i open the packcage, i notice some dirty in the handle,</li>
            <li>Like back in the day when it didn&#x27;t matter what kind of foreign iron you showed up with, you were going to get smoked by a big bore Chevy even if its doors didn&#x27;t quite shut.  </li>
            <li>I am replacing my old Wahl shaver with this new All in One Trimmer.  </li>
            <li>This thing is loud when it&#x27;s new and getts louder as it ages.</li>
            <li>it has a newly redesigned holding tray which will now hold all of the attachments (though the product packaging displays the old one).  </li>
            <li>I then took the metal gate off an old 3.5\\&quot; floppy and cut out replacement contacts which I soldered to the new battery.</li>
            <li>replaced the old one with this this new one.</li>
            <li>When I asked if I could have a replacement sent immediately if I paid with a credit card, she said I could do that too, and return the old one after the new one arrived.</li>
            <li>When I asked if I could have a replacement sent immediately if I paid with a credit card, she said I could do that too, and return the old one after the new one arrived.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of wahl products, they stay cool, have tight powerful motors, and have the sharpest ground blades....</li>
            <li>It charges super fast and has a very long lasting battery.</li>
            <li>The battery on this product stopped holding a charge in less than 2 years of light use.</li>
            <li>It cuts mor precise than previous conair and braun models.  </li>
            <li>It is light weight, the charge lasts incredibly long (unlike the nicad versions that could only make it through one trim before slooowwwwwiiiiiinnnnnnnggggg).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a small, cheap, plastic tray that doesn&#x27;t serve much purchase.</li>
            <li>I worked a long time at trying to figure out how to make them fit in as the picture shows until I finally realized that the tray in my package is not the one in the picture.  </li>
            <li>The attachments go on and off easily, yet stay on firmly.  </li>
            <li>For delicate work, like separating that unibrow into two separate eyebrows, the detail head works fine, though perhaps because of the small size of its face plate, it becomes uncomfortably warm during sustained use.  </li>
            <li>Because there is no light on unit or charger you can&#x27;t easily determine which part is malfunctioning.</li>
            <li>Nice size-not big, nor too small.</li>
            <li>It lasted 2 months of frequent use on its first charge, and I expect it to last for years.</li>
            <li>After 6-months the battery only held a 3-5 minute charge and requried a full 8hrs to charge back up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already lost some of  the smaller parts and have chosen to store the stuff in a small wire basket rather than the nice rack provided</li>
            <li>But to date I have only given it the initial full charge and there has been no noticable drop in battery power yet.</li>
            <li>I bought this trimmer at my local store and paid $45 for it, Amazon is offering a much better price ($32 as of this review), but it doesn&#x27;t change the fact that this trimmer is still not worth the price.</li>
            <li>I have used several types of trimmers over the past several years, and while most were adequate for a while, they come nowhere close to this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a big deal to wipe it down with a damp cloth, but I would prefer to be able to just brush it off without a fight.</li>
            <li>This little trimmer deals with it just fine.  </li>
            <li>It was wonderful and easy to use, the smallest razor head is only about less than 1 cm wide, which is small enough to trim the hair between her tiny paws.</li>
            <li>Actually, if I have any complaint, it&#x27;s that it offers too many different capabilities by having way too many different attachments.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Purchased this trimmer 2 years ago and after a year and a half of great use it has become dull and no longer holds a charge have to charge for an hour and keep plugged in to shave my face</li>
            <li>which is why i (initially) gave the 3 star rating (have calld &amp; emaild wahl &amp; will update this review if i get a positive response fr them).</li>
            <li>As it turns out, the battery was the only positive thing about this trimmer.</li>
            <li>I bought this because of all the positive comments about the battery, and I thought the variety of clippers would make it easier to shave all the different hair I have (body hair, sideburns, etc).  </li>
            <li>I mean, if you&#x27;ve gone a few days and need to clean yourself up without being all close-shaven, and you don&#x27;t have anything else handy, it can work.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is decent for fine hair but thicker beard hairs are very hard to be cut and you must be sloooow as to not pull your hair because it feels like it doesn&#x27;t fully cut through the hair at first</li>
            <li>I had to say that first because so many negative reviews obviously missed these words on the Operating Instructions that came with the unit, and they also do not appear on the Amazon website.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this for my husband after the old system died of old age!</li>
            <li>I have had 3 or 4 of these Wahl trimmers in the last 2 years, they use to be better, work well but don&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying for days, but I&#x27;ve been unable to reassemble the spring and whatnot, and I&#x27;m usually pretty good at fixing such things.</li>
            <li>I would avoid using the blades they have for getting a close shave, as well as the nose-hair trimmer if you have other tools for that, but even those are really not bad.</li>
            <li>This new one has an upgraded lithium ion battery that will last much longer.</li>
            <li>even when things work right, and the parts stay on, you get a pretty uneven trim--especially at the #1 setting.</li>
            <li>I agree with previous posters that the extra attachments would be better suited as an addition purchase if desired.</li>
            <li>As I have less hair than most, and pay the same..</li>
            <li>My space is precious and I would have preferred less attachments and a smaller footprint on my bathroom</li>
            <li>The only slight downside is the rubber gripping area is &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; and hair sticks to it.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re okay with #3 or less, then I can&#x27;t recommend this trimmer highly enough.</li>
            <li>I have been loyal to Wahl ever since I started cutting my own hair when I was ~15yo</li>
            <li>However I find that after one year of very light usage, a fully charged battery loses it charge in about a week.  </li>
            <li>I have a thick beard, and this helps out a lot with a very smooth trim/shave.</li>
            <li>When new it was powerful enough to get through my head and beard with ease several times.</li>
            <li>The mechanical parts work just fine, but the material on it rusts within a few uses.  </li>
            <li>I have no doubt that this will last just as long as my original Wahl.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product about a month ago, it worked fine for the few shaves</li>
            <li>Trimmed fine while it ran but now completely dead.</li>
            <li>Worked fine as a beard trimmer, two or three times a week until a few weeks ago.  </li>
            <li>This fine morning I could get it to turn in for a few seconds at a time, so</li>
            <li>Unlike other inexpensive groomers, these blades are meant to be maintained (a good thing, in my opinion), and come with a small bottle of lubricating oil.</li>
            <li>Anyway, a good to go little unit, and you can take the little charger with you when you travel.  </li>
            <li>The little organizer really isn&#x27;t worth much.</li>
            <li>The blades can get pretty hot and the smallest blade and foil shaver can get a little noisy.</li>
            <li>The sole purpose for my purchase was to have a little more customization when trimming my beard and although this product does supply that I cant believe the amount of hairs it just pulls out of my face.</li>
            <li>Sure it vibrates a little, but it&#x27;s lightweight and doesn&#x27;t have enough mass to absorb it all.</li>
            <li>Ultimately, though, I see this unit as a pretty decent deal - especially given the $32 price (sans shipping).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ultimately, though, I see this unit as a pretty decent deal - especially given the $32 price (sans shipping).  </li>
            <li>Dull blades rip out more hair than it cuts.</li>
            <li>The Lithium Ion battery system charges remarkably quickly, without the &amp;#34;memory&amp;#34; issues inherent with other battery powered trimmers.  </li>
            <li>The motor is very strong, the battery has a very long charge on it and it don&#x27;t take little to no time to charge.</li>
            <li>These clippers are not precise or accurate in their clipping.</li>
            <li>And, it&#x27;s not very easy to clean it.</li>
            <li>The Wahl not only has great battery life, but an amazingly powerful motor that allows for even cutting with only one or two passes of the beard.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s advertised as \\&quot;All in One\\&quot; and clearly has lots of options....</li>
            <li>However, as a nose hair or ear hair trimmer, it is clearly inferior to any with rotary heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For body hair trimming, this device is clearly inferior to the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>the various combs just don&#x27;t fit well and sometimes loosen and come off while trimming (giving you a really crappy, uneven beard until you see what&#x27;s happened)&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is clearly an issue with their batteries.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile my package was clearly used since it had finger marks all over it.</li>
            <li>So far that is the only real problem I have with it.  </li>
            <li>would clearly buy this item again and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>Steer clear of this god-awful product.  </li>
            <li>But the guide does not have rounded edges and therefore by the time you complete the shave, you are left with very irritated skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t entirely clear what all the attachments are for though...</li>
            <li>Once intercourse with her exposed steel water directly</li>
            <li>It is a bit loud, but not unbearable.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for a friend and so far he loves it.  </li>
            <li>No complaints so far, but</li>
            <li>My old trimmer, with no guard, did not cut as close...</li>
            <li>So far it is performing well.  </li>
            <li>I contacted WAHL and they said this should not be used anywhere near water</li>
            <li>I am getting ready to buy this trimmer for the third time.</li>
            <li>This trimmer works very well, especially compared to the Conair 13-piece that I had before this.  </li>
            <li>Loud.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very versatile with multiple attachments for trimming beards, as a nose-ear-eyebrow timmer, stubble shaver and hair clipper.  </li>
            <li>If I find myself running late in the morning the shaver works okay, but nothing I would use every day.  </li>
            <li>Battery lasted far longer than anything I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>Idk what the guy is talking about when his review states that this trimmer is too loud.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned it so far.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beast, seems to actually dim the lights when you turn it on (semi-kidding here</li>
            <li>I find the charge life is no-where near what was advertised.  </li>
            <li>I have been trimming it since I was young.</li>
            <li>In comparing the two, the Wahl has a MUCH stronger motor and solid feel.</li>
            <li>Eventually, my old cordless basically became corded.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product as replacement for an old failing electric hair clipper.</li>
            <li>My 10 year old cheaper Remington still works.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this product to replace a Wahl trimmer that I had used for nearly 15 years.</li>
            <li>loud noises</li>
            <li>This would result in around $10 (or 25% of the purchase price) to get it fixed.    </li>
            <li>I gave my two year old a haircut and even using the longest clipper</li>
            <li>As a frequent traveler i wish it was 220v compatible as well.    </li>
            <li>It comes with every conceivable attachment, making it versatile for any use you can think of.</li>

            <li>Some reviewers have noted that the trimmer is loud &amp; bothersome.</li>
            <li>Each time, I worry I&#x27;m going to break the plastic tabs (haven&#x27;t yet, though, thanks to the solid construction).  </li>
            <li>Will post an update about whether this gets fixed and the timing.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s plugged in, it won&#x27;t switch from the ni-cad cell to just direct power.</li>
            <li>Of course, I had to buy another Wahl trimmer to fill in, but I&#x27;m betting they&#x27;re getting the battery issue fixed.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time to trim my beard and it took me twice as long to get the cut hair off the sticky rubber as it did to cut the beard.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too loud, it&#x27;s hair clippers after all.</li>
            <li>Overall, though, I really like this clipper and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>and it works so far as advertised.</li>
            <li>The item is as described and has completely met and exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li>Very durable and hold a charge for several weeks at a time.</li>
            <li>Note that the shiny segment of the body near the blade is plastic, not metal as it may appear in the pictures.</li>
            <li>I would not buy this razor until this flaw is fixed.</li>
            <li>Battery is completely DOA.  </li>
            <li>I got my Wahl Lithium Ion Trimmer in the mail yesterday and even without a complete charge up</li>
            <li>All extra pieces really work well</li>
            <li>I chuckle at the reviews that complain it&#x27;s too loud.</li>
            <li>At least Wahl products are better than the Conair junk.</li>
            <li>trimmer from Wahl offers all the trimming capabilities that any man could want.  </li>
            <li>there are plenty of different attachments included which is really nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it to trim my beard, since I can&#x27;t shave because of my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I am very dissatisfied with the product and advise -</li>
            <li>Seems it would be at home in a professional portable kit.</li>
            <li>(I keep my pate at about \\&quot;stubble level\\&quot; because I prefer that over complete smoothness.)</li>
            <li>Quality and wow</li>
            <li>, my review, do NOT waste your money on this trimmer.</li>
            <li>I got about four years use out of the old one, it had a Ni-MH battery in it, so</li>
            <li>Soft rubber grip on the handle of the trimmer</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is loud.  </li>
            <li>As far as noise and vibration, its a hair trimmer.</li>
            <li>this thing is loud.</li>
            <li>I have used this three times so far without re-charging.</li>
            <li>A soft travel case is needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Who wants back and shoulder stubble?</li>
            <li>Battery now runs about 8 minutes before completely losing its charge.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband to replace his old one.  </li>
            <li>Since my old one gave out I have been sampling trimmers.  </li>
            <li>Wow</li>
            <li>I bought this item for my husband and he used it for 1.5 months when it completely stopped working.</li>
            <li>his old trimmer was on</li>
            <li>Overall I use it about 3-4 times a week and really like it.</li>
            <li>The case does not hold all of the attachments, although that really makes no difference to me personally.  </li>
            <li>Even 2 days old beard can be taken care of.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Completely dissatisfied with this</li>
            <li>I had to replace my old Wahl beard trimmer with a non-replaceable Ni-Cad battery that no longer holds a charge.  </li>
            <li>The heads are interchangeable with my old unit.  </li>
            <li>I DO like the soft case that holds everything in one place --</li>
            <li>The battery lasts much longer on this one, I only have to charge every once in awhile.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t come with the guides like our old one</li>
            <li>I tend to avoid shaving until the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow gets pretty long, and like to use a trimmer before shaving with a blade.</li>
            <li>I use it without a guard to simulate the effect of shaving, and that is as far as I can review it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I always wondered how Patrick Demsey -- Dr. Derek McDreamy on \\&quot;Gray&#x27;s Anatomy\\&quot; -- always manages to keep what looks like a three-day old shadow, without ever being completely clean-shaven or bearded.  </li>
            <li>but I was a way too busy to see it...</li>
            <li>Although this does get somewhat close, my old buzzer (Remington I believe) seems to get closer.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t seem to find another one like my old one that gets as close.</li>
            <li>As a mostly bald man with occasional beards, I needed a trimmer that could keep my facial hair short and occasionally cut my hair.</li>
            <li>Lasted about 3 months then stopped working completely.</li>
            <li>Plenty of power - cuts my beard with no trouble.  </li>
            <li>The battery, by the way, is a 3.7V 750mAh Li-ion (14500) and is soldered directly to the PCB.</li>
            <li>That will be painfully obvious as soon as you pick it up, though it really hits home with a peek inside.</li>
            <li>They are used frequently and seldom need charged.  </li>
            <li>i drop mine frequently</li>
            <li>Bought this to replace another Wahl that was 14 years old.  </li>
            <li>I have had different types but with these I felt like a real barber I was changing heads and everything.</li>
            <li>This is by far the sharpest electric trimmer I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s one feature I miss about my old trimmer ...</li>
            <li>I am an old man</li>
            <li>So far, it has worked like I thought it would.  </li>
            <li>For some reason, this one does not hold it&#x27;s charge as well as the old nicads.  </li>
            <li>Wahl is the #1 choice of professional barbers.  </li>
            <li>my old one</li>
            <li>Seems to work very well, but I&#x27;ve only used it once.</li>
            <li>I bought these clippers for my husband to replace an old one he had that broke.</li>
            <li>so far all Walh trimmer i got</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Strong and powerfull to complete the job</li>
            <li>What I learned is that there are two &#x27;levels&#x27; of product; professional and home use.</li>
            <li>The professional product to which I was accustomed</li>
            <li>THIS IS BY FAR</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, but I&#x27;ve never had a foil shaver irritate my face like</li>
            <li>The picture made these look larger than they really are.</li>
            <li>I had to dedicate an old toothbrush to it just to remove cut hair that would cling to it.</li>
            <li>Not quite professional quality, but as close as you can get in the home market</li>
            <li>I researched a bit and found you shouldn&#x27;t let the LI battery completely discharge which I did.</li>
            <li>- My old Remington had an adjustable blade guard</li>
            <li>I took an old toothbrush and removed all the corrosion</li>
            <li>I recommend purchasing a Wahl professional versus this unit.</li>
            <li>old Samoyed dog who&#x27;s hair is like couch stuffing.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for the last three weeks now and its working very well.</li>
            <li>Stopped working completely after a charge, was not heavily used.  </li>
            <li>Like the clippers, easier to hold than an old Wahl clippers</li>
            <li>Then we got one for my 15 year old son.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work like my old pair.</li>
            <li>This won&#x27;t be a big deal since we have a very convenient outlet in our bathroom.  </li>
            <li>Orig 3 yrs old but still works even with drop.</li>
            <li>I see lots of reviews for this junky trimmer, and it won&#x27;t matter much to its overall rating, but I must add my two cents.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The trimmer is comfortably light, with just enough heft to feel solid but not enough to tire my hand.</li>
            <li>His noticed a difference from his old one immediately.</li>
            <li>Even plugging it in directly to the charger did not help in just getting it on.</li>
            <li>and it completely stopped.</li>
            <li>So far I have had this a month and have used all the attachments and blade</li>
            <li>I kept it plugged into a faulty socket without realizing, and found out that the product had completely drained itself.</li>
            <li>I bought this since my old buzzer kicked the bucket.  </li>
            <li>Requires frequent cleaning which means you need a screwdriver to take it apart.</li>
            <li>my old one.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Wahl Lithium Ion trimmer because my old trimmer I had used for years was a Wahl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>storage case is cheesy and cheap, I am glad it is only the storage tray.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>far, I&#x27;ve ran this out of power once, but it was intentional.</li>
            <li>but I really felt that I should, especially as someone who has owned this product for over 6 months.</li>
            <li>The fixed guides are too short.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the tray that holds it and all the attachments isn&#x27;t nearly big enough and looks cheap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had mine for over 4  years now and although it&#x27;s starting to lose it&#x27;s charge fast</li>
            <li>I have used a ConAir before until it got too old and started to make a noise</li>
            <li>I really forgot when was the last time I&#x27;ve charged it.</li>
            <li>You wouldn&#x27;t think one could buy a quality, US-made product like this for such a reasonable price, but here it is.  </li>
            <li>But I would rather spend the extra $20 for the stainless version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my old Wahl trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I used to keep the old one plugged in all the time, but with this one I just charge it once</li>
            <li>It charges fast, shaves/trims well, has every thing you&#x27;re likely to need, and</li>
            <li>It did come with a lot of different depth combs and three width razors which make it very versatile.</li>
            <li>This product is a complete piece of junk.</li>
            <li>Any complain so far...</li>
            <li>It is a bit loud for am shaving while everyone else is sleeping.</li>
            <li>Complete piece of s</li>
            <li>I just bought another this week, they have made some changes: it now has a soft rubber handle, it&#x27;s a sticky rubber and</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive face, and don&#x27;t like to shave every day, so between</li>
            <li>Of course that&#x27;s because all my old trimmers had NiMH</li>
            <li>Stopped working completely after two.</li>
            <li>After using it once or twice a month, it&#x27;s completely stopped working in under two years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found the key to getting a very close trim that doesn&#x27;t even look like a stubble look.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame my old wahl attachments don&#x27;t work with</li>
            <li>I have read the offers from Wahl to call and follow up on the warranty</li>
            <li>I once let my beard grow, completely untamed for over six months.</li>
            <li>Replaced 20 year old unit.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I just got this for my beard and it does everything so far.</li>
            <li>However I&#x27;m going to print the label and return the old one</li>
            <li>It charges completely in an hour .... and holds a charge for weeks.</li>
            <li>WOW, works like a charm.</li>
            <li>I used to have to charge my old clipper for hours just before needing to use it.</li>
            <li>The package is complete and has all you&#x27;d need to groom yourself</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m glad some people found use for this, but i agree with the negative reviews, DO NOT BUY PLEASE.</li>
            <li>Eventually the battery died and it is too old to replace.  </li>
            <li>I bought this in early May of 2012.</li>
            <li>Totally, completely.  </li>
            <li>I really like these clippers, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this since early January.</li>
            <li>it was too loud &amp; too rusty and wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After one day of use it completely stopped working.</li>
            <li>but then the battery started declining and couldn&#x27;t last more than a few minutes before having to plug it in again.</li>
            <li>This is a rare problem, but there&#x27;s really no excuse.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I personally bought mine from Amazon for $23.00 W/ shipping which is way cheaper than any retail store and for the ladies that are looking to get their boyfriend/husband/family member a gift this will definitely put a smile on anyone&#x27;s face.    </li>
            <li>I believe a non-lithium version is also sold, sometimes for the same price.&lt;br /&gt;There are a few things that could be improved on:&lt;br /&gt;- a better organizer for all the accessory pieces&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using these, he came up to me with a big smile on his face and said, \\&quot;look how short it gets my hair!  </li>
            <li>The narrow head, I think, allows better control and access to smaller areas.</li>
            <li>Overall solid though and worth the price.</li>
            <li>If you need to buzz clip heads regularly then get something more heavy duty.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s narrow enough to get in your nose and snip those pesky hairs, so what more do you want from it?</li>
            <li>The Wahl lithium all-in-one is 4-star clipper... not perfect, but damn good for the price.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why it is so difficult to find a good trimmer/groomer these days.  </li>
            <li>Its a good purchase though for Lithium battery life and when in countries that use weird 50Hz AC, I now have a rechargeable clipper.</li>
            <li>but once again walh fails to deliver a good product.</li>
            <li>Things like, the electric shaver just seems kind of unnecessary to me.  </li>
            <li>Not great, still kind of works, but</li>
            <li>I hate required reviews but for this I will tell you it is the best on the market</li>
            <li>good but difficult to charge</li>
            <li>really like the way it cuts and even a newer Norelco trimmer that I got doesn&#x27;t cut as good as this Wahl does, but the rubber grip drives crazy.</li>
            <li>I use this product for anything hair, except the hair on top of my head, which is extremely thick and curly.</li>
            <li>: This is a very capable beard trimmer with a very long battery life.</li>
            <li>Looking at the materials and construction of the various attachments to the trimmer motor, it is easy to tell that they won&#x27;t last long if used</li>
            <li>Just because I only use one attachment 90% of the time doesn&#x27;t mean the others wont come in handy once in a while.  </li>
            <li>gets used everyday and is always ready when called upon - just the right accessories were included with this purchase</li>
            <li>When the work is done, it can be turned back right side out and pulled back over the body into place with a bit of effort.</li>
            <li>Your likely using this in front of a mirror in a bathroom, there is likely an outlet right there.  </li>
            <li>If you would like a trimmer that will leave you hanging half way through your morning shave, you have found the right one!  </li>
            <li>Wahl has a reputation for good professional trimmers, but they really dropped the ball on this one due to poor quality accessories.  </li>
            <li>Even the screen shaver attachment is still working good, and I used that about half of every day for the past 4.5 years too.  </li>
            <li>Overall, my beard looks better than ever--the 2 other trimmers I used to use were both in the same price range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The lack of a carrying case is particularly felt with such a large number of attachments, and a vacuum feature to capture hair clippings would be a nice-to-have.</li>
            <li>I use this every other day before work, it lets me keep a light beard (sporadic since my facial hair hasn&#x27;t decided to fully grow out at the age of 27).</li>
            <li>The accessory tray is too small and attachments fall out easily.</li>
            <li>The older model had a similar rubber handle that seemed slightly easier to clean.</li>
            <li>Also previously mentioned is the fact that the rubber grip tends to attract and hold clipped whiskers, which is true.</li>
            <li>If you have a trimmer for a long thick beard you would like to recommend, we would love to know the brand and model!</li>
            <li>Lithium ion battery is superior to other types commonly used in shavers and trimmers.</li>
            <li>I liked about this one was the special \\&quot;detail\\&quot; trimming head that was less wide than normal and could help shape a goatee or get into hard to reach places.  </li>
            <li>I use a trimmer regularly to trim my beard when it starts to get a little too long and have always just kind of excepted that the trim was not that even.</li>
            <li>Do NOT buy into \\&quot;super strong titanium coated blades\\&quot; \\&quot;blades that never need oiling\\&quot; and any other claim from trimmers with standard batteries and CHEAP blades that WILL fail and need to be replaced.  </li>
            <li>I then have to clean it out before it works a little longer.</li>
            <li>But since that first charge ran out, I can&#x27;t seem to get a single shave out of this thing without it dying.  </li>
            <li>the main problem:&lt;br /&gt;- too many poor quality attachments.</li>
            <li>Normally there is a light that goes from red (charging) to green (charged), but for this trimmer you just plug it in and let it charge overnight.  </li>
            <li>The other plastic parts I would never use I just threw away, considered them \\&quot;fluff\\&quot; to make me think I got my monies worth.  </li>
            <li>other reviews mention, the grip does get hairs stuck to it, but it&#x27;s worth it - just rinse your hands after using it.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried any other trimmers but this thing is worth</li>
            <li>One small issue is that the main razor attachment tends to pop out a tad easily, so that when I&#x27;m removing a plastic attachment I tend to remove both at the same time, but that might just be me.</li>
            <li>The motor is powerful and the blades are sharp.</li>
            <li>A Wahl representative responded to my original amazon comment stating that my comment (that is, my quotation of product warranty) does not accurately reflect Wahl&#x27;s service.</li>
            <li>Though it took some getting used to (having to change the guards) over my older one which had a single adjustable guard, I grew accustomed to having the security of knowing that it wasn&#x27;t going to slip from a number 6 to a 2 and leave me looking like high school</li>
            <li>After a few more months the other blade also broke the same exact way.</li>
            <li>Soaking in toilet water over night doesnt really help a trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve said this, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll have to charge it sometime this week, but the point is the charge is ridiculously</li>
            <li>Because the teeth on the comb are too small for facial hair it misses a lot of the hair and you have to go over your face many times.</li>
            <li>didnt expect that much less this quickly.</li>
            <li>the LI-Ion battery holds a decent charge (about a week with daily use.  </li>
            <li>The second time was ok, but again, the attachment was so small it would have taken all day to try to shave.    </li>
            <li>Powerful, long lasting charge, lots of clipping/trimming/detailing options and a tray to keep all the parts together...</li>
            <li>Not only are the blades on the Wahl much higher quality, the various attachments cover all the bases.</li>
            <li>Same design as the older model, but</li>
            <li>Buy a cheap one, not worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>This shaver has a long lasting, powerful battery.</li>
            <li>The rubber grip does seem to hold on to bits of hair, but a quick wipe with a slightly damp wash cloth removes them</li>
            <li>The extra blade is the main asset.</li>
            <li>Worked fine until it broke less than 6 months later.</li>
            <li>But battery lasts and a decent shave overall</li>
            <li>The main problem I have is switching between the different settings is a bit tricky without practice.</li>
            <li>it actually did a surprisingly decent job</li>
            <li>Finally, getting the various attachments on/off the main unit isn&#x27;t easy (especially with wet hands/fingers).  </li>
            <li>, so I will say that this trimmer lasted me over a year before the main blade finally cracked &amp; broke.</li>
            <li>It was a replacement for an older model that lasted several years.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Although it comes with attachments for cutting the hair on top of your head, I can&#x27;t imagine this would really be strong enough for that job.</li>
            <li>I had the older model, basically the same trimmer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still searching for a decent electric - should have gone back to Norelco I guess.</li>
            <li>This was my third attempt at finding a decent trimmer.</li>
            <li>this isn&#x27;t an item you want only sometimes working, especially if you need it for work, which was exactly the case.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even find a YouTube video about putting this particular model back together.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m using it wrong, which I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li>I had several criteria for this: it had to hold a charge for a long time, cut hair well, and had to be fun to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really liked this trimmer, but in a little less than one year it won&#x27;t hold a charge.  </li>
            <li>This is not due to lack of attachments, as there are nearly a dozen included.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it take forever to shave due to the small head size but it doesn&#x27;t do that good of a job at shaving(doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Wahl may not be quite as slick in their marketing as other consumer product companies, but their basic product is a good value.</li>
            <li>Other reviewers commented on the beard clipper pulling hairs -- they are so right.  </li>
            <li>After owning this Wahl Lithium Ion facial hair trimmer for 2 weeks one of the blades began making a high pitched buzzing noise.</li>
            <li>Obviously the trimmer blade is defective and one would expect this to be covered by their highly touted FIVE YEAR WARRANTY.  </li>
            <li>The blades are fine and precise but the cutting path is slightly narrower than my full size trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The compnents show high quality and work quite well, especially for trimming beards and sideburns.</li>
            <li>I already owned a similar trimmer made by Remmington, but this new WAHL trimmer completely trumps the Remington in performance.  </li>
            <li>It was powerful, and the charge would last a VERY long time.</li>
            <li>I then punched them back through the trimmer&#x27;s board, touched them up with a little more solder and snapped the case back together.</li>
            <li>I picked up a replacement battery from one of those Chinese online retailers (you know, where you might go if you wanted to find a \\&quot;deal\\&quot; that was \\&quot;extreme\\&quot;) and bought a pair of 3.7v 900mAh Li-ions for less than $5 with free shipping.</li>
            <li>Seems like it would have been easy to attach a real razor head, but alas</li>
            <li>They honored the 5 year limited warranty (longest we&#x27;ve seen, to be sure), and a few weeks later, a working trimmer complete with brand new blades arrived.</li>
            <li>I got used to holding them a certain way to minimize injuries, but after using other trimmers and not having to be so careful during normal use, this one can only be described as mildly dangerous at best...</li>
            <li>In addition, the box says very clearly made in USA, and the various items are clearly marked &amp;#34;China&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>The battery really does last a long time and charges quickly, the blades cut well, and the attachments all seem to perform as expected.  </li>
            <li>It stays charged for a long time and is always ready when you need it.</li>
            <li>, happy that it plugs directly into unit; no base charger (which I hate to would travel with!).</li>
            <li>If a longer stint away from home is required, its small wall-wart DC adapter would fit inside of a dopp kit without any trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gives a very close trim and the battery lasts long.  </li>
            <li>It charges fast and stays charged for a long time.</li>
            <li>Battery has lasted a long time without a charge, I do keep a very close beard by using the closest shave attachment.</li>
            <li>ok but not as wide as I thought it was , but I kept it for emergencies , only about 1 inch wide</li>
            <li>- Charges fast and runs long.  </li>
            <li>retail package has the usual number of cheap combs and brushes.</li>
            <li>I really like the long battery life.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t sound like a vaccuum cleaner at 6 am) and he has no &#x27;gripping&#x27; problems.</li>
            <li>and the whole bunch will be in the trash, and I will learn once again the truth of the old saying that \\&quot;poor people can&#x27;t afford cheap things.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>It is small and light weight.</li>
            <li>I barely got around 20 uses from the trimmer before it completely stopped working.</li>
            <li>I liked the small nose/ear trimmer head, but never once used any of the other attachments.    </li>
            <li>Last but not least,</li>
            <li>Wow - this little clipper really has the power and holds the charge!!</li>
            <li>It just seems such a waste that \\&quot;made in China\\&quot; products never seem to last more than two years.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>I spent years using scissors to keep it under control before buying my first electric trimmer.</li>
            <li>I was able to trim my mustache and occasionally extend my haircut a few extra weeks.  </li>
            <li>First the wide width trimmer broke, then the ear/nose hair trimmer broke.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was pretty excited about the precision detailer attachment because I&#x27;m tired of having a bunch of grooming tools in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>Long story short,  It cuts evenly and smoothly, holds a charge forever and will last you at least 4 years (thats how old my original one is.)</li>
            <li>It was also pretty loud as other reviewers noted.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve taken this trimmer to many different places i&#x27;ve lived, other countries, and even on a cross country bicycle trip (to keep me from looking like a total bum).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for about 2.5 years, and the battery is only holding a charge for about 10 minutes, and the plastic case is separating where the attachments go in, so they don&#x27;t have as tight of fit as they should have.</li>
            <li>Very disappointing; especially since we are very happy with our Wahl clippers.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be doing a lot of changing either, but the little I played with the parts they seemed adequate.</li>
            <li>More expensive razors are washable - that would be nice but those are typically 2 - 3 times more expensive.</li>
            <li>The quality of clipper wins hand down.</li>
            <li>It is so powerful it always gets the job done with out any hang ups or clogs or bogging down.</li>
            <li>We took it out of the packaging and was surprised to see that it worked without even needed to charge it for the first time, man this battery must last a long time!</li>
            <li>power supply is small and light, but it&#x27;s only 120V - a problem for me because I live in a dual-voltage house.</li>
            <li>I constantly get &amp;#34;bare spots&amp;#34; where the hair is essentially clipped right at the skin, or just barely above.</li>
            <li>However, this one seems a little cheaply made and the on-off button has already popped off, but clicks back on.  </li>
            <li>You have to go over it several times to get a smooth feel and it can be a little noisy, but every one of these type of razors I&#x27;ve had were that way.</li>
            <li>Missed hairs on a regular basis but is very powerful and it makes for a quick trim, just requires a few extra passes than expected.</li>
            <li>only complaint, albeit minor, is that I use it to trim existing stubble... and the cutter with NO guard on it cuts very close, and the smallest guard leaves more stubble than I would like.</li>
            <li>Wahl cut more hair than my battery powered Panasonic nose trimmer, which was under powered, and had a hard time starting up.</li>
            <li>like other reviewers said, the clips are fragile, and even while gently trying to remove it, the whole head came off with the attachment.  </li>
            <li>It does not cut as short as I prefer, so I bought a new one a couple of months ago.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Two weeks later I received a brand new trimmer in the mail.</li>
            <li>Now I am in the market on buying a new one, possibly this one again.       </li>
            <li>So, instead of having my wife search all over creation for the parts and charger back home, I&#x27;ll just pay $40 to have a new set shipped.</li>
            <li>That being said, these trimmers set a new standard for power and trim level.</li>
            <li>This new lithium-ion battery (the same type as in notebooks/netbooks/tablets, etc.)</li>
            <li>I recently called to order a new head that had been lost.</li>
            <li>The product was receive in new condition and functions as advertised, the only negitive is I could not figure out how to store all the attachments in the holder provided.</li>
            <li>The variable length attachment and other single length attachments are extremely cheap.</li>
            <li>Fast charging that lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li>It works very well for my use and it does hold a charge for very long.</li>
            <li>Was not very powerful when charged the first time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works great not only for beards but for trimming just about anywhere, though I&#x27;m still too chicken to try the clipper blade for a self-clipped #2 haircut - I think I&#x27;ll stick with a cost-cutters type vendor for those.  </li>
            <li>The blade and guard design never gave me a clean, even shave, and creating fades never worked as well as it had with my previous (or current) Norelco.  </li>
            <li>This is smaller than you would expect, but seriously cuts hair, trims beards better than my old clunky NiMH cordless clippers.</li>
            <li>A lot of times when companies make disposable electronics like this, they will at least make the battery easy to remove (once you&#x27;ve destroyed the thing by opening it up)</li>
            <li>But so far I am much happier than expected.</li>
            <li>All the accessories are nicely made, the unit lasts forever between charges, and the cutting blades seems to work very well...</li>
            <li>Battery last pretty long.</li>
            <li>I found that the only useful attachments are the blades and not really the shaver attachment.</li>
            <li>Holds a long charge and runs for a long time, lots of useful tools and attachments.  </li>
            <li>I said that they didn&#x27;t get back to me fast enough</li>
            <li>It can do everything from shaving to standard haircuts to more complex \\&quot;man-scaping.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I can charge the trimmer over night, but the next day when it comes time to use it, it will only fast for 5 minutes of use.  </li>
            <li>It has only 6 settings where most of the dedicated trimmers have at least twice that.</li>
            <li>I know I shouldn&#x27;t have expected much, but I was surprised at what I found.</li>
            <li>sure, the stand it comes with is largely useless as the moment you brush your hand against it, the whole thing collapses.  </li>
            <li>Only thing I wish was that there was a bar to show you how much power was left on the trimmer</li>
            <li>This product is not what I expected it does not hold a charge,stays on chager if not for  an hour or more it will be dead when needed</li>
            <li>It finally died out on me when I left it plugged in charging for 4 days straight.</li>
            <li>I only use them for my beard, of which I like to keep very trim and short...</li>
            <li>First and foremost, it still just doesn&#x27;t charge the battery long enough and the electricity isn&#x27;t a bypass.</li>
            <li>too much 4 me to getto p[ost office, but i have learned to buy local, since my recent purchases have been disapointing</li>
            <li>Not liking for a bar to waste space, just simple light.</li>
            <li>a man in his later mid-life who wants to maintain a well-groomed appearance, I find regular trimming of nose and ear hair</li>
            <li>This thing has plenty of power to easily cut through a thick beard without issue.</li>
            <li>I use this once or twice a week for routine trimming - nothing super heavy duty.</li>
            <li>Well built and strong for thick hair.</li>
            <li>It has stayed sharp and so long as I clean it properly, works as well as the day it was new.  </li>
            <li>Plus they are located right down the road in Sterling</li>
            <li>Right down to the skin.  </li>
            <li>I placed the cutter head along side the one off my aging MB200 on a scanner and it&#x27;s very apparent  </li>
            <li>I now have a 2 step process, I use this one first to trim down to close and then my old one to get even closer.</li>
            <li>I would MUCH rather have had a single higher-quality blade.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>It stays pretty sharp when oiled</li>
            <li>This was the one and major flaw I found with this product.</li>
            <li>Since I used none of the other attachments, I wonder - if they broke the first time used.... of course, they would no be covered either.  </li>
            <li>I have very coarse facial hair that usually has to be taken off with a Mach 3 or better blade.</li>
            <li>Acts like blades not sharp and/or sticking.</li>
            <li>i ever came across no other words for it</li>
            <li>Changing the attachments is a snap, and the trim blades cut close but are not sharp and don&#x27;t snag your skin.</li>
            <li>No other Wahl product I have owned has ever done that.  </li>
            <li>Then, the case is easily pried open, using a small screwdriver.</li>
            <li>Saved me from spending at least $70 more, and from the hassle and irritation of old fashioned shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After about 6 months, the battery holds almost no charge, so it must be plugged in for several minutes prior to and during use.</li>
            <li>Since your face isn&#x27;t a flat surface and it&#x27;s elastic, you are pretty much guaranteed to end up with a patchy beard because the curve of the comb will not successfully keep the blade at a consistent length away from your skin.  </li>
            <li>When changing accessories it is necessary to occasionally clean the hair shavings off of the driving areas, and they have grease on them - that&#x27;s what the little brush is for.</li>
            <li>It has both a small and large blade set, but I don&#x27;t see that I&#x27;ll ever use the large blade.</li>
            <li>It would be nice to just pop out the bad one and pop in a replacement vs. buying a whole new trimmer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It would be nice to just pop out the bad one and pop in a replacement vs. buying a whole new trimmer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The heads and the various cutting guides attach easily and precisely.    </li>
            <li>Also, the attachments are not long enough for my hair, which normally takes a 4 and a 5 attachment.</li>
            <li>This particular trimmer is Lithium-Ion (Li-Ion), and that means a long time between charges.  </li>
            <li>I rarely used any of the other accessories that came with it but for the price it definitely did what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But, I think  the blade teeth are too fine to accommodate thick hair.</li>
            <li>Product works very well, only reason for rating it a four stars is because it pulls the hair a little at certain angles.</li>
            <li>A great trimmer and the only minor complaint I have is that it doesn&#x27;t trim as close to my face as the previous trimmers did.</li>
            <li>This is one powerful little trimmer.  </li>
            <li>The attachments snap on and snap off a certain way that can be a little difficult at first, but gets easier as you do it more often.</li>
            <li>I have tried several other products, and this one is the best for overall cutting and trimming.  </li>
            <li>I expected a mediocre trimmer, similar to the other brands I&#x27;ve owned, but this is superb.</li>
            <li>Then I went back to my other trimmers and found out that this thing has power and will cut more and not bog down like the others.</li>
            <li>Very small, easy to transport.</li>
            <li>I think Wahl should be ashamed to ship one of their motors with cheap plastic accessories that fall apart if you stare at them too hard.  </li>
            <li>Seems fine, only used once, tried a few of the different fixtures</li>
            <li>The cheap Philips it replaced lasted 4 years, and was dull, but still running when I \\&quot;retired\\&quot; it.    </li>
            <li>Overall this is a powerful trimmer with sharp blades and nice construction, loaded down with attachments that either don&#x27;t work properly or add very little value.  </li>
            <li>great first few uses then went dull switched heads and that one went dull rite away</li>
            <li>I always trusted Wahl and spent a little more on this one compared to others I found that got the same reviews.</li>
            <li>When I do need to recharge it takes very little time to be up to full.  </li>
            <li>The last \\&quot;con\\&quot; is the real deal-killer for me, as I could live with the other ones.  </li>
            <li>In response to the Negative reviews below, I have not found them to be accurate.    </li>
            <li>first I was scratching my head a few times before I was brave enough to remove the default cutting attachment.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The attachments in general are a bit of a pain, as everyone else mentions.</li>
            <li>I bought this device about a year ago because Wahl is a brand of trimmers that I generally trust.  </li>
            <li>A wimpy razor - two star, and a confusing amalgam of plastic parts that don&#x27;t really fit so well together.</li>
            <li>Though the handle is comfortable to hold, hair and skin flakes stick to it and is almost near impossible to clean off.    </li>
            <li>This is quite minor... and more of a piece of information than a complaint.</li>
            <li>I ended up buying a second small foil head shaver for that detailed touch up work.</li>
            <li>Nothing about the performance of this trimmer&#x27;s shaver head has changed my mind, and for shaving the entire face it is clearly inferior to the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>and I really like the fact that the battery doesn&#x27;t drain when not in use (product claim as I haven&#x27;t owned it long enough to truly test this out).</li>
            <li>But I did that in the past and spent a lot more money, dropped it &amp; broke.  </li>
            <li>Cuts very close and battery lasts long enough</li>
            <li>only minor complaint is the head changing: To me part of the most important portion of the printed directions the pictures are too small to see.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t make it through an entire shave before switching to my old trimmer that has wider teeth.</li>
            <li>After using for a while a charge barely lasts for one trimming session.</li>
            <li>I only wish I&#x27;d have thrown away my old trimmer a year ago and bought this one.</li>
            <li>It has enough reserve power to give a complete haircut, assuming you are not an ape.</li>
            <li>- Wow, different opinion.</li>
            <li>(always don&#x27;t use too much pressure, be careful),</li>
            <li>already (actually it is 5 months old).</li>
            <li>They are sending me a replacement, and when I receive it, I am to send the old one back.</li>
            <li>say 3 days later and find that it had completely discharged of all power or did so within minutes of use, and thus needed my plugging into a socket.</li>
            <li>They barely trim stubble.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, it completely died after about the third month I had it.</li>
            <li>and so far have only charged the battery at the time I opened the box.  </li>
            <li>I too draw weary of the old cadmium rechargeable battery shortcomings (short charge durations + memory problems).     </li>
            <li>The handle material attracts hairs but a Wahl video on youtube explained that wiping with a wet cloth cleans it off very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this set barely over a year and use it twice a month.  </li>
            <li>The clipper blade could be larger as it takes quite a while to complete the job.  </li>
            <li>My only recommendation to Wahl is to add a light indicator that starts out red when you begin charging and turns to green when the battery is fully charged.</li>
            <li>My old drug store Conair lasted ten times longer.</li>
            <li>Not at all what I expected very unprofessional feel pulls a lot of hair</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m back to the old brand.</li>
            <li>Who wants to keep a wet towel with a bunch of hair in their bathroom?</li>
            <li>I bought this in March, now it&#x27;s barely August.  </li>
            <li>I use the shaver everyday, and it does ok, as long as I don&#x27;t actually try to use it on my entire face, because that just isn&#x27;t happening.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The wide trimmer and accessories meant for hair trimming I really haven&#x27;t tried and probably won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>but I barely had it for 4 months and</li>
            <li>The last star could be earned if Wahl fixed the two criticisms below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wahl needs to go back to the old design.  </li>
            <li>and it would last longer far from the truth</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this product would hold up under constant professional use, but it might.  </li>
            <li>Barely usable after a year of using once per week to trim beard.  </li>
            <li>After 6 weeks of use, he is wanting to replace it as it frequently pulls on his facial hair.  </li>
            <li>So far those are still built to last.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only 14 months old..</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how well it did until I had to revert back to my old unit to get by until I could replace this one.  </li>
            <li>I ended up having to fall back on my old Philips Norelco groomer anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Went back to his old one.</li>
            <li>To be fair, my trimmer is pretty old, maybe 5 years, and I&#x27;ve just sucked it up and lived with it even though it&#x27;s been getting worse and worse since there does not appear to be any way for the user to change batteries on this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>as big as the M/S attachment on old clippers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so upset that this one apparently had no durability at all.</li>
            <li>When you open it up the battery is a 3.7v 750mah AA size, but it is soldered directly to the circuit board.</li>
            <li>Had another trimmer (different brand completely) that crapped out on me.</li>
            <li>Only time will tell if this lasts longer than my old norelco.  </li>
            <li>Despite shopping around for some time and continuing to use my old model for facial and body grooming, I ended up purchasing the newer model with the Lithium battery.</li>
            <li>The 9818 was also apparently defective.</li>
            <li>and I used for body trim and never wet.</li>
            <li>But nowhere near enough to complain about unless it takes you 6~7 hours to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>time i used it, it wasn&#x27;t cutting nearly as well, and i knew i didn&#x27;t have much time before it died, so i had to apply more pressure to the skin and (which is of course my fault) cut myself.  </li>
            <li>It pulls on my hair, especially where it is shorter near the neck.</li>
            <li>After about 5 years, the battery finally died on my old one and I use this 2-3 times per week.</li>
            <li>Needs an indication on either the trimmer or the charger that shows if it is actually charging and if charging is complete.</li>
            <li>Second is no red / green light telling you if its done charging.</li>
            <li>Insult to injury, the cord to charge the trimmer apparently just sits there.  </li>
            <li>I have no regrets purchasing this product.</li>
            <li>Anyway, shortly after I rashly posted that review, Wahl got back to me in their normal course, and said just send it in</li>
            <li>After talking with A lady at Wahl, it is finally clear that you should not charge for more than a hour, even if completely dead, and not to charge it until completely dead.</li>
            <li>The attachments are kind of useless.  </li>
            <li>So many pieces, so poorly labeled</li>
            <li>The shaver barrier screen is to0 thick and as a result does not give a smooth result.  </li>
            <li>While I appreciate the quality and simplicity, it doesn&#x27;t do as good of a job as cutting the hair on my head.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is the shaving head as it is mediocre at best.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There is no charging indicator (no indication that it is charging and no indication that the battery is full), the charging is totally open loop (plug, leave for a few hours and hope it is charged).&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are a few cons, but nothing worth taking off a star.  </li>
            <li>everyone has an outlet close to their bathroom mirror, you should be able to use the product plugged in or not, not solely on it&#x27;s poor battery</li>
            <li>There is no other rechargeable battery technology I&#x27;m aware of that could even approach, much less match</li>
            <li>It was very light weight and not like the other Wahl trimmers I&#x27;d seen in the past.</li>
            <li>Blades are garbage and go dull very quickly even when regularly</li>
            <li>This is less of an issue, because the T Blade is comfortable enough to use, and since it&#x27;s larger, it&#x27;s actually a bit faster to shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m only going to take off one star for this because I believe most users will settle on a single head, and a single comb, and put all the other attachments in a ziplock bag in their closet.  </li>
            <li>It works, but made me sorely miss my old Norelco Turbo Vacuum Trimmer, so I just gave the Wahl to Goodwill and bought another Norelco Turbo Vac.</li>
            <li>And I only use the main trimmer, not the little attachment guys, so I can&#x27;t really rate those bits.</li>
            <li>and this is a better trimmer than both in terms of power and versatility.s, and are easily knocked out when the flimsy base gets knocked around.    </li>
            <li>Upgraded to 2 stars (they really shouldn&#x27;t have both broken so quickly).</li>
            <li>The only positive thing I can say for this product is that the lithium battery does last for a long time.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps it&#x27;s due to my own thick facial hair, but if you&#x27;re looking for a Trimmer that won&#x27;t pull on your hair, you may want to look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>blades have large gaps in the sides so all your hair &amp;#34;conveniently&amp;#34; gathers inside the motor cavity and the intricate parts that move the blades, and the provided brush is too poorly designed to clean that out, so be prepared to vacuum it</li>
            <li>but it took a few changes to get it right.</li>
            <li>i loved the old stand, hate the new carrying case, i want the stand not a case!</li>
            <li>The manual is not very useful if you are trying to figure out what attachment does what or how much hair each attachment will cut.  </li>
            <li>I bet the people at Walmart thought I look funny coming in with a half trimmed beard</li>
            <li>After reading the fine print it&#x27;s hard to tell if anything at all is actually covered - why not put 100 year warranty on the package?  </li>
            <li>The different blades are a little tricky to interchange, but not too much of a problem!!</li>
            <li>This Wahl trimmer is small, lightweight, charges quickly, and does it&#x27;s job well.</li>
            <li>I am using this to shave because I am not very fond of a clean cut and the troubles of conventional razors.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s hard to clean after every shave.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know what some of these other reviewers are talking about -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had mine for a couple of years and it still cuts fast and the blades are sharp.</li>
            <li>There is no charge indicator, direction really matters unlike other trimmers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>This includes an every other day beard touch up and a whole head shave.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t really used the other accessories.</li>
            <li>Although I can&#x27;t really complain about this one, I wish I&#x27;d gone with the other.</li>
            <li>and it is somewhat hard to clean off.</li>
            <li>Sharp and cuts very well.</li>
            <li>keep it on the charger.&lt;br /&gt;liion batteries would rather be charged after little use many times over being drained and few charges.&lt;br /&gt;it will kill the battery by draining it before charging</li>
            <li>It serves well enough, but it&#x27;s not the exact length I would like, and even this fixed attachment is still more difficult to remove and replace than other attachments I have used with cheaper trimmers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My belief with these trimmers was I wouldn&#x27;t use the guards since I have a steady hand and could just slide them down my beard to pick off all the wild hairs.</li>
            <li>I started searching for a new one and it didn&#x27;t take long to find this one!</li>
            <li>I never got the blades wet, but as other reviewers noted, the blade RUSTED QUICKLY.</li>
            <li>I have had no major problems so far</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great, it&#x27;s just that there are a few useless peices.  </li>
            <li>the razor is also extremely loud and vibrates accordingly in the hand, not pleasant or comfortable at all.&lt;br /&gt;i tried plugging it into the wall and turning it back on, but it does not bypass the battery charge.  </li>
            <li>The only complaint I have is the cheap looking accessory holder.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t a concern for me at all, and so far has only reinforced the initial impression I have of, well ...</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t a concern for me at all, and so far has only reinforced the initial impression I have of, well ...</li>
            <li>Like the title says, I&#x27;m on my second one of these, as the old one finally gave out (battery issue).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not obvious at a glance -- or indeed, so far as I can tell, possible at all to tell -- when the trimmer is fully charged.  </li>
            <li>I did find that it&#x27;s slightly more difficult to get a closer trim than our old trimmer.</li>
            <li>Spent all day trying to put it back together again (again, thanks to not documentation).  </li>
            <li>Screen shaver is very tricky to open to empty the trimmings, and there is no instructions on how to do so.</li>
            <li>How can a company (especially Wahl) create a trimmer that completely stops working after only one month.  </li>
            <li>I use it as a personal groomer which seems to work better because of the thin hair on my chest and stomach.</li>
            <li>purchased this unit as xmas gift for my son who loved it til it died inexplicably 7 months later.</li>
            <li>I needed to clean the blades often and take it slow.</li>
            <li>I hated it and am looking forward to finding something better, even if that means paying substantially more.</li>
            <li>The adapters require a little giggle to attach it right and the plastic guides are sturdy enough to stay on place.  </li>
            <li>First being the bottom is not completely flat, slightly domed.</li>
            <li>After using this trimmer for several months I have discovered what I consider a major flaw in design after I wrote this review.</li>
            <li>and the next day they had a major rust issue.</li>
            <li>The blades were not sharp enough.  </li>
            <li>For the price, you can&#x27;t beat this little trimmer, and it charges fast!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use any guard to trim my face, and the blades seem to have a sharp spot that occasionally seems to snag or snip at me.. not sure how to explain it, maybe one of the teeth protrudes slightly more or something.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have extensive experience with other trimmers, but this seems pretty solid to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The little clipper is beating itself to death somehow, and eventually, probably pretty soon, it will quit.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably decent at trimming a long beard to a short one but does not work well for trimming a short beard to stubble which is my 2x a week routine.</li>
            <li>thought I finally figured out what to order but reading all the reviews found one guy saying the combs did not fit quite right and another saying the comb was causing it to pull hairs.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money- spend a little more and get something that will last.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, after using it only 4 times after 4 month (I don&#x27;t need to trim my dog everyday, once a month is good enough), the motor in the main body stopped running for no reason.  </li>
            <li>The only bad thing i can say is that i wish it had a charge light indicator to let me know if it is fully charged or not,even some of the cheap trimmers have this option.</li>
            <li>Disappointed that I can&#x27;t find any truly great ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I shave my head about every two days and also use this guy on general facial maintenance every day.</li>
            <li>However,like the previous reviewer said, the cut hairs stick to the rubber on the outside the shaver like glue, and spent about 15 minutes trying to clean them off.  </li>
            <li>i should have taken it back then, because this thing was clearly used in store or brought back because it didn&#x27;t work and just put back on the shelf by the target employees, or used at some point in shipping.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The clippers are sharp,  charge fast,  and the charge seems to last a while.  </li>
            <li>Now, it barely lasts 5 minutes on a \\&quot;full\\&quot; charge and 5-10 minute bump charges only give it around a minute.</li>
            <li>I still go to the barber every once in a while to get a professional clean-up, but not nearly as often as I used to.</li>
            <li>I do use professional hair clippers when the beard gets too long, then use the Wahl for clean-up. .</li>
            <li>elsewhere- the bare cutter (like pictured) does not cut close enough.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to replace my 20 yr old Wahl trimmer.  </li>
            <li>The battery lasts quite long between charges (I used it about 10 times and did not need to charge it so far).</li>
            <li>I do not understand why, but the one i got will no long turn on.  </li>
            <li>Barely acceptable for occasional use.  </li>
            <li>Choose the attachment(s) you need in the first few days of ownership, then store the rest.</li>
            <li>Save the box because it is much more helpful than the printed instructions that come in very small print and never really explain what everything is for,</li>
            <li>The reason I am writing this review is I want men to be aware of what they are missing on if they havent tried or used this before.</li>
            <li>Worked well for first few uses.  </li>
            <li>I learned that in the first few times I used it.</li>
            <li>This is an easy-to-use small but powerful trimmer.</li>
            <li>the past I have always &amp;#34;clean-shaven&amp;#34; my whole face, but recently I grew tired of shaving and decided to grow a simple &amp;#34;Van Dyke&amp;#34; just to see if I liked it.  </li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t hold ANY charge and often bogs down so much that it pulls my hairs out.</li>
            <li>I like using a disposable every other / every 3rd day to cut it nice and tight with a little stubble.  </li>
            <li>Too many little pieces!!!!  </li>
            <li>have had The exact same issues with the 2nd trimmer and its been less than a year!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first one was over 3 years ago, and the little battery finally just won&#x27;t go anymore.</li>
            <li>Nice to give something other than video game related things !!!!!</li>
            <li>It works alright, but every time you wana change the head unit on it you have to unscrew two screws and carefully put the new head on and then screw in two screws.  </li>
            <li>No thanks, for that shipping I can buy a new unit.  </li>
            <li>Hands down, this trimmer is super sharp.  </li>
            <li>But ... less than a year of once-a-week use, the rechargeable battery didn&#x27;t hold much of a charge.   </li>
            <li>B000XVXK12 Gillette Fusion Power Phenom Razor]], I have always believed that electric razors are for men who don&#x27;t really insist on a close shave (or less facetiously for men whose lifestyle requires shaving on-the-go).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d previously purchased an all in one Remington from Target, and it was absolute junk.</li>
            <li>, I had the previous version with NiCad battery, this one is much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Apparently Wahl packages this product with different options for different retailers.  </li>
            <li>The battery seams to last long time, again so far.</li>
            <li>So far I have had no problem with the battery, it holds a charge for a long time, I only charged it once a month</li>
            <li>Needless to say, it now takes over an hour for a full trim, which is absolutely unacceptable.</li>
            <li>Worse yet, the construction quality is pretty much junk.</li>
            <li>I found it no more effective than a real round headed ear/nose trimmer.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this not a bad product, but the quality could really have been improved.</li>
            <li>However, after about 6 months of use, most of the blades started cutting my skin (I guess they&#x27;re not as sharp), and the shaver itself rattles too much, it&#x27;s gotten too loud, and it just doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li>A single one-hour charge has yielded seven shaves so far.     </li>
            <li>a single stubble guard that was adjustable, and very clearly marked for each depth setting- with Arabic numbers 1</li>
            <li>Previous clippers we have purchased when they got more dull would bend the hair, this does not do this.</li>
            <li>is the  third time I&#x27;ve been burned by thinking a German product was superior (Opel, the worst car I ever owned; Bosch dishwasher that doesn&#x27;t clean the dishes).</li>
            <li>I thought it was going to be a cheaply made, weak rip off.</li>
            <li>I rarely leave negative reviews, but this item and the company leave a GREAT DEAL to be disappointed in.</li>
            <li>My first beard trimmer was at least ten years old.  </li>
            <li>The first time I left it in a hotel and the second one I misplaced the blade attachments.</li>
            <li>The base to hold everything is pretty cheap and doesn&#x27;t hold all the components very well, but since I don&#x27;t use the attachments I have them in a baggie in a drawer.  </li>
            <li>The double headed trimmer does not fit anywhere except in the first drawer next to my sink.</li>
            <li>I use this where I work in a barber shop, I use it mainly for when I am cutting a small childs hair to go around the ears and neck line, well worth it!!!!</li>
            <li>My last trimmer never pulled hairs, and it cost half as much.</li>
            <li>Works very well for that function, at a lot less than the commercial stitch erasers.</li>
            <li>When it came time to prune it back, my Wahl was ready with a charge even though it sat, neglected, in my medicine cabinet for half a year.</li>
            <li>stand included, I&#x27;d advise anyone who wants to use it to somehow anchor it down with either double sided tape or such.  </li>
            <li>I followed user instructions and oiled it before every use still went dull fast!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sad to say that the motor stopped working after three months of very light usage.  </li>
            <li>shipping the old unit back and won&#x27;t hesitate to grab another in hopes that this isn&#x27;t a product design issue instead of a single janky unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Wahl website says that both clippers have the same torque, but my new stainless 9818 runs slow and seems wimpy.</li>
            <li>His only complaint so far is that the small detail attachment does heat up a good deal if left running for an extended amount of time and burns the skin a little.  </li>
            <li>, i think you can find a shaver that  feel like its take that little hair at all!, and put it to that beuty ;)</li>
            <li>all these reviews where people talk about how much it vibrates had me a little nervous about this trimmer</li>
            <li>This little shaver really amazed me.</li>
            <li>It takes a little getting used to, but once you do, this is a very versatile set.</li>
            <li>complaints are that the little stand that comes with it doesn&#x27;t seem very well thought out.  </li>
            <li>and I cleaned the Wahl beard trimmer with a little too much water and</li>
            <li>The blades in this unit are sharp, sharp, sharp and give a smooth trim without irritation.</li>
            <li>but I really do think this foil shaver gets a little closer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have had this trimmer at least six months now and haven&#x27;t had to charge it since the first charge!</li>
            <li>Unless you develop the habit of using it to trim your beard or are still maintaining that boot camp &#x27;doo, this will probably be the least useful blade unless you have a partner with some haircutting skills because while any idiot can eventually learn to trim his own beard, cutting your own hair in a manner you&#x27;d be willing to display in public is probably going to be beyond your abilities.  </li>
            <li>The packaging needs to be updated with the new tray design, and somewhere in the packaging or instructions I would think there should be instructions on how to store the guides and other attachments in the tray holder...  </li>
            <li>The packaging needs to be updated with the new tray design, and somewhere in the packaging or instructions I would think there should be instructions on how to store the guides and other attachments in the tray holder...  </li>
            <li>The blades are sharp and still cut like new.</li>
            <li>It held a charge and had decent run time for the first year or so of intermittent use, but since then it&#x27; has gotten much worse.</li>
            <li>Some of the hair gets into the nook and crannies of the heads or even down inside the main unit.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, four stars (or maybe 3.75), due to the few (relatively) minor design flaws detailed above.</li>
            <li>So, four stars (or maybe 3.75), due to the few (relatively) minor design flaws detailed above.</li>
            <li>Very loud compared to other razors.  </li>
            <li>: powerful quality feeling motor, sharp close cutting blades, and easy interchangeable heads&lt;</li>
            <li>So that&#x27;s good, right?&lt;br /&gt;The shaving head is bad.</li>
            <li>Too bad since this is a good trimmer otherwise.</li>
            <li>I read some good and some bad reviews on this trimmer.</li>
            <li>But since it came with the bigger cutting head, i tried it out on buzzing my head and it worked amazingly.  </li>
            <li>That can be good and bad, especially if it quits in the middle of a trim.</li>

            <li> Not that great, they say all USA but almost all of the stuff made in China.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer and accessories.</li>
            <li> Great price that met the needs.</li>
            <li> But for trimming hair it works great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason for 4 stars and not 5 is that the body of the buzzer has a rubber coating on it which is great for the hand to keep a hold of it, but all the hair that you cut gets stuck all over the body of the trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband and he said it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> This product work great  </li>
            <li> foil shaver is great.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s the power from the motor, but this foil shaver does a great job.</li>
            <li> That is a great feature for those days where the battery dies onyou before work</li>
            <li> So great long-life too.</li>
            <li> Great quality.</li>
            <li> Great value.</li>
            <li> Great shaver..........</li>
            <li> I would not expect this to be used as a close shaver, but it works great as a trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Wahl is a great brand.</li>
            <li> Great razor...</li>

            <li> Great battery life and power</li>
            <li> thing is great.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;VE HEARD GREAT THINGS ABOUT THE BRAND.  </li>
            <li> This thing holds a charge great, too.  </li>
            <li> As a beard trimmer, it&#x27;s great; but if I had it to do all over again, I&#x27;d have saved the money and just bought a trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Great product.  </li>
            <li> Great for \\&quot;whole\\&quot; body grooming.</li>
            <li> But this kit works great for trimming just about everywhere else if you&#x27;re not into gorilla-type body hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All in all this was a great purchase - $24.95 for what imo</li>
            <li> This unit works great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, really happy.</li>

            <li> I have had this for 3 years, battery is still great, no issues.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for sideburn and eyebrow cleanup in between haircuts at the barber.</li>
            <li> Pro&#x27;s:  Great Quality.  </li>
            <li> Great shaving kit.</li>
            <li> A GREAT JOB FOR ME .</li>
            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> I´m happy with it.</li>
            <li> I ordered the part from www.wahl-store.com and inserted it into the handle (the battery operated thing) and the clippers work great now.</li>
            <li> Read great reviews on this trimmer but have had nothing but problems.</li>
            <li> great trimmer</li>
            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> Also great for pre trimming before shaving with a razor.</li>
            <li> Great price for a great product.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is great, the attachments and stand are not.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> Excellent Product, it works amazingly well</li>
            <li> It was a great investment</li>
            <li> Its a great trimmer, and all attachments work great with the exception of the shaver.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Although gift hasn&#x27;t been opened, I&#x27;m happy to say it came in perfect condition, original box and packaging- which made me so happy!</li>
            <li> this is a very nice and functional trimmer with great attachments and it is made in the USA.</li>
            <li> Glad I bought it!!</li>
            <li> For trimming the edges of his beard, or hair elsewhere, this is a very nice trimmer.    </li>
            <li> This is a very nice trimmer for the price.  </li>
            <li> This is very nice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a very nice trimmer.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a very nice shaver.</li>
            <li> It was very nice to see the comment from Wahl (below).</li>
            <li> This is a very nice trimmer.</li>
            <li> receommend highly!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> in all, a very good and nice looking trimmer.</li>
            <li> What an amazing convenience!</li>
            <li> This trimmer is amazing!</li>
            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> the good side it has a great battery life and its a workhorse.</li>
            <li> I love the power and the attachments, they all work perfectly.</li>
            <li> Outstanding response, and wonderful service.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works great and the close shaver gets surprisingly close.</li>
            <li> This is remarkably the trimmer men can get.</li>
            <li> The duel-foil attachment performs like most foil shavers- not that impressive.</li>
            <li> More incredibly, when it ran out of juice and tried to use it by plugging it, it would not run!</li>
            <li> I knew Wahl made good products, so combining them with Lithium batteries would be great.  </li>
            <li> nice quality!</li>
            <li> Nice job, Wahl!  </li>
            <li> a great one I got is as a gift for Christmas and my hubby loved it..</li>
            <li> Excellent Product, I am really pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is Made in the USA, the best, and so competitively priced!</li>
            <li> Not the best product out there for sure.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.. love the attachments  </li>
            <li> I like how handy this product is!</li>
            <li> great product at good price</li>
            <li> Works great and good price.</li>
            <li> Great product if you are looking for a good trimmer for your beard</li>
            <li> Trimmer is great, some good attachments.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Nice job of not changing a winner!</li>
            <li> Once it arrived I was even more impressed.  </li>
            <li> At best they lie on top of the tray, but not with any degree of security; one jostle and they&#x27;re scattered across your counter.</li>
            <li> With impeccable care?  </li>
            <li> My husband has had a mustache for about 10 years, and declared this the best and most efficient trimmer</li>
            <li> /&gt;In summary: a very nice trimmer showing that Wahl&#x27;s engineering is good</li>
            <li> The guides are easy to install and the device is an excellent trimmer between hair cuts and for eyebrows and cleaning up the neck.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is easily the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Easily the best trimmer I&#x27;ve used ever.</li>
            <li> Excellent battery life, with a very quick charge time.</li>
            <li> I have been extremely happy with this Wahl trimmer, and to top it off, it is Made In America by U.S. workers!</li>
            <li> great trimmer,even better price and customer support,cant beat wahl!</li>
            <li> very good trimmer and now has even more options.</li>
            <li> This machine works great and it has an amazing battery life.</li>
            <li> The stand it good</li>
            <li> I have good experience with purchase</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a rechargeable trimmer for a couple of years that was doing a good job, but I was noticing the recharge life was getting shorter and shorter, then the charger died.</li>
            <li> The rubber grip feels good in the hand, and with the attachements you get with it, you can trim every place on your body.</li>
            <li> The box was not in good condition.</li>
            <li> , it would be fair to guess that I may have received a defective trimmer.  </li>
            <li> A fair trade-off in my book.  </li>
            <li> The handle made of something that doesn&#x27;t feel so good and hair stick to it</li>
            <li> Wahl is a really good brand.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise it was a good product.</li>
            <li> I keep them all in the tray on my countertop and it works fairly well.</li>
            <li> It was a good one</li>
            <li> not as good as the norelco but a good buy nonetheless...</li>
            <li> Good accessories.  </li>
            <li> Does a good job on trimming beards etc.  </li>
            <li> I have NEVER had good luck when it comes to these types of razors.</li>
            <li> it is a good deal, and it travels well.</li>
            <li> It gives a good trim, but on durability, I give it a ONE star.</li>
            <li> Will soon learn how good Wahle&#x27;s customer service is.</li>
            <li> He loved it and kept telling me how good it was, so I purchased one for myself.  </li>
            <li> Good value for the money.  </li>
            <li> Surprisingly he received the gift Christmas eve</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it is a good trimmer.</li>
            <li> When it worked it was good</li>
            <li> It is a good trimmers with lots of options for variety of purposes.</li>
            <li> This is a good trimmer when it was working.</li>
            <li> Father&#x27;s Day gift for good ol pops.</li>
            <li> Feels good in the hand.</li>
            <li> I loved the way the lightweight trimmer felt in my hand.  </li>
            <li> Good for 5 years.</li>
            <li> It cuts well and looks good.  </li>
            <li> Also the blades were rusting even though I took good care of them.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a goatee for going on 15 years now, so I&#x27;ve been through my fair share of trimmers/detailers.</li>
            <li> This is good for trimming a beard and stuff like that.</li>
            <li> is a good beard and body trimmer - four star.</li>
            <li> after warranty, mail the problem piece to them and they will fix or replace at fair</li>
            <li> However I decided to increase the rating as the company made good on replacing the item with a brand-new boxed Wahl Lithium Ion Trimmer.</li>
            <li> It was good when it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ,it is deffinately a good product and would recomend to any one looking for a good trimmer service and delivery was prompt</li>
            <li> good product.</li>
            <li> Was good when it worked...after 4 months of use it quit working</li>
            <li> These clippers are well built, versatile, good features &amp; dependable</li>
            <li> Wahl has a good trimmer that just needs some refinements.  </li>
            <li> Wahl doesn&#x27;t have good customer service or warranty return service and their web site support is a joke.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good buzzer itself, just the battery is a POS.  </li>
            <li> Like I said, works good while it lasts...</li>
            <li> WAHL Lithium-Ion All in One Trimmer is a reasonably good all-in-one trimmer.</li>
            <li> There is no cover for it or a travel bag, which would have been the most ideal solution.</li>
            <li> Fair price.</li>
            <li> However that&#x27;s good as they are clipper attachments for those who shave their hair.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, when you&#x27;re finished just give the trimmer you&#x27;re using a good blow of air to get the hair out</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re using a good blow of air to get the hair out</li>
            <li> Son loved it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It did good when it did work</li>
            <li> It has a good variety of attachments.  </li>
            <li> This will be put to good use around our household.</li>
            <li> yu have to keep changing out the blades to get a good close cut.</li>
            <li> It was a good trimmer</li>
            <li> Good product and compact design.</li>
            <li> Good quality for a good price.</li>
            <li> Probably good hygiene anyways.</li>
            <li> I chose the Wahl Power Pro corded trimmer as my replacement model, because I didn&#x27;t have a good experience with the battery version.</li>
            <li> I notched my review up one star because of the good customer support.</li>
            <li> Fair price.</li>
            <li> Then how good it works.</li>
            <li> Has met all my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;- Good battery life;&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Bought this trimmer for my boyfriend, he charged it once in February and has used it fairly often.</li>
            <li> This is a really good trimmer comes with a lot of attachments.</li>
            <li> Has good battery life.</li>
            <li> I thought the Wahl all in 1 trimmer was a good choice for me since I have plenty of nose and ear hair.</li>
            <li> Good luck finding one made in the USA.</li>
            <li> good shave to some with peach fuzz for hair.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> Good buy in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Good for you</li>
            <li> Good but works on electricity 110</li>
            <li> Seems to work good, and have a number of components to use with it.  </li>

            <li> , the attachments seem to be in good condition, and it works well.</li>
            <li> I waited for 8 months to write this review so that I could give it a fair assessment</li>
            <li> Runs fantastic and cuts great!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly knowledgeable when it comes to electronics and battery technology and assumed the battery&#x27;s safety mechanism got tripped so it would no longer charge.</li>

            <li> Good product/ good price</li>

            <li> This \\&quot;new\\&quot; trimmer is so much better than the Wahl it replaced!</li>
            <li> for sure!</li>
            <li> I have been extremely satisfied with this product; it does what it needs to do, but the battery holds its charge sooooo well!</li>
            <li> BUT - this is a throw away piece, one in which Wahl did not intend the user to ever be able to change the battery!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re willing to do all of this, then it&#x27;s a great trimmer!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> the most aggravating thing was it kept pulling the hairs from my chin (OUCH!)</li>
            <li> The Lithium Ion batteries are so much better!  </li>

            <li> The shaver adapter doesnt trim great but does work fine if ur in a pinch.</li>

            <li> The Wahl LiIon is amazing.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;it is amazing .</li>
            <li> works amazingly well for all shaving /trimming needs</li>
            <li> The attachments it came with all seem to work great with the exception of one: the close rolling razor attachment doesn&#x27;t really fit well into the trimmer, and doesn&#x27;t shave close anyway.</li>
            <li> It has an amazing battery life and it trims well.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and when he used it it did a great job and gave him a close shave leaving him with a baby smooth face.</li>
            <li> Amazing value.</li>
            <li> The shaver doesn&#x27;t do that great of a job, but I like having all of the attachments and the fact that the set is so compact, which is important for my travel needs.</li>
            <li> Wahl has amazing customer service.  </li>
            <li> It was amazing.</li>

            <li> The battery life is amazing as well.</li>
            <li> Battery life seems amazing to me.</li>
            <li> amazing thing -</li>
            <li> it may not be your choice as a primary tool but would be great for styling.</li>
            <li> I used it to trim and shave my beard and to clip my head, the battery is amazing.</li>
            <li> It felt very &amp;#34;weak&amp;#34; and not the best quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shaver has a nice grip.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> It comes with a ton of attachments so you can trim everything up nicely.  </li>
            <li> To each his own.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Although lacking an adjustable trimmer attachment, this device is still an excellent trimmer, with a rock solid motor and great battery.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Compare this to the norelco and make your own decisions based on the features.</li>
            <li> His beard is nice and tidy and he is not a man that will not tolerate a crappy piece of equipment.</li>

            <li> (Who uses this where there is no outlet handy?)  </li>
            <li> Nice product all the way around.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the greatest clippers I have ever purchased.  </li>
            <li> I cut my own hair and it takes me about 40 - 45 minutes, this because I also trim my bread.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s nice, maybe they&#x27;ll get used sometime.</li>
            <li> , it was way shorter than I would have liked (almost a buzz cut).  </li>
            <li> Shame because I really liked this product.</li>
            <li> The clippers are nice but the kit came with a bunch of attachments that I didn&#x27;t need.  </li>
            <li> Concerning the comments of those who choose to nitpick what they perceive as shortcomings -- perhaps the comments of those who shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to own mechanical devices of any kind -- this is my take on that criticism.</li>
            <li> Wahl trimmers don&#x27;t look as nice as the Conair line of beard trimmers.</li>
            <li> Wahl includes a nice array of trimmers and guides.</li>
            <li> This is a nice machine.  </li>
            <li> Purchase at your own risk.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the kind of buyer that does hours of research on a product before I make my decision and for those of you that just started looking</li>
            <li> I own</li>
            <li> I own</li>
            <li> It holds everything this time, but for me it would be nice if the tray had the charging adapter built into the bottom of the trimmer holder.  </li>
            <li> It holds everything this time, but for me it would be nice if the tray had the charging adapter built into the bottom of the trimmer holder.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m honestly blown away with this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I own both this and PHILIPS Norelco G370.</li>
            <li> i liked the price and all the attachments.  </li>
            <li> Absolute best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned</li>
            <li> Thanks for the great customer service!</li>
            <li> I can pull each whisker out with tweezers on my own, if that&#x27;s what I want to do.  </li>
            <li> It would have been nice if it came with a bag to keep all the do dads together.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really understand why this one got reviewed as the best shaver by wirecutter.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and he loves it so much its the best one I have ever seen</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son and he liked it.  </li>
            <li> I was so thrilled because my poodle now looks like a fussy ball</li>
            <li> The tray is handy and I&#x27;ve had it for over a month now, use it twice a week</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome and really makes shaving</li>
            <li> The good: a powerful cutter, great battery.    </li>
            <li> To be honest they didn&#x27;t even work well before they broke.</li>
            <li> Straight up best mechine</li>
            <li> It has all sorts of accessories and feels nice in your hand.</li>
            <li> , taht come handy.</li>
            <li> I liked the product and would buy it again.  </li>

            <li> I absolutely love this razor and look forward to using it because of how good of a job it does.</li>
            <li> I ordered it and liked it.</li>
            <li> The attachments are a nice addition.  </li>
            <li> This seems to be a nice unit.</li>
            <li> it work&#x27;s so nice that I had to buy me another set.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a cost effective trimmer, get a Wahl like this one.</li>
            <li> does NOT hold accessories effectively (</li>
            <li> The cordless lithium ion is a nice feature.</li>
            <li> I think he&#x27;s really going to like it :D</li>
            <li> lithium-ion battery life is astounding for a unit like this.</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> So i purchased it as I shave my own head, have a beard i trim and have nose hair.</li>
            <li> The stand is nice lots of adapters</li>
            <li> Purchased as gift for my son who reported that it is NICE.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to wet/dry shaving accouterments, so kind of a head slap moment.</li>
            <li> Nice size for your hand</li>
            <li> Also, I feel that it is nice to see that there is still something made in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Now the stand has a nice weight, and stays where I put it.  </li>
            <li> Now everything fits nice and neat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a battery life indicator would be a nice add on</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have a rubber grip but just change the type of rubber</li>
            <li> Nice for traveling, and home use.  </li>
            <li> cut my own Hair</li>
            <li> Nice design&lt;br</li>
            <li> The fine-toothed blades are also nice to keep you skin from getting as irritated if at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use a buddy T blade clippers before on my face and It came out so nice</li>
            <li> Have done my own head-shaving for years now.</li>
            <li> Nice attachments.</li>
            <li> It also needs to be charged after almost every use to work effectively.</li>
            <li> Also in the manual it describes the handy rotary nose hair trimmer</li>
            <li> I used to own a Panasonic beard and moustache trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Nice grip and cut like it was supposed to.</li>
            <li> Carry case would be nice, considering this was not the cheapest trimmer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Holding tray doesn&#x27;t hold everything as nicely as the picture.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shopping on and off for one of these for some time, and the Wahl is quite nice.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I had looked at a number of devices, and the two that stood out to me were this one and the Remington.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s is a great trimmer for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Very powerful</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and the caddy is handy and keeps all the accessories organized!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this on Amazon at a great price.</li>
            <li> Got his to keep my beard neat and clean and it is great.  </li>
            <li> A nice carrying case instead of a cheap plastic tray would be nice!  </li>
            <li> so I am very happy with the product and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> It is high quality and does a superb job of keeping his beard tamed.</li>
            <li> Great product, easy to use, but did not come with attachments that was pictured, I was looking for a product that would cover my grooming needs, thought this was it, but now I&#x27;ll need to order more attachments.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many for body and beard, and this is my very favorite.</li>
            <li> Amazingly, I have not recharged the unit since my review and it&#x27;s still going strong!</li>
            <li> The ergonomics are very good --it is comfortable, compact, and light.  </li>
            <li> I am impressed with this new shaver.  </li>
            <li> Works Great, seems like Pro Quality and most important - does the job.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This won&#x27;t be replacing my corded Wahl, but it&#x27;s great for a quick touch-up type job.</li>

            <li> Very nice unit and a great upgrade from my old Wahl.  </li>
            <li> Easily the best and most powerful I&#x27;ve used..</li>
            <li> The good:  - Strong motor with excellent battery performance (6 months old).  </li>
            <li> This trimmer is great at first,  but they have a battery problem!  </li>
            <li> very good beard trimmers trim very closely.</li>
            <li> I love the razor, very smooth, very quality and battery is SOOO great!  </li>
            <li> It cuts very smoothly and is a good, easy size to handle.</li>
            <li> So far I am extremely impressed with this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Wahl is by far the best I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> It has been by far the best trimmer I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> and I have no doubt it&#x27;s the best electric for the price by far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how much better this trimmer is compared to the NiCad Wahl version.  </li>
            <li> I have tried just about every manufactures trimmer and this one by far is the best.</li>
            <li> Eventually, after many minutes of use, some of the cutters will become warm.</li>
            <li> Well, my doubts were completely baseless - this trimmer is a wolf in sheep&#x27;s clothing with impressive performance.  </li>
            <li> Nice shaver and more attachments than I need.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect to be able to do any kind of hair styling with this thing.</li>
            <li> By far the best trimmer I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li> This thing is awesome and powerful and more importantly for me</li>
            <li> and I can truly say the Wahl Lithium Ion is by far the best.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is light and has good power.  </li>
            <li> I am also pleased with the Detailer head, and thrilled with Dual Shaver!&lt;br</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing, I have been using it for many months and it does wonders.</li>
            <li> Three months into use and so far excellent!</li>
            <li> Dependability and the brand are excellent, gives me the close edge and professional look</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco and Remington beard trimmers, but this Wahl is the best by far.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I was able to effectively shave with it.</li>
            <li> I can get many trims from one charge, which is really nice.</li>
            <li> That would sure be nice.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer is by far the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace an old trimmer that I used to trim my beard and mustash, It works excellent.</li>
            <li> It has so many ways to it make your own.</li>
            <li> I found that a cheap 30 cent toothbrush removed it fairly easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so far this is the best trimmer I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> It is certainly worth the money for this great tool.</li>
            <li> I keep this in the medicine cabinet, but still...if I can&#x27;t really fit the pieces in it, what good is it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> An excellent trimmer, as far as how it cuts.</li>
            <li> Since that is not why I bought it, I would rate it good at its primary purpose.</li>
            <li> Appears to be good quality (does not seem to be cheaply made)</li>
            <li> Gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because it might not be a good fit for my beard.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned!  </li>
            <li> This product is of great worth for its price...</li>
            <li> and attractive, easy to carry during travelling, light weight.&lt;br /&gt;Above</li>
            <li> and attractive, easy to carry during travelling, light weight.&lt;br /&gt;Above</li>
            <li> The attachments are easy to change and fit great.</li>
            <li> Pros: powerful motor; efficient blades; quick switch on attachments; excellent charging time and usage&lt;</li>
            <li> Quick charge, good power, nice attachments.  </li>
            <li> and this blade is a very fine cut........</li>
            <li> My dog has very fine Hair...</li>
            <li> Saved a bunch of money on this and it was delivered very quickly!  </li>
            <li> The motor is STRONG!</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought the Philips Norelco G370 All-in-1 Grooming System, which I think is also excellent with a GREAT battery life, but the blade on that one is NOT near as fine as the one on the Wahl trimmer........</li>
            <li> I have owned many trimmers through out the years and this is by far the best I have come across yet.</li>
            <li> I am pleased to report that as a head shaver/trimmer it is amazing and probably better than my corded Wahl I have had for years.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Feels good in your hand, well balanced and sturdy, not like a cheap, plastic contraption like so many others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Good, light , multi use , many choices .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many trimmers and this have the best power and battery life by far.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and so much better without a cord.</li>
            <li> excellent detail capability, lots of blade and comb options, which are easy to change with a flip of the thumb - I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This is a great tool and a very reasonable price for what you are buying.  </li>
            <li> but when u know its easy, looks like the baterry its the better!,</li>
            <li> Way more options and attachments that I should ever need, but once I found the right settings it works great.</li>
            <li> Great beard trimmer and even does a pretty close shave.  </li>
            <li> However it works great and has worked exactly as I have desired it to.</li>
            <li> Worked great at first.</li>
            <li> My eyesight isn&#x27;t that great first thing.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for at a great price.</li>
            <li> A great started kit for someone who is growing their beard for the first time.</li>
            <li> The unit worked great for the first couple weeks.</li>
            <li> worked great the first time.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works great and was exactly what it was advertised as.</li>
            <li> In summary, it is not a bad trimmer and is offered at good price.</li>
            <li> is a good buy for someone who has shape and trim GoaTee&#x27;s or Full Beards.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The comb attachments fit securely and, when used with the trimming blade, do a beautiful, easy job.  </li>
            <li> It attaches to the trimmer head very securely, and holds its setting very securely too.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> the rubberized covering on the handle, while very comfortable to grip, is like a magnet for the hair clippings.  </li>
            <li> Very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> This model is very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> very very very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> This is very important because if you&#x27;ve ever used a battery powered nose trimmer when the battery is going, you KNOW that when the battery starts to go, hair gets pulled instead of cut.</li>
            <li> [Update after 6 months of use: The stickyness wears off, leaving a very comfortable, non-slip grip.</li>
            <li> The trimmers&#x27; slim design was very comfortable in my hand and gave me the control to produce an even trim.</li>
            <li> Very light in weight too.</li>
            <li> is very light and maneuverable.</li>
            <li> item works great, holds great charge nice and sharp</li>
            <li> etc, work great, long time between charges,feels great in your hand.</li>
            <li> and it also is suitable for trimming a more creative cuts.</li>
            <li> It looks like plenty of people here have had a good experience with this trimmer while some have not been so lucky.</li>
            <li> The interchangable heads are nice and change out easily.  </li>
            <li> Why Remington for $10 10 years ago managed to give a nice strong box for the trimmer I had</li>
            <li> The shaver head is good, it makes a quick and close shave.</li>
            <li> Nice trimmer setup, easy to use and change over from one setup to another.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer fits nicely in your hand and it is easy to manipulate.</li>
            <li> Shipped quick and looks like a good quality product even though my husband hasn&#x27;t used it just yet.</li>
            <li> quick everything about this piece is really good .</li>
            <li> So it looks like I&#x27;m out of luck on this one, but it had a pretty good run until my own clumsiness did it in.</li>
            <li> I like about this trimmer is the compact size, the excellent battery life (and quick recharge time), as well as the large selection of trimmer blades and guards.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Likes: is very powerful &amp;#34;) , no hair pulling, great grip, easy and quick charging, good build quality for price, great for shaping and fine tuning esp.</li>
            <li> They do offer an accessory that gives you multiple height setting which is not the best, but other wise I am very happy I splurged a bit.</li>
            <li> Was very happy to find it available new.</li>
            <li> Except the attachments for trimming your hair to a certain length, aren&#x27;t so great.  </li>
            <li> far the charge seems to be holding very good.</li>
            <li> The battery life on this trimmer is so far outstanding, and the quality of the trimmer itself seems very good.</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t snagged or pulled at all yet like many do.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally I throw it in my trash  :)</li>
            <li> I read many of the reviews and I decided to give this trimmer a try.</li>
            <li> i love it its lion</li>
            <li> A better design could keep it more simple&lt;br /&gt;Standard</li>
            <li> It was okay while it lasted, but for the amount I used it, it should have lasted a lot longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve known the Wahl name for many years because my barbers have used them.</li>
            <li> The heads interchange perfectly, once you get the hang of it, and feel very solid.</li>
            <li> Love the fact it can be used without the cord.  </li>
            <li> I hope yours works better than mine.</li>
            <li> and that is the reason for the better power.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a cordless personal trimmer and Wahl has a reputation for being some of the best hair trimmers on the market</li>
            <li> i would have thought Wahl would be better then</li>
            <li> But for 30 bucks I find it to be an outstanding value and have no problems justifying its purchase.</li>
            <li> I agree, like most trimmers of this sort</li>
            <li> It cuts better than the Norelco because it has more power.  </li>
            <li> This is better than Philips.</li>
            <li> The improvement has made my life better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s convenient and comes with more attachments than I&#x27;ll ever need in this lifetime.</li>
            <li> I also believe it&#x27;ll be much more durable than the cheapo shaver I bought some years ago.</li>
            <li> This one took a bit more work</li>
            <li> One thing is for sure, I will never buy WAHL again.</li>
            <li> I somehow learned to settle with the results, though mostly by cleaning up the beard with a pair of scissors after.  </li>
            <li> As for the accessories: I kept the six-position Guide, Dual Shaver, Precious Detailer, and the Clipper Blade.  </li>
            <li> Had my hair trimmed with it for more than a year.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Although the battery choice is excellent, and the cutters are solid, the flaws in this device lie with the accessories.  </li>
            <li> Many cuts between charges.  </li>
            <li> could have written a better manual, better describing how to change blades.  </li>
            <li> shaving attachment is rather amazing, and useful, but don&#x27;t expect the kind of close shave that a dedicated Norelco will give.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I found this trimmer while searching the internet.  </li>
            <li> I had another clipper before this that was much better that I would have kept if it wasnt for TSA smashing my bag.</li>
            <li> Low charge time and accuracy are excellent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer a couple of months now, and really love it.</li>
            <li> This trimmer attachment does a much better job than those, and is faster.</li>
            <li> In sum - it&#x27;s outstanding for moustache/ear/nose trimming as well as shaping your beard or hair at the edges.</li>
            <li> The blades are well-machined, and the battery life is phenomenal.</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding product.</li>
            <li> ok</li>
            <li> plus glad I purchased it.                                      </li>
            <li> But for the price I am pleased.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to trim all my body hair</li>
            <li> DO NOT PAY MORE, DON&#x27;T LET THE PACKAGING HYPE FOOL YOU.  </li>
            <li> The Norelco groomers were much better</li>
            <li> The razor worked OK while it was operational, but OK is all I can say.</li>
            <li> Got this for my bf for christmas, im sure he will like it</li>
            <li> he will have more options</li>
            <li> So consider the #1 more like #.75 and the #2 more like a #1.5.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be better off with a plug-in model, but they don&#x27;t seem to exist in this convenient size.</li>
            <li> Like most products</li>
            <li> I never saw anything like this, this product would be a perfect travel companion, many time I&#x27;ve traveled and have to take two different clippers and there chargers and</li>
            <li> I really love this item.</li>
            <li> There are too many pieces.  </li>
            <li> I miss the adjustable trim guard that one had, but this unit provides greater on time and more flexibility with the assortment of heads.  </li>
            <li> I also like the feel in my hand; I appear to have better control.</li>
            <li> Invest in something better.  </li>
            <li> , that was so nice,very pleased with the order.</li>
            <li> My husband loved it, worth every penny bought at christmas &amp; yet never had to charge</li>
            <li> It is much better than the garbage trimmer I bought at Marshall&#x27;s for $10 a year ago.</li>
            <li> This shaver comes with more attachments than I will use.</li>
            <li> but after 3 uses it has not been able to hold a charge.</li>
            <li> and this is much better than the 1st one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it being knocked off a counter top onto a marble floor (this was about the 5th time in the course of 2 years</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s more consumer-focused.</li>
            <li> It ran better than everyone&#x27;s electrical ones.</li>
            <li> I cut many heads on one charge.</li>
            <li> Read the #1 Most Helpful Customer Review entitled, \\&quot;All</li>
            <li> Well\\&quot; By  D. R. Jeanclerc for more info.</li>
            <li> It charges fast, and works great.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used various trimmer types but this is the best of them all.</li>
            <li> overall excellent product save for the foil shaver accessory.</li>
            <li> but when it works....it is my favorite rechargeable unit.</li>
            <li> The power unit is outstanding.</li>
            <li> Comes with more stuff than I needed.</li>
            <li> Almost too many parts and pieces.</li>
            <li> I cannot find a trimmer that does a better job.</li>
            <li> Too many attachments</li>
            <li> Instructions do not cover the purpose of most of the attachments.&lt;br /&gt;-  </li>
            <li> I love it,</li>
            <li> The motor seems to have significantly more power than its predecessor at our house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unless you are planning a career as a traveling beard stylist, a six-position trimmer guide and 3 fixed-length attachment combs is probably going to be more than you will ever need.  </li>
            <li> Two words -- \\&quot;razor stubble\\&quot; -- in close contact with your most tender areas should be explanation enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fortunately, many women love it also.</li>
            <li> I currently own a Braun rechargeable foil shaver, &amp; neither provides me a skin smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I called asking about the nose trimming attachment, and they sent me one for free!</li>
            <li> When it comes to Wahl, MADE IN AMERICA means, GIVE US MORE MONEY BECAUSE WE SOLD</li>
            <li> Pleased with everything I bought</li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t be fooled; Wahl trimmers work better.</li>
            <li> This model seems to have plenty of power and came with more fancy accessories than I&#x27;ll ever need.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how anyone could ask for more.    </li>
            <li> To charge the trimmer it must be plugged in with the supplied charger which is one more thing that must be stored with this unit.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t bother with the accessories, better off buying a foil and rotary separate for that close face shave.</li>
            <li> Much to my surprise, this trimmer works great.</li>
            <li> OK, the plastic clip-on attachments aren&#x27;t all good, but a few of them are perfect.  </li>
            <li> It would be nice if it had a charging indicator light on it.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t have to worry about it dying on my when I needed it the most.  </li>
            <li> it really kicks in with great satisfaction and gives the impression that it will do the job.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the wireless feature because my apt bathroom has no outlets.</li>
            <li> Better off keeping them in a sandwich size ziploc bag.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the market for something better.    </li>
            <li> It would be much better if it came with a closing storage case.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use more of the included oil</li>
            <li> Most men I know don&#x27;t have the patience to use it.   </li>
            <li> You have to make the jump to over $50 to get a better unit imho.</li>
            <li> But overall, an excellent unit with a five year warranty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure everyone tried it, and it worked \\&quot;OK\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> If you want a quality trimmer you&#x27;re going to have to spend more money.</li>
            <li> Wonderful trimmer with numerous attachments.  </li>
            <li> I was pleased with the shaver attachment, which did do a close shave.     </li>
            <li> Many attachments to trim/sculpt hair.</li>
            <li> Love all the attachments and the power it has.  </li>
            <li> Built sturdy love the coreless.</li>
            <li> Cuts better and closer than the Pro Glide.</li>
            <li> - It would be a better haircut tool with an adjustable comb for the widest cutter head.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not mechanical enough to do that, I suggest go buy another product and hope for the best.</li>
            <li> Mostly the electric ones.&lt;br /&gt;Bought these to use as a beard trimmer once a week.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and he loves it uses it quite often :)</li>
            <li> and I am quite pleased.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re okay with always using one of these lengths, this trimmer is probably leaps and bounds ahead of any competition.  </li>
            <li> It worked better than the pet clippers I have</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t hold a charge for more than 2mins or so.  </li>
            <li> For 30$, I&#x27;d expect more than 4mnths use -</li>
            <li> Have had it a couple of months now, and it&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li> More attachments than I need, but I can&#x27;t complain.  </li>
            <li> I love this shaver and all it&#x27;s attachments.</li>
            <li> Too many attachments</li>
            <li> The battery no longer accepts a charge for more than five minutes, so I have to use them for five minutes, then wait 10 minutes for them to recharge.  </li>
            <li> I believe the tray to hold all of the components could have been better designed.</li>
            <li> and this is a better trimmer than both in terms of power and versatility.</li>
            <li> Says it is so much better</li>
            <li> I bought more cutter blades thinking that would work.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 5 - 6 months now and am satisfied with features and quality.</li>
            <li> (Here, I&#x27;ll also note that on the front of my unit - where the rubber meets the plastic - the upper edge of the rubber doesn&#x27;t perfectly align with the bottom edge of the plastic.</li>
            <li> I sure hope this feature keeps working for years to come.</li>
            <li> If so, then, it&#x27;ll definitely be a winning feature, in my book.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t know what y&#x27;all use to trim your facial hair, but Wahl&#x27;s Lithium Ion Clipper is the best.</li>
            <li> and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Not a biggie, as with this one I was able to figure it out, but I can see some people not realizing that the front of the trimmer storage area is for storing a blade/shaver head.  </li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer for the \\&quot;semi-pro\\&quot; in you, that wants to have that chiseled look, and control body hair all over.  </li>

            <li> Example say you shave your sides with a number 4 and the top with a number 2.  </li>
            <li> the foil cutter cuts my stubble better than a $90 brawn i bought or a $200 Phillips norelco trimmer I returned.</li>
            <li> my husband love this trimmer.</li>
            <li> There are better options out there, avoid this one.</li>
            <li> and it seems to cut better -perhaps</li>
            <li> &amp; I love how It makes me look.</li>
            <li> The attachments leave a lot more to be desired.</li>
            <li> This model has a body made mostly from plastic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nicely shaped rubber handle provides a sturdy, precise feel.  </li>
            <li> As others have stated, there are a lot of attachments, almost too many.  :)</li>
            <li> Trimmer is ok.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s also stylish and sleek, if that matters to you.</li>
            <li> another excellent product from wahl - i&#x27;ve come to only trust wahl for my shaving needs.</li>
            <li> Make sure you look for the lithium ion description when you order.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;- an indicator light to show battery is being charged would be nice</li>
            <li> better instruction manual</li>
            <li> Whatever Vibraty razor and shaved myself much better and faster.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I find it works better</li>
            <li> You can pick up a spray can of blade lubricant for a couple bucks at most stores.</li>
            <li> I love using this to keep my body hair in check</li>
            <li> Cuts OK, but the battery checked out after two years.</li>
            <li> but they were selling it for $20 more at the time in store and $15 more on the website.</li>
            <li> Love it love it love it.</li>
            <li> Also, the fact that they&#x27;re cordless makes it much more convenient to use.  </li>
            <li> Clipper are OK, however they do not come with all the attachments listed in the instructions/description.  </li>
            <li> My husband and son both love this.</li>
            <li> the rubberized handle holds static and so hair sticks to it.  </li>
            <li> I can confidently tell you that this trimmer works WAY better:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> It cuts better and has a better blade.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has WAY more features.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> Seems more durable.</li>
            <li> all its MADE IN USA product not MADE IN CHINA which makes it more superior.&lt;br</li>
            <li> just want men to be aware of this remarkable product&lt;</li>
            <li> all its MADE IN USA product not MADE IN CHINA which makes it more superior.&lt;br</li>
            <li> just want men to be aware of this remarkable product&lt;</li>
            <li> I have used most all of them at some point.  </li>
            <li> and I could not ask for more.  </li>
            <li> I love the battery life and charging time.</li>
            <li> I used the nose hair detailer once and was quite satisfied.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> - Many attachments</li>
            <li> I was able to get in</li>
            <li> Love the charging time and the use between charges.  </li>
            <li> but I did expect more than one year from the trimmer.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s an excellent value.</li>
            <li> I absolutely in love with it.</li>
            <li> 3rd WAHL trimmer and the best one yet.</li>
            <li> Love the power the lithium ion battery provides.</li>
            <li> I have had this for many months now.  </li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> have had this trimmer for a month and it is an acceptable value for the money; however I&#x27;m going to return it because it causes more frustration that it is worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worked ok... Died after 6 months with usage maybe two times per week</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember ever having a better customer service experience!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What I really love about this purchase is the battery life on the shaver.  </li>
            <li> If these parts are provided it seems that the manufacturer would provide a better holding tray for their product.  </li>
            <li> I love everything about this trimmer... except</li>
            <li> This trimmer is powerful and did a good job at trimming.</li>
            <li> Oh and btw lithium battery is light and lasts forever!  </li>
            <li> the battery died within a week, and was no longer able to hold a charge.  </li>
            <li> Cant believe you can get a nice trimmer like this for a cheap price........</li>
            <li> I am a huge electric buzzer/trimmer kind of guy.</li>
            <li> If it was just a bit more durable, I would give it a 5-star rating, but for the price I guess you do get what you pay for in terms of longevity.</li>
            <li> Good and useful</li>
            <li> Lithium batteries are much better in this type of application and should outlast the rest of the trimmer.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Look, I know that there are probably better trimmers out there, but they can&#x27;t come close to this price.  </li>
            <li> love this product, I&#x27;ve recommended it to all my family and friends, and if it ever dies, I will buy another Wahl.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use most of these attachments, but I do like the attachment approach instead of the adjustable head approach</li>
            <li> I love this thing.</li>
            <li> I love this one.</li>
            <li> Works better as a tweezer than a trimmer.</li>
            <li> I let the trimmer run for about 10 mins and was satisfied with its performance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a much better clipper, but cost a lot more as well..</li>
            <li> It works better than I&lt;br /&gt;expected.  </li>
            <li> This is the perfect set for any man or person who needs to groom regularly.</li>
            <li> I ended up buying a pair of Panasonic trimmers that were cheaper and that cut much better.</li>
            <li> Nice &amp; light trimmer.</li>
            <li> I used the electric shaver attachment and it works okay.</li>
            <li> I was looking for hair clippers and this was more for beard and face trimming.</li>
            <li> I like how it came with so many accesories and is durable.</li>
            <li> I love my set.</li>
            <li> All In One Trimmer&lt;br /&gt;Rating: 3 1/2 stars&lt;</li>
            <li> Ive been able to get another month out of it because it would work if i plugged it in and then turned it on.</li>
            <li> ok.</li>
            <li> I have been using this trimmer for the last 6 months and works great!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note; I see some people complain about noise and vibration, I have owned many trimmers and they all are noisy, and vibrate.</li>
            <li> I love it and makes life easier.</li>
            <li> But in my case, this gets used maybe once weekly at the most</li>
            <li> battery life on this trimmer has been phenomenal.  </li>
            <li> and I am really glad I went with this Wahl model.eps</li>
            <li> The battery life on this trimmer has been phenomenal.  </li>
            <li> and I am really glad I went with this Wahl model.</li>
            <li> I used the trimmer for 3 more years before I dropped it one night on a trip to Japan.  </li>
            <li> I kept adjusting the size lower and lower and shaved off a bit more than I intended.</li>
            <li> read many reviews before buying this.</li>
            <li> I love this product and also the name.</li>
            <li> I am highly satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> This product is more for home use (i.e. a guy trimming his beard).</li>
            <li> It works excellent and it very simply to use and the battery lasts forever!</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love these trimmers.</li>
            <li> This is a must have for creative grooming. &#x3D;0)</li>
            <li> I used mine once to trim my beard with - worked okay then.</li>
            <li> Aside from this issue, I was really please with it - worked great for both beard trimming and head shaving.  </li>
            <li> It cuts okay, when it&#x27;s got power.  </li>
            <li> but many of them just don&#x27;t deliver fully.</li>
            <li> My husband is enjoying this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used most of the attachments, but would prefer a better way to store - maybe a pouch?  </li>
            <li> I have had so many electric shavers that it&#x27;s become a joke with my wife.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that some of the attachments are one size.</li>
            <li> Lots more attachments than the ad said.</li>
            <li> I use the most.  </li>
            <li> Its OK...</li>
            <li> Why get more than one item when one does the trick.</li>
            <li> love it use it all the time</li>
            <li> I am pleased and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love the trimmer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the top rated product on Amazon was a Philips-norelco brand beard trimmer at the time.</li>
            <li> There were more attachments than I knew what to do with, but I found a subset I could reliably use to trim to a style I enjoyed.</li>
            <li> The Lithium battery, and related power output is its best feature.</li>
            <li> The accesories are interesting.</li>
            <li> like the most diferent attachement</li>
            <li> stand charger would have been better.</li>
            <li> I use mostly the 6-way adjustable guard to trim my beard.  </li>
            <li> #34;it has too many accessories&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> many accessories with no practical storage</li>
            <li> I have been doing this for many years</li>
            <li> and I have burned through more trimmers than I would care to recall.</li>
            <li> The included shaving attachment look ok, but I will never use it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this is a solid piece of equipment for what it does and what it costs, this thing is probably the best at what it does, hands down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use the Wahl on my dog much more than the Andis because the Whal beard trimmer does a better and quicker job than the Andis Pet shaver and is portable.</li>
            <li> , I am pleased and will continue to buy this trimmer when I need to.</li>
            <li> i was very happy with it, but it seems like there are quality control issues, possibly with the waterproofing - this thing is supposed to be used in an moist room most of the time, so</li>
            <li> I love the clipper.</li>
            <li> They could have gotten 5 stars if the quality of clipper-combs/guides and the stand were any better.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love the portability and ease of use.</li>
            <li> It started off ok and worked well.  </li>
            <li> I have had alot better luck with cheaper shavers.  </li>
            <li> I think alot of these better reviews are people reviewing after they use a month and not returning to update after it takes a turn.  </li>
            <li> Will be a repeat buyer :)</li>
            <li> It is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Overall very good product!</li>
            <li> and YES the battery is better.</li>
            <li> With the charger attached, you are still able to set it in the stand.</li>
            <li> My husband said It&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li> There are way too many parts.</li>
            <li> I love the Lithium Ion battery, more power longer life.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure they will be meet.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;d had a Wahl that he used for many years</li>
            <li> it does a great job, thanks Wahl.</li>
            <li> Comes with many attachments and all work as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Well, this one wasn&#x27;t any better.</li>
            <li> Hopefully it will be better than this one.  </li>
            <li> Well made, had many options for lengths.</li>
            <li> Needs a better tray to hold the attachments.</li>
            <li> It is not the most durable and if you want the cleanest of shaves look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> So many attachments comes with the trimmer.</li>
            <li> This trimmer has many attaachments, some of which I don&#x27;t use, but they are there if needed.  </li>
            <li> I had another Wahl trimmer for many years.</li>
            <li> It was light and nice not having a cord plugged in.  </li>
            <li> My father used a Wahl to cut my hair as a kid more years ago than I care to admit</li>
            <li> There are 3 snap-on short-hair trimming guides - 5 lengths would have been better to cover all possibilities, but I make do with the #2 guide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and we just love it.  </li>
            <li> After some messing around and shaking it out of frustration I was able to get it working again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It must be able to put some charge into the battery for it to operate.</li>
            <li> I love these clippers.</li>
            <li> Hand done the best beard, chest and back</li>
            <li> Others are just okay ( shaver )</li>
            <li> Attachments are sufficient for most any user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the battery life and the accessories.  </li>
            <li> Came in a very timely manner, works great</li>
            <li> My husband does love it. :)</li>
            <li> I bought this unit for my husband for mostly beard and neck trimming.</li>
            <li> As with many lithium ion batteries, the one in this shaver works for about two years and then will no longer hold a charge.  </li>
            <li> It is cordless and has many attachments.</li>
            <li> All in all, I love mine.</li>
            <li> All of these fit nicely into a stand.    </li>
            <li> The grooming kit is truly all in one and has many uses.</li>
            <li> Ultimately, I am extremely pleased with the grooming kit</li>
            <li> I really like how it handles, great percision.  </li>
            <li> like most of the attachments</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve finally found the perfect beard trimmer (for me).</li>
            <li> My husband will love it for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I have had a beard for about 32 years and have used many types of trimmers and the Wahl Lithium Ion</li>
            <li> you will find better one .</li>
            <li> Also I agree that there is too many accessories as well.  </li>
            <li> charge lasts me more than 1 week.</li>
            <li> The difference in price is more than made up for in convenience and quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband bought this in December 2013, but it cannot hold a charge more than about 10-15 seconds by September 2014.</li>
            <li> This is the best male grooming set that I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> Also I love how it has the shaving head too.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my neck and it gets nice a smooth.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try the Wahl, but now I love it.  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;Its attachments are on the cheaper side for sure</li>
            <li> I owned an earlier Wahl for years with excellent results, so therefore bought this Wahl replacement.  </li>
            <li> Great deal, thanks</li>
            <li> Works better then</li>
            <li> make sure you keep your receipt so you can replace it.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t want to break it and the pictorial instructions didn&#x27;t make me too confident.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it could work...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have the haircut attachments in there, since I&#x27;m not ever using those, and I still can&#x27;t fit everything in it nicely.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied.  </li>
            <li> It seems to &#x27;look&#x27; okay, but it feels stubbly.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> is MUCH better, lasts 3-10 times longer.</li>
            <li> After 1.5 years of use, I still love this shaver.</li>
            <li> It is more of a shaver than a trimmer.</li>
            <li> I had a similar model for years and was very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> I had a philips trimmer that worked much more better than this one.</li>
            <li> In the beginning I was quite satisfied.  </li>
            <li> The smaller trimmer head works excellent for anything you want to do to your face.</li>
            <li> The shaver head works ok...</li>
            <li> The blades on this clipper is much better than others that I have used.</li>
            <li> I like to keep a short beard, and this groomer is perfect for this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It gets hair on the &amp;#34;grip,&amp;#34; but it lets you control the haircut a lot more.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this thing.</li>
            <li> Otherwise I love the gadget and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> ..wish it was more contained (with a lid over the attatchments.)</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it has a lithium ion battery.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would recommend paying 20 or 30 dollars more for a better quality trimmer.</li>
            <li> It would be better priced at $25 though.</li>
            <li> and im satisfied with it, and</li>
            <li> /&gt;It would have been better if:&lt;br /&gt;1-</li>
            <li> This product is ok.  </li>
            <li> It has everything I could want and more.  </li>
            <li> One can be used for ears and noses and the middle one is perfect for my beard.  </li>
            <li> I was able to put the charger, trimmer and the attachments I use into the pouch and still have room.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great for travelling as it&#x27;s a very compact size.</li>
            <li> Almost too many but</li>
            <li> others have &amp;#34;complained&amp;#34; that there are too many accessories.</li>
            <li> you are OK with having a hairy trimmer</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Love all of the attachments...</li>
            <li> I will probably get a more reliable corded version.</li>
            <li> It would have been better to come with a docking charging station instead of a cord.  </li>
            <li> Nothing more to say.  </li>
            <li> If they would add a 1/2&amp;#34; and a 3/4&amp;#34; that would be phenomenal.</li>
            <li> I love this thing.  </li>
            <li> have to have 13 more words to be able to get this posted.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it can be a bit overwhelming, deciding which one to choose.  </li>
            <li> I should have done more research into before buying the product.</li>
            <li> The trimmer itself is okay, but the rack that is supposed to hold the accessories, etc.</li>
            <li> Again, more false/misleading advertising.</li>
            <li> But the head needs to be wider for more coverage.</li>
            <li> Great price and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it&#x27;s not the grossest thing in the world for sure, so i used it.  </li>
            <li> Close &amp; precise!</li>
            <li> Wanted something that would be &#x27;safe&#x27; for using around the jewels.</li>
            <li> It does a good job and has a number of useful attachments.</li>
            <li> purchase was an awesome upgrade from the latter.</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with the product and price.  </li>
            <li> Have recommended to a friend or two and they love it as well.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to oil the blade every now and then.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes with more attachments than I&#x27;ll ever need.  </li>
            <li> It has more power, trims better and holds a charge longer than any of the others.  </li>
            <li> You can wipe most of the hair off with a towel, so I still gave it a 5.  </li>
            <li> hopefully i can write another review after four more years.</li>
            <li> It has many attachments and meets any of your grooming needs.</li>
            <li> Love made in america quality.  </li>
            <li> Also has smaller trimmer attachment for the nose and ear holes that works great!</li>
            <li> It does an OK job at evening out the beard</li>
            <li> My beard looks better since I made the switch to Wahl, with</li>
            <li> Hopefully they work better</li>
            <li> So many attachments</li>
            <li> I was able to do virtually anything that I needed to do with clippers.</li>
            <li> Too many attachments.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it is ok.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> my sideburns and touching up the sides of my hair.</li>
            <li> quite simply .... the best trimmer in the world ...</li>
            <li> I shave my head and spend more time doing that than just trimming my mustache and beard</li>
            <li> Buy this trimmer you will love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it will be outstanding.</li>
            <li> I checked Wahl on-line, and I didn&#x27;t see more attachments for the 9560.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not in love with the snapping on and off of the trimmer guards and combs.  </li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d bought a more expensive/better trimmer</li>
            <li> Works better than others I had and lasts a&lt;br /&gt;Long</li>
            <li> Has many attachments.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> This one charges in just 5 minutes to a charge that has MORE than allowed me to finish my beard/goatee/moustache trimming</li>
            <li> I just thought it appropriate to update my review.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> - I would pay more for better quality and durability.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, I know this is a simple review, but this thing is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll have this thing for years.</li>
            <li> but I was able to deal with it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall: An OK product.</li>
            <li> For the money you should be able to find something better.</li>
            <li> unreliable and too many pieces for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i have tried many grooming products from whal, this one however just doesn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li> If you want to stand it up, you have to sit it on the charging port or or will top over.</li>
            <li> They will love it.</li>
            <li> Using it mostly on the road.</li>
            <li> The Wahl is has noticeably more power and is quieter.</li>
            <li> fact that I have to spend more money on a separate \\&quot;nose/ear\\&quot; trimmer is another 1/4-star deduction.</li>
            <li> It seems to be built better with better quality materials, and is manufactured in the United States.</li>
            <li> I was satisfied with it, but after using this Wahl I gotta give the nod to the Wahl.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a daily use trimmer, this would be your best</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Wahl for such a wonderful product in this price range!</li>
            <li> and he seemed pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> all in all he was pleased.</li>
            <li> You have to switch attachments, which is frankly very easy, though not as easy as just dialing in a 3 or 4 on one of those beard groomers.</li>
            <li> Each time in mentioning his new trimmer, he as told me it was an excellent trimmer and that all the reviews he has read have been true.  </li>
            <li> he liked the unit enough to want to purchase another but for $30 (albeit a good price!)</li>
            <li> But a very nice trimmer and charges fast and lasts awhile.</li>
            <li> and i very rarely have to charge it!</li>
            <li> Very powerful blades, hasn&#x27;t pulled my hair yet!</li>
            <li> So far so good!  </li>
            <li> The nose clipper head works perfect for your nose and the larger clipper head works pretty good for your head....</li>
            <li> It works great when it&#x27;s new!</li>
            <li> It is a great all in one trimmer, but the main reason I give it a 3 out of 5 is the fact that it has rusted in 30 days.</li>
            <li> It was metal and had great steady power, but needed to be plugged in to work.</li>
            <li> This particular trimmer was attractive also because of its rechargeable feature and the fact that it&#x27;s made in the United States.  </li>
            <li> Nice lil clean up clippers</li>
            <li> When it works it cuts great and the battery life was decent.  </li>
            <li> Good cut, good power, easy to operate and so far</li>
            <li> The classic and T-blades are just great, though.</li>
            <li> No pulling hair, just a nice, clean cut.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s long-lasting battery and powerful motor deliver exceptional results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It produces a very fast, good even cut.</li>
            <li> Does a good job, I reccomend very much</li>
            <li> Very light, easy to charge, and versatile.</li>
            <li> Took apart some of the easy bits but nothing stood out apart from very cheap parts and assembly.</li>
            <li> thanks Amazon for your amazing return policy!</li>
            <li> really good one, battery back is too good :)</li>
            <li> Pretty good shaver.</li>
            <li> The two best features, how well it trims and how long the lithium battery lasts.</li>
            <li> The battery and motor are in fact higher powered than the ones on the trimmers I&#x27;d used before and it felt good to know</li>
            <li> Cuts pretty good also.</li>
            <li> Wahl is pretty good too.</li>
            <li> The shaver attachment however, is pretty good, kinda.</li>
            <li> While the T-blade head is about a 1/4 inch narrower, it does a pretty good job.</li>
            <li> , the warranty doesnt extent to my country, but its a pretty good trimmer</li>
            <li> The charge was pretty good, no discomfort while trimming, and it cleaned up well.  </li>
            <li> This is awesome and stays charged for a long time.</li>
            <li> My experience is pretty good in this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this trimmer when I first got it, but now it won&#x27;t hold a charge to even fully trim my goatee.  </li>
            <li> This is a pretty good trimmer with lots of attachments.</li>
            <li> I really loved this trimmer at first.</li>
            <li> This was after a long surcharge for best price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It did seem to work well while it lasted, rarely snagging hair, which is VERY important when manscaping!</li>
            <li> This thing works great for a pretty clean shave, or just trimming your goatee,mustache, or sideburns, etc.</li>
            <li> They have very fine teeth that move smoothly.</li>
            <li> Very nice trimmer for the money and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> So excited!  </li>
            <li> The new one is on the money, works great</li>
            <li> New one works great, too.</li>
            <li> , I think with a new charger, under warranty, and it&#x27;s been great ever since.</li>
            <li> This one feels much better in the hand and is easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much out of this trimmer based on the reviews, so I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Had nice selection of pieces, charged quickly.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is easy to use, has a powerful motor, does a good job, and the heads are easy to change.</li>
            <li> Meanwhile, my clock-radio that had a 1-year warranty has been going strong for more than 10</li>
            <li> It does a good job on hair trimming, since my hair is quite short, but the shaving is not so good with the foil attachment.  </li>
            <li> It does a good job of shaving, although some parts of my face need several passes to get a fairly close shave.</li>
            <li> I have to return this product to the company because it does not work as I would have liked it to work, however it may still be useful to most buyers but it was not what I was expecting in performance.</li>
            <li> So I researched various grooming/shaving things, and Wahl seemed to get a lot of good reviews, and this product seemed to be good for an \\&quot;all in one\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;The trimming heads work as well as trimming heads should.</li>
            <li> I figure that if it&#x27;s good enough for a pro, it&#x27;s plenty good for me.&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The basic trimmer function works great, and the build quality of the blade LOOKS nice, but it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> So far, it seems to be great for trimming the edges of my beard, top of my head and those extraneous nose and ear hairs.</li>
            <li> If you enjoy having your hair forcibly ripped from your face, you will love this thing.</li>
            <li> The blades are highest quality, easily maintained, and the high torque of the motor make them great</li>
            <li> Great replacement for my old trimmer that had to stay plugged in as the batter was kaput!</li>
            <li> The storage &#x27;rack&#x27; is pretty cheap, and the pieces don&#x27;t fit all that great.  </li>
            <li> Charges very quickly and retains its power after long use, I am impressed.</li>
            <li> Good strong motor and the charge time is exactly as advertized.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to trim my beard which it worked great for, but if you don&#x27;t keep the parts oiled it will pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is much more powerful than any I&#x27;ve used before and comes with many more (too many?) attachments.</li>
            <li> Most have done the trick just fine.</li>
            <li> It does not cut clean !</li>
            <li> The shaver does, however, hold a charge remarkably well, which is its main selling point.</li>
            <li> I am happy with my trimmer, it was fairly inexpensive compared to other options and has all the attachments I need.  </li>
            <li> Works great, holds a charge for a full trim session, and on a high note, has a quick charge!!  </li>
            <li> It was easy to hold on to and I was able to easily guide it where I needed it as I was trimming my husband&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> The shave you get with it also isn&#x27;t very good he still ends up having to use a disposable razor after trimming his facial hair.</li>
            <li> Overall a very good product.  </li>
            <li> The heads are easily to change and very easy to clean</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer for my husband and he is so happy with it,he said its the best trimmer he had so far, its clean cut and very quiet</li>
            <li> The attachments are more accurate as well.</li>
            <li> but I have more important things in life to do than to be tied to a charging routine.</li>
            <li> Works great on sensitive areas, if you catch my drift.</li>
            <li> There are many accessories that can freely remove unwanted hair from the body.</li>
            <li> This one does an excellent clean close outline above the lip and is easy to handle.</li>
            <li> I have been happy with the razor so far.  </li>
            <li> Wow, This works great.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t comment on it but for light use, it&#x27;s better than anything else I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> far, the battery is great and</li>
            <li> I am happy so far with the trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it a lot yet, but so far it works great.</li>
            <li> so far im happy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable to hold and has many attachments.</li>
            <li> Worked great -- for about 6 months, then it stopped working completely.</li>
            <li> Works great but will have to deal with the loud noise&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I started searching around for the advanced products I was sure might exist, but found nothing that compared in quality and design.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s available from most all battery dealers.</li>
            <li> all the plastic accessories are really cheap and flimsy would be better to enhance this</li>
            <li> I got this to replace an old trimmer and it is a great deal.  </li>
            <li> Great product, replaced an old corded Wahl I had for over 8 years.</li>
            <li> The trimmer&#x27;s build quality is excellent, though the settings on the plastic adjustable trimmer head can slip if not set and used carefully.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the purchase; it is everything that I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> I have a feeling the the oil free trimmers might be more for planned obsolescence.  </li>
            <li> Had it not been for it suddenly becoming unusable</li>
            <li> But, in general, it&#x27;s a fun and excellent trimmer to have around.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good solution for that guy who wants to keep a trimmed look.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re good quality and have held up very well.</li>
            <li> Good product from Wahl, but the image shows a very compact and organized stand.</li>
            <li> Was reasonably priced and the description was good.  </li>
            <li> much which is a good thing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for very fine and very very short hair.  </li>
            <li> Charges super fast, attachments work great.</li>
            <li> There are several guides, and it was easy to find one that was ideal to trim my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This tool is also great at cleaning up my neck area as I grow a beard, easily defining lines and trimming well, without upsetting my sensitive</li>
            <li> This is the perfect tool for those quick in-between barbershop touch-ups, especially around the neck.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for pre-shave cut-down of hairs under the chin and on the neck, makes the actual shave quick and easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The battery provides more power than cadmium rechargeable batteries, &amp; having experienced Lithium Ion batteries in other products I own, I look forward to no longer wondering whether or not the battery will be there for me when I need it if I&#x27;ve not kept it plugged into the charger.</li>
            <li> High marks to this product - a very reasonable price for a very good trimmer.</li>
            <li> All in all a good buy, comes with a micro screen for shaving but don&#x27;t expect a close clean shave, good for travel, small lightweight, good trimmer, lots of attachments.</li>
            <li> Worked well for 10-months of very light duty trimming a goatee and sideburns and being kept clean and oiled up.  </li>
            <li> With that one caveat out of the way, it has been superb in every other area.</li>
            <li> When I first got it, I didn&#x27;t have to recharge the battery for greater than 6 months!</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this product and recommend it to any man who has a beard and/or other trimming needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this and two other hair clippers, and this is the best one.</li>
            <li> I use it for full body once every 2 weeks and after 3 uses of about 15 minutes each still haven&#x27;t had to recharge it!</li>
            <li> Other than that it is a great trimmer!  </li>
            <li> Heads are sharp, easily changed and perform wonderfully.</li>
            <li> The two blades provided provided a close shave - too close for my taste, not the ideal length for that groomed, evening shadow look and you have to press hard to get a good line up.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s practical and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Charges very quickly</li>
            <li> But after browsing the instructions and realizing how easy it was to change heads and adjust accesories</li>
            <li> I fear that a piece of the plastic holder will snap off easily.</li>
            <li> , the plastic norelco used on the guides easily broke.  </li>
            <li> It would often remove the trimmer piece itself which doesn&#x27;t always snap on easily.  </li>
            <li> It does rust easy and collects hair on the handle as you shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The rubberized grip attracts hair trimmings like a magnet, which then stick and do not brush off easily.</li>
            <li> excellent battery combined with the $40 I&#x27;ve spent keeps me using this trimmer, but I&#x27;ll happily abandon it in the future for a better li-on model should one become available.</li>
            <li> Easy to hold and maneuver.  </li>
            <li> Easy Pop in/out design for the Blades</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy.</li>
            <li> I bought it for getting my Doberman ready for the show ring &amp; so far, it has worked perfectly for what I needed.  </li>
            <li> It has a great very short attachment that most models struggle with.</li>
            <li> It easily shaved his head.</li>
            <li> The heads are easy to switch out</li>
            <li> I shopped around a bit but easily decided to order another one of these.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to charge (just plug the bottom in)</li>
            <li> do not like the shape of the ear/nose trimmer, attachments do not switch out easily.</li>
            <li> Receipt of Wahl trimmer states easy to use and works well.</li>
            <li> He tells me it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> the attachments switch out easily and there are tons.  </li>
            <li> Switching heads was easy.</li>
            <li> The detachable blade heads all work well and are extremely easy to assemble when switching out.</li>
            <li> The spring would be easy to replace, but they don&#x27;t sell the springs.</li>
            <li> If so, it&#x27;s easy.  </li>
            <li> One could easily duplicate that look with this tool.  </li>
            <li> Loves how changing the blades are so easy</li>
            <li> This set is so durable and easy to use that I bought one for my brother for his birthday.</li>
            <li> I like this as it keeps all the parts together and is easy to store in a bathroom vanity</li>
            <li> all the parts together and is easy to store in a bathroom vanity drawer.    </li>
            <li> The variety of attachments is great and has so many different lengths to trim at!  </li>
            <li> Blades rust easily</li>
            <li> - Easy to switch attachments.  - Made in USA.</li>
            <li> The trimmer blades will get rust very quickly.  </li>
            <li> My dog&#x27;s hair is the thickest of any hair, located anywhere on any mammal on the Earth, so when this unit made easy work of his steel-wool mayne, I bragged it up to my three brothers and each one bought this model (when it was on sale for one weekend in November).  </li>
            <li> It wipes off easily after you are finished, but I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Reviews said that the Wahl battery was easily replaceable and the motor was strong, so I went for it.</li>
            <li> The accessories do NOT go in the stand as easily as the picture on here would imply.</li>
            <li> really does a nice job comes with many adapters charges</li>
            <li> The blade gets quite rusty very quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s underpowered (requires many, many passes), required disassembly to clean and oil the blades EVERY use, and the rubberized exterior is a hair magnet making it a serous pain to keep clean.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it comes with four easily changeable \\&quot;blades\\</li>
            <li> This product also comes with seven guide combs that easily attach to the trimmer and can be used to help with grooming.</li>
            <li> Once charged up it does hold its charge well and is easy to recharge.     </li>
            <li> The accessories are easy to change out and provide all the options I need.</li>
            <li> Pieces rust easy.</li>
            <li> Cuts a bit easy.</li>
            <li> In my case I find it as easy as combing my hair</li>
            <li> However, the metal parts of the trimming attachment rust easily and remain corroded.</li>
            <li> I like the heads and this is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> , it feels sturdy in my hand and is easy to maneuver.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nope, nothin&#x27; close about this shave plus it breaks easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a compact device with a rubberized handle that makes it easy to hold.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, and</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s easy to charge before it dies.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to control, the blade doesn&#x27;t pull on the whiskers, and the battery holds a charge almost forever ( not quite, but close).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Trimming with this thing is easy for me, and I know nothing about beards or beard &amp;#34;hygiene&amp;#34;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lightweight, easy to handle.</li>
            <li> The attachments are easy to change and all work as advertised.</li>
            <li> The heads are easy to change,</li>
            <li> The plastic tab that you have to lift up to pop it off is not as rigid as needed and instead of popping off easily, it bends.  </li>
            <li> It works and is fairly easy to use.  </li>
            <li> So, If the clipper ever sounds like a mini chain saw and doesn&#x27;t clip well at all, it just might be the blade portion and a fix is relatively easy.</li>
            <li> It is easy to change height settings and cuts</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- easy to change blades</li>
            <li> besides that it&#x27;s a strong machine that does it job.</li>
            <li> Strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong.  </li>
            <li> the unit itself is strong and powerfull, and feels well built, but I have yet to find an attachment I like.  </li>
            <li> The motor doesn&#x27;t seem to be nearly as strong as the review had implied.</li>
            <li> and it is still going strong after lots of use.  </li>
            <li> you want to (The main blade is good for almost everything)</li>
            <li> that being said, the blades are good, give a nice shave and overall</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t needed recharge in 3 - 4 weeks - still running strong.  </li>
            <li> The attachments are not its strong point</li>
            <li> But the motor is strong and the battery has given me no problems.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> ive used this about 3 or 4 times (which doesnt seem like alot) and the battery is still going strong.</li>
            <li> Two years and going strong.</li>
            <li> The man who this was purchased for has an incredibly strong beard and it grows like a weed.  </li>
            <li> Battery is strong and lithium.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product if you are looking for a good beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> The advertising brags at length about the battery, and I guess its a good one, and the motor seems high quality, but the blades and guides are junk.  </li>
            <li> Have had this for quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;Works very good and hold a charge for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Love it lots of attachments nice little canvas case works great.</li>
            <li> Jeanclerc\\&quot; comment in every single word, This is by far and for sure the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever had, the charge is amazing</li>
            <li> This beard trimmer is awesome and comes with so many hair cutting features and they are all great.  </li>
            <li> Li-Ion devices generally boast great power capacities and this trimmer is no exception.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, fine trimming, power to do the job.  </li>
            <li> It also works for the dog, trims his ear&#x27;s pretty nice.</li>
            <li> The  battery does not hold its charge for more than a couple minutes after a full nights charge.  </li>
            <li> Love the full array of attachments.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m LOVING this all in one trimmer!</li>
            <li> This is the first razor I can honestly say does it all for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Largest Blade:</li>
            <li> I went to use it and noticed that the handle was really warm, almost hot.  </li>
            <li> He has a full beard and was pleased with the item</li>
            <li> I tried using a depth attachment a couple times to trim my leg and chest hair (not thick at all), but found them fairly ineffective.</li>
            <li> These are the best hands down.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is hands down the best.</li>
            <li> The rubberized handle is comfortable and easy to grip, and though hair clippings tend to stick to it, they easily wipe off with a damp rag.</li>
            <li> My last trimmer had a great tray that tucked the wire in a way that I could easily pull it off and pop it on the charger, and had a tray they fit all the accessories to store them in a very clean manner.  </li>
            <li> a \\&quot;good, strong unit.\\&quot;  Now for a word of pure praise: Kudos to Wahl for their quickly interchangeable head system.</li>
            <li> (It certainly raises the \\&quot;useful\\&quot; quotient by more than a bit!)</li>
            <li> (It certainly raises the \\&quot;useful\\&quot; quotient by more than a bit!)</li>
            <li> I was very happy also that after removing the comb I was able to clean up the neckline and remove the little fine neck hairs in a Jiff.  </li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d just upgrade to a new trimmer, and this seemed like a good unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it still works as good as new.</li>
            <li> worked fine until about 2 weeks ago...</li>
            <li> The plastic guards that set the length of hair fit on and off easily and do not flex when I trim.  </li>
            <li> This works fine for the price.  </li>
            <li> Everything else is fine.  </li>
            <li> Easy to operate and smooth.  </li>
            <li> The Wahl All In One Trimmer, has worked out just fine for me.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li> When it runs, it works fine.</li>
            <li> Bottom line is that it&#x27;s light weight &amp; easy to use.</li>
            <li> The attachments, which click off and on easily, are lightly built but seem functional and not about to fall apart.</li>
            <li> Oh, it somehow manages to produce a fine dust from your skin, but the hair underneath will be almost untouched.</li>
            <li> 2/21/15 Battery dies, works fine for a while</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight and feels comfortable, easy to hold.  </li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m just fine.  </li>
            <li> The battery seemed fine.</li>
            <li> and yes I checked my outlet and it works fine with wife&#x27;s blow dryer.</li>
            <li> The adjustable guide for the trim head works fine.  </li>
            <li> and it seemed to handle it just fine.</li>
            <li> Although it works fine, it has some quirks.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve worked fine every time.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no effort to seal the unit, so the electronics were covered with fine hair residue.</li>
            <li> but it does the job just fine.</li>
            <li> It still works fine</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t fit snug against the blades and seem like they could easily break.  </li>
            <li> Works fine.</li>
            <li> The Phillips model shaves so smooth &amp; easy that a baby could use it.</li>
            <li> just fine.  </li>
            <li> perfect the first time I used teh product and then 2 days later the trimmer wouldn&#x27;t trun on.</li>
            <li> Compact, light, easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> : this is a 120/60hz trimmer, but it does work fine on a transformer</li>
            <li> but if the dog keeps shedding, I may fine a use for it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> then this will suit your needs just fine.</li>
            <li> A bit underpowered and doesn&#x27;t cut as fine as I would prefer (like a corded trimmer), but understandable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Wahl trimmer for about 3 weeks now, and it works just fine for what I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The trimmer has been running just fine on a &amp;#34;factory charge&amp;#34; for 2-3 weeks now - (I am not making this up)&lt;br /&gt;a testament to:&lt;br /&gt;a)</li>
            <li> Trimmer works fine.</li>
            <li> It works just fine.</li>
            <li> The Litium Ion All in One is a fine product.</li>
            <li> This works okay for a couple months but quickly wears out.  </li>
            <li> I was pleased with how quickly this shipped and the price that I paid for the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> I love how the accessories just snap on/off quickly.</li>
            <li> The clippers are cheaply made, but they are light and easily maneuverable.  </li>
            <li> but if you use the buzz upside down it gets close enough, great battery life and perfect size.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The clippers work just fine and the motor does not make too much sound.</li>
            <li> Love the battery life but it would be much easier to manage the many attachments if it came in a case with a lid for easy storage.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for an older trimmer and we were very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is a nice set, I certainly recommend it.with this Wahl.</li>
            <li> This is a nice set, I certainly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Here, I wonder about the experience of most folks - as, a good, strong unit is bound to feel &amp; sound like it - especially at this price point!</li>
            <li> Here, I wonder about the experience of most folks - as, a good, strong unit is bound to feel &amp; sound like it - especially at this price point!</li>
            <li> This the best little trimmer you could ask for.</li>
            <li> The stand for all the assessories could use a little work but over all very impressed with the trimmer</li>
            <li> This is the perfect little trimmer.</li>
            <li> thanks so much!!!!!</li>
            <li> I use the accessories to help get hard to reach places safely, as well as perfect the trimming process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The clipper had a good grip, very good torque (it feels heavy and very stable) and the blade is far superior.</li>
            <li> an accurate variable length trimmer 2) had a nose hair attachment and 3)</li>
            <li> Li battery makes a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li> Despite this huge shortcoming, WAHL never mentions it in the instructions or elsewhere that it&#x27;s not waterproof.</li>
            <li> He uses the trimmer on his 6 year old Braun rechargeable electric shaver for his sideburns, and it still runs perfectly after all these years, though some of the paint did flake off near the head.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give an accurate description or account of this product because I have not used it yet.</li>
            <li> however the so called smooth shaver attachment is just abysmal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other reviewers mentioned the stand and they are right..its not convenient nor have I found a way to make all of the attachments fit securely although there is a diagram in the manual on how to do so...</li>
            <li> Watch my review to see the cheap construction inside.</li>
            <li> And its genuinely just a tray</li>
            <li> They stayed on and snapped in place securely.</li>
            <li> Overall, a great product.  </li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t really fit well.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it does a great job trimming the edges of your mustache above the lip, etc.</li>
            <li> Fantastic Trimmer.  </li>
            <li> No one person needs them all, but it is important to have the options to try when you receive the machine.</li>
            <li> I have always had a cheap trimmer.</li>
            <li> While it is slightly more pricey than the Ni-Cad versions it is well worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> 30 day return available</li>
            <li> spare parts available</li>
            <li> A smooth surface would solve this problem.</li>
            <li> I have purchased and replaced EVERY supposed quality BODY GROOMER and rechargeable trimmer available for years.</li>
            <li> It stopped working after one month of light use -</li>
            <li> and they replaced it promptly and cheerfully.  </li>
            <li> Fits well in your hand, comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> It was fantastic while it worked.  </li>
            <li> He liked it to much, I bought my son one also.  </li>
            <li> Really cheap stuff</li>
            <li> The multiple heads offer great flexibility for trimming and close shaving.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no need for a sticky rubber grip on a trimmer, and it&#x27;s not even that comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Powerful, with many attachments.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Wahl Lithium Ion trimmer primarily for sideburn, neck, &amp; \\&quot;nether\\&quot; region trimming purposes, as well as for the Lithium Ion battery.</li>
            <li> Given my experience, I don&#x27;t expect skin smooth shaves from a foil shaver.</li>
            <li> Done Liked it so much</li>
            <li> Overall a great value, no complaints.</li>
            <li> They are easy to clean (a damp face cloth will get the hair off the handle (for the person who gave it a one star because he had hair on the handle)).</li>
            <li> For the 3 months that it worked properly, it worked great.</li>
            <li> Great for trimming up around the ears and back of the neck.</li>
            <li> Then come back and do your shave - works great.</li>
            <li> the plastic \\&quot;chrome\\&quot; feel lends a cheap feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great price especially for the quality&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy care, just clean &amp; oil</li>
            <li> The blade is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Cheap finishing ..</li>
            <li> This is a Fantastic kit, everything you want or need in trimmer.</li>
            <li> A foil shaver attachment that actually does a great job.</li>
            <li> and they did not sacrifice any cheap material for price.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also incredibly useful for touching up brows, nose, and ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great overall product.</li>
            <li> the attachments get rusty, they are made from cheap metal.</li>
            <li> [3 week Update: I omitted this before, but, I bought this unit primarily to shave my head.</li>
            <li> Does its primary function well.</li>
            <li> dislike those adjustables for detailed work, and I often forget what setting I need, resulting in having no eyebrows for a week or two</li>
            <li> -- this is fantastic, unlike others I have used, this one does not slip around when using it.  </li>
            <li> It will save you a fortune not to mention all the time it might take to run to a hairdresser or barber, and the cordless possibilities free you up to move away from the mirror.</li>
            <li> is way to light to support everything without it falling.  </li>
            <li> it comes with cheap plastic add-ons that no one will ever use.</li>
            <li> I have owned this model before and this one is great just like the last one.  </li>
            <li> It cuts smoothly.</li>
            <li> the extra components it comes with make it a great buy.    </li>
            <li> They fit the trimmer head</li>
            <li> and it works great for personal grooming.</li>
            <li> I had the same model for about 5 years before it died and never had a problem with it and worked great.  </li>
            <li> the light weight of it will send the attachments all over the place.    </li>
            <li> worked great for the short time it worked</li>
            <li> There is no charge indicator light on the shaver to indicate charging status.  </li>
            <li> If you need a simple machine that just works, you should be happy with this Wahl.</li>
            <li> it has cheap plastic in the blades.</li>
            <li> I liked the Wahl product so much, I purchased another one</li>
            <li> It seems to be the most economical one to use.</li>
            <li> The cheap, plastic &amp;#34;organizer&amp;#34; tray that came with</li>
            <li> Keeps its charge and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> He has had a beard for most of his adult life, and has declared this trimmer as the best performing trimmer he has ever owned - definitely 5 stars!</li>
            <li> This was ordered as a Christmas gift and getting it on time was important.  </li>
            <li> However, the attachments don&#x27;t seem as accurate and precise as others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> My husband says this is comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let this deter you from buying though, the trimmer is the important part and it works great.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Compared to some of the stuff I&#x27;ve tried from Wally World it is fantastic.</li>
            <li> And, an indicator light when charging.  </li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s important information.</li>
            <li> The packaging is cheap, and there is no carrying or storage case.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a great unit.</li>
            <li> The attachments are cheaply made but they do the job, plus you get tons of attachments so there is one for whatever your need is.</li>
            <li> accessories are easy to maintain and clean.  </li>
            <li> It feels sturdy in the hand and it comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> I took a knife to the cheap rubber shrink-wrapped handle and opened the thing up.    </li>
            <li> Know that this is an extremely cheap piece of electronics.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the way everything fit together.  </li>
            <li> The cheap bum that I am purchased on Amazon vs Target to save $2...</li>
            <li> then this unit will save you lots of money by not going to the barber as it works great for short hair too.  </li>
            <li> Maybe the Lithium Ion battery makes it feel so light?</li>
            <li> compact and works quietly and does a great job</li>
            <li> Update - Wahl contacted me about my unit and is replacing it free of charge.  </li>
            <li> There is a nice youtube video that explains the whole device from Wahl</li>
            <li> Paid $34.17 - Free Shipping.</li>
            <li> Overall a great trimmer and would buy again.</li>
            <li> But, for those who travel, this trimmer is outstanding; compact, powerful, and lightweight and it works right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> then that I really enjoy this product and will choose Wahl again.</li>
            <li> Replacement heads are available from WAHL for $7.50, $5.95 shipping and $4 handling.  </li>
            <li> Although the grip is comfortable, my hair sticks to it, after I am done with the job.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use all the attachments and I primarily bought this to keep hair neat in between trips to the barber.&lt;br</li>
            <li> cheap - stuff falls out of it frequently&lt;</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, in terms of its basic function, the trimmer blade works great at trimming neck hair, sideburns, over-ear hair, etc.</li>
            <li> And theres no charge light to indicate its getting a charge.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Obviously the clipper is more powerful, so the clipper gave a faster and cleaner trim vs the trimmer.</li>
            <li> I also threw the cheap plastic stand/organizer away.  </li>
            <li> It holds a charge for what seems like forever and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight and cordless.</li>
            <li> and I have owned some cheap pieces of junk before.</li>
            <li> The free shipping can&#x27;t be beaten.</li>
            <li> this model has a great battery with several attachments.</li>
            <li> blade cuts smoothly</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried all of them yet but the height adjusters are cheap and they don&#x27;t mount that well.</li>
            <li> would give this item 5 stars if it were a lit more powerful.</li>
            <li> Great trimming kit with lots of extras: multiple heads and attachments!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need it for much, only trimming, so I don&#x27;t use the majority of the possibility it affords, but for my purposes it works great.</li>
            <li> The rubberized handle is exceedingly sticky, making for a secure grip.</li>
            <li> razor makes quite a buzzing sound.</li>
            <li> As it is, I would not recommend this product; if, however, this issue (the death of the product) were addressed in future models, it would be a great trimmer.</li>
            <li> light weight.  </li>
            <li> A friend recommended this to me, and I&#x27;ve been very impressed after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The build quality of this is extremely cheap.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it was available at the time.</li>
            <li> It has several widths of trimmers and the smallest is great for over the ears.</li>
            <li> sound and vibration&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it primarily as a beard trimmer and body hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Overall great</li>
            <li> Oh and everything falls out of the cheap plastic stand anytime</li>
            <li> The T-Blade head did not have an attachment with the 6 position trimming guide (like the primary Trimmer head) which would allow a variety of beard lengths.</li>
            <li> I have no idea how they fit everything in the tray.</li>
            <li> Everything (except the adjustable-length trimmer comb) still works great, and the battery charge still works over multiple beard</li>
            <li> I think this is a nice quality machine and will be appreciated by anyone with thinner beard hair than I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think this is a nice quality machine and will be appreciated by anyone with thinner beard hair than I have.</li>
            <li> Great company to do business with I would us them again if prices remain low.</li>
            <li> It also is easy to clean if you follow the instructions.</li>
            <li> the foil shaver gives a close and smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> :  Light and efficient.  </li>
            <li> that noise, that hammering sound that you hear is something... hammering.</li>
            <li> I turned mine over, filled it with BB shot (fishing aisle, Wal-Mart, $1.29) and topped it all off with Shoe Goo (also at Wal-Mart).  </li>
            <li> this cheap and acword plastic base.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Feels cheap.</li>
            <li> I was a light user with it, maybe twice a month to trim.  </li>
            <li> The battery lasts forever but the parts dont fit in the box that came with it.</li>
            <li> It pulls the hair, irritates my skin a bit, and leaves a spotty shave (some spots baby smooth and others with a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow).</li>
            <li> Cheaply made.</li>
            <li> A great edition to my necessary grooming...</li>
            <li> and  look cheap</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this guy for a few years now and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I owned the model before this one which is not a lot cheaper than this one, but still available.</li>
            <li> The blades and engine are smooth.</li>
            <li> This is a well built, durable, and comfortable trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried (but rarely use) most of the accessories and additional trimming / clipping / shaving heads, etc -</li>
            <li> Enjoy not having to deal with the cord-tangle issues.</li>
            <li> I also use the foil shaving head on my neck occasionally, and it seems great too.</li>
            <li> I noticed a rattling sound</li>
            <li> But the rattling sound continues</li>
            <li> This is a great personal trimmer that covers all hair and beard trimming needs at a great price and a quality close to commercial trimmers.</li>
            <li> Flimsy trim heads that fall off, cheap construction, noisy motor,</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use all the attachments, but I like having them available to use.  </li>
            <li> Works great for all the necessary trimming on the face and head.</li>
            <li> but I tried to go cheap.</li>
            <li> The trimmer I have just purchased does a fantastic job trimming my beard.</li>
            <li> Heads are removeable and easy to clean by brushing the blade out.</li>
            <li> I use a blade lube with the product and to date it has done a fantastic job.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean with the included brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- blades feel smooth on the skin</li>
            <li> I purchased my trimmer in July of 2012, and use it primarily for stubble-length trimming of my beard and mustache.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> His Norelco is far superior.  </li>
            <li> Not too loud, it&#x27;s got a good torque to it.</li>
            <li> Good Razor, I am sure I will have to replace it in 3 years like the  last one</li>
            <li> So far so good, I bought it to trim my dogs face around her eyes and mouth.</li>
            <li> Yeah, this is more of a narrative than a proper review, but there is some good information to be gleaned.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer to keep my beard in check and so far it has been fairly usefull.</li>
            <li> Me machine is loud, but works good.</li>
            <li> I gave one to my bf for christmas and it seems to have done a good job so far.</li>
            <li> SO FAR SO GOOD....</li>
            <li> I was so happy with my previous one, it was very easy to buy another one.</li>
            <li> It works fine for it&#x27;s original design of being just a shaver.  </li>
            <li> The only things I would say is that it is mainly made out of plastic (except for the blades of course) which gives it kind of a cheap feel however it does work great.  </li>
            <li> The reason I say to make sure that you have the right lenghth, I literally shaved my eyebrows off trying to trim them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Strong motor, good attachments, easy to use, everything you want in a simple trimmer.</li>
            <li> The only one I can ever see myself using is the very nice 6 position adjustable head.</li>
            <li> Trimmer is well made and very useful.</li>
            <li> Very powerful.</li>
            <li> I have found the trimmer very useful and it has lived up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> The package contents are very useful.</li>
            <li> I would gladly pay more for this if it just had some type of water resistance...and a decent stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This trimmer has a ONE HOUR CHARGE, a quick charge function and keeps its power full on for 3 HOURS!  </li>
            <li> but if you like choices, then this one is most certainly the winner!</li>
            <li> The trimmer is a great size, is really easy to change attachments for and is, overall, an extremely useful tool.</li>
            <li> He says the cut is clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> They just give you a cheap $0.05 brush that fell apart after 5 uses -- to clean the blades.</li>
            <li> Have used many Wahl products over last 25 years &amp; have always been very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It recharges quickly and cleans easily.</li>
            <li> I liked my older Wahl because it was all metal.</li>
            <li> And even trying to do exactly what they have in the picture, I found that many of the pieces don&#x27;t really fit in their places as shown snugly.  </li>
            <li> I expected to be impressed, but sadly, I&#x27;m not.</li>
            <li> Lasts forever on 1 charge and helps me achieve my &#x27;Don Johnson&#x27; look quickly and easily every day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very practical, easy to use and most importantly it serves its purpose.</li>
            <li> Accessories change quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> Its a neat package of accessories and quick and easy snap-on cutters.</li>
            <li> The attachments themselves are all effective and high quality.</li>
            <li> Battery last for quite a while, strong motor, good attachments.  </li>
            <li> The battery works great, charges last a LOOOOOONG time and it recharges quick.</li>
            <li> The trimmer itself is strong, relatively quiet and has good battery</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still not convinced that it will replace my old school manual razor for shaving, but it&#x27;s a good quick option.      </li>
            <li> /&gt;Summary: If you want a lightweight, powerful beard trimmer that won&#x27;t leave you hanging with half a beard in the morning, this product from Wahl is an awesome buy.</li>
            <li> This is a great quality, light weight, powerful trimmer for personal use.  </li>
            <li> the clippers were OK at first</li>
            <li> I was pleased with this trimmer at first but after about 8 months it quit holding a charge.</li>
            <li> And changing trimmer heads is straightforward and snap into place with precision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Okay everyone this is the first time I ever wrote a review on the items I purchase from amazon</li>
            <li> Original review</li>
            <li> They did not, however, offer to replace it on the phone (see below original review).</li>
            <li> It is still running on the original charge.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I read all the reviews first.  </li>
            <li> Brought this Trimmer and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I have been very pleased so far.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to buy a made-in-USA product ... until I used it.</li>
            <li> It works great and the charge lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> The rep was friendly and helpful.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with so far.</li>
            <li> Worked great for a year though, and had long battery life.</li>
            <li> The trimmer doesnt take long to charge, and all the accessories are great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a month now, and it&#x27;s still on the original charge.  </li>
            <li> Brought this trimmer home today excited to trim my beard and mustache.</li>
            <li> My original review is at the bottom of this entry.</li>
            <li> ORIGINAL REVIEW:</li>
            <li> Works great, holds charge for a long time without needing to be recharged.</li>
            <li> I wish that there was a light that let me know when the charger was full.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with having one item for all kinds of hair grooming.</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed with the shaver,however.</li>
            <li> I was mostly interested in a better and stronger battery life, and this product meets that need.</li>
            <li> - Powerful!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve successfully rinsed the handle before, but after rinsing it recently, the trimmer quit working.</li>
            <li> the first one lasted approx 5 years or more.</li>
            <li> If you were dependent on the attachments for your needs it would rate significantly lower as the attachments are not as well made as the trimmer itself.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure, but it&#x27;s wonderful.  </li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m pretty sure I saw this at Wal-Mart</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t trim my goatee every day maybe twice a week but the power and charge is always there, never disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is the first trimmer I have owned, and still my favorite.</li>
            <li> It blows away any competitors with which I have been familiar.  </li>
            <li> For those who complain about too many accessories: Really? Just throw them away then!</li>
            <li> The long operating time between charges is great and all accesories work as advertised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be willing to pay a lot more</li>
            <li> Seemed to work OK the first couple of weeks although it would pull hairs when using the attachments to trim my beard.</li>
            <li> Pretty sure this is planned obsolescence.</li>
            <li> These clippers are pretty much better than sliced bread</li>
            <li> I was really excited to use this when I bought it, but I do have a couple of complaints.</li>
            <li> Now fast forward 5 months it worked today and no wont turn back on awesome right.  </li>
            <li> Great little unit, more versatile than I was expecting.  </li>
            <li> &gt; say all of this because my new Wahl Lithium Ion All In One Trimmer is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> It has great power and the battery has a very long life.  </li>
            <li> If you want to clean the beard trimmings, you need to spend an hour using the provided brush.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> trimmer is indeed quite powerful, one of the most powerful on the market today.  </li>
            <li> It pulled a lot (i.e. didn&#x27;t cut cleanly).  </li>
            <li> which we did not test since Dave is clean shaven except for his mustache.  </li>
            <li> I prefer not to shave my head clean with a blade....</li>
            <li> The trimmer attachments provide a clean &amp; close trim.</li>
            <li> SUPER smooth, lightweight, and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> and I also use it to clean up my neck line which grows rapidly.  </li>
            <li> I managed to clean up my goatee, sideburns, and my eye brows in just 10 min.</li>
            <li> The attachments are flimsy and cheap, and there isn&#x27;t a good one for a short (#2) beard like mine.  </li>
            <li> but it would take hours to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li> The powerful motor in the trimmer easily cuts through hair.</li>
            <li> The 5 year warranty is great - in theory - but trying to actually ship it off for repair is a pain and with the cost of shipping it isn&#x27;t worth it.  </li>
            <li> clean, even shave.</li>
            <li> I used a damp cloth to wipe it clean, but even the fibers from the cloth somehow got stuck on the handle.</li>
            <li> and I have only had it for about a month, but so far it is excellent.</li>
            <li> Provides a quick and precise mustache trim.  </li>
            <li> It cannot line up hair and it cannot give you a clean cut.</li>
            <li> Says that it cuts nicely and loves that it has many different guard options.</li>
            <li> These have been the best clippers so far out of 6 different ones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several trimmers and this one by far is the best.</li>
            <li> The trimming action is great and he seems very please with the gift.</li>
            <li> As far as clipping goes, it does great and works very well for my needs.</li>
            <li> Has more accessories than you need (better than too few) and feels really nice and solid in the hand--not cheap--and the rubber grip is great.</li>
            <li> I kept it lubricated and clean.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;We used to think Wahl made the best quality clippers and trimmers, and maybe with their professional line products that may be the case, but for the consumer products, we feel they are just junk, and will try a different brand, and stick to a corded model.</li>
            <li> I wanted to use this in order to clean up about 10-12 days of beard growth.</li>
            <li> It picks up stuff on surfaces that appear to be perfectly clean.</li>
            <li> when I contacted the company about this issue they had a quick prompt response and sent out a free replacement.</li>
            <li> I use it for trimming around the neck hairline and it seems to stay relatively clean.</li>
            <li> If it is - stay clean</li>
            <li> The stand is super cheap quality.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my son who wanted to keep his hairline clean in between haircuts.  </li>
            <li> so I removed the beard guide to clean the blades -- and some sort of clip fell out of the unit.  </li>
            <li> a clean even look that I like.  </li>
            <li> I just needed it to remove nose and eyebrow hair and maybe keep my wife&#x27;s play ground clean</li>
            <li> trim all the hair on my neck and looks clean and neat all the time--thanks</li>
            <li> to keep clean , hairs stick to handle.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Worth the buy for a variety of things, and still going strong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong, powerful, and reliable.</li>
            <li> On the positive, the stubble guards on this work  work better once you manage to get them on</li>
            <li> By far the most power from any trimmer I&#x27;ve owned!</li>
            <li> After reading lots of positive reviews and using the 5yr warranty as a feel good reinforcement, I decided to give the Lithium Ion a try, even with the high price tag, I figured \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made of a high grip type of rubber that does make it very easy to hold, but your trimmed hairs will stick to it.</li>
            <li> The Tray is great for holding all the blades and accessories, but the Shaver itself sits a bit loose and the charge wire doesn&#x27;t stay in place</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s pretty easy to put a drop or 2 of oil on the blades once a week, and it helps give a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great that it charges so quickly and keeps its charge for so long.</li>
            <li> The li-on battery is a great feature on this trimmer, as it lasts for a long time and charges quickly.</li>
            <li> I ordered this, but had to return it, it&#x27;s very sturdy and my skin is very sensitive, I liked the built quality but its not for me !</li>
            <li> It cuts very well, is very light weight.  </li>
            <li> thankfully it was nothing visible and stopped bleeding after a minute, but i was right to hurry because it did die very quickly.  </li>
            <li> My original title for this review was:  \\&quot;OK if you consider $40 reasonable for a disposable razor!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I like it better than my large Whal clipper.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t style it or do anything special -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful, recharges quickly, and the attachments are easy to change.  </li>
            <li> Feels cheaply made in comparison, and my older model even now does a better trimming job.</li>
            <li> Changing the different heads is very easy and the holder is just okay.</li>
            <li> It claims more power, and it definitely delivers with a very strong motor.</li>
            <li> I shopped hard for the best price, and Amazon was lowest, including Walmart online.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve found many of these attachments very useful and of high quality.</li>
            <li> It cuts amazingly and it isn&#x27;t loud at all.</li>
            <li> When I got it out of the box I was thrilled to see it already had a pretty substantial charge and was ready to go.</li>
            <li> I got this item because it was an all in one and the reviews on it were overall good.</li>
            <li> Feels really solid in my hand and the head is well-designed, it&#x27;s easy to get a nice clean line.</li>
            <li> I figured if it&#x27;s good enough for professionals, it&#x27;s good enough for me to try out.</li>
            <li> It gave a good shave, but there are over a dozen different pieces that will probably get scattered all around some drawer.</li>
            <li> I really like the results I am able to achieve with this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Whether I have a full beard or switch it up with a goatee, this trimmer allows me to groom and style any way I want.</li>
            <li> My barber charges 10 bucks for lineups and trims in between full blown haircuts</li>
            <li> Meaning it&#x27;s just not designed to give full service haircuts.</li>
            <li> This is a cool product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a real shame because i was staring to love this thing.     </li>
            <li> When looking at the photos I figured that the trimmer would charge by placing it in the holder...not true.</li>
            <li> Charged for just over an hour when I received it, it has been running full strength ever since.  </li>
            <li> The conaire I thought was very underpowered for the beard trimmer and would require many passes to get an even cut.  </li>
            <li> After a full charge (overnight) it will run about 2-3 minutes, maybe.</li>
            <li> The dual foil shaver actually does a good job.</li>
            <li> Today after a full charge it died until I plugged it in.</li>
            <li> I had to send in the full unit with power supply.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very flimsy, looks more like a packaging tray, and if you touch anything it all falls out.  </li>
            <li> With a full beard it saves all those hours of trying to be proficient with scissors.</li>
            <li> but Amazon wants me to write more.  </li>
            <li> and this is after a full night recharge.</li>
            <li> Love the straight blade nose trimmer...</li>
            <li> It does a wonderful job on my thick beard</li>
            <li> it was 3.95 V showing a full charge.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s good enough ..  </li>
            <li> Same price, way superior battery.</li>
            <li> the unit: Seems like a good, solid buy.</li>
            <li> The only good thing about this device is that it&#x27;s a Lithium Ion battery (have not opened to confirm that).</li>
            <li> Replaceable battery would be nice -- as my old trimmer wasn&#x27;t what I would refer to as \\&quot;all used up\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Replaceable battery would be nice -- as my old trimmer wasn&#x27;t what I would refer to as \\&quot;all used up\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> A really nice, complete grooming set.</li>
            <li> The cordless feature is very convenient and provides better control.</li>
            <li> detail attachment is good because it&#x27;s not big.</li>
            <li> I have another beard trimmer that does a good job of trimming my beard but not above the lip.</li>
            <li> Batter lasts FOREVER, one sweet cut and it out performs my Norelco that I&#x27;ve owned for years.</li>
            <li> Not everyone can have a beard, but if you have been blessed with the genetics to grow one, it is your responsibility to respect and maintain it; thus ensuring many more decades of this glorious time period known as the Beard Renaissance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expected to give this trimmer 4 stars because I thought it had too many attachments</li>
            <li> A full charge lasts me for weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> it makes too much noise, the battery charge is ok.</li>
            <li> This is simply a quality product at a good price.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how good it is for facial shaving.</li>
            <li> I have also cut my own hair with their hair clippers since I was 7 years old.</li>
            <li> Plus it has the attachments that really send this over the top.</li>
            <li> the stainless body one is better.</li>
            <li> Full Práctica porque es inalámbrica, liviana, corta muy bien, le cargo la batería una sola vez al mes (increíble).</li>
            <li> There are way too many attachments for my needs, but who really cares?</li>
            <li> Will be getting the kind that just plug directly into ac power this time.     </li>
            <li> Good overall trimmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have a full set of heads this way, 2 bases, and a bag to store it all in</li>
            <li> I was enjoying it so much</li>
            <li> I have no idea how this thing got through any testing in the Wahl company, but I hope the people responsible for this ingenious idea have been removed from a position of power.</li>
            <li> I have had a full beard and moustache since 1978.</li>
            <li> Plugged it in for a full day and still nothing.</li>
            <li> I really like that Wahl still manufactures most of their products in the USA</li>
            <li> Also, the charger is the same for this as it is for the lithium head hair clippers I have (which also has good battery life).</li>
            <li> This is absolutely true.</li>
            <li> The attachments all seem to work fairly well too, no problems with pulling/snagging of facial hair.</li>
            <li> Full voltage of a Lithium battery).</li>
            <li> This one product is really all you need to remain a well-groomed and distinguished man. :)</li>
            <li> The trimmer will not hold a charge in about 6 months,  It will not even get threw a trimming at full charge.  </li>
            <li> Its good buy but smaller than I</li>
            <li> Initially, I had a had good things to say about this product and now find myself editing this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Has a good selection of various attachments and has worked well since its purchase.  </li>
            <li> I was actually really worried as at times I was wondering whether or not I was going to be able to find the charger for it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It looks like it was made for a full size clipper and it slides sideways when trimming because it is wider than the trimmer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cool.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really ask for much more at this price.</li>
            <li> I am using this trimmer for the last 1 month and feels really good.</li>
            <li> Have a good night.&amp;#34; and told me I could send it back.</li>
            <li> find the Lithium Ion battery life to be spectacular thus far.</li>
            <li> This is now my full body hair removal tool.  </li>
            <li> Battery charge life and short time for chargning are good.  </li>
            <li> Overall this has been a good product.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t need a full size shaver, but this foil head just doesn&#x27;t cut the mustard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> some more cons I could add but when a product stops working after four months the rest really doesn&#x27;t matter.  </li>
            <li> I use the Wahl Trimmer on my full beard.  </li>
            <li> Judging from the sound, the motor is powerful and the battery holds its charge.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it will be good for someones back hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s true</li>
            <li> Stay away spend a bit more money on real quality.</li>
            <li> Good trimming initially, lots of attachments.</li>
            <li> Full compliment of trim heads</li>
            <li> But considering the product as a whole, I couldn&#x27;t give more than 4 stars, and would have given 3 1/2 if it was allowed.</li>
            <li> I really like the trimmer but haven&#x27;t used many of the attachments.  </li>
            <li> Not bad....</li>
            <li> Also pretty loud and a good bit of vibration.</li>
            <li> Customer service says no bad batch of product &amp; offer no assistance that matters.</li>
            <li> in all, it&#x27;s not a bad trimmer.</li>
            <li> Well not bad.</li>
            <li> Very powerful and a charge lasts a good long time.  </li>
            <li> The handle is a magnet for beard clippings, but a quick swipe with a damp sponge will clean it adequately.  </li>
            <li> Better than my previous Wahl rechargeable beard trimmer but not as good as they used to be.</li>
            <li> Bought this trimmer in december used it 30 times more or less on stubble now its sits not operating at all call Amazon given a 815 number to call good luck</li>
            <li> The standard against which a multiple use product like this is to be measured is NOT whether it is the best performing product at each task, but rather whether it performs well enough to replace two or more items in your bathroom or more importantly in your carry on luggage.  </li>
            <li> yeah, my wife is right, I now look civilized.</li>
            <li> Other than that, the old one was great and this new one is just as great.</li>
            <li> It charges quickly, and it holds a full charge a looooong time.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer has enought attachments and depths guides to allow easy trimming exactly the way you need it.</li>
            <li> very nice, but not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Very cheap - I was only able to use it a handful of times before needing to get something else.  </li>
            <li> This is really the best all-in-one beard trimmer out there for this price and even better than some more expensive products out there.</li>
            <li> The foil shaver isn&#x27;t a high end electric shaver, but it is more than good enough for me.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get a chance to use the shaver, i assume it works great according to other people&#x27;s reviews.</li>
            <li> It charges very fast, it is very powerful, and so far the charge is holding nicely.</li>
            <li> beard and other trimmer shaver attachments work great as well.</li>
            <li> Just used it the other day to cut my husbands hair and it turned out great with the clipper attachments.  </li>
            <li> All other features are great tho.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer, sharp blades, and 6 trimming levels.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I trimmed his neck with it and the sharp blades did great on those wiry neck hairs.</li>
            <li> do agree with some of the other reviewers that mention the plastic holder that everything sits in does not do a great job of keeping everything in place and</li>
            <li> all the other attachments are a great plus to.</li>
            <li> cuts great with no tugging that you get with other trimmers in this price range.  </li>
            <li> The attachments are functionable, and provide a very close trim, the precision trimmer is quite impressive but heats up a little bit after prolonged use, be hasty with the nose hairs.</li>
            <li> This little trimmer has impressed me so much, that when I replace my dog grooming clippers this summer, I&#x27;m buying Wahl.</li>
            <li> Just as an example of how powerful it is, let me tell you, if I wanted, I could easily use this thing to shave all the hair off my head, probably in about 2-3 minutes... and I have a very large and bushy head of hair.</li>
            <li> After getting the other one replaced, my new trimmer has been working perfectly.</li>
            <li> battery lasts a couple of days, the accessories are very complete, and the trim is very fine.</li>
            <li> The battery seems great, I have only had to charge it once so far and has full power every use!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two of these now and the first one works just fine still</li>
            <li> First 6 months it worked fine and then it quit working after 7 months.</li>
            <li> Part did not work properly first time I tried to use it--requested return --printed document--trimmer works fine</li>
            <li> It worked fine at first.  </li>
            <li> worked great until almost one whole year later.</li>
            <li> It seems to have \\&quot;wore out\\&quot; rather quickly.</li>
            <li> The power of this trimmer is tremendous.  </li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and it performs just as advertized.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve gotten used to the super close #1</li>
            <li> it got there that quickly.</li>
            <li> I can quickly shave and trim my goatee in minutes.</li>
            <li> Dave trimmed up his mustache and eyebrows quickly, too.  </li>
            <li> and then I am lucky if it finishes without dieing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;In summation for a bearded or mustachioed man on the go this device CAN adequately replace everything it claims to replace with the exception of a nose hair trimmer.vacuum feature to capture hair clippings would be a nice-to-have.</li>
            <li> In summation for a bearded or mustachioed man on the go this device CAN adequately replace everything it claims to replace with the exception of a nose hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> Despite the whisker trimmings attracting rubber grip, the trimmer is adequate and the battery lasts about two months on a charge (for trimmings three times per week).</li>
            <li> trimmer provides plenty of useful attachments, some of which I&#x27;ll never use but they seem good enough.</li>
            <li> The two saving features are the quick charging lithium battery which charges the unit in one hour and</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that these people did not pay for the item and did not actively go out and search for the product they now own.  </li>
            <li> Also, if you run out of juice, it recharges quickly.</li>
            <li> Lithium Ion batteries charge quickly &amp; can charge often with no memory effects</li>
            <li> To be honest, I expected more.</li>
            <li> is that it cuts super close to my scalp because I shave my head.</li>
            <li> I emailed Wahl and got a quick response telling me to send in the shaver and charger.  </li>
            <li> My old Norelco (which died a natural death after years of great service) gave a 100% even trim at any length setting</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had the issue of my clipper&#x27;s battery dying out super quick and eventually losing it&#x27;s charging capabilities.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is underpowered, and the battery dies quickly, then within a couple months is un-rechargeable...</li>
            <li> Luckily nothing broke</li>
            <li> This particular trimmer from Wahl is my all time favorite.</li>
            <li> Came quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a quickly dying trimmer I&#x27;d owned for years.</li>
            <li> Charges fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> Started losing battery life fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that the shaving head rusted quickly, which probably added to the friction load on the spring.</li>
            <li> The documentation is barely adequate.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s exactly what I use this product for, and for the past two years it has worked flawlessly.</li>
            <li> With occasional oiling of the head, this trimmer should give me many more years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lucky if I get 3 minutes of use after charging it all night.</li>
            <li> Ordered this one, and got it super quick.</li>
            <li> but they never trim as well and quickly wear out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It charges quickly and holds a charge well.</li>
            <li> I will continue to be a loyal customer as a result....</li>
            <li> If you need something quick for travel I would recommend getting this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I think it would have made more sense to decrease the amount of accessories and use the saved money for a better charging function and standard auto-ranging wall-brick.</li>
            <li> i like the super rubber grip of the trimmer, but if you pull it from the tray to quick it will just pull the tray with it and all the pieces will go flying everywhere.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through numerous trimmers of different brands and this one lasted the longest and worked the best.</li>
            <li> For a beard and extraneous hair cutter, it works adequately.</li>
            <li> Holds charge for what seems like forever (mild usage for me).  </li>
            <li> Most importantly, it just does not work as well as my old Wahl.  </li>
            <li> Additional the blades rusted quickly.</li>
            <li> It is the kind of grip you would want on a golf club or something that has a greater likelihood of slipping out of your hands.  </li>
            <li> However, I discovered that the hairs come off quickly when I blow on them, so this is no longer an issue for me.</li>
            <li> It has lots of different attachments, more than most people would ever need or use</li>
            <li> My son had, repeat, had a somewhat overgrown and mildly unkempt beard/mustache.</li>
            <li> I wanted to check the quick charge function.</li>
            <li> If it wasn&#x27;t overpriced, it was too cheap, and many of the reviews reflected that, but this appears to be the exception so far.  </li>
            <li> And, without a guard on the trimmer, it will pull your hair like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s super</li>
            <li> Trims the beard adequately.</li>
            <li> It was delivered quickly.  </li>
            <li> I just use a 1/8&amp;#34; on my head so it is super</li>
            <li> Cuts super close.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;3 minute quick charge&amp;#34; is nonexistent.  </li>
            <li> as most people (besides me) could figure out, a Van Dyke or most any beard requires maintenance / regular trimming, or you end up looking like a homeless grizzly adams</li>
            <li> Luckily it&#x27;s Li-ion</li>
            <li> quick ship.  </li>
            <li> quick charge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the capable vacuum alone makes it great</li>
            <li> Awesome trimmer, only downside that SOME people may see is that it does not have a vacuum system.</li>
            <li> this is great as a &#x27;balding&#x27; razor for a tight, clean look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had maybe a dozen personal trimmers over the years, and for the price, this is by far the best - well-made, powerful motor, long-lasting battery, and every kind of useful attachment you&#x27;ll possibly need.  </li>
            <li> Only way to get a good 5 o&#x27;clock shadow is to use the 6 position trimmer at a right angle to face.  </li>
            <li> It was ready for use right out of the box and works much better than any</li>
            <li> Nice, sharp blades (which are ground, not stamped), clean cuts, and overall a great product.  </li>
            <li> It charges very quickly, holds a charge well, and it pretty powerful.</li>
            <li> Overall I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> If you go bald on top or wear a buzz cut, don&#x27;t spend the bucks for a larger, more powerful clipper.</li>
            <li> WAS NOT AS LOUD AS OTHER PEAPLE SAID IT IS VERY GOOD FOR PRICE!</li>
            <li> First, the chrome parts on the body feel extremely cheap.</li>
            <li> The hair cut blade also can be fit with Wahl attachments for more precise and longer hair cuts, and the 10 piece attachment kit only costs 6 dollars.</li>
            <li> Came with so many pieces and has such a great, ergonomic style and battery life that I rate this a solid 5 from Wahl.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It feels good in your hand -- not too heavy and not too light -- and comes with a huge assortment of attachments.</li>
            <li> From the moment I took it out of the box, the cheap workmanship was evident.  </li>
            <li> IS DOES A PRETTY CLOSE SHAVE FOR BEARD SHEARING,&lt;br /&gt;THE RECHARGER WORKS FABULOUS ON IT.</li>
            <li> , good feel in the hand, and lasts a long time between charges.</li>
            <li> Works good, my husband said holds a long charge, hasn&#x27;t charged it since he got it.</li>
            <li> Charge lasts a good long while.</li>
            <li> The charge lasts a long time and my hair dresser girlfreind thinks it is a good quality product.</li>
            <li> Good choice of tips/options and battery lasts as long as you keep it charged vs forgetting about it(standard batt maint).</li>
            <li> -- it seems like it&#x27;s more powerful than the older version, though both work well.  </li>
            <li> I had an older Wahl trimmer which worked great until it died recently.  </li>
            <li> While it is a lighter weight than the older one, it provides superior performance so far.  </li>
            <li> work good , the battery hold the charge for a long time , easy to handle ,small,but to much stuff i just used for a couple weeks</li>
            <li> This trimmer is very high quality and has made for easy maintenance of my beard.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;ll be sporting some new cool designs into his white hair or some great new beard designs.</li>
            <li> very powerful and would absolutely recommend!</li>
            <li> Pretty god trimmer very useful .</li>
            <li> alot better than what he has now, its just one setting and with this new one</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m sure it doesn&#x27;t hurt that I live in Los Angeles.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> fairly ok while its still new, after a month or two it just drops to the ground on its quality, \\&quot;who says no pull?\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Good trimmer with very long battery life.</li>
            <li> It is more powerful, cuts better, battery lasts longer, and is just plain better quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about half the width of my corded Wahl trimmer, which is what I&#x27;ve been using to cut my hair (and does a great job).</li>
            <li> Great portable trimmer, still working after two and a half years.&lt;br /&gt;Never had any issues with it.</li>
            <li> shaver head actually works for a pretty good shave where needed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Trimmer charges quickly and is powerful.  </li>
            <li> The charger was also very quick and ready to use.</li>
            <li> It takes quite a bit of force to snap them on; making me feel pretty sure they will snap off at some point before I&#x27;m ready to be done using this product.</li>
            <li> All of the attachments are very flimsy and feel like they&#x27;ll break easily.</li>
            <li> It really helps him to keep his beard and sideburns in shape easily and neatly</li>
            <li> The super close attachment also works well to clean up the neckline after the first pass with the metal head.</li>
            <li> Accessories pop on and off easy and trimming heads are fast to swap with no tools.</li>
            <li> It keeps a charge very well and easy to operate.</li>
            <li> Battery last quite long and trims perfectly.</li>
            <li> so this is compact enough to travel with and the battery life is pretty good.</li>
            <li> The guard attachment is very flimsy and falls off easily.</li>
            <li> Powerful battery as advertised and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Use it to trim the whole body and it&#x27;s easy as could be.</li>
            <li> It has so many attachments,  you can trim pretty much anything with this puppy.  </li>
            <li> The battery in this thing is awesome, everything else pretty much sucks.</li>
            <li> I liked the earlier version and was happy to see that basic design and weight were the same in this version with the better battery.  </li>
            <li> Strong, Very Versatile.</li>
            <li> It keeps its edge, and is fast and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very strong, charges fast, and comes with more attachments than you&#x27;re likely to use.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure the little lines were even indicators at first, until I examined all three in bright daylight.</li>
            <li> , it’s perfect and light to hold, not heavy like other brands and very quite.</li>
            <li> But 4.5 years is fair for the low price, used this trimmer head almost every day, the rest of the unit and attachments still work perfectly fine and the battery still works almost like new.  </li>
            <li> I was excited when I first got this, as it seemed to be everything I needed in a beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> Love these things so far!</li>
            <li> This trimmer offers up an excellent choice for those looking to get past the cheap trimmers with abysmal battery life.  </li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time &amp; it cut me to the point of bleeding!  </li>
            <li> : first off, this thing HURTS!</li>
            <li> The look of my beard after a brief cut so impressed my wife that she said I should have bought it a long time ago!</li>
            <li> Exactly what my hairy husband wanted!</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended !!!</li>
            <li> A company like Wahl should have paid attention to small details such as these (it&#x27;s what once made them great); instead they seem to be relying solely on their reputation and good name.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to change the attachments, though most of them seem low quality.</li>
            <li> However, so much hair will stick to the handle that I had to use the toothbrush to clean it in the sink and then clean the sink.</li>
            <li> The best and most powerful I&#x27;ve used I can&#x27;t say enough about this set compared to others I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> Luckily I found the right product.</li>
            <li> Works great has lots of power and attachment, I just hope the battery holds up heard alot of stories about the battery not lasting very long satisfied for now.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is a great device; use it just about every day until it dies and have only charged it THREE times so far!  </li>
            <li> Thanks for the quick delivery!</li>
            <li> While the rubber covering makes it easy to hold it acts like a vacuum cleaner - most of the hair you trim sticks to it.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Super powerful, light weight and fast shaves.  </li>
            <li> Powerful motor that provides a great tight clip for beard and scalp.  </li>
            <li> Though well within reason, the unit is not as quiet as a good Andis trimmer, but you get many more options for less money.  </li>
            <li> and I was replacing a much less elaborate Wahl trimmer that had given me more that ten years of good service.  </li>
            <li> Took the head off and inspected inside, very clean and the unit looks brand spanking new.  </li>
            <li> advice to a new owner is to keep it very clean and lubricated.</li>
            <li> Great little buy.</li>
            <li> the dual head shaver does a great job with little \\&quot;touch up\\&quot; grooming jobs (as in toes, and around ankles, or anywhere else that you missed when you didn&#x27;t have your glasses on, or were grooming by candlelight in the bathroom).&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> This is a great little trimmer.</li>
            <li> Great little machine.</li>
            <li> This is a great little trimmer.  </li>
            <li> This is a great little unit.</li>
            <li> Great little shaver for women and men.</li>
            <li> The little bag holds everything nicely, including the many attachments (not all of which you might use, but you can always throw them out) and the charger.</li>
            <li> this shaver is good and had long time for battery and recharge very fast</li>
            <li> If there&#x27;s one \\&quot;negative\\&quot; aspect to this model, it&#x27;s the rubber handle that seems to attract cut hair (due to static build-up), but it cleans off easily with a light brush.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than the prices available here in Australia.</li>
            <li> For this price I did not buy it expecting it to shave lots of hair away or shave my face baby smooth (haha).  </li>
            <li> Battery/motor power can sound really week but</li>
            <li> I really wish they put some sort of charging indicator light on this</li>
            <li> Especially being so hectic around the holidays for delivery, that was amazing</li>
            <li> The tray for the attachments is huge (as others here have noted) and would take up too much space on my countertop, too.  </li>
            <li> If you really want it smooth though, you&#x27;ll still need a blade.  </li>
            <li> The contacts were connected much too securely to the battery, so I melted the solder at the board and just pulled them out.</li>
            <li> So ladies and gents, don&#x27;t waste your time with the older-technology rechargeables no matter how amazing the blades are or how many toys it comes with.</li>
            <li> Very plastic-y and kinda cheap.</li>
            <li> this stays charged while not in use and charges real fast.</li>
            <li> It is very versatile and smooth.</li>
            <li> The razor is more fun, though, and it is important that rituals such as shaving, hair trimming and the like should be fun.  </li>
            <li> It is surprisingly powerful for being battery operated.</li>
            <li> But the battery is powerful, and just need to be recharged in one hour.</li>
            <li> All in all, definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I just wanted something for those emergency shaves, but most important as a daily beard and mustache trimmer and for haircut touchups.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The long-life-charge of this system is also worth the price of admission.</li>
            <li> shaver is a nice one, but I think looking back on it I would have gotten the Norelco bodygroom trimmer.</li>
            <li> Really powerful.</li>
            <li> Great so far - only had clipper for a month</li>
            <li> Useful Hair sticks to the rubber grip though.</li>
            <li> well worth the money.</li>
            <li> will actually buy a product for myself after that kind of a response.</li>
            <li> However, the battery, which was wonderful at first, will not keep a charge long enough for me to trim my beard!</li>
            <li> the motor is powerful.</li>
            <li> This product is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> They can be used interchangeably by easily snapping on or off of the main unit.</li>
            <li> But with the #1 beard guard, they cut almost nothing off my goatee with 3 days worth of growth on it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-  Powerful.  </li>
            <li> All in all, this trimmer is worth the $40.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly quiet which is nice because I have to shave the inside of his ears and his whiskers.  </li>
            <li> The battery alone makes it worth buying</li>
            <li> a bit powerful though.</li>
            <li> Well worth the buy.</li>
            <li> Just be nice to the plastic pieces, and it will last you.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Worth the price ..  </li>
            <li> And it is certainly powerful as promised.  </li>
            <li> Powerful trimmer but needs work.  </li>
            <li> Third, the most important attachment (to me) is the rotary blade that trims nose hair and inside the ear hear, and this is not included, it has to be ordered separately.  </li>
            <li> Certainly powerful enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels like it could handle most of the same jobs as a full-size plugin unit, and has the benefit of being light and nimble.</li>
            <li> but is that ever useful.</li>
            <li> but is that ever useful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It would of bee nice for Wahl to include a bag or such to keep everything inside (cord, attachments, etc.).  </li>
            <li> I had it all set up nice, used the trimmer and put it back in the stand and BAM....</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s about the only nice thing I have to say about it.</li>
            <li> Additionally, this trimmer feels as powerful as any corded/plug-in trimmer I have used.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it</li>
            <li> Whal, quality product and worth the money.</li>
            <li> Just wish it came with a nice storage box, perhaps with slots and pockets for oranizing all the individual pieces.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Not feeling the highest quality - makes loud noises after a while, maybe it needs more lubrication.</li>
            <li> I rarely charge it.</li>
            <li> Maybe someday I&#x27;ll use them all but for now I use only two and the trimmer with those two attachments does everything I need done ... effectively and efficiently.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight powerful and has lots of attachments.</li>
            <li> Powerful and diverse.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a nice Panasonic I bought to replace it that doesn&#x27;t need all the attachments because you can dial different trimmer heights.</li>
            <li> I rarely have to charge it</li>
            <li> rarely needs charging</li>
            <li> , this will replace several shavers I own, once I&#x27;ve played with all the attachments.</li>
            <li> have not had success using the 2 headed beard trimming attachment.</li>
            <li> Worth the money..</li>
            <li> They obviously don&#x27;t use their own products.</li>
            <li> The motor is powerful but the trimmer is very compact and comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is well worth $30.</li>
            <li> (a rare find these days)  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe it is worth $30-$40, however.  </li>
            <li> Comes with a useful set of attachments and</li>
            <li> Motor unreliable and alternates speeds when it feels like it, conveniently catching and chomping on your facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> There are far more attachments for varied types of trimming.  </li>
            <li> This product was worth every penny I paid for it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have ordered a replacement trimmmer as Amazon was kind enough to refund my purchase and issue a shipping label for its prompt return, even after their 30 day refund policy had expired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Powerful.</li>
            <li> He has used and own much more expensive trimmers, and He says this is as good or better than the most expensive He has ever own.</li>
            <li> Has professionally ground trimmer head, that is way better than the forged trimmer head (blades) on the cheaper units.</li>
            <li> and this thing does not control the hair length worth doo-doo.</li>
            <li> 10x better then my old conair istubble.</li>
            <li> Well worth it</li>
            <li> for the second time it has been repaired and so far it is working great.  </li>
            <li> have used it quite a bit and love it so far,was surprised with the foil shaver</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m pleased.  </li>
            <li> Lets be honest, it is not very likely</li>
            <li> We liked our purchase and would recommend this to the next guy.</li>
            <li> I like that it is very durable, easy to clean, and has many different trimmers to choose from.</li>
            <li> As a male with a penchant for facial hair configurations that require constant upkeep, I have experienced my fair share of trimmers in this variety.</li>
            <li> It has a more powerful motor than the old trimmers and the Li - On batteries stay charged a lot longer.</li>
            <li> It has different attachments for lengths which is nice.</li>
            <li> Powerful, lots of trimming options, holds a charge forever.</li>
            <li> Has a powerful motor</li>
            <li> Anyway, this trimmer is worth</li>
            <li> I use the Wahl for beard/face trimming and shaving my head, and I really love this trimmer so far.</li>
            <li> Made of nice solid plastic, not flimsy at all.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> After my faithful Wahl beard trimmer finally died after 20 years of good service, I decided I&#x27;d look for something that did more than just trim beards - I wanted a combination trimmer that would also double as an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m sincerely surprised to see so many well received reviews</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve realized with these trimmers that there is no one shaver to rule them, but this one has been my favorite so far.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it every day, but it is nice not having to plug it in, like my last one once the battery no longer held a charge.</li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t remember the last time I charged it.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Kind of low rent, of</li>
            <li> And,  lastly it would be nice if all metal headed attachments had protective guards.</li>
            <li> So, rather than being able to drop the trimmer directly onto the charger, you have to plug it in, and then set it on the base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gave me a nice shave and was quiet.</li>
            <li> This unit seems to be well made and comes with useful attachments.</li>
            <li> Powerful motor</li>
            <li> I had about 3 months worth of beard growth and after using 2 attachments I was back to a nice smooth facade (the lady definitely appreciated that).</li>
            <li> Very nice little trim and worth the money.</li>
            <li> And it seems more than adequately well-made to last for many years of normal consumer use.    </li>
            <li> I have had many beard trimmers and this is the first one that easily gets through an entire trimming without slowing down.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that I have to keep the instructions right next to it on the bathroom vanity just to figure out which attachment does which kind of cut and how to connect it, etc.  </li>
            <li> Thanks, and enjoy your product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, it works right out of the box.  </li>
            <li> It is much lighter than the norelco and is very powerful.  </li>
            <li> Still works as good as the first day I bought it which includes weekly trimming of a full beard, using the T-Blade to shave/buzz my hair, and other body trimming as needed.</li>
            <li> Very sleek and contemporary design makes it visually pleasing, the rubberized gripping is a nice touch.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m impressed with how long it has held a single charge...several weeks and counting.  </li>
            <li> Good tool but not very powerful.</li>
            <li> I liked the idea of its light weight due to a lithium battery.  </li>
            <li> The only problem I have had I&#x27;m sure is unique to me.</li>
            <li> Other then that -- great product -- highly recommended!</li>
            <li> main unit is light weight and designed to be very flexible, although it does not feel cheaply made.</li>
            <li> This item arrived quickly and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> i wanted a trimmer with a long lasting battery and professional results ,and this fit the bill perfectly!</li>
            <li> The normal attachment does a great job of shaping your hair and cuts super sharp.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway I really like the unit for my application and obviously battery life is exceptional.</li>
            <li> The main reason I went with this one was for the shave attachment as that is what I use my trimmer for (not as close as a razor, but good enough for my needs).</li>
            <li> other then that it works good, not practical though</li>
            <li> The blades are sharp and they do a good job.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews - probably should - but this Wahl trimmer is so much superior to any other product out there I had to.  </li>
            <li> This gave me an extremely even trim on my beard so good that I came out bragging to my wife about how even it was.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find anything like a 6-position guide, and the only reasonable attachment suitable for a beard doesn&#x27;t really fit the trimmer.</li>
            <li> This is a very good trimmer - long lasting working time,</li>
            <li> speed zips right up when turned to non-useful angles.    </li>
            <li> just right.</li>
            <li> if I don&#x27;t charge them right away, they lose there charge with this product you won&#x27;t have to worry about that.</li>
            <li> And indeed he&#x27;s right; warranty service worked as it should.</li>
            <li> This does your beard right.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start right into it...</li>
            <li> They just didn&#x27;t seemed like the right item for my needs.  </li>
            <li> After charging this trimmer fully I used it right away to trim my beard and eyebrows.</li>
            <li> It takes chunks of hair out if you don&#x27;t hold it just right.</li>
            <li> and I believe I was right.  </li>
            <li> and I have to angle it to work right.  </li>
            <li> Got the job done while it lasted and came at the right price.</li>
            <li> Hoping someone can make this right.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair and this cuts right thru it with ease, I have yet to use all the attachments (it comes with a lot)</li>
            <li> Our wives/girlfriends of course requested a man-scapeing session right away, and it passed that test with flying colors (and no nicks, scrapes or scratches...</li>
            <li> it came precharged and it shaped me just right</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it three or four times a week for about eight months and it ran at full-power every time, right up to when the battery drain</li>
            <li> The price is right for what you get.</li>
            <li> Their 1/8 guard leaves just the right amount of stubble.</li>
            <li> The price is right.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s right - again.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After doing lots of online shopping, I decided to take the plunge on this guy (Wahl Trimmer All-In-One Lithium Ion) as the price was right - I paid $24.95 at the time from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , the price is just right.</li>
            <li> I have very little hair on top which means I need haircuts often to look nice.    </li>
            <li> Wahl replaced under warranty without receipt and I received an entirely new set which is still going strong.  </li>
            <li> The main unit gets the job done and has a decent motor, but the comb attachments, foil shaver and organizer are very cheap and don&#x27;t function well.  </li>
            <li> I works like a champ, holds an amazingly long charge and offers great control.  </li>
            <li> I keep it clean, oil after every use (after I blow it off with the air compressor-I really do this</li>
            <li> As expected, this doesn&#x27;t have the power of a corded trimmer, but is pretty good for a cordless.  </li>
            <li> The separate charger is brilliant solution to making the rechargeable battery last a long time.  </li>
            <li> It works great on long hair; I wanted to clear a spot around a cut on my leg</li>
            <li> Great trimmer so far long battery life.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s three years old now and it still works great, but I left the charger at home, and I&#x27;ve misplaced most of the attachments now after so many moves.</li>
            <li> Oh, the instruction booklet was intricately detailed on its trimming uses, but not on how to utilize the convoluted combs relative to the attachments, which no longer fit adequately nor stay in place for any of the combinations I attempt.  </li>
            <li> After 3 months I started to notice that it needed a lot more time to charge up and that it could only hold a full charge for one shave.</li>
            <li> It certainly was powerful and took a charge extremely quickly.  </li>
            <li> I will gladly put up with a little extra vibration from a great powerful motor.</li>
            <li> Use a little warm water and easy scrubbing &amp; it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> The heads switch out very easily and the attachments are simple to change as well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to snap the hair-sizing attachments on and end up with them crooked.  </li>
            <li> The blade detachment design is different, but very easy once you learn how it works...don&#x27;t fear that.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had numerous Wahl clippers over the years, this is best so far, battery charge seems to last \\&quot;forever\\&quot;, well worth the money.</li>
            <li> and although I am using the replacement, I really like this new all-in-one trimmer and will use it repeatedly for many years.</li>
            <li> It still works, but the charge is only good for one or two trimmings, so I decided to get a new one.  </li>
            <li> Even though he hasn&#x27;t tried all the various attachments yet, my husband  loved his new trimmer, which was a birthday gift.</li>
            <li> its very smart and I like it...</li>
            <li> You will be best off by buying like product at a local beauty supply brick and mortar store where you can get customer service without wasting one half of a day on phone calls and returns.</li>
            <li> The top half of the instructions tell about the warranty, things to do to keep safe, how to charge the battery and how to care for the trimmer.</li>
            <li> Cuts my super course facial hair like butta and love the barbershop chrome aesthetics.  </li>
            <li> you MIGHT be able to do one quick trim over your entire beard before the charge died.</li>
            <li> To make matters even BETTER, if you DO hit the end of your battery, charging this thing for ONE MINUTE gives you five minutes of trim time (enough to do a quick shave in a pinch).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the lithium power is really what makes it worth it, cuts quickly, and i don&#x27;t have to always keep charging</li>
            <li> One full month after that same one-hour charge mentioned above, this amazing unit is still going strong.  </li>
            <li> Very precise blade and easy to use and change out for the other extensions.</li>
            <li> The not-so-good: very loud, lots of vibration, throws hair all over the place as it cuts, very cheap plastic snap-on trimmers, limited options in terms of trim length, you need to keep the blades well oiled, not so easy to keep clean.    </li>
            <li> Worth every cent of the higher cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It worked great for that one month, but not sure what happened to make it stop working.</li>
            <li> Excellent replacement for 5 year old earlier version of the same trimmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through about five different clippers in the last six years or so, and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> I have used several different trimmers over the years, and this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> Its really amazing how long the charge lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The trimmer and accessories are great for just about any beard style, I keep mine at a medium length, just past stubble</li>
            <li> This model comes with far more attachments than most people are ever likely to use.  </li>
            <li> After around the 10th use you have to pass over your face literally 4 or more times to get all the hairs, and I barely have anything to call a beard.</li>
            <li> have only had this product for a short period of time (2 weeks), but so far I have been very impressed.</li>
            <li> The small one is great for trimming nose hairs.</li>
            <li> I take good care of my things, used on average 1.5 times a week, never dropped and I don&#x27;t travel with it.</li>
            <li> Nice trimmer with a long batter life.</li>
            <li> unit.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for a word of pure praise: Kudos to Wahl for their quickly interchangeable head system.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t &#x60;brush&#x27; the  trimmer clean as much as I should, and have oiled it once since I bought it; and it still runs like the first day I used it.  </li>
            <li> is a decent trimmer that doesn&#x27;t look or feel like cheap junk, and does exactly what I want it to do.  </li>
            <li> While we liked that Wahl is still a family-owned company, and the shaver was made in the US, the quality feels a little cheap for the price.</li>
            <li> Once you use this one you will be glad you paid a little bit more.  </li>
            <li> Great trimmer with ample power and quick long lasting charging system.</li>
            <li> Performs extremely well with exceptional battery life.</li>
            <li> I have owned many personal trimmers in the past and this one is by far the best one.</li>
            <li> What is amazing is how long a battery charge lasts: days and days!</li>
            <li> This is very lightweight but does the job faster ad better than most other trimmers.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using my new Wahl shaver/beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> The blades actually fit the model that I&#x27;ve had for years and wore out the blades and had to purchase a new clipper set.  </li>
            <li> There are accessories that are not needed for novice use I have only owned this for two months, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> It is a powerful shaver however my last trimmer did a better job of getting cleaner closer trim of my beard.  </li>
            <li> When I purchased this, I was concerned if it would be good enough to shave my head, which I do frequently.</li>
            <li> Item just as described with super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Great for facial, ear, back neck, side burn trimming.</li>
            <li> All in all this is a great product and if you take care of your personal belongings this will last you for years to come.</li>
            <li> I cleaned it up really nice, put it in a dry spot, and charged it.</li>
            <li> After a quick call to Wahl, a very helpful employee (I wish I got his name) explained the differences between the one I got and the one described in the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the battery is AMAZING, but after that you really can only use this for your beard or mustache.  </li>
            <li> Also the detachable heads fall off quite easily if you give it a smack on the side to try and clear out the hair between the blades while trimming.</li>
            <li> It has been great up until now, but am going back to a Phillips Norelco in the next month or so...</li>
            <li> Charges quickly and really holds its charge.</li>
            <li> I expect products to work properly as intended and this one greatly falls short.  </li>
            <li> I did a few tests on both the \\&quot;T-Trimmer\\&quot; included, and the regular one, and both did superbly.  </li>
            <li> It has the utilities for trimming head hair, and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s powerful enough for that.</li>
            <li> The handle tends to collect particles of cut hair, but is easy enough to clean that this is not an issue for me.</li>
            <li> Very reliable and an extremely quick charge.</li>
            <li> Charges quickly and maintains its charge very well.</li>
            <li> invest few more bucks and get something better.</li>
            <li> I actually was happy to see they still have the same model.</li>
            <li> All in all, a very handy trimmer in a small package.</li>
            <li> This really has a long lasting battery between charging and does a very good job in the power capacity to trim my beard.</li>
            <li> in all seriousness that is exactly what I use this for, slide on the 1/8 guard and you are good to go down there.</li>
            <li> I cant speak about how long it will last, but I am very happy with it, so far.</li>
            <li> If you use it daily, I am sure it needs more charging but for my usage I barely charge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great little trimmer with all the necessary addons to do some basic maintenance at a good price for li-ion.</li>
            <li> The pros include:  - Long battery life  - solid construction and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap while holding  - Good customer service.  </li>
            <li> The foil shaver is pretty good if you just want to get things looking acceptable but doesn&#x27;t get nearly as close as a razor and requires multiple passes.</li>
            <li> - The foil shaving head is great for touching up but too small for daily shaving.</li>
            <li> but in fact it is incredibly powerful, long lasting battery, and its compact size is great for traveling.</li>
            <li> Have a cheap one that is now from the dollar store 2 years old and it still cuts better&amp;#62; If I had not disposed of the packing I would have returned for a refund !</li>
            <li> We are also given a stand with the trimmer, which honestly is too small to be useful but it is a thoughtful addition.</li>
            <li> The first time trying my Norelco to see if it&#x27;d be a suitable replacement proved to be such an immediate and obvious improvement that I immediately discarded the Wahl unit and have not looked back.o settle with the results, though mostly by cleaning up the beard with a pair of scissors after.  </li>
            <li> VERY, VERY VERSITILE .</li>
            <li> I did very much like the attachment that did my mustache and edged my beard.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Recharge time is apparently very fast too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /</li>
            <li> It has a very smooth back and slices the hair off with no tug and pull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I very much disagree.  </li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> Very nice screen-shaver (screen shavers only work with short stubble).</li>
            <li> It does a very capable job of trimming.</li>
            <li> (I know - gross) is very important to me.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how long it lasted and it kept good power right up until the end.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it for that special dad  for father&#x27;s day.</li>
            <li> The blades all seem well made, they seem to be more precise than the others I have used from other makers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seems to be working fine now--I guess it just needed a complete charge__</li>
            <li> I feel this trimmer is more comfortable than all other trimmers  </li>
            <li> It comes with my many attachments, but like other reviewers, i find them cheap and</li>
            <li> Sharp blades and good power, with a ton of adapters gets a very even trim every time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this Trimmer for the past 4 years and the fact that is charges so quickly ans lasts so long makes it an excellent choice.</li>
            <li> It worked nicely, and this unit was EXTREMELY well cared-for, but: today, while I was using it, there was a distinct slowing of the motor and the thing died.  </li>
            <li> Works great but price was a little high.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Powerful, VERY long battery life - 4 months of 1-2 uses a week on one charge, light and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was originally planning to replace the battery and blades, but that would have been two-thirds the cost of a new one.  </li>
            <li> It was quick and easy to give him a short even cut using the comb attachment.  </li>
            <li> The main trimmer head comes with far too many attachments IMHO, and I don&#x27;t say that just because in mine all of the plastic attachments displayed in the box window were duplicated inside.  </li>
            <li> Being the kind of guy that goes through phases of not wanting a clean shave all of the time, I have purchased and used quite a few trimmers over the years to keep my stubble neat.</li>
            <li> a full shave after only a quick, 3-minute charge?!</li>
            <li> a full shave after only a quick, 3-minute charge?!</li>
            <li> , my beard hair tends to stick to the black part of the handle, doesn&#x27;t clean off very easily.  </li>
            <li> * Back to the tray, I think the new design is much, much better (Kudos WAHL!).  </li>
            <li> * Back to the tray, I think the new design is much, much better (Kudos WAHL!).  </li>
            <li> The smaller razor attachment is great for the ears and will fit a little inside the ear.</li>
            <li> I could of kept it seeing as how even in its &amp;#34;broken&amp;#34; state it worked better than most other trimmers but decided to get a new one.</li>
            <li> With very little practice and experimentation, I was achieving perfectly even trims at exactly the lengths I wanted (with different lengths for my beard along my chin and cheeks and for my mustache).    </li>
            <li> Light, easy to maneuver and battery lasts a VERY long time before recharge!</li>
            <li> The battery life is amazing (curious how battery life is the biggest thing touted on this -</li>
            <li> The comb rusted after the first use and</li>
            <li> This the trimmer attachment starts rusting after the first use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am aware that these devices are designed to be disposable and after about a year</li>
            <li> love the power of the razor and the lithium battery provides for weeks of daily use without recharging.</li>
            <li> I mostly use it without the attachments so that is not a big deal to me.</li>
            <li> I charged this one the first time and did not have to charge it again for 9 months.  </li>
            <li> Anyways, it was alright the first couple of weeks</li>
            <li> This Wahl uses Li-ion, besides being lightweight, is more powerful, lasts a long time between charges, and charges quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Already it won&#x27;t hold enough charge to operate for more than 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> I purchased my first unit in september</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I was instantly showing a lot more lip than I had planned on.</li>
            <li> Battery life is outstanding, and what puts it above everything else.</li>
            <li> So we had to purchase the whole kit and caboddle!  </li>
            <li> Hats off to Wahl for developing the first Lithium Ion Trimmer.  </li>
            <li> It pretty much rattles and vibrates but not much cutting.    </li>
            <li> Will it last for a year or more?</li>
            <li> POWERFUL, ULTRA FAST CHARGING, PLENTY OF TRIMMER LENGTHS, SHAVER FOILS etc, NEVER NICKED ME ONCE...</li>
            <li> I tried to turn it on out of curiosity and sure it enough it worked!</li>
            <li> The shaver attachment is useless on my face, YMMV but the beard and hair trimmers are perfect.    </li>
            <li> I purchased the first one for my son.  </li>
            <li> but why am I bothering with this in the first place?  </li>
            <li> It cuts through hair like a hot knife through butter.  </li>
            <li> This was a replacement for another beard trimmer that I had used for more than ten years.</li>
            <li> This thing is not made with staleness steel and got rusted just after the first wash.</li>
            <li> First one never worked and was returned.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Has attachments I&#x27;ll personally never use (maybe) but better to have more than not enough</li>
            <li> Over the last two months I noticed I was charging it more since it wouldn&#x27;t even turn on.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a personal grooming set, this would probably be ok, but if you&#x27;re looking for an all-in-one trimmer set that you can use for haircutting, you should probably look at something else.</li>
            <li> I bought it more than a year ago to replace two different razor sets.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about how wonderful this set is compared to others I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just funny</li>
            <li> It is so much better than the cheaper consumer brands I have owned, such as Conair and Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> not sorry at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even been able to use this for (short) hair cuts.</li>
            <li> The first thing he asked me was, &amp;#34;You know that trimmer</li>
            <li> Higher quality materials would have made this a 5 star product.</li>
            <li> This is my first beard trimmer</li>
            <li> THE FIRST TIME.  </li>
            <li> the first two I owned each lasted two years to the month then just stopped working.  </li>
            <li> I bought a Remington trimmer after my first Wahl and it broke in about two months...</li>
            <li> That was thoughtless of me, not taking into account any of the realities of doing business, even when supporting your products.</li>
            <li> The first thing that you notice is that the supplied stand is not a charging stand.</li>
            <li> but I nicked my face 3X on my first use.</li>
            <li> Until the first curve.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> First off...</li>
            <li> People, be aware of \\&quot;Vine Program\\&quot; reviewers.  </li>
            <li> This is the first trimmer I&#x27;ve owned</li>
            <li> overall I am satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> Of course it is Made in USA so it is considerably better quality than its chinese competitors.  </li>
            <li> First, I would like to point out</li>
            <li> First one lasted me about 8 years before the battery died.</li>
            <li> I wanted to make sure my next trimmer was a wahl since they are known for their quality.  </li>
            <li> Used it for the first time today.</li>
            <li> The various attachments ensure that you have the appropriate tool for any trimming job you may come across.</li>
            <li> Comes with many attachments, but you&#x27;ll only end up using two or three, over and over again.  </li>
            <li> As far as trimming goes, it does a fabulous job.  </li>
            <li> My first one lasted over eight years with weekly go-tee &amp; side-burn trimming use.  </li>
            <li> This one is light years ahead of my 8 year old model.  </li>
            <li> I am still on my first charge of the unit.</li>
            <li> a company representative admitted that the battery&#x27;s \\&quot;smart-chip\\&quot; -tasked with overcharge prevention- may also prevent any charge at all if the unit is left plugged in for more than 3 hours.</li>
            <li> a company representative admitted that the battery&#x27;s \\&quot;smart-chip\\&quot; -tasked with overcharge prevention- may also prevent any charge at all if the unit is left plugged in for more than 3 hours.</li>
            <li> I bought the Wahl in the first week of June and after about 2-3 uses per week, I have yet to charge it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of personal groomers and this has remained my favorite.</li>
            <li> Amazon wouldn&#x27;t post my first comment, so let me try again.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The storage is one of the great features, at least in my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The storage is one of the great features, at least in my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First, i was amazed at the number of attachments included in the set.</li>
            <li> Many different attachments.  </li>
            <li> The rubberized grip is a nice feature, even with wet hands.   </li>
            <li> I was already sold on Wahl based on the quality of my first one, but leaped at the opportunity to purchase Lithium-Ion technology based on my 30-years&#x27; experience with battery-powered hand tools and the evolution of battery technology in them.  </li>
            <li> Lithium-Ion is the current state of the art for most consumer-level products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> opened the box, read the instructions, and gave the unit its recommended 1 hour charge before first use.  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what I need it to do.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer because my former trimmer, also a Wahl, no longer held a charge after many years of faithful service.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a cheaper Remington model on which the guard I use most frequently finally broke.</li>
            <li> Many different attachments and length guards.</li>
            <li> First impression:  </li>
            <li> First week, I had to request a refund, it just stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> More for facial than hair cuts.</li>
            <li> More maintenance is required for the blade that regular trimmers.</li>
            <li> At first it was a pain switching combs.</li>
            <li> this is the best wahl shaver i&#x27;ve used for my face in the past ten years.</li>
            <li> Honestly, those six parts seem redundant with the 6-position trimming guide, or are for people as fussy as professional beard stylists... who would undoubtably use better equipment.</li>
            <li> but there are too many attachments or not enough room for all of them</li>
            <li> Worked well when I first tried it out.</li>
            <li> Initially, I had gotten this Trimmer after reading a glowing review by an outlet(I don&#x27;t remember the name of the site) that stated that out of all the trimmers they had tried, this was the most consistent.</li>
            <li> That is unfortunately not the case.</li>
            <li> First, there is no storage tray as shown in the picture.  </li>
            <li> Because beard grooming is the most desirable part of mens personality and this product simply makes your life easier.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first one was almost identical to this one.  </li>
            <li> I wind up pulling the head off first before I get the guide off.</li>
            <li> This is my first trimmer, and it does the job.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> First review:</li>
            <li> I have had many trimmers in my day and this is the only one that I feel isn&#x27;t underpowered.</li>
            <li> Broke after first shave.</li>
            <li> Within the first year a blade broke.</li>
            <li> The first one I bought at Wal-Mart 5 years ago.  </li>
            <li> pretty well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It served me for more than five years, and did a hell of a job trimming back a beard.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although it can&#x27;t get quite as close to my face as the Remington did in its prime, it gets close enough to give me a &amp;#34;I shaved 12 hours ago&amp;#34; look, which I find is acceptable in most realities nowadays.</li>
            <li> No warning no weird sounds just turned the power button on and nothing.</li>
            <li> I had to recharge it for a while first.</li>
            <li> That one use I got out of it was pretty stellar though.</li>
            <li> This is my first trimmer</li>
            <li> I love that it has several guards.</li>
            <li> Most recent one lasted 15 months.</li>
            <li> This is my first beard and thus my first beard trimmer</li>
            <li> the first time I tried using it</li>
            <li> The switch, I&#x27;m assuming, crapped out in the first three months.  </li>
            <li> But I figured it could be a simple project that keeps me from having to spend more money on a replacement or dealing with the warranty (which was probably out now that I had taken it apart).    </li>
            <li> During its first charge it&#x27;s going to sit somewhere fire-resistant just in case.    </li>
            <li> so I can trim more often than having to get out a case from under the sink, plug it in, wrap it back up in the case and stow it away.</li>
            <li> This trimmer stopped charging in first week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be the first to admit, I ask a lot from any trimmer I purchase.  </li>
            <li> First the battery started dying quicker and quicker.  </li>
            <li> I wish they&#x27;d unbundled most of them into an optional expanded attachments set, because the only attachment I want or need is the adjustable depth trimmer guide.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Has many accessories for all your possible needs</li>
            <li> The first one I must have thrown away as I could not find it.  </li>
            <li> And if you are interested in your manscaping as well as giving yourself a haircut then this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> I charged it per the instructions when it first arrived and haven&#x27;t had to charge it again once since then (about a month as of this writing).  </li>
            <li> I charged it per the instructions when it first arrived and haven&#x27;t had to charge it again once since then (about a month as of this writing).  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Broke sometime after I used it the first time I guess, just went to shave and nothing happened.</li>
            <li> I have only used this trimmer three times now, but I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> I only had to charge it once a week at the most.</li>
            <li> but you have to look closely to be sure they&#x27;re properly seated.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my first beard/mustache trimmer</li>
            <li> The larger blade could do it, but I feel like I have more control.</li>
            <li> and I was able to get the same product.</li>
            <li> but I definitely wont buy any more of their products.</li>
            <li> To ensure this never happened again I coated all the metal contacts with hot glue to keep out the water.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer worked well for the first 6 months</li>
            <li> The battery does not stay charged for more than an hour (of non-use) and in the last three days the unit has stopped responding to the On/Off button.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly what he needed, and he seemed to like it.  </li>
            <li> it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The battery in my first trimmer would not hold a charge, but Amazon replaced it promptly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is there are to many attachments.  </li>
            <li> This is the first trimmer I have ever bought where this is not the case.</li>
            <li> This is my secong Wahl trimmer, because my first trimmer went out because I shaved feces off my dog&#x27;s butt</li>
            <li> To first put things in context I don&#x27;t use this trimmer as an \\&quot;all-in-one\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> The product is exactly as discribed.</li>
            <li> is it cuts hair pretty close to the skin.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m pleased though.</li>
            <li> The first one was a Wahl that looked just like this.</li>
            <li> So many attachment that I actually read the instructor manual....</li>
            <li> I bought my trimmer back in October and use 2-3 times a week and love it.</li>
            <li> I just had to charge it for the first time.  </li>
            <li> Should be the first thing a man buys himself.</li>
            <li> Now i have to pay for an accessory it should have had in the first place.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t needed a charge since the first.</li>
            <li> It worked well the first year, but I won&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> My husband got one first.  </li>
            <li> More than enough attachments for every need.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Accidentally I broke the first one during a trip and I didn´t hesitate to have it again ASAP.</li>
            <li> The first lasted about 5 years</li>
            <li> After having a Wahl for many years, I decided that we would go with another one when his first finally quit working.</li>
            <li> First off I don&#x27;t have anything against Wahl.</li>
            <li> Love the battery life, I only have charged it once.</li>
            <li> I estimate that I have now enjoyed 30+ shaves without a recharge, with each shave lasting about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I contacted Wahl and they weren&#x27;t interested.</li>
            <li> I have had it for a couple weeks now and is still on its first charge.  </li>
            <li> the blade was rusty literally within the first 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> While this isn&#x27;t a completely skin smooth shave</li>
            <li> it did the first time I used it</li>
            <li> hot glued to something, it&#x27;s going to go scattering the moment you try to place something in it and the amount of attachments are stupefying.  </li>
            <li> I have owned several wahl trimmers and I am always satisfied with the performance and durability of their products.</li>
            <li> Once we get the replacement I will update my rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Second trimmer has been much better.</li>
            <li> He has coarse beard hair and wears a beard or a goatee most of the time.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pull the hair even after it gets hot.</li>
            <li> We find them to be pretty quiet,and do the job with ease.</li>
            <li> The type is smaller that that used on the safety instructions on the top panel</li>
            <li> I was inconvenienced and couldn&#x27;t use it in the shower, but this was my first WAHL</li>
            <li> The blades move faster, are smaller and cut much better.</li>
            <li> It gives like a day 4 stubble, where as i prefer it to be a bit more short.</li>
            <li> I recommend moving the shaver in the opposite direction of the hair growth for a better stubble</li>
            <li> Too much work!  </li>
            <li> Very solid value, but certainly more for light/medium tasks.</li>
            <li> Started having difficulty with the switch within the first month or so.. it now will not work at all..  </li>
            <li> All In One Trimmers (9854-600) as gifts…Recipients were pleased with the trimmers, overall quality, all of the attachments, and the battery life.</li>
            <li> Le complaints of this exact problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> More than enough power to manscape.</li>
            <li> and it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m pretty pleased with the overall battery life.</li>
            <li> But, this brings me to my first issue.</li>
            <li> I actually was not expecting to be so satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I am an avid Amazon.com customer</li>
            <li> The charge lasts a long time and it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The cleaner &amp; lubricated you keep it, the better &amp; longer it will last.</li>
            <li> : Loud, cheap material, broke after 5 or 6 uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After several weeks of use I am so pleased with this trimmer.</li>
            <li> The trimmer was a good value with many attachments, but it is not ideal for edging/shaping.</li>
            <li> After using a couple of times I wasn&#x27;t satisfied, so I took it to my barber and to get his opinion, or some pointers (maybe I wasn&#x27;t using it properly).  </li>
            <li> This is light trim, no heavy duty stuff here..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for 2 or 3 weeks now, and still running off of the first charge.</li>
            <li> I had to return the first one after a week, because it died.</li>
            <li> They really last and do well in many ways.</li>
            <li> the charge last thru several trims and is easy on the skin trims close and the attachment work really well, easy to use and easy to change attaments</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I imagine most people looking to buy this would be looking to use it regularly.  </li>
            <li> charge has never failed while using it.</li>
            <li> standard blade and small detail blade are excellent though with a close cut (as close as a trimmer like this can get anyway) and no snagging or nicks to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We are not sorry.  </li>
            <li> A piece broke off the first week of having the product.</li>
            <li> Had the first one for about 5 yrs</li>
            <li> The first time you charge, they recommend charging for 1 hour.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> First, the stand that this comes with is a joke.</li>
            <li> This will be my first review ever on Amazon.</li>
            <li> First off, I was looking to replace my Remington Trimmer which was a piece of trash and for the strangest reason I stuck with it for like 2yrs.</li>
            <li> the first 4 times.</li>
            <li> The accessories are one too many for the same application.</li>
            <li> Overall 3 stars mostly for the lithium battery.</li>
            <li> First off, I&#x27;ll tell you what I use it for:</li>
            <li> but, this one is so much better and such a closer shave.</li>
            <li> The electric-razor attachment seems to work pretty s***tily</li>
            <li> I bought mine 14 months ago (my first Wahl product and my first trimmer ever), and have used it about once a month since then, sometimes twice.</li>
            <li> first anyway.  </li>
            <li> First is that the cut hair seems to stick to the surface of the trimmer.  </li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> First of all let me start by saying that the price is unbeatable, how did I pay under $50 for this?</li>
            <li> I love this company and the quality can&#x27;t be beat, God Bless the USA and American manufacturers like Wahl!</li>
            <li> I have used Wahl for years and was pleased with my last trimmer.</li>
            <li> Has a lot more power than the standard Ni-cad on.</li>
            <li> Bought it when I first heard about the lithium-ion batteries.  </li>
            <li> Since my first charge, I have not charged it once, nor have I noticed the need to charge it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried over several hours and made sure all connections are correct but:</li>
            <li> I will first say that, performance-wise, this is a 5-star trimmer.</li>
            <li> Wahl narrow blade head not as good for faster trims.</li>
            <li> I have full thick beard and keep it fairly</li>
            <li> The battery is good for just a few minutes</li>
            <li> As someone else noted, the grip handle is incredibly good at hanging onto hair clippings, but it&#x27;s not a huge problem.</li>
            <li> I initially replaced this with the previously mentioned Remington (which wasn&#x27;t very good).</li>
            <li> Switched to the norelco vacuum trimmer and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> The trimmer should have no trouble charging the new battery, as I made sure to splurge on a \\&quot;protected\\&quot; one which should prevent any over-charging or over-draining.</li>
            <li> This thing is very powerful, and loud when the battery is fully charged.  </li>
            <li> It is very useful for people with a busy schedule.</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these 2 years ago that got dropped in a toilet (and fortunately it was clean</li>
            <li> It cuts great, but I was surprised to find the rubber separated from the chrome part of the unit in less than a year.  </li>
            <li> Works very well, easy to maintain, complete, reliable.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s fine (but the point is to be smooth, too, right?)  </li>
            <li> wow!!!!  </li>
            <li> Instructions could be better, there is one adjustable attachment that so far I haven&#x27;t been able to adjust due to fear of breaking it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also worth noting that this trimmer is easy to clean compared to other clippers that I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I see a lot of rave reviews about the power of the battery on this, and yes that is true when the unit is new.  </li>
            <li> That 6-position trimmer attachment is what I use, and it&#x27;s fine, though adjusting it&#x27;s height requires a little more effort than it should.    </li>
            <li> It is a great little trimmer and this version is slimmer, more solid and better looking than the previous model.  </li>
            <li> These guys need to get together with some Italian and Japanese designers and make this basic motor a more versatile and more easily handling &amp;#34;All in One&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> positive first</li>
            <li> It was so sharp and everything that comes with it is amazing.</li>
            <li> To fix that, make sure you lay it flat when trimming.  </li>
            <li> The attachments don&#x27;t pinch or poke my skin and the blade is sharp, keeping everything nice and even.</li>
            <li> The Shaver attachment is useless for the most part, the detail attachment works pretty good also.</li>
            <li> + yr&#x27;s as I&#x27;m a former long distance cyclist, &amp; you learn quickly that that area is better off smooth for cycling purposes.</li>
            <li> Ended up ordering a new battery for my Norelco 7775x and figuring out how to solder since that device works as I expect (the trimmer attachment) and is waterproof, has a charge indicator and is much easier to clean.</li>
            <li> This new one cuts much better than the old one ever did, and a battery charge lasts much longer.</li>
            <li> Another great thing about it is the ability to be able to see where I&#x27;m cutting.</li>
            <li> Great product -- the extra wide trimmer helps keep those sideburns in check with one pass.</li>
            <li> trimmer is great for keeping your facial hair neatly trimmed and if you&#x27;re used to having a military style haircut</li>
            <li> It has a powerful motor, a battery that stores a decent about of charge and loads of accessories (16).     </li>
            <li> and I love the convenience of being able to shave in less than 5 minutes instead of having to plug in my bulky old clippers.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is great but the shaver in the kit was less than usless it dosent really shave or anything it took about 10 min to \\&quot;Shave\\&quot; about a inch of facial hair,but lucky for me</li>
            <li> Makes a clean cut for the 19 yr old son.</li>
            <li> Better change you warranty to 1 year, because your product often fails to even meet that!io that had a 1-year warranty has been going strong for more than 10 years.    </li>
            <li> really like this trimmer and the attachments that come with it, as can be evidenced by the fact that I bought a second one :)  </li>
            <li> really like this trimmer and the attachments that come with it, as can be evidenced by the fact that I bought a second one :)  </li>
            <li> Cons:  Really the same cons as most clippers.  </li>
            <li> CHEAP - looks like they could make bases that are truly meant to last, and be useful.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is really a cut above all the rest, and I&#x27;m so glad I found it 5 months ago.</li>
            <li> The charge on this trimmer is impressive, seems to last at least a month.</li>
            <li> The foil shaver attachment could be better, but overall I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li> Prior to this, I had big corded Wahl clippers that lasted 10+ years before they broke, so I had a good impression of their products.</li>
            <li> The trimmer has plenty of accessories to cover multiple uses, and the shaving attachment actually works surprisingly well.</li>
            <li> : This is the major selling point; I fully charged it when I received it and have been using it off and on over the last two months ON THE VERY FIRST CHARGE, and it is still going strong!  </li>
            <li> So, for a much cheaper price, this does fine, just takes a little more time.  </li>
            <li> with cordless circular saws, cordless weed eaters, cordless vacuum&#x27;s, its probably better to just get the corded version unless you &#x27;really&#x27; need that feature.  </li>
            <li> However, Wahl has revealed itself to be a very consumer &amp; environmentally unfriendly company with this design, as most folks will simply send a good piece of machinery, &amp; a used up Li-Ion battery along with it, to their local landfill, simply because it needs a new battery!!</li>
            <li> The price for the kit was very reasonable and the delivery was fast.  </li>
            <li> , 90% of the men simply go around straight to Raser without thinking its better to first remove it with a trimmer and then use raser.. because using raser straight on a dense shave will not leave your skin with any goodness..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through many sets of clippers in the past 20 years and these are actually the BEST I&#x27;ve ever owned, probably by a wide margin.  </li>
            <li> The thing comes with tons of little add-on bits and bob, and they don&#x27;t really seems to fit into the stand in any coherent way.  </li>
            <li> For just a little bit more the Wahl  lithium ion trimmer is far better.</li>
            <li> Very powerful, long lasting charge, the multitude of interchangeable heads is quite nice and the whole trimmer feels sturdy and well built.</li>
            <li> Second, it gets hot very quickly (yes, I used blade oil).  </li>
            <li> They also say &amp;#34;Do not use the trimmer while it is charging.&amp;#34;  It only takes 1 minute for a Quick Charge to provide 5 minutes&#x27; use, they say, or 60 for a full charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> the thing that has the screens over the blades like a typical electric razor, its not really wide, but when i&#x27;m just doing my neck its great.  </li>
            <li> I see a lot of positive reviews</li>
            <li> I dont know what you guys are all positive about ?  </li>
            <li> It is competitively priced and has lots of positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Otherwise great, torque and battery life especially, and better than the several Norelco units I&#x27;ve had previously.</li>
            <li> This is a very powerful trimmer, but it has a major flaw in the design.</li>
            <li> Not a good showing for build quality, but the rest of the kit is great</li>
            <li> It make short work of the job, needs recharging only once a year, is more reliable than the Norelcos I have had, and is quite comfortable to use --</li>
            <li> The shaver attachment did not shave very well the first time I use dit.  </li>
            <li> More powerful than the plug-in versions from other manufacturers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Apart from this, the rest of my review remains pretty much in tact...</li>
            <li> As long as it&#x27;s charged (which it always is) who takes more than maybe two clips?</li>
            <li> Love the lithium battery too, lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Pretty much the two things I have learned over the years to *</li>
            <li> Only appropriate for light body hair &amp; facial sculpting.</li>
            <li> Pretty much stuck w/them now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m bald (most of the time) and use this a lot when my hair gets to long</li>
            <li> tray sucks, its way too light and cheap, i couldn&#x27;t even figure out how all the pieces were suppose to fit in it.</li>
            <li> At first this bothered me a lot, even though I appreciated the safety value of the sticky handle.</li>
            <li> At first, it worked really well</li>
            <li> I have only used the regular trimmer and the t-trimmer so far, but everything is working great.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight, but you can really feel the power the first time you shave.  </li>
            <li> thankfully i was able to shave to my satisfaction before the charge died, which wasn&#x27;t long at all.  </li>
            <li> Once I managed to attach a beard guide (not my first choice but the first one I was able to attach after three or four tries) and began shaving I noticed that the trimmed hairs stuck to the body of the unit.  </li>
            <li> I have had Wahl products in the past with good results.</li>
            <li> This is far superior to other trimmers.</li>
            <li> I got lazy and buzzed a good chunk of my goatee out with it by accident, but that was my fault.  </li>
            <li> The foil shaver head is small also, but works good for a foil shaver.  </li>
            <li> The small size makes it good for travel.</li>
            <li> It also comes with a junky miniature comb, a good cleaning brush and a small amount of oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , if you can get past that, for the money, it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> This is a fine product that works very well and has many different options and attachments to multiply its versatility.  </li>
            <li> Then bought this exact prodduct with a lithium battery which worked on an initial test, just running it but not using it, which worked fine.  </li>
            <li> It worked fine for the first month and then suddenly would not hold a charge.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure it would be easy to use and work well at first, came with lots of attachments and seemed confusing.</li>
            <li> The other reviews are right, I&#x27;m glad I trusted them.  </li>
            <li> In fact, despite offering a more consistent beard trimming experience, it actually takes more passes over my head to get the hair down to that afore-mentioned stubble.</li>
            <li> I originally didn&#x27;t think this was built any better than competing products but after more time I was proven wrong.</li>
            <li> I think this is definitely worth more $ so long as it stays alive!</li>
            <li> so well I kept it for detail dog grooming and bought my husband a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Trimmer has a very powerful motor, But there were only 3 depth attachments, which are only good for short buzz cuts.</li>
            <li> The Remington has only one guide and an easy to use thumb wheel to adjust the length.  </li>
            <li> Personally, I find that a mute point, as it&#x27;s easy to wipe them off by hand or with a towel.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a lot of power and easily handles the basic trimming operations I use it for.</li>
            <li> The attachments are easy to interchange and simply snap on and off.</li>
            <li> The metal blades rust easily even though they were never exposed to water, only to sweat.  </li>
            <li> I bought this back in January and have yet to find an easy, reliable way to change the heads or settings.  </li>
            <li> The clipper is easy to handle and has a lot of different attachments.</li>
            <li> I find it kind of odd to have to guide the wire and plug it in separately.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find it kind of odd to have to guide the wire and plug it in separately.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The various tools are fairly easy to change, once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleaning is easy but not easier than cleaning a regular razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are several trimming heads that easily swap out.</li>
            <li> Lightweight, easy to use, battery strong enough to allow periodic use when traveling without constant charging.  </li>
            <li> I have had another batter powered trimmer for about a year, which was cheaper, and much less effective.</li>
            <li> and it comes off easy enough.</li>
            <li> I like how you can easily change from one head to the next.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me who have this super sensitive skin and can&#x27;t shave with no type of razor</li>
            <li> It is a bit loud, particularly when you&#x27;re near (or in) your ears, but it&#x27;s not terrible.</li>
            <li> Basic and easy.</li>
            <li> It cuts and trims just like its big brother, if you trim your own hair or keep it bare, this is the item for you.</li>
            <li> As long as the person using it knows basic haircutting techniques, then your hair looks good without the expense of a salon hair stylist.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend the Wahl L/I Trimmer for your personal use or as a gift.</li>
            <li> The core unit is strong and solid in the hand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only charged it once and the motor still seems strong.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise this is a good buy for shorter beards/mustaches as there are no attachments for long facial hair.</li>
            <li> Strong motor,  fairly quiet operation.  </li>
            <li> The shaver does a good job but dosent stay charged long enough for me to finish.</li>
            <li> Good trimmer, long lasting with no problems.</li>
            <li> I promptly charged its battery, as directed, and it is still going strong two weeks later!  </li>
            <li> Look elsewhere; this is low quality junk diminishing the strong Wahl brand.  </li>
            <li> This one is a good basic trimmer as long as you take care of it</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous about this purchase as someone I know had a Wahl trimmer that they were less than impressed with.  </li>
            <li> I was not disappointed with my choice, the battery seems to be better than the original, at least as far as I can remember!</li>
            <li> About 10 months after I purchased it, the trimmer started dying before I was able to finish a single trim.  </li>
            <li> He has told me that the large trimmer attachment does well with his manscaping, while the medium attachment does well with face and neck.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The nose hair trimmer I found to be a bit large</li>
            <li> They might as well have just made it out of pure glue</li>
            <li> This item has certainly met my expectations.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to replace one of the large corded Wahl units.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would certainly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> There are two comb attachments for trimming hair to a certain height.</li>
            <li> pulls from time to time, but the reviews were largely correct</li>
            <li> certainly recommend this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer comes with a large selection of adapters.</li>
            <li> Other than that, quick easy changes from trimmer head to trimmer head.</li>
            <li> On a positive note, it trimmed really well while it worked.</li>
            <li> At that point, you are left with a clipper that is very powerful, does exactly what you need it to do, and doesn&#x27;t require a cord.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As long as you aren&#x27;t the type of guy who HAS to shave with a regular razor in order to not have scruff, the Wahl should fit most, if not all of your needs.</li>
            <li> It runs around 1/4 of the original speed and barely cuts hair at all anymore</li>
            <li> &quot; allow you to keep the length nice and even in depth, and the actual shaver head isn&#x27;t too bad either, although I use a safety razor for that, since one has to come right up to the Van Dyke to keep a clean edge, and most electric razors won&#x27;t get that task done easily.  </li>
            <li> Eg, more than 50% of the cost to buy an entire new unit.  </li>
            <li> I recently bought a new shaver (made by phillips) and it is 10x better than this electric paper weight.</li>
            <li> After my last Wahl shaver decided to give it up after a very very long time, it was time and it was more cost effective to buy a new Wahl vs getting the elderly model fixed.</li>
            <li> At first it worked fine, 3-4 weeks later it only worked if it was plugged in, then 3-4 more weeks it completely stopped working</li>
            <li> black handle is a soft, rubbery material which is good to hold onto.</li>
            <li> The lithium Ion allows me to use this trimmer for 5-10 minutes every morning for more than a week in between charges, AND the motor does not become noticeably less powerful as the charge goes</li>
            <li> This set is nice for the price and what you get, but the blade does not cut down close enough to your skin and does not leave your skin smooth (i.e., you get stubbles).</li>
            <li> (right after Christmas because Santa forgot to bring me a new trimmer).</li>
            <li> Other than that, offers plenty of attachments, easy to use, and easy to change those attachements.</li>
            <li> (I found this unit advertised at a large electronics superstore for just under $20 after buying my 4th all-in-one cordless trimmer from a large deparment store that has a 110% price guaranty, so I really found a bargain).   </li>
            <li> It is very sharp and seems to do a good job, although a bit narrow for top head hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The littlest one is the right size to go around the ears and catch the stray hairs on the top of my head without creating big bare rectangles if I accidentally touch the skin.  </li>
            <li> When it worked as new, it was very powerful but extremely loud.</li>
            <li> The upside would be that it worked pretty well for the price at first, it was better than a similiar $30-40 trimmer from another brand that I&#x27;d previously purchased(that one also quit working in under a year).</li>
            <li> There must have been a short circuit or something because the unit has worked fine ever since.</li>
            <li> I have taken this one along to places where recharging was not an option, and if worked fine for several beard trims and even touch-up haircuts.</li>
            <li> Too many parts, no decent storage, incnvenient o change heads.    </li>
            <li> The 3rd one seems to work fine.  </li>
            <li> They still work fine, but look kinda gross.</li>
            <li> I only use 2 of the attachments and both work fine.  </li>
            <li> that, I love it, compared to multiple previous trimmers, mostly Wahl:  PROS:</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty picky and use it alot, about once a week, and i&#x27;ve been through many other types.</li>
            <li> He loves the attachments included and it holds a decent charge!</li>
            <li> The biggest advancement over older Wahl models is the Li-ion battery!</li>
            <li> It was decent for the first month.  </li>
            <li> I had to used it to shave when my main clippers broke and it has done the job pretty well with zero skin irritation.</li>
            <li> Mine held its first charge decently well, through probably 5 or 6 shaves</li>
            <li> I dont really recommend it due to inconvenience, because for the price you should be able to easily just pop one head unit off and a new one on.&lt;br /&gt;otherwise, this trimmer loud, which is fine with me, and it definitely cuts hair.</li>
            <li> The swap seems well-controlled, the pieces fit tight without anything feeling cheap or flimsy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Though made specifically for men, a little experimenting convinced me that parts of the system can be used effectively for women&#x27;s grooming too.</li>
            <li> but honestly I have so little faith in this product and this company I don&#x27;t think I would take a replacement at any price.</li>
            <li> The nose trimmer is much too large to fit comfortably in a nostril, and - though it has seven guide attachments in total -- there are no guide attachments for use on eyebrows (only a hand-held comb, which is easy to move).</li>
            <li> When I first saw this product I had high expectations and maybe that&#x27;s my fault,</li>
            <li> The only good thing I have to say about it is the blades are sharp, and as long as you don&#x27;t want to use the adjustable trimmer, you should be able to suffer through it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, that attachment isn&#x27;t very good at all.</li>
            <li> I almost didn&#x27;t buy this trimmer because of the large number of negative reviews, but took a shot anyway based on the good reviews.</li>
            <li> It is the most powerful rechargable trimmer I have ever had and charges in as little as an hour.</li>
            <li> it being a little more powerful.  </li>
            <li> This little trimmer cuts through the scraggle smoothly and comfortably with the wider trimmer blade.</li>
            <li> Wahl is perfect for cleaning up, trimming, and the little touch-ups I have to do every few days or so to keep from looking like a bum.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer is so good I hardly need my razor anymore.  </li>
            <li> and i get a good trim in those hard to get areas</li>
            <li> The spacer attachments for trimming beard/mustache length seem to grab hair quite a bit, I need some more time to mess with them, if I can&#x27;t fix that I&#x27;ll be using my old vacuum trimmer to occasionally trim length, but will still be keeping this for shaping as it works great.</li>
            <li> right there whenever you need them - otherwise I would not clean and oil it as often as I should:)    </li>
            <li> Working great as a trimmer - I&#x27;ve had it a few months and only charged once.</li>
            <li> We all have cameras on our phone and taking and providing an accurate picture is very simple.</li>
            <li> it should have a light, something, an indicator of how much charge is left.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my beard because of the advertised attachments but it only has one reasonable attachment for that and the attachment doesn&#x27;t fit the clipper.</li>
            <li> Works great, I only use a few of the attachments</li>
            <li> I put the larger trimmer attachement along with the accompaning guards to trim body hair and even give a few hair cuts with great results.  </li>
            <li> I took it few months ago and it works great with even occasional charging.</li>
            <li> get very close unless you really PUSH it into your face).</li>
            <li> so really you have to plug the cable in while the trimmer is out of the stand and then set it in after.  </li>
            <li> I dont use these clippers very often; maybe once in 2 weeks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair got caught between the plastic attachment and blade and pulls just as much hair out as it cuts.</li>
            <li> very time consuming.</li>
            <li> Maybe instead of a flimsy plastic tray filled with junk accessories they could have spent the money to make a more solid product.</li>
            <li> The blades are incredibly precise and are reminiscent of a bygone era.</li>
            <li> The attachments and stand work very well and are well designed.</li>
            <li> The nose/ear/eyebrow attachment works very well and</li>
            <li> Not so much for shaving, before work.&lt;br /&gt;-  </li>
            <li> About 6 months ago, I started noticing that the battery wasn&#x27;t holding as much of a charge as it used to.</li>
            <li> I had to ding 1 star on this one, the shaving attachment really doesn&#x27;t work that well at all.</li>
            <li> I definitely expected more from the Wahl brand.</li>
            <li> I also found cleaning the accessories and blades to be a pain, hair seems to really find a way to get tucked in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Without sounding like too much of an ad for Norelco, the Norelco guards and blades on my current unit very simply and easily provide the clean, even trimming that I had been struggling to get with the Wahl unit.  </li>
            <li> Without sounding like too much of an ad for Norelco, the Norelco guards and blades on my current unit very simply and easily provide the clean, even trimming that I had been struggling to get with the Wahl unit.  </li>
            <li> Hair clipper is very narrow.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> My husband dislikes it so much that I am looking for a replacement for him</li>
            <li> Made very cheaper.</li>
            <li> you really don&#x27;t know what goes where</li>
            <li> It retains charge very well.  </li>
            <li> (Thanks BTW)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about this product is the cheap case used to hold all the attachments and accessories.</li>
            <li> The tray gets really crowded, so I&#x27;ve take some of the attachments I&#x27;m never going to use and put them in a drawer.</li>
            <li> If this trimmer can deal with my whole body in one charge...it can handle anyones.</li>
            <li> Much easier to use  UPDATE:  </li>
            <li> I bought this ONE MONTH ago and it works well, very well.</li>
            <li> Really pisses me off b/c</li>
            <li> I will have to take the item to a service center more than 50 miles away.</li>
            <li> I really had no problem with this trimmer/razor until it just died..</li>
            <li> When it was working it did very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, I really need the foil shaver head to work.</li>
            <li> and then if I went to fast.</li>
            <li> I recommend this trimmer for it&#x27;s ease of use, variety of specialty attachments that snap on and off and for it&#x27;s superb cutting power.</li>
            <li> Well, It Does Very</li>
            <li> /&gt;Comes with too much junk -- inflates the price for cheapo plastic &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> will see how much that will cost.  </li>
            <li> but works very well.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li> but it if you really need the foil shaver part.    </li>
            <li> Come on people, really complaining that they give you too much?  </li>
            <li> Spend the 32 bucks for the trimmer and enjoy hands-on personal grooming.</li>
            <li> very professional.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for what it does as a trimmer, but woefully deficient as a detailer (hence wanting this Wahl with all the options).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have to admit that I really appreciate the shaver/blade/accessories tray that comes with this Wahl.</li>
            <li> The adjustable trimmer guide provides more choices without switching attachments, but it is susceptible to slipping under pressure, resulting in a closer trim than you intended.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I use a blade for all of my shaving - to achieve the actual skin smooth results.    </li>
            <li> I really had my doughts about a rechargable trimmer</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s better than I expected at this price</li>
            <li> To the reviewers who whined about the stand not being a charging stand or the shaver having too much vibration:  Boo-hoo.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t replace the battery, so no matter how well the trimmer is built, once the battery goes, it is ready for the trash.</li>
            <li> This Wahl Lithium Trimmer seems to cover the whole spectrum.</li>
            <li> It shaves really close, too, which is another feature I needed.  </li>
            <li> I like it so much that I am getting one for my grandson today.</li>
            <li> It cuts very close, almost to a fault.  </li>
            <li> Rubber material covering body of unit grips TOO much.  </li>
            <li> have found Wahl to make the best cutting blades.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I said thanks for nothing.</li>
            <li> Great for travel as the charger is unnecessary to bring along.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Wahl hair trimming products!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the picture or the description really make</li>
            <li> and it really hurts.</li>
            <li> Plenty of power and the attachments work very well.</li>
            <li> - Cuts fast and the combs work well.  </li>
            <li> You can just tell when you take it out the box that it is very well build</li>
            <li> It trims reasonably well.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer is solidly built and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> of the blades included seem very well-constructed.</li>
            <li> I expected a lot more.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ready for a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My grandson really likes this trimmer.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this trimmer!</li>
            <li> Charges fast (1 hour).  </li>
            <li> Bought it here on Amazon for a very reasonble price and it was shipped really fast, the price could not be beat.</li>
            <li> Its that whole billiard ball look I sport.  </li>
            <li> on setting #2, but the length of the cut is VERY dependent upon the angle at which you hold this too your face.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t want to be thinking that much about it.  </li>
            <li> I had to refer to the instructions just to figure out how to fit everything on it, and even at that, it was a total puzzle.</li>
            <li> A real piece of junk.</li>
            <li> It is also very versatile.  </li>
            <li> the razer works really well</li>
            <li> /&gt;I expected better.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy build as well.</li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few months and it has held up well for me, I mostly just use the trimmers to keep facial hair under control, but the shaver is ok for every now and then.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery was a plus.</li>
            <li> I really like this Wahl shaver/trimmer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does come with a lot of accessories that I can&#x27;t really evaluate because my husband doesn&#x27;t use them.  </li>
            <li> Every time he uses it he says how great it is, how much power, and how after only a few minutes of charging, it is ready to use.  </li>
            <li> The shaver itself cuts very well.</li>
            <li> All of the attachments seem to work really well.  </li>
            <li> This turned out to work much better that expected.</li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I never soak the whole trimmer - just the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t want to use 2 buzzers.</li>
            <li> Blades are extremely gentle on skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Blades are extremely gentle on skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i really like that it has the shaver part.  </li>
            <li> second point--not all the parts fit in the stand as shown.  </li>
            <li> its ok, not very close</li>
            <li> Next time shaving, your hands are filled with hair trimmings and so is the place you store it.</li>
            <li> real mans beard is another story all together.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> But it charges fast and keeps doing its job.  </li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really comment on the functionality of this product.  </li>
            <li> Iv decided to go ahead and get the newer 9818 stainless steal one soon just because it thinner and cooler looking</li>
            <li> (I use a straight razor to cut my non-beard hairs</li>
            <li> Wahl charges $9.75 plus shipping for a replacement blade, which I think is too much.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Make available a smaller shaver attachment, along with the one here.  </li>
            <li> you for the fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Does the whole body manscaping with trimmed chest and legs and closely trimmed &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; areas.  </li>
            <li> This thing is light years beyond and solid design and construction.  </li>
            <li> Only drawback is lack of a charging status light.</li>
            <li> I get a much closer shave.</li>
            <li> Another annoyance is when I try to remove a plastic attachment the whole blade part pops off.  </li>
            <li> Charge on the battery REALLY LASTS.....</li>
            <li> Thanks Nitro</li>
            <li> was reasonable</li>
            <li> so much</li>
            <li> It is very well-made.</li>
            <li> Very well designed tool.</li>
            <li> and it really doesn&#x27;t tell you much about how to use it.  </li>
            <li> Fast forward to a month ago</li>
            <li> And for those of you who read the whole thing, I don&#x27;t recommend doing what I did, I just shared the steps for entertainment purposes.</li>
            <li> This did all as advertised and the charge held through the whole workout.</li>
            <li> If this was listed for 1.00 it would be too much.</li>
            <li> When I received this product it was fully charged and ready to go.  </li>
            <li> I really like this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> He absolutely loves it, it is convenient and well engineered.</li>
            <li> I cut my six year olds hair and as you can imagine he doesn&#x27;t sit very still for me.</li>
            <li> Expected a bit better for the price.</li>
            <li> I shave my head with a razor so the need for a trimmer really hadn&#x27;t came up with me before this beard of mine started getting out of control.</li>
            <li> so I just needed one of them but had to pay for the whole bunch.</li>
            <li> I like it very much!!Lot of clips  </li>
            <li> I would not pay too much over 30$ for this.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t use it much on my face.</li>
            <li> Better than what I expected.</li>
            <li> The shave very close,have plenty of power,and the battery stays charged.</li>
            <li> Who wants to have all that stuff sitting on their counter?</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s better than I expected, but not problem</li>
            <li> For this price, it&#x27;s a real bargain.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> improvement suggestion for future model is the trimmer needs a charge level indicator light.</li>
            <li> : They repaired my second trimmer free of charge.  </li>
            <li> I really like this shaver.  </li>
            <li> For the price, this trimmer really is all encompassing.</li>
            <li> When it did work, it worked very well.</li>
            <li> unit absolutely powers through hair.  </li>
            <li> However, the grip is very grippy and some hair may stick to it.  </li>
            <li> Problem is, it doesn&#x27;t trim very well at all.</li>
            <li> It worked reasonably well while it worked.</li>
            <li> and the whole head broke off.</li>
            <li> Second time I wanted to use it to trim my hair so changed to the replacement longer blade and doesn&#x27;t cut my hair at all despite making noise and vibrating.&lt;br /&gt;Product is cheap so if it stops working after one use don&#x27;t be surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Li-ion battery charges fast</li>
            <li> the razor works amazing.the attachments work very well.</li>
            <li> will stick to the handle, too much IMO.</li>
            <li> fast service.....</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t really make a difference from using one or the</li>
            <li> The stand is acceptable, but I didn&#x27;t really have room for everything.</li>
            <li> so I bought the whole thing again.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> The trimmer was already charged and ready to go out of the box.  </li>
            <li> Because it is a Lithium battery it needs to disposed of in an environmentally responsible manner.</li>
            <li> He really likes it.</li>
            <li> I really like the weight of this razor.</li>
            <li> I could do this probably three times (whole body and hair) before needing to recharge.</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer because of the numerous attachments available along with it&#x27;s affordability.  </li>
            <li> very convinient.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like the cavities in the stand weren&#x27;t really designed for the accessories that were</li>
            <li> It will always leave stubble no matter how much I tried.</li>
            <li> and he really likes it.</li>
            <li> Hubby doesnt use it all that much.</li>
            <li> The trimmer hair guides work very well</li>
            <li> Also the rubber grip attracts hair very well and sticks.</li>
            <li> used it the very night i got</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t need them as much as others so for me</li>
            <li> WELL THANKS</li>
            <li> A real bargain.</li>
            <li> was very durable.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why this happened, really.</li>
            <li> The rust in this situation is really inexcusable.</li>
            <li> Came on time, and the blade cuts very evenly.  </li>
            <li> It works, but it should fit properly.</li>
            <li> but it really doesn&#x27;t trim my husbands head very well and he is quite bald.  </li>
            <li> It has a whole myriad of attachments, I can&#x27;t imagine needing something it didn&#x27;t already come with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You have to hold it very carefully at a precise angle for it to cut properly.</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> Both of them really like this shaver.  </li>
            <li> Nothing is this close or this fast.</li>
            <li> I really like this trimmer and hope that it stands the test of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very practical.</li>
            <li> For the price you can keep replacing the whole unit.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> light a moderate stubble.</li>
            <li> The stand is very flimsy plastic, and its like playing Jenga trying to get all the pieces in there.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled into thinking this is a very durable and efficient way of organizing everything.</li>
            <li> and I really like</li>
            <li> The buzzing sound is now a bit erratic, which I interpret as the charge finally wearing off, so I&#x27;m going to plug it in for a recharge.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also know that Wahl is a very reliable brand.</li>
            <li> Said if I really wanted I could mail it in</li>
            <li> If the battery dies you cannot power this straight from AC -</li>
            <li> It trims very close.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> Really goo done</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a month and am ready to write a review.  </li>
            <li> 60 minutes on the charger and its ready to go for another eight months.  </li>
            <li> Very dissapointed in product.</li>
            <li> Hoping it will last a few years or more :)</li>
            <li> It heats up fast and it lasts my husband</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s really nothing I would change about it.</li>
            <li> It does not hold all of the accessories very well.</li>
            <li> but then again I don&#x27;t have much of a need for them anyway.</li>
            <li> This works perfectly well to trim anything that needs trimming, but you can&#x27;t plug it in and use it cold.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair cutting trimmer we have ever had.  </li>
            <li> The shaving attachment though really chewed me up.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to charge it as much</li>
            <li> He really likes his too.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get much work</li>
            <li> You have to press the blades against your skin which is very frustrating.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sharp/ powerful enough to trim the most stubborn facial hair.</li>
            <li> I really like the product.</li>
            <li> I also have used it for some \\&quot;body grooming\\&quot; and it worked very well.</li>
            <li> This thing can really cut.</li>
            <li> So much so that I&#x27;ve stopped using them all together</li>
            <li> He really likes this one.</li>
            <li> They would make the decision much easier that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> It trims very well.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> OK, I&#x27;ve used lots of hair cutters and have learned that there are somethings to be careful to look for:&lt;br /&gt;1.  </li>
            <li> I also got rid of the shaver attachment and the guards that I won&#x27;t use (there really isn&#x27;t room for EVERYTHING, so you have to choose what you will use).  </li>
            <li> But, if you&#x27;re a technically oriented person, the battery is available from Amazon:     http://www.amazon.com/Cylindrical-Rechargeable-Batteries-Philips-Electric/dp/B00ML5K2OG/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?s&#x3D;electronics&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1422152997&amp;sr&#x3D;1-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;3.7+volt+aa+battery+with+solder+tabs%27    </li>
            <li> you do a search you will find the Business development manager giving a demo that is very good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Lithium Ion Stainless Steel All-in-one Groomer]] ($50.99 Nov-2012).</li>
            <li> Vibrates too much and very noisy.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because the comb that comes with it is very flimsy.</li>
            <li> Glad my remote control batteries on my TV don&#x27;t do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Why do you really need cordless?  </li>
            <li> also seems to hold a charge very well.  </li>
            <li> however the \\&quot;stainless</li>
            <li> charges  fast, and holds the charge very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> to the complaints about too much vibration?</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> sure what the picture is showing, but I received the 17 piece set and maybe 1/2 of the pieces fit in the provided base, and of those many not as if they were intended to actually fit...</li>
            <li> To be short the battery life on this product was fabulous.</li>
            <li> but the item looks as described and was packaged very well</li>
            <li> My husband loves his Wahl 9818 Stainless Steel Lithium Grooming Trimmer.  </li>
            <li> My only problem is that neither the charger nor the clipper has an indicator light to confirm that the clipper is charging, or to confirm that it is fully charged.</li>
            <li> Maybe the box was made in USA, but it is very misleading.</li>
            <li> the plastic tray to store the various attachments is so light that it seems almost throwaway quality.  </li>
            <li> Wahl even wants to charge you if it IS in warranty.</li>
            <li> Works very well&lt;br /&gt;Comes with plenty of attachments&lt;br /&gt;Good value</li>
            <li> The only accessory included to hold the parts is a cheap &amp;#34;bag&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> it also has the same comb attachment as the last one I had of this same model but the blade is different, it seems to sit lower and will not trim as close, 1/4 inch at best</li>
            <li> powerful unit, just like a professional trimmer set.  </li>
            <li> I keep thinking it must be ready to die soon, but it just keeps going.  </li>
            <li> so you know when it&#x27;s ready to quit.</li>
            <li> very dissapointed.  </li>
            <li> This product is really mind blowing with the price I paid for..</li>
            <li> The rubber grip attracts hair and dust and is a real pain to get off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I need it so it just sits there forever in a charged state ready to be used without needing to be charged again.</li>
            <li> The rubber handle has so much &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; to it that hair sometimes clings to it.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works really well.</li>
            <li> The order came very</li>
            <li> I really like the trimmer and accessories.</li>
            <li> The rubber grip is very sticky and consequently collects ALL clippings.  </li>
            <li> I really expected better from Wahl.</li>
            <li> However, very noisy which is a price to pay for the lightweight design of the trimmer.</li>
            <li> hassle\\&quot; customer service department ready to help fix whatever problem you may have.</li>
            <li> Works really well.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> SO MUCH</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t run stronger, just much much</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have much use for the haircut pieces included,</li>
            <li> Works as advertised - only problem was had to eliminate some of the accessory items to get them to fit on the stand.</li>
            <li> it was very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> my only &#x27;dink&#x27; here is that this lacks a charging light.  </li>
            <li> It was smooth, quiet and did the job well.</li>
            <li> , I just needed to pull off the whole head.</li>
            <li> Makes the razor process so much</li>
            <li> Absolute garbage.  </li>
            <li> only cons are that it does not have a light to indicated when it is fully charged.  </li>
            <li> Wahl products are very dependable.  </li>
            <li> For the price - really a 4.5+.</li>
            <li> So much for the \\&quot;All-in-One\\&quot; billing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The battery died very</li>
            <li> There are better trimmers/shavers out there for nearly the same price.</li>
            <li> It is just for convenience and, considering the cost of this set, a rather nice throw-in -- especially for traveling when you don&#x27;t want a bunch of extra things to pack and carry.&lt;br</li>
            <li> docking base is a nice touch, although a cover for keeping it dust free would have been nice.  </li>
            <li> I guess I will go buy the Remington Titanium, since I already know a few people who own it and it works very well.  </li>
            <li> So far I have used it once to trim my thick goatee, using the adjustable guide and it did a great job.</li>
            <li> Far more power, smoother, quieter, and lasts longer than my similar (but cheaper) Norelco trimmer.  </li>
            <li> The rechargeable battery wore out eventually on both Norelcos, and it was really more difficult to replace than I would have liked.</li>
            <li> Same when charging it, I wasn&#x27;t sure when it was complete.  </li>
            <li> it is easy to maintain and attach the various heads to the main device.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s only because I wanna try something on more of a professional level)</li>
            <li> far superior cut/trim compared to round headed nose trimmers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Points to note:&lt;br /&gt;Superior battery performance, lasts for like 5 to 6 times, quick charge, 3hours of total run time, and as per my experience one shave dosnt last for more than 15-20mints, so one can easily use 6 times in a single charge.&lt;br /&gt;Great grip and handling while trimming&lt;br</li>
            <li> it will only shave really fine hair and have to go over many times for a real close shave but other than</li>
            <li> not bad for this price, easier to handle and use, it&#x27;s hard to clean up, but with water, it&#x27;s easier to clean</li>
            <li> like the other blades is a very precise cutter.</li>
            <li> Despite the new battery getting pretty hot during some inefficient soldering on my part, it already works at least as good as new.</li>
            <li> So far I keep Panasonic clipper, Philips groomer and Wahl trimmer each one in a separate ZIPLOCK PLASTIC BAG with attachments heaped inside!!!</li>
            <li> very powerful and quiet.</li>
            <li> I have found the different attachment heads to be very useful in maintaining a neatly groomed appearance.</li>
            <li> This single charge (and here&#x27;s the amazing part), last exactly 1 month and 7 days, or 5 weeks.  </li>
            <li> For the price, this is a great trimmer, but it has a pretty limited life-span of around 9 months in my experience if you are using it nearly everyday as I am.  </li>
            <li> Did notice that the blade did seem to rust pretty quickly, so it had to be cleaned almost daily.</li>
            <li> Made a mistake of buying another Braun due to loving their regular electric shavers but it paled in comparison to this ones battery life and powerful motor.  </li>
            <li> because it operates at higher RPM, or just that it is new.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten three years out of the first two and expect to get three years or so out of the new ones.</li>
            <li> When I was first shopping around for a new beard trimmer, I had no idea what to look for, so</li>
            <li> Despite the fact that they are not super durable, I am still happy enough with the product and its price to keep buying a new one each time it wears out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for a long time, and is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> It runs strong for a long time and it does not cut or catch at all.</li>
            <li> The blade was sharp and cut cleanly and quickly without any skin pinching or nicks.</li>
            <li> Seems like some sort of water issue possibly, but what good is a trimmer that cant get wet!  </li>
            <li> in all, when compared to the other brands we&#x27;ve tried, which are about the same cost, these seem superior.</li>
            <li> First of all, it&#x27;s very loud.  </li>
            <li> My second ,does a great job until the blades get dull,parts more expensive than buying a whole new razor.</li>
            <li> At first, I thought it was really cool to have all these options, but now I&#x27;m just wondering if they couldn&#x27;t have narrowed it down by using a smaller number of more adjustable items.  </li>
            <li> In other words, it trims mustaches better than anything I have used before.    </li>
            <li> Great little trimmer - long battery life - lots of accessories.  </li>
            <li> Within a day of posting this original review, I received different information from the company.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how any of the other trimmers are because I lack experience with them, but I am very much pleased with this one.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve worked better than any other brand</li>
            <li> My other Wahl trimmer has lated many years, and it&#x27;s still working.</li>
            <li> Better than any other of the cordless trimmers I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> Hopefully this is an isolated event and other customers have a better built trimmer.</li>
            <li> Not only is the shaver visibly more powerful than the others I&#x27;ve used, but this charges in a fraction of the time it took for the others, and the charge lasts absurdly long.</li>
            <li> i used it as soon as i got home, and found a mass of tiny hairs inside the original clip.  </li>
            <li> The battery system is great - long lasting but they always seem to quit when you are in the middle of something.</li>
            <li> However, it was stressed that these blades are not water or moisture friendly, so even if you oil them, keep the blades outside of the areas you wash, bathe, shower.  </li>
            <li> The new trimmer head works great and looks a little different</li>
            <li> The high-torque means a fast and accurate trim (lesser trimmers you have to keep running over the same area over and over) and the LiOn means I don&#x27;t have to worry if I&#x27;ve got enough charge left to get a good trim.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shaver is not good but as far as trimming is concerned, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> The silicone handle on the trimmer gets covered with hair while you trim your beard and the only way to clean it</li>
            <li> I use these tools all the time, and this particular model has been very reliable.  </li>
            <li> have owned a Wahl 8900 for a long time, maybe 15 or more years; it was a gift from a professional cosmetologist family member.  </li>
            <li> The multiple attachments makes for a clean job.</li>
            <li> The lithium ion battery really does last far longer between charges and, in addition, it maintains a consistently strong speed or &amp;#34;torque&amp;#34; as Wahl advertises.  </li>
            <li> like the most is it has several heads you can change, its battery and in general it&#x27;s practical</li>
            <li> Overall, i&#x27;d say look elsewhere for an easier to clean clipper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 71 years of age, have worked successfully as a craftsman assembling all my days, but there are too few left to play with this thing.</li>
            <li> Have to go over the same area over and over to get a clean cut.</li>
            <li> I have to say that this trimmer cuts much closer than the older one.</li>
            <li> Well it seems that way, but after about 7 weeks of normal use, light trimming and the occasional shave, never in the shower or exposed to water, it stopped working.</li>
            <li> , whats left of it.&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with the purchase and already amortized the cost of the device that I would have otherwise spent at the barber shop.</li>
            <li> but if they work as well as the main one, I&#x27;m that much happier.</li>
            <li> He stated that the blade isn&#x27;t close enough to give that clean edging</li>
            <li> The battery is amazing and neither trimmer worked long enough to need a</li>
            <li> definitely a much higher quality and worth an extra $25.</li>
            <li> Good shaver with one serious flaw.</li>
            <li> Overall, we loved this little trimmer and would certainly recommend it at this price.</li>
            <li> Its ok but power seems to wear down fast.</li>
            <li> Shaver works fine but is quite weak and requires more time to shave with.</li>
            <li> I bought the same set about 4 years ago and it is still working fine, I ordered this one in case my old one gives up, but I think I will never need it!</li>
            <li> They come off easily and as you long as you align the head correctly it goes back on quickly also.   </li>
            <li> After the first year, I started observing that the charge will not hold for more than a few minutes, steadily decreasing.</li>
            <li> , it gave my beard a nice trim, I can tell its going to last a long time, Made in USA!</li>
            <li> The quality of this one is evident right away compared to ones that are similar in cost or cheaper.  </li>
            <li> Even though this was only $32 for me, compared to my $150 remington, it cuts through the hair probably about 10 times as fast, without snagging,(when properly used,) is easier to clean, and is more solidly built.</li>
            <li> No big deal, as a quick wipe down/brush off will get it off, and I MUCH prefer the accuracy of not having it slip around in my hand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find that if the blades are oiled regularly, this trimmer cuts very evenly and quickly.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really add much more than what everyone else has already said in previous reviews.</li>
            <li> After running it down from the quick charge, I charged it for an hour, since that&#x27;s supposedly a full charge.</li>
            <li> the new large attachment&lt;br /&gt;was</li>
            <li> My last trimmer was much more expensive and didn&#x27;t do nearly as good a job.</li>
            <li> This trimmer completely stopped working 3/4 of the way through my first trim with it.  </li>
            <li> At first, I used to have to keep my old cordless trimmer on the charger</li>
            <li> so my trimmer usually has a beard of its own.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m so use to the Andis professional clipper (heavier, noisier, get hot and reliable.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small in size so it fits nicely in my show bag, too.</li>
            <li> I almost dropped it the first time I turned it on because I was so surprised by the noise and vibration.</li>
            <li> When I used it for the first time I thought this was the closest to a professional trimmer I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> but so far it is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> I have a short full beard and mustache that I&#x27;ve trimmed with this device for about three months.</li>
            <li> I took this product and used it only 2 times and this one isnt working now.it does not get switched even after full charge.faced</li>
            <li> So this has basically been kind of a bust for me, and I&#x27;m going back to my old standard Panasonic razor.</li>
            <li> Its a small flaw, though it is nice.</li>
            <li> The foil shaver is small but effective.</li>
            <li> I was able to fix mine, but the average person probably would have just thrown it away.</li>
            <li> Made a full grown man cry just wanting a simple shave&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also comes with a variety of heads which work well - including a small shave head that works nicely below my beard line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the last three months, the trimmer charge lasts under a minute after a full day of charging.</li>
            <li> After a full charge I could grab the blades while running and stop them using very moderate force.</li>
            <li> and it stayed alive the whole time!</li>
            <li> However I&#x27;m going to print the label and return the old one first</li>
            <li> I just had my beard trimmed professionally today for the first time</li>
            <li> The only issue that I had initially was the removal of the heads which after finding this very informative video by Wahl I was able to figure it out:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It only runs about 60 seconds now on a full charge.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this product in that it never seemed able to charge to the point where I could use it for more than a few minutes at a go, a problem compounded by the trimmer&#x27;s lack of any kind of charge-indication light that would let me know if it was fully charged, or even in the process of charging.  </li>
            <li> I have this thing for 6 months it&#x27;s already broken very cheap made it even feels cheap</li>
            <li> It works OK but two things get it knocked down.</li>
            <li> The Wahl is immediately much high quality: real metal pieces, heavy in my hand, the design allows for a much closer much more even shave.</li>
            <li> (I could not find any better trimmer than this one, some other trimers even cut and rubbed her skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had about a half dozen trimmers over the past 20 years and this one was by far the best yet.</li>
            <li> All in all, for $30 I can&#x27;t complain too much, but I was expecting a little more from Wahl.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got a safe spot to sit this set on the counter, you may find yourself doing little grooming tasks that seemed too much hassle to do before.</li>
            <li> /&gt;just bought the Oster fast feed, it cost a little more</li>
            <li> It should be like the new Norelco razor platform!  </li>
            <li> There actually are too many attachments, which overcomplicate using the device and create far too many small parts that could be lost.  </li>
            <li> The different guards help with trimming hair while the different attachments like the wide blade and the shaver make it very handy  and allow you to do what you need to.</li>
            <li> Convenience makes up for this shortcoming.&lt;br /&gt;Holds a charge for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Attachments are very useful.</li>
            <li> What I found was that most of the clippers are very similar, so it&#x27;s not useful to have so many, and in any case it is a pain to always switch between the different clippers.  </li>
            <li> It is smooth, powerful, and works very well for beard and body and battery last so long, and if ever stopped working, I will reorder immediately.</li>
            <li> Wahl, on the other hand, is also quite the capable beast but where the T980 is really only good as a Trimmer, the Wahl tries to be a little of everything and in my opinion fairly well succeeds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had a nicad Wahl trimmer before this one and the difference in the length of time a charge is held is amazing and highly appreciated - I hardly ever have to charge this one.</li>
            <li> It is relatively easy to clean but has spaces that are hard to get to.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find functional, reasonably priced trimmers, so this one was a nice surprise to recieve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty sweet little workhorse - always reliable and holds a good charge for a long time even after a long time on the shelf.</li>
            <li> The plastic packaging materials can be used to hold the various accessories and parts in a primitive tray (which is what&#x27;s pictured), but the plastic molding doesn&#x27;t fit the items particularly well, doesn&#x27;t secure them at all, and is extremely flimsy.  </li>
            <li> i have to buy a whole new pack.</li>
            <li> Do I really want to buy a new trimmer head twice a year and by the end of the 5 yr warranty have paid for the product 5 times over?  </li>
            <li> The new package doesn&#x27;t include the molded upright stand, instead it just has a fabric zipper pouch (don&#x27;t care much).  </li>
            <li> The new blade really did not help.</li>
            <li> I guess I will just have to assume I buy a new one very 6 months.</li>
            <li> Truly the best trimmer ive ever owned as far as the cutting and trimming capability is concerned.</li>
            <li> but my previous trimmer was better in this regard.   </li>
            <li> Like I said previously, the unit worked OK for about 3 months (used it 10-20 times MAX).</li>
            <li> That was certainly refreshing after using some non lithium shavers previously.</li>
            <li> Odd choice of material for sure.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find the button to depress to swivel the trimmer head, couldn&#x27;t get the 6 position guide to fit correctly on the trimmer head.</li>
            <li> Had this product for over a year and half and always enjoyed its convenience and reliability.</li>
            <li> The handle is coated with black rubber which must be for better grip but hair and beard particles stick to it.</li>
            <li> However, for those who want a slightly longer and prominent stubble this maybe the product for you.</li>
            <li> Walgreens has a much better trimmer for half the price.</li>
            <li> but it just seems odd that Wahl can&#x27;t make something with better quality</li>
            <li> For all around trimming, meaning sideburns and hairline at back of neck, it&#x27;s super.</li>
            <li> It also gives a fairly decent haircut.  </li>
            <li> It runs faster and longer than the older model I had for 10 years before the battery gave out.  </li>
            <li> I replaced an older trim unit I&#x27;ve had for 10 years.  </li>
            <li> 2 sizes for cutting head and many attachments make it adept at beards, moustaches, necks and around ears.</li>
            <li> This was purchased to replace an older wahl trimmer, and I wish I had replaced it sooner.</li>
            <li> I have never seen a similar product that charged up as quickly as this one did.  </li>
            <li> Not really a big deal, considering it&#x27;s got a 1-minute quick charge ability.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer to replace a much older rechargeable Wahl trimmer.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m going to give that a try and hope that I can end my hunt for a trimmer I can be satisfied with for the next several years.</li>
            <li> - maybe it&#x27;s the same, but appears to be better quality than what was initially supplied.  </li>
            <li> The teeth on the main trimmer head started falling out or breaking off causing the product to chomp on my face.  </li>
            <li> (check out the cost of a decent dedicated shaver).</li>
            <li> the second saving feature is the quick releasing interchangeable trimming heads.</li>
            <li> Given the lithium battery it will probably do so for quite a while and take a quick charge when it runs low.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions in the package to send it in for warranty repair, I am hoping to get it back quickly.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what happened with this particular model.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This review will be about 2 models including this particular product.</li>
            <li> It has WAY too many attachments for me - but that&#x27;s because I use it only as stated above.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested the charger and it is producing a steady 4.30 V.  </li>
            <li> I say &#x27;potentially&#x27; because, for the most part, I think the battery is a strength(!)</li>
            <li> I say &#x27;potentially&#x27; because, for the most part, I think the battery is a strength(!)</li>
            <li> The older designed tray never would hold them all, so some wound up sitting in a drawer.  </li>
            <li> It seems no one makes a decent trimmer out there anymore.</li>
            <li> , was that it&#x27;s main function for me -- the beard</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different models but I keep coming back to this one.</li>
            <li> I had it for 6 months of steady use without having to charge it.</li>
            <li> This replaced an older trimmer.</li>
            <li> I use it daily for quick touch up and it has remained charged for a month or so.</li>
            <li> I like the attachments, especially the tiny detail trimmer which is really my favorite.</li>
            <li> I bought this mainly as a beard trimmer for my husband.  </li>
            <li> last quick note on the battery-</li>
            <li> This particular model comes with attachments to meet just about any need</li>
            <li> However, with the trimmer plugged in I could get about a minute of use out of it, which was all I needed for the occasional quick touch-up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but only last about a year or so, before the blades get worn.</li>
            <li> It has a decent amount of accessories.</li>
            <li> This is decent for body hair.</li>
            <li> This Wahl product uses a lithium battery, not the older nickel-cadmium battery technology.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Decent shaver.</li>
            <li> This the main resion for buying this model.</li>
            <li> A lot of reviews I read say this trimmer, mainly for ears/nose/eyebrows, doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> The attachments (blades mentioned above) can be pretty tricky toput on and take off at first.</li>
            <li> We owned an older version of a Wahl trimmer.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s older counterparts.  </li>
            <li> charger is also 110V only (while most of the countries are using 220V now and a battery powered shaver is likely to be used for travelers...</li>
            <li> The cut is very close and has quiet and powerful trimmers.</li>
            <li> The powerplant in this model (Lithium vs. the older NiCad or NiMH rechargables) makes this the one to beat against all others in the sub-$60 price-range.</li>
            <li> I was warned by the reviews and not only that, some of my old attachments fit this one.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer I have is an older version 9854-L</li>
            <li> Trimmer shipped quickly and works terrific!</li>
            <li> Uses it mainly for trimming nose and ears.  </li>
            <li> The problem is that Walmart no longer carried this particular model.  </li>
            <li> I took care of it pretty well, and it took care of my facial hair pretty well, until 6 months in it just doesn&#x27;t work anymore.</li>
            <li> The motor is plenty powerful, the trimer selections are quite inclusive for most anyone&#x27;s beard, moustache, complex goattee.  </li>
            <li> Works great with thick facial hair.  </li>
            <li> The main difference is in the quality of the blades that came with this clipper.</li>
            <li> and I just stick with the main blade.</li>
            <li> The attachments are vast and very helpful in hair removal and makes trimming fun.</li>
            <li> Part of the workings in the main head broke off completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I openly gave it 5 stars in hopes that more folks will see the review, but it really only deserves 2 or 3!</li>
            <li> I have 2 main gripes.  </li>
            <li> Note: We did have to send the unit into Wahl after 3 weeks because it suddenly stopped working completely, but they replaced it free of charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> if I knew I was getting a decent</li>
            <li> The battery charge is quick and will last through two or three shaving sessions.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m back to using my 5 year old cheap Norelco to trim because it doesn&#x27;t pull (go figure).</li>
            <li> I came to amazon to look for something decent that can give me a close stubble trim.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to put them back in a back or container after i use them, and with a lot of traveling, I often misplace them in bags and eventually lost two guards.</li>
            <li> the battery stopped holding a decent charge.</li>
            <li> I was particularly drawn to this product because of the lithium ion battery.  </li>
            <li> It has worked well and initially the charge lasted for several trims, so I had confidently carried it with me on business trips without the charger.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;d be nice if the warranty description that comes with the product was accurate, but given that the instruction booklet that comes with the trimmer is rather generic (describes features of other models as well), I&#x27;m guessing they haven&#x27;t updated that text in a long time.    </li>
            <li> At first I was glad to see that WAHL had finally designed a shaver with a lithium battery because the nickel-cadium battiers in their other units die out way too fast.  </li>
            <li> Again, great for fine and short hair, great to trime facial hair as well, not good for long and thick hair.</li>
            <li> They were fine for awhile, but got plugged and dull no matter what you tried to do to clean.</li>
            <li> My most recent trimmer (before getting this Wahl) is the Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum.</li>
            <li> It is very powerful and keeps its charge for a long time!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d particularly recommend this for men with beards or high maintenance haircuts that need to be trimmed every couple of days.</li>
            <li> I will try to contact Wahl&#x27;s customer service department since they seem to offer a generous warranty, but the original packaging is long gone.</li>
            <li> Very powerful, versitale, and holds charge for a very long time.</li>
            <li> The blades are sharp, and it seems that this will be a great little work horse.</li>
            <li> They worked great for the first 1.5 years, but alas, their demise has finally come.  </li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s a great little trimmer.</li>
            <li> A great replacement for my old battery operated Wahl trimmer which has work well for the past 8 years, the rechargeable battery is a vast improvement.</li>
            <li> first off, clearly amazon doesn&#x27;t check their returns before they resend it out to a new customer because mine had fingerprints all over the chrome (which i sterilized before using).  </li>
            <li> The different trimmer heads vary in quality, some feel very sturdy and snap right into place.</li>
            <li> , so the attachments more or less just lay in there against the other accessories, so even after you get everything in there all nice and organized as soon as you pick up a different accessory everything is just going to shift and move.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the previous version that came with the other kind  battery ( not li Ion) and this one definitely has a better battery life.&lt;br /&gt;Downside-</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve only had my new Trimmer/(Shaver) for one day, but I&#x27;m looking forward to 59 more days to be convinced that I&#x27;ll be happy with this purchase for at least 5 years (as per Guarantee, Warranty, and previous experience).  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The first time trying my Norelco to see if it&#x27;d be a suitable replacement proved to be such an immediate and obvious improvement that I immediately discarded the Wahl unit and have not looked back.</li>
            <li> high quality trimmer with tons of attachments.</li>
            <li> The blades are extremely high quality and it powers through any hair type without choking ever.</li>
            <li> This product seems to be high quality, and has lots of attachments.</li>
            <li> This set came highly recommended from a friend, so I bought it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone looking for an all in one trimmer.  </li>

            <li> This is high quality, well built equipment.</li>
            <li> Had high expectations for this trimmer...</li>
            <li> highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this shaver.</li>
            <li> but at this point I have high exceptions</li>
            <li> I highly recommend oiling often.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> All of the options provide a highly functional tool with the ability to trim any beard out there.  </li>
            <li> would highly recommend these clippers</li>
            <li> The only complaint i do have is that i like a very close shave and the shave attachment does not give as great a shave compared to an old fashioned razor.</li>
            <li> Sure enough, after only a minute of charging (after it was dead), I was able to run it for between 3-4 minutes.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> A HIGH RECOMMEND..</li>
            <li> Does everything I want it to effortlessly and is high quality.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The foil shaver (and great torque from the motor) managed to get through nearly all of the facial hair except for a few sensitive neck areas that weren&#x27;t used to an electric trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The new Li-Ion is basically the same trimmer I&#x27;ve enjoyed using for years, but with double the power.  </li>
            <li> This definitely seems more powerful than my previous Wahl, allowing me to get an even trim on one pass over any given area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried at least a half dozen of these rechargeable trimmers and this one is, by far, the best yet.  </li>
            <li> Lithium battery has an option for charging it just a few minutes, which forces just enough energy into it, to be able to do a quick trim.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Surprised that the blades aren&#x27;t sharper, haven&#x27;t tried other attachable blades to see if they are better yet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the trimmer worked fine for a while, though it is not really powerful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend it to anyone who is willing to invest a little more in a quality product that performs well and will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> I would like to get the rotary attachment with this, for the asking price, or just charge me a little more.  </li>
            <li> I would like to get the rotary attachment with this, for the asking price, or just charge me a little more.  </li>
            <li> I struggled a little to understand the instructions for adjusting the trimming guide, but once I understood it was pleased by its beard-trimming performance.  </li>
            <li> Then a little more effort to understand the instructions for changing heads, but they are literally a snap to change once you get it.  </li>
            <li> They can be a little challenging to set on the power unit but that gets easier with practice.   </li>
            <li> The nose hair trimmer could be shaped a little better.</li>
            <li> Could trim a little better at times, but works well.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this little guy -</li>
            <li> also use the little comb/brush to brush my hairs out of the trimmer after every use, i think the oils from the hair can wear out the trimmer quicker, which means having it to lube it more</li>
            <li> All I need now is a little more experience.</li>
            <li> This little trimmer has more than made up for its compact size.  </li>
            <li> I should of shopped around a little more.</li>
            <li> I always use the basic \\&quot;full\\&quot; trimming head, but there&#x27;s a ½ inch fine trimmer (without any trimming guides, just the bare razor head) and another head for deburring neck hair.</li>
            <li> So finally with much force it did suddenly with an alarming crack sound, and now it moves too easily.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother thinking it&#x27;s going to be very good for actually cutting your hair.</li>
            <li> Very good at cutting the hairs without pulling them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Battery life plays a large role in user experience with cordless trimmers (you never want to run out of juice halfway through a shave), I do not expect these to disappoint as many NiCad&#x27;s have in the past.</li>
            <li> Easy head change from one to the other</li>
            <li> Not as easy as other trimmers I have used.  </li>
            <li> And  blade is sharp and the motor is strong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably keep it and just deal with it, but I really wish I could find a *new* one of my old Wahl trimmer!</li>
            <li> The guides that come with it are not as precise as I expected, but they get the job done.</li>
            <li> The old one had gotten to where it didn&#x27;t cut very well, and it required recharging after every use.</li>
            <li> That being said, they&#x27;re very sturdy, and they never pinch, which isn&#x27;t something I could say for my old clippers.</li>
            <li> This is one great trimmer, however it&#x27;s not perfect.  </li>
            <li> The reviews about hair clippings gathering on the rubber grip are accurate, but the issue is of no real consequence imo.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t be scared of the people that say it is loud and vibrates too much.  </li>
            <li> The plastic guides to put over the wide beard trimming blade are cheaply made.</li>
            <li> so you can hold it securely without worrying about it slipping off your hands.</li>
            <li> It really isn&#x27;t that loud compared to some of the reviews I read</li>
            <li> I spent about 15 minutes trying to figure out what went were because not all of the pieces fit.</li>
            <li> /&gt; much cheaper than the ones on the old Wahl&lt;br /&gt;clippers.</li>
            <li> He looks very presentable and professional and he enjoys that.</li>
            <li> Since I am in my seventies, it is important that I can grasp the handle without fear of it slipping in my hand.</li>
            <li> This one is much quieter than my old one.  </li>
            <li> Holds the charge really well, no battery issues so far</li>
            <li> The stainless Steel looks classy.  </li>
            <li> The tray is useless lol.</li>
            <li> Recommend this product if someone wants to replace their 2-5yr old Beard &amp; mustache trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> He really likes this, I had to replace his old one</li>
            <li> I was on hold for 10-15 minutes, but the rep that answered was very helpful, knowledgeable and clearly communicated everything.</li>
            <li> Much improved over my old trimmer.  </li>
            <li> While I haven&#x27;t been able to try out all the attachments that come with since my beard isn&#x27;t long enough I will not grade those items.</li>
            <li> I think the battery never loses charge.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve used more than a few.    </li>
            <li> Wow...this thing pulls hair all over my face and neck while leaving many uneven hairs.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t cost more than a few dollar.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These pieces, as well of the rest of the system (11 pieces total) is an efficient way for men to get a fresh from the barber/stylist look at a fraction of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> While I can&#x27;t give it five stars, it is definitely a purchase worth considering.</li>
            <li> The razor ran on the initial charge that entire time which surprised and pleased me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always been powerful enough that it didn&#x27;t pull my beard.   </li>
            <li> but i don&#x27;t know if the plastic parts have a long life because you have to put  it on or take off depend what you want do ,loud sound when you work with it</li>
            <li> I normally use the adjustable comb at setting &amp;#34;3&amp;#34; to trim up my beard.  </li>
            <li> Even leaving it plugged in 24/7 could not trim for more than 90 seconds before it would go dead.  </li>
            <li> I use it most everyday.  </li>
            <li> When it does get low, it pretty much just stops.</li>
            <li> They have to be stacked on top of one another and look like they do not fit anywhere.  </li>
            <li> The different trimming heads are all incredibly useful.</li>
            <li> (I have purchased at least 10 trimmers over the past 10 years, and this one is the best!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several types and this one seems to be the most solid I&#x27;ve used so far.  </li>
            <li> Could use a few more trimmer guard sizes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes with a lot of combs attachments but they&#x27;re pretty much within the same height range</li>
            <li> It has a five year warranty, it&#x27;s pretty cheap, and feels like a sturdy razor that will last a long time.</li>
            <li> It would be even more helpful with round nose attachment.</li>
            <li> I used it daily as my shaver for 10 days straight, plus gave myself and my thick-furred dog a buzz-cut before I noticed any change in the power output... straight out of the box!   </li>
            <li> What I like the most is the fact that charge takes a long time and if for some reason you need to use and no charge, a 5 min plugged to the electricity is enough.</li>
            <li> The attachments are really useful because it can be used in various ways.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m confident this one will last just as long.</li>
            <li> I do like the fact that it comes with 2 different widths of trimming heads as well as a shaving head (which is pretty much</li>
            <li> I bought this 6 full months ago, fully charged it once, and only just recharged it for the first time last week.</li>
            <li> normally don&#x27;t review products</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful enough to buzz through the thickest hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet and plenty powerful.  </li>
            <li> Usage proves the opposite.  </li>
            <li> Was a good trimmer but the plug on the unit has broken away and will not charge now.</li>
            <li> the only thing with lithium batteries is when they are dying they just quit, not much warning, but a full charge lasts a few trims, good life.</li>
            <li> It is not great, it is good.  </li>
            <li> I can get a new one from another brand for just a little bit more and no hassle or waiting.</li>
            <li> It catches hair decently well and doesn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive skin on my neck.</li>
            <li> New batteries are great and long-lasting, last for at least a dozen trims (&amp;#60;1yr old).</li>
            <li> No mess in the house, a quick, clean cut, trimmed eyebrows and groomed neck in just a few minutes.</li>
            <li> slight pressure on the switch toward off suddenly makes it sound as full power.  </li>
            <li> The unit is small and light enough that it would be easy and feasible to carry on extended trips (if one had a carrying case).    </li>
            <li> as well, in everything except battery, but unless you are a performer in the adult film industry, it will probably do an adequate job, especially if you have someone who can assist you with the underbrush</li>
            <li> I charged it once I received it, used it daily ever since, and it&#x27;s still going strong on the initial charge.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; trimmer stopped being strong enough to shave the back of my head in summer.</li>
            <li> Finally Wahl has caught on used the powerful, long lasting batteries in a great little trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Its not that loud and easy to clean (comes with a very small cleaning brush</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even sure which attachment to use, as the single page of tiny instructions doesn&#x27;t identify them.  </li>
            <li> I have only just begun to use these trimmers, so I can not speak to their durability, but I do believe that going with the lithium ion option was the right choice.  </li>
            <li> It charges quick and run for a long time, before it needs to be recharged again.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> : Too many attachments and not easy to switch between them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The lithium ion battery charges quickly and holds the charge for a long while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It charges quick and the charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Charges quickly and the charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The battery charges quickly and lasts for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It keeps a charge for a long time and recharges fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> suppose, I am tending to make things more complicated as they really are.&lt;br /&gt;Within the several attachments, one can choose one that is appropriate for the length of hair that needs to be cut.</li>
            <li> The Trimmer does indeed woke fine and and comes with a variety of ways to style your facial hair, it does occasionally chug when trimming.</li>
            <li> One second it was working fine, the next it was dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Second, the main head it comes with started to rust within the first 5 weeks of owning it.</li>
            <li> Replacing the one I have had for years that still works fine but wanted this same one only new.</li>
            <li> It handles beards, sideburns, and *other* areas with comfortable ease.</li>
            <li> one drawback - there should be a charging indicator light as in other models which lets you know when the unit is charging and when it has completed.    </li>
            <li> More power, battery life extra long, if there isn&#x27;t an attachment to complete the task...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I would use this for anything other than shaving, beard trimming, or doing light maintenance on my hair.</li>
            <li> I opened the box I discovered that the primary Trimmer head did not have a spring loaded vibrating mechanism like the other heads that would make that trimmer</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m going try other brands or just purchase another cheap Norelco.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for an amazing amount of time - long enough to take it on a short trip without even bringing the charger.  </li>
            <li> However, all of the other trimmers in the market seam cheap too.</li>
            <li> It comes with 3 fixed length guides, which seem okay, but I didn&#x27;t use them because 2 were too short and 1 was too long.  </li>
            <li> Considering that a Braun shaver is quite costly, I was surprised that such a good shaver came with a small, inexpensive trimmer.</li>
            <li> Very slick and comes with own stand.</li>
            <li> Solidly built, runs a very long time with a full charge,charges quickly,comes with enough attachements to fit any trimming needs.</li>
            <li> As I suppose is a problem with quick change tip items, shaved hair gets into the mechanism and since the little shaft that does the work is in there and greased, it kind of gets messy.  </li>
            <li> I would not given this 5 stars originally if I new that this would happen&lt;br</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t live without this trimmer.</li>
            <li> it never ran again return for new one  </li>
            <li> So it is time to buy a new one</li>
            <li> Not on a new product.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll live.</li>
            <li> When it died, I didn&#x27;t want to spend the $100+ on a new razor, so I decided to try this.</li>
            <li> Well, so it may be, but not at the level I want to live with.  </li>
            <li> So new Amazon order today</li>
            <li> so I decided to just get a new one all together</li>
            <li> But with a new shaver and blade, the 10 days of growth came off in a snap.  </li>
            <li> Time for a new pair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaper to buy a new set than a new blade.</li>
            <li> I like about this new one:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> New Li-ion battery</li>
            <li> While comparing prices on a new replacement I discovered this model.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer new in December of 2010.  </li>
            <li> A new one costs $40.</li>
            <li> hopefully I can get this replaced with a new item</li>
            <li> update got a new one and that one lasted about 2 weeks until it stopped working all together</li>
            <li> and then it&#x27;s time for a new one.</li>
            <li> Like the new ION battery</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice to trim my newly grown moustache and goatee.  </li>
            <li> So time for a new one.</li>
            <li> Just wish I could have gotten a new one.</li>
            <li> It still holds a charge like the day it was new, and cuts the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The new one was plugged in and it worked.  </li>
            <li> guess it&#x27;s time for a new razor\\&quot;,</li>
            <li> This lead to the purchase of this new Wahl, which outperforms</li>
            <li> will keep everyone updated with my new findings.</li>
            <li> so I could get a new one</li>
            <li> I now have to purchase something new</li>
            <li> and I just bought a new razor with the lithium ion battery</li>
            <li> I had.&lt;br /&gt;The attachments, on the new clippers, were&lt;br</li>
            <li> This morning I just set a new record for speed and height, trimming my hair.</li>
            <li> and I have a new hair trimmer on the way to me....</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for quite a while when it&#x27;s new.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update:  I&#x27;ve been using this clipper once a week for a year, and it still looks and performs as new.  </li>
            <li> cost of a new battery.</li>
            <li> and im on the search for a new trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I still need a new trimmer, if I cant find</li>
            <li> Just got a new one because one of the attachments locked up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this product is manufactured garbage, and came used when bought new in store.</li>
            <li> Got a new ac adapter</li>
            <li> hard to get hair off of the handle, too many plastic parts that dont look very durable.</li>
            <li> I liked that it stopped, rather than draining slowly down to non-operation, but I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was broken or needed a charge.  </li>
            <li> I needed a new trimmer after my old Wahl crapped out on me, and so far, I really like this trimmer.</li>
            <li> You can not just wipe them off or brush them off, you have to use a wet towel to clean it.</li>
            <li> Not worth it to replace as it still cuts fine with the guides placed over it.</li>
            <li> The problem came when the battery finally died (it just shut off in the middle of the shave, it doesn&#x27;t have an indicator light).</li>
            <li> I expected more from an American based company.  </li>
            <li> It has quite a strong motor that has no trouble going through very coarse facial hair.</li>
            <li> I liked this trimmer when it worked, however after only a few months it refused to charge.  </li>
            <li> but the blade movements are not what they should be to be overall effective, it works but plan on a few hair pulls</li>
            <li> just random slots to toss where some may fall, but many don&#x27;t fit at all.&lt;br /&gt;Alas</li>
            <li> Not that I use the attachments much, since they&#x27;re of the same flimsy plastic as the tray, and really don&#x27;t do the job they&#x27;re designed to do.  </li>
            <li> Item was inexpensive, and not junk, works great,&lt;br /&gt;much better than expected for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Coupled with the fact it is an American Made Product...</li>
            <li> Fairly silent and good power for thick beards.  </li>
            <li> Hard to clean and maintain.&lt;br /&gt;Battery lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Invest in something better.</li>
            <li> Like with the original battery, I&#x27;m going to cycle it completely the first few times to condition the battery.</li>
            <li> The different head types (standard for trimming down facial hair, wide for haircuts, narrow for nose and precision requirements, and twin foil for a smooth shave) are great and can be interchanged fairly easily.  </li>
            <li> It got dull very quickly after the first week.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s far from high quality.</li>
            <li> The adjustable attachment very nearly broke in my hands when I tried to adjust the length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> highly recommend this thing if you&#x27;re going to use it to &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; like the late-20s, dashing, busy, rugged, testosterone-addled man that you are.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised to see all the negatives.</li>
            <li> If left unplugged for more than a couple days, and used only for a combined time of a couple minutes on a FULL charge, it would be dead.</li>
            <li> Good quality, sharp blades, handles well, but tends to pull at hair a little.</li>
            <li> It is important to remember that having a beard is not a right, but a privilege.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice anything special to justify the price which was roughly 3X</li>
            <li> especially if used in sensitive areas (get my drift?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the blades began to rust almost right away.</li>
            <li> My old ones died so quickly, this one lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Battery is exceptionally strong and long lasting.  </li>
            <li> Small super powerful.</li>
            <li> It is not as easy to get into tight places as the Norelco.  </li>
            <li> usually do not give bad reviews, as you are more than welcome to see through the thousands I have spent thought</li>
            <li> I was wanting something better and last week bought a Norelco (that was a stupid choice, now in the trash), then started reading reviews and was going to get an Andis pro model, great reviews</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> The attachment for getting a close shave works in some ways better than my everyday shaver!  </li>
            <li> More is not better.</li>
            <li> Keep shopping - there are several other trimmers under $20 that are better than this one.</li>
            <li> I received my clipper on September 11, I charged it over night and used it for the first time the next day.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really used the other attachments yet, but hope they will be useful and as well made.</li>
            <li> pretty much only use 2 attachments.</li>
            <li> This is my second Wahl trimmer, the first one died after about 10 years.</li>
            <li> To me, it seems as if perhaps Wahl&#x27;s manufacturing standards aren&#x27;t consistent enough to keep this trimmer a guaranteed winner for all of us.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it to be of pretty standard grade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it to be of pretty standard grade.</li>
            <li> The first one I had stopped working recently after 6 or 7 years.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this item; the first lasted three years.</li>
            <li> It says that it has three hours of battery life which seemed too short at first.  </li>
            <li> think the small precision attachment is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> It is more effort to use than my other trimmers that have different settings for the trim.</li>
            <li> I wonder seeing most of the men vouching for Philips which is a piece of trash in terms of the sharpness of blades.&lt;br /&gt;Trimmers are simply judged by the smoothness of shave, and this has the finest blades which I havent seen in any of the other brands.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> I wish I could save that extra step and just have 1 that is well built like this Wahl and get close on the first try.</li>
            <li> Sure it&#x27;s got a warranty, and at least someone seems enthusiastic to help based on responses to some of the negative reviews, but who reallywants to hassle with the process?</li>
            <li> Finally had to give up on the first one I bought 4-5 years ago.</li>
            <li> So far a normal trimmer.</li>
            <li> Others feel cheap and take multiple tries to get them in straight.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s in quotes because apparently my idea of reasonable life span of 1+ years is excessive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Perhaps they did the math and figured that it would cost them an extra 2.5 cents, and besides, the marketing folks could trick us into thinking that the pretty stand in the picture was a charging stand.</li>
            <li> Most other trimmers can simply be used over and over again with no maintenance.</li>
            <li> How can two of these devices break in exactly the same way?  </li>
            <li> I guess if a guy sports facial hair and reaches for this product on a near daily basis the plastic organizer might be important.  </li>
            <li> I bought the first at a Wal-Mart while on a business trip that was extended into a 2nd week.  </li>
            <li> From what I&#x27;ve read, it&#x27;s a better trimmer and doesn&#x27;t have these small nuisances.</li>
            <li> Best Trimmer set out there, I have tried others and have been disappointed.</li>
            <li> I get WAAAAAY better results this way instead of the generic 10 dial adjuster other razors come with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My first one was several years ago.  </li>
            <li> I like this product due to its many attachments for different hair lengths.</li>
            <li> Nuff said, except I have to type 10 more word for review to be accepted :s</li>
            <li> And I went out and bought another Whal beard trimmer (same model) to use on my Samoyed and it works as the first one</li>
            <li> why at 4 stars, is that the grip is made of a material designed to give you a better grip, but it also tends to have small bits of hair stuck to it when you use it</li>
            <li> The first model last 3 years</li>
            <li> Now the thing won&#x27;t hold a charge and due to Amazon&#x27;s 30 day return policy it is no longer able to sent back for a replacement.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was my first and last WAHL and Ihighly recommend that you DO NOT purchase</li>
            <li> It exceeds  by far my expectations!</li>
            <li> I use regular blades and this was my first time using electric</li>
            <li> I first bought this last 2010 and now it has died on me, but it lasted 5 years!</li>
            <li> It will still be sharp, but the blades will cut ten times better when you oil them up</li>
            <li> Used it several times and haven&#x27;t even charged it but the first time when I got it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the trimmer doesn&#x27;t always trim so well on the first go over.&lt;br /&gt;Often, it takes several laps to trim the hair.</li>
            <li> For those using this unit for the first time pull the head off following the curve of the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite</li>
            <li> and he digs in his drawer and pulls out the exact same model.  </li>
            <li> It cuts pretty short, but not the shortest cut I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li> It does not come with the stand, just a bag, which though is nice for travelling, it&#x27;s not good if you want to keep it out on your bathroom shelf or vanity.</li>
            <li> but wow, its well made!</li>
            <li> I see more trimmers offer the Lithium batteries than they did a year ago, but not many in this price range.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want to charge or discharge them too much, but Lithium batteries generally have built in safeguards against that happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time I used it to trim my beard, it pulled on my whiskers several times.  </li>
            <li> I have used it once to trim, shave, cut and put it away only for it to still have good battery life a few weeks later.</li>
            <li> Charging it only takes a few hours and you are good to go for several weeks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a pretty decent trimmer kit that is capable of all basic facial hair managment.  </li>
            <li> The little organizing rack makes it easy to keep track of all the parts on your bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> The old one&#x27;s main trimming head was getting loud,</li>
            <li> still have to use a disposable double bladed razor to clean up the forementioned neck and cheek areas outside the beard</li>
            <li> Like the tools it has, especially the smaller head to clean up under lower lip.</li>
            <li> Wahl should at least offer the option to purchase a nice, fitted organizer - either soft traveler or hard counter style (better yet, both).</li>
            <li> There are very few better bargains in the world than the 32 bucks one will pay for this comprehensive grooming kit.</li>
            <li> this walh ion help my skin to be soft and nice :), but when i open the packcage, i notice some dirty in the handle,</li>
            <li> Like back in the day when it didn&#x27;t matter what kind of foreign iron you showed up with, you were going to get smoked by a big bore Chevy even if its doors didn&#x27;t quite shut.  </li>
            <li> I am replacing my old Wahl shaver with this new All in One Trimmer.  </li>
            <li> This thing is loud when it&#x27;s new and getts louder as it ages.</li>
            <li> it has a newly redesigned holding tray which will now hold all of the attachments (though the product packaging displays the old one).  </li>
            <li> I then took the metal gate off an old 3.5\\&quot; floppy and cut out replacement contacts which I soldered to the new battery.</li>
            <li> replaced the old one with this this new one.</li>
            <li> When I asked if I could have a replacement sent immediately if I paid with a credit card, she said I could do that too, and return the old one after the new one arrived.</li>
            <li> When I asked if I could have a replacement sent immediately if I paid with a credit card, she said I could do that too, and return the old one after the new one arrived.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of wahl products, they stay cool, have tight powerful motors, and have the sharpest ground blades....</li>
            <li> It charges super fast and has a very long lasting battery.</li>
            <li> The battery on this product stopped holding a charge in less than 2 years of light use.</li>
            <li> It cuts mor precise than previous conair and braun models.  </li>
            <li> It is light weight, the charge lasts incredibly long (unlike the nicad versions that could only make it through one trim before slooowwwwwiiiiiinnnnnnnggggg).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a small, cheap, plastic tray that doesn&#x27;t serve much purchase.</li>
            <li> I worked a long time at trying to figure out how to make them fit in as the picture shows until I finally realized that the tray in my package is not the one in the picture.  </li>
            <li> The attachments go on and off easily, yet stay on firmly.  </li>
            <li> For delicate work, like separating that unibrow into two separate eyebrows, the detail head works fine, though perhaps because of the small size of its face plate, it becomes uncomfortably warm during sustained use.  </li>
            <li> Because there is no light on unit or charger you can&#x27;t easily determine which part is malfunctioning.</li>
            <li> Nice size-not big, nor too small.</li>
            <li> It lasted 2 months of frequent use on its first charge, and I expect it to last for years.</li>
            <li> After 6-months the battery only held a 3-5 minute charge and requried a full 8hrs to charge back up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already lost some of  the smaller parts and have chosen to store the stuff in a small wire basket rather than the nice rack provided</li>
            <li> But to date I have only given it the initial full charge and there has been no noticable drop in battery power yet.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer at my local store and paid $45 for it, Amazon is offering a much better price ($32 as of this review), but it doesn&#x27;t change the fact that this trimmer is still not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have used several types of trimmers over the past several years, and while most were adequate for a while, they come nowhere close to this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a big deal to wipe it down with a damp cloth, but I would prefer to be able to just brush it off without a fight.</li>
            <li> This little trimmer deals with it just fine.  </li>
            <li> It was wonderful and easy to use, the smallest razor head is only about less than 1 cm wide, which is small enough to trim the hair between her tiny paws.</li>
            <li> Actually, if I have any complaint, it&#x27;s that it offers too many different capabilities by having way too many different attachments.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Purchased this trimmer 2 years ago and after a year and a half of great use it has become dull and no longer holds a charge have to charge for an hour and keep plugged in to shave my face</li>
            <li> which is why i (initially) gave the 3 star rating (have calld &amp; emaild wahl &amp; will update this review if i get a positive response fr them).</li>
            <li> As it turns out, the battery was the only positive thing about this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of all the positive comments about the battery, and I thought the variety of clippers would make it easier to shave all the different hair I have (body hair, sideburns, etc).  </li>
            <li> I mean, if you&#x27;ve gone a few days and need to clean yourself up without being all close-shaven, and you don&#x27;t have anything else handy, it can work.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is decent for fine hair but thicker beard hairs are very hard to be cut and you must be sloooow as to not pull your hair because it feels like it doesn&#x27;t fully cut through the hair at first</li>
            <li> I had to say that first because so many negative reviews obviously missed these words on the Operating Instructions that came with the unit, and they also do not appear on the Amazon website.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband after the old system died of old age!</li>
            <li> I have had 3 or 4 of these Wahl trimmers in the last 2 years, they use to be better, work well but don&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying for days, but I&#x27;ve been unable to reassemble the spring and whatnot, and I&#x27;m usually pretty good at fixing such things.</li>
            <li> I would avoid using the blades they have for getting a close shave, as well as the nose-hair trimmer if you have other tools for that, but even those are really not bad.</li>
            <li> This new one has an upgraded lithium ion battery that will last much longer.</li>
            <li> even when things work right, and the parts stay on, you get a pretty uneven trim--especially at the #1 setting.</li>
            <li> I agree with previous posters that the extra attachments would be better suited as an addition purchase if desired.</li>
            <li> As I have less hair than most, and pay the same..</li>
            <li> My space is precious and I would have preferred less attachments and a smaller footprint on my bathroom</li>
            <li> The only slight downside is the rubber gripping area is &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; and hair sticks to it.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re okay with #3 or less, then I can&#x27;t recommend this trimmer highly enough.</li>
            <li> I have been loyal to Wahl ever since I started cutting my own hair when I was ~15yo</li>
            <li> However I find that after one year of very light usage, a fully charged battery loses it charge in about a week.  </li>
            <li> I have a thick beard, and this helps out a lot with a very smooth trim/shave.</li>
            <li> When new it was powerful enough to get through my head and beard with ease several times.</li>
            <li> The mechanical parts work just fine, but the material on it rusts within a few uses.  </li>
            <li> I have no doubt that this will last just as long as my original Wahl.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product about a month ago, it worked fine for the few shaves</li>
            <li> Trimmed fine while it ran but now completely dead.</li>
            <li> Worked fine as a beard trimmer, two or three times a week until a few weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> This fine morning I could get it to turn in for a few seconds at a time, so</li>
            <li> Unlike other inexpensive groomers, these blades are meant to be maintained (a good thing, in my opinion), and come with a small bottle of lubricating oil.</li>
            <li> Anyway, a good to go little unit, and you can take the little charger with you when you travel.  </li>
            <li> The little organizer really isn&#x27;t worth much.</li>
            <li> The blades can get pretty hot and the smallest blade and foil shaver can get a little noisy.</li>
            <li> The sole purpose for my purchase was to have a little more customization when trimming my beard and although this product does supply that I cant believe the amount of hairs it just pulls out of my face.</li>
            <li> Sure it vibrates a little, but it&#x27;s lightweight and doesn&#x27;t have enough mass to absorb it all.</li>
            <li> Ultimately, though, I see this unit as a pretty decent deal - especially given the $32 price (sans shipping).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ultimately, though, I see this unit as a pretty decent deal - especially given the $32 price (sans shipping).  </li>
            <li> Dull blades rip out more hair than it cuts.</li>
            <li> The Lithium Ion battery system charges remarkably quickly, without the &amp;#34;memory&amp;#34; issues inherent with other battery powered trimmers.  </li>
            <li> The motor is very strong, the battery has a very long charge on it and it don&#x27;t take little to no time to charge.</li>
            <li> These clippers are not precise or accurate in their clipping.</li>
            <li> And, it&#x27;s not very easy to clean it.</li>
            <li> The Wahl not only has great battery life, but an amazingly powerful motor that allows for even cutting with only one or two passes of the beard.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s advertised as \\&quot;All in One\\&quot; and clearly has lots of options....</li>
            <li> However, as a nose hair or ear hair trimmer, it is clearly inferior to any with rotary heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For body hair trimming, this device is clearly inferior to the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> the various combs just don&#x27;t fit well and sometimes loosen and come off while trimming (giving you a really crappy, uneven beard until you see what&#x27;s happened)&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is clearly an issue with their batteries.</li>
            <li> Meanwhile my package was clearly used since it had finger marks all over it.</li>
            <li> So far that is the only real problem I have with it.  </li>
            <li> would clearly buy this item again and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Steer clear of this god-awful product.  </li>
            <li> But the guide does not have rounded edges and therefore by the time you complete the shave, you are left with very irritated skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t entirely clear what all the attachments are for though...</li>
            <li> Once intercourse with her exposed steel water directly</li>
            <li> It is a bit loud, but not unbearable.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for a friend and so far he loves it.  </li>
            <li> No complaints so far, but</li>
            <li> My old trimmer, with no guard, did not cut as close...</li>
            <li> So far it is performing well.  </li>
            <li> I contacted WAHL and they said this should not be used anywhere near water</li>
            <li> I am getting ready to buy this trimmer for the third time.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works very well, especially compared to the Conair 13-piece that I had before this.  </li>
            <li> Loud.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very versatile with multiple attachments for trimming beards, as a nose-ear-eyebrow timmer, stubble shaver and hair clipper.  </li>
            <li> If I find myself running late in the morning the shaver works okay, but nothing I would use every day.  </li>
            <li> Battery lasted far longer than anything I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> Idk what the guy is talking about when his review states that this trimmer is too loud.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned it so far.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beast, seems to actually dim the lights when you turn it on (semi-kidding here</li>
            <li> I find the charge life is no-where near what was advertised.  </li>
            <li> I have been trimming it since I was young.</li>
            <li> In comparing the two, the Wahl has a MUCH stronger motor and solid feel.</li>
            <li> Eventually, my old cordless basically became corded.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product as replacement for an old failing electric hair clipper.</li>
            <li> My 10 year old cheaper Remington still works.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this product to replace a Wahl trimmer that I had used for nearly 15 years.</li>
            <li> loud noises</li>
            <li> This would result in around $10 (or 25% of the purchase price) to get it fixed.    </li>
            <li> I gave my two year old a haircut and even using the longest clipper</li>
            <li> As a frequent traveler i wish it was 220v compatible as well.    </li>
            <li> It comes with every conceivable attachment, making it versatile for any use you can think of.</li>
            <li> B001E0C9LI Philips Norelco BG2030 Professional BodyGrooming System]]</li>
            <li> Some reviewers have noted that the trimmer is loud &amp; bothersome.</li>
            <li> Each time, I worry I&#x27;m going to break the plastic tabs (haven&#x27;t yet, though, thanks to the solid construction).  </li>
            <li> Will post an update about whether this gets fixed and the timing.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s plugged in, it won&#x27;t switch from the ni-cad cell to just direct power.</li>
            <li> Of course, I had to buy another Wahl trimmer to fill in, but I&#x27;m betting they&#x27;re getting the battery issue fixed.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time to trim my beard and it took me twice as long to get the cut hair off the sticky rubber as it did to cut the beard.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too loud, it&#x27;s hair clippers after all.</li>
            <li> Overall, though, I really like this clipper and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> and it works so far as advertised.</li>
            <li> The item is as described and has completely met and exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li> Very durable and hold a charge for several weeks at a time.</li>
            <li> Note that the shiny segment of the body near the blade is plastic, not metal as it may appear in the pictures.</li>
            <li> I would not buy this razor until this flaw is fixed.</li>
            <li> Battery is completely DOA.  </li>
            <li> I got my Wahl Lithium Ion Trimmer in the mail yesterday and even without a complete charge up</li>
            <li> All extra pieces really work well</li>
            <li> I chuckle at the reviews that complain it&#x27;s too loud.</li>
            <li> At least Wahl products are better than the Conair junk.</li>
            <li> trimmer from Wahl offers all the trimming capabilities that any man could want.  </li>
            <li> there are plenty of different attachments included which is really nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it to trim my beard, since I can&#x27;t shave because of my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I am very dissatisfied with the product and advise -</li>
            <li> Seems it would be at home in a professional portable kit.</li>
            <li> (I keep my pate at about \\&quot;stubble level\\&quot; because I prefer that over complete smoothness.)</li>
            <li> Quality and wow</li>
            <li> , my review, do NOT waste your money on this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I got about four years use out of the old one, it had a Ni-MH battery in it, so</li>
            <li> Soft rubber grip on the handle of the trimmer</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is loud.  </li>
            <li> As far as noise and vibration, its a hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> this thing is loud.</li>
            <li> I have used this three times so far without re-charging.</li>
            <li> A soft travel case is needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Who wants back and shoulder stubble?</li>
            <li> Battery now runs about 8 minutes before completely losing its charge.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband to replace his old one.  </li>
            <li> Since my old one gave out I have been sampling trimmers.  </li>
            <li> Wow</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my husband and he used it for 1.5 months when it completely stopped working.</li>
            <li> his old trimmer was on</li>
            <li> Overall I use it about 3-4 times a week and really like it.</li>
            <li> The case does not hold all of the attachments, although that really makes no difference to me personally.  </li>
            <li> Even 2 days old beard can be taken care of.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Completely dissatisfied with this</li>
            <li> I had to replace my old Wahl beard trimmer with a non-replaceable Ni-Cad battery that no longer holds a charge.  </li>
            <li> The heads are interchangeable with my old unit.  </li>
            <li> I DO like the soft case that holds everything in one place --</li>
            <li> The battery lasts much longer on this one, I only have to charge every once in awhile.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t come with the guides like our old one</li>
            <li> I tend to avoid shaving until the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow gets pretty long, and like to use a trimmer before shaving with a blade.</li>
            <li> I use it without a guard to simulate the effect of shaving, and that is as far as I can review it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I always wondered how Patrick Demsey -- Dr. Derek McDreamy on \\&quot;Gray&#x27;s Anatomy\\&quot; -- always manages to keep what looks like a three-day old shadow, without ever being completely clean-shaven or bearded.  </li>
            <li> but I was a way too busy to see it...</li>
            <li> Although this does get somewhat close, my old buzzer (Remington I believe) seems to get closer.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t seem to find another one like my old one that gets as close.</li>
            <li> As a mostly bald man with occasional beards, I needed a trimmer that could keep my facial hair short and occasionally cut my hair.</li>
            <li> Lasted about 3 months then stopped working completely.</li>
            <li> Plenty of power - cuts my beard with no trouble.  </li>
            <li> The battery, by the way, is a 3.7V 750mAh Li-ion (14500) and is soldered directly to the PCB.</li>
            <li> That will be painfully obvious as soon as you pick it up, though it really hits home with a peek inside.</li>
            <li> They are used frequently and seldom need charged.  </li>
            <li> i drop mine frequently</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace another Wahl that was 14 years old.  </li>
            <li> I have had different types but with these I felt like a real barber I was changing heads and everything.</li>
            <li> This is by far the sharpest electric trimmer I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s one feature I miss about my old trimmer ...</li>
            <li> I am an old man</li>
            <li> So far, it has worked like I thought it would.  </li>
            <li> For some reason, this one does not hold it&#x27;s charge as well as the old nicads.  </li>
            <li> Wahl is the #1 choice of professional barbers.  </li>
            <li> my old one</li>
            <li> Seems to work very well, but I&#x27;ve only used it once.</li>
            <li> I bought these clippers for my husband to replace an old one he had that broke.</li>
            <li> so far all Walh trimmer i got</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Strong and powerfull to complete the job</li>
            <li> What I learned is that there are two &#x27;levels&#x27; of product; professional and home use.</li>
            <li> The professional product to which I was accustomed</li>
            <li> THIS IS BY FAR</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, but I&#x27;ve never had a foil shaver irritate my face like</li>
            <li> The picture made these look larger than they really are.</li>
            <li> I had to dedicate an old toothbrush to it just to remove cut hair that would cling to it.</li>
            <li> Not quite professional quality, but as close as you can get in the home market</li>
            <li> I researched a bit and found you shouldn&#x27;t let the LI battery completely discharge which I did.</li>
            <li> - My old Remington had an adjustable blade guard</li>
            <li> I took an old toothbrush and removed all the corrosion</li>
            <li> I recommend purchasing a Wahl professional versus this unit.</li>
            <li> old Samoyed dog who&#x27;s hair is like couch stuffing.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for the last three weeks now and its working very well.</li>
            <li> Stopped working completely after a charge, was not heavily used.  </li>
            <li> Like the clippers, easier to hold than an old Wahl clippers</li>
            <li> Then we got one for my 15 year old son.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work like my old pair.</li>
            <li> This won&#x27;t be a big deal since we have a very convenient outlet in our bathroom.  </li>
            <li> Orig 3 yrs old but still works even with drop.</li>
            <li> I see lots of reviews for this junky trimmer, and it won&#x27;t matter much to its overall rating, but I must add my two cents.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The trimmer is comfortably light, with just enough heft to feel solid but not enough to tire my hand.</li>
            <li> His noticed a difference from his old one immediately.</li>
            <li> Even plugging it in directly to the charger did not help in just getting it on.</li>
            <li> and it completely stopped.</li>
            <li> So far I have had this a month and have used all the attachments and blade</li>
            <li> I kept it plugged into a faulty socket without realizing, and found out that the product had completely drained itself.</li>
            <li> I bought this since my old buzzer kicked the bucket.  </li>
            <li> Requires frequent cleaning which means you need a screwdriver to take it apart.</li>
            <li> my old one.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Wahl Lithium Ion trimmer because my old trimmer I had used for years was a Wahl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> storage case is cheesy and cheap, I am glad it is only the storage tray.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> far, I&#x27;ve ran this out of power once, but it was intentional.</li>
            <li> but I really felt that I should, especially as someone who has owned this product for over 6 months.</li>
            <li> The fixed guides are too short.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the tray that holds it and all the attachments isn&#x27;t nearly big enough and looks cheap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had mine for over 4  years now and although it&#x27;s starting to lose it&#x27;s charge fast</li>
            <li> I have used a ConAir before until it got too old and started to make a noise</li>
            <li> I really forgot when was the last time I&#x27;ve charged it.</li>
            <li> You wouldn&#x27;t think one could buy a quality, US-made product like this for such a reasonable price, but here it is.  </li>
            <li> But I would rather spend the extra $20 for the stainless version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old Wahl trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I used to keep the old one plugged in all the time, but with this one I just charge it once</li>
            <li> It charges fast, shaves/trims well, has every thing you&#x27;re likely to need, and</li>
            <li> It did come with a lot of different depth combs and three width razors which make it very versatile.</li>
            <li> This product is a complete piece of junk.</li>
            <li> Any complain so far...</li>
            <li> It is a bit loud for am shaving while everyone else is sleeping.</li>
            <li> Complete piece of s</li>
            <li> I just bought another this week, they have made some changes: it now has a soft rubber handle, it&#x27;s a sticky rubber and</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive face, and don&#x27;t like to shave every day, so between</li>
            <li> Of course that&#x27;s because all my old trimmers had NiMH</li>
            <li> Stopped working completely after two.</li>
            <li> After using it once or twice a month, it&#x27;s completely stopped working in under two years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found the key to getting a very close trim that doesn&#x27;t even look like a stubble look.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame my old wahl attachments don&#x27;t work with</li>
            <li> I have read the offers from Wahl to call and follow up on the warranty</li>
            <li> I once let my beard grow, completely untamed for over six months.</li>
            <li> Replaced 20 year old unit.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I just got this for my beard and it does everything so far.</li>
            <li> However I&#x27;m going to print the label and return the old one</li>
            <li> It charges completely in an hour .... and holds a charge for weeks.</li>
            <li> WOW, works like a charm.</li>
            <li> I used to have to charge my old clipper for hours just before needing to use it.</li>
            <li> The package is complete and has all you&#x27;d need to groom yourself</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m glad some people found use for this, but i agree with the negative reviews, DO NOT BUY PLEASE.</li>
            <li> Eventually the battery died and it is too old to replace.  </li>
            <li> I bought this in early May of 2012.</li>
            <li> Totally, completely.  </li>
            <li> I really like these clippers, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this since early January.</li>
            <li> it was too loud &amp; too rusty and wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After one day of use it completely stopped working.</li>
            <li> but then the battery started declining and couldn&#x27;t last more than a few minutes before having to plug it in again.</li>
            <li> This is a rare problem, but there&#x27;s really no excuse.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I personally bought mine from Amazon for $23.00 W/ shipping which is way cheaper than any retail store and for the ladies that are looking to get their boyfriend/husband/family member a gift this will definitely put a smile on anyone&#x27;s face.    </li>
            <li> I believe a non-lithium version is also sold, sometimes for the same price.&lt;br /&gt;There are a few things that could be improved on:&lt;br /&gt;- a better organizer for all the accessory pieces&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using these, he came up to me with a big smile on his face and said, \\&quot;look how short it gets my hair!  </li>
            <li> The narrow head, I think, allows better control and access to smaller areas.</li>
            <li> Overall solid though and worth the price.</li>
            <li> If you need to buzz clip heads regularly then get something more heavy duty.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s narrow enough to get in your nose and snip those pesky hairs, so what more do you want from it?</li>
            <li> The Wahl lithium all-in-one is 4-star clipper... not perfect, but damn good for the price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it is so difficult to find a good trimmer/groomer these days.  </li>
            <li> Its a good purchase though for Lithium battery life and when in countries that use weird 50Hz AC, I now have a rechargeable clipper.</li>
            <li> but once again walh fails to deliver a good product.</li>
            <li> Things like, the electric shaver just seems kind of unnecessary to me.  </li>
            <li> Not great, still kind of works, but</li>
            <li> I hate required reviews but for this I will tell you it is the best on the market</li>
            <li> good but difficult to charge</li>
            <li> really like the way it cuts and even a newer Norelco trimmer that I got doesn&#x27;t cut as good as this Wahl does, but the rubber grip drives crazy.</li>
            <li> I use this product for anything hair, except the hair on top of my head, which is extremely thick and curly.</li>
            <li> : This is a very capable beard trimmer with a very long battery life.</li>
            <li> Looking at the materials and construction of the various attachments to the trimmer motor, it is easy to tell that they won&#x27;t last long if used</li>
            <li> Just because I only use one attachment 90% of the time doesn&#x27;t mean the others wont come in handy once in a while.  </li>
            <li> gets used everyday and is always ready when called upon - just the right accessories were included with this purchase</li>
            <li> When the work is done, it can be turned back right side out and pulled back over the body into place with a bit of effort.</li>
            <li> Your likely using this in front of a mirror in a bathroom, there is likely an outlet right there.  </li>
            <li> If you would like a trimmer that will leave you hanging half way through your morning shave, you have found the right one!  </li>
            <li> Wahl has a reputation for good professional trimmers, but they really dropped the ball on this one due to poor quality accessories.  </li>
            <li> Even the screen shaver attachment is still working good, and I used that about half of every day for the past 4.5 years too.  </li>
            <li> Overall, my beard looks better than ever--the 2 other trimmers I used to use were both in the same price range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The lack of a carrying case is particularly felt with such a large number of attachments, and a vacuum feature to capture hair clippings would be a nice-to-have.</li>
            <li> I use this every other day before work, it lets me keep a light beard (sporadic since my facial hair hasn&#x27;t decided to fully grow out at the age of 27).</li>
            <li> The accessory tray is too small and attachments fall out easily.</li>
            <li> The older model had a similar rubber handle that seemed slightly easier to clean.</li>
            <li> Also previously mentioned is the fact that the rubber grip tends to attract and hold clipped whiskers, which is true.</li>
            <li> If you have a trimmer for a long thick beard you would like to recommend, we would love to know the brand and model!</li>
            <li> Lithium ion battery is superior to other types commonly used in shavers and trimmers.</li>
            <li> I liked about this one was the special \\&quot;detail\\&quot; trimming head that was less wide than normal and could help shape a goatee or get into hard to reach places.  </li>
            <li> I use a trimmer regularly to trim my beard when it starts to get a little too long and have always just kind of excepted that the trim was not that even.</li>
            <li> Do NOT buy into \\&quot;super strong titanium coated blades\\&quot; \\&quot;blades that never need oiling\\&quot; and any other claim from trimmers with standard batteries and CHEAP blades that WILL fail and need to be replaced.  </li>
            <li> I then have to clean it out before it works a little longer.</li>
            <li> But since that first charge ran out, I can&#x27;t seem to get a single shave out of this thing without it dying.  </li>
            <li> the main problem:&lt;br /&gt;- too many poor quality attachments.</li>
            <li> Normally there is a light that goes from red (charging) to green (charged), but for this trimmer you just plug it in and let it charge overnight.  </li>
            <li> The other plastic parts I would never use I just threw away, considered them \\&quot;fluff\\&quot; to make me think I got my monies worth.  </li>
            <li> other reviews mention, the grip does get hairs stuck to it, but it&#x27;s worth it - just rinse your hands after using it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried any other trimmers but this thing is worth</li>
            <li> One small issue is that the main razor attachment tends to pop out a tad easily, so that when I&#x27;m removing a plastic attachment I tend to remove both at the same time, but that might just be me.</li>
            <li> The motor is powerful and the blades are sharp.</li>
            <li> A Wahl representative responded to my original amazon comment stating that my comment (that is, my quotation of product warranty) does not accurately reflect Wahl&#x27;s service.</li>
            <li> Though it took some getting used to (having to change the guards) over my older one which had a single adjustable guard, I grew accustomed to having the security of knowing that it wasn&#x27;t going to slip from a number 6 to a 2 and leave me looking like high school</li>
            <li> After a few more months the other blade also broke the same exact way.</li>
            <li> Soaking in toilet water over night doesnt really help a trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve said this, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll have to charge it sometime this week, but the point is the charge is ridiculously</li>
            <li> Because the teeth on the comb are too small for facial hair it misses a lot of the hair and you have to go over your face many times.</li>
            <li> didnt expect that much less this quickly.</li>
            <li> the LI-Ion battery holds a decent charge (about a week with daily use.  </li>
            <li> The second time was ok, but again, the attachment was so small it would have taken all day to try to shave.    </li>
            <li> Powerful, long lasting charge, lots of clipping/trimming/detailing options and a tray to keep all the parts together...</li>
            <li> Not only are the blades on the Wahl much higher quality, the various attachments cover all the bases.</li>
            <li> Same design as the older model, but</li>
            <li> Buy a cheap one, not worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> This shaver has a long lasting, powerful battery.</li>
            <li> The rubber grip does seem to hold on to bits of hair, but a quick wipe with a slightly damp wash cloth removes them</li>
            <li> The extra blade is the main asset.</li>
            <li> Worked fine until it broke less than 6 months later.</li>
            <li> But battery lasts and a decent shave overall</li>
            <li> The main problem I have is switching between the different settings is a bit tricky without practice.</li>
            <li> it actually did a surprisingly decent job</li>
            <li> Finally, getting the various attachments on/off the main unit isn&#x27;t easy (especially with wet hands/fingers).  </li>
            <li> , so I will say that this trimmer lasted me over a year before the main blade finally cracked &amp; broke.</li>
            <li> It was a replacement for an older model that lasted several years.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Although it comes with attachments for cutting the hair on top of your head, I can&#x27;t imagine this would really be strong enough for that job.</li>
            <li> I had the older model, basically the same trimmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still searching for a decent electric - should have gone back to Norelco I guess.</li>
            <li> This was my third attempt at finding a decent trimmer.</li>
            <li> this isn&#x27;t an item you want only sometimes working, especially if you need it for work, which was exactly the case.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even find a YouTube video about putting this particular model back together.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m using it wrong, which I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li> I had several criteria for this: it had to hold a charge for a long time, cut hair well, and had to be fun to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really liked this trimmer, but in a little less than one year it won&#x27;t hold a charge.  </li>
            <li> This is not due to lack of attachments, as there are nearly a dozen included.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it take forever to shave due to the small head size but it doesn&#x27;t do that good of a job at shaving(doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Wahl may not be quite as slick in their marketing as other consumer product companies, but their basic product is a good value.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers commented on the beard clipper pulling hairs -- they are so right.  </li>
            <li> After owning this Wahl Lithium Ion facial hair trimmer for 2 weeks one of the blades began making a high pitched buzzing noise.</li>
            <li> Obviously the trimmer blade is defective and one would expect this to be covered by their highly touted FIVE YEAR WARRANTY.  </li>
            <li> The blades are fine and precise but the cutting path is slightly narrower than my full size trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The compnents show high quality and work quite well, especially for trimming beards and sideburns.</li>
            <li> I already owned a similar trimmer made by Remmington, but this new WAHL trimmer completely trumps the Remington in performance.  </li>
            <li> It was powerful, and the charge would last a VERY long time.</li>
            <li> I then punched them back through the trimmer&#x27;s board, touched them up with a little more solder and snapped the case back together.</li>
            <li> I picked up a replacement battery from one of those Chinese online retailers (you know, where you might go if you wanted to find a \\&quot;deal\\&quot; that was \\&quot;extreme\\&quot;) and bought a pair of 3.7v 900mAh Li-ions for less than $5 with free shipping.</li>
            <li> Seems like it would have been easy to attach a real razor head, but alas</li>
            <li> They honored the 5 year limited warranty (longest we&#x27;ve seen, to be sure), and a few weeks later, a working trimmer complete with brand new blades arrived.</li>
            <li> I got used to holding them a certain way to minimize injuries, but after using other trimmers and not having to be so careful during normal use, this one can only be described as mildly dangerous at best...</li>
            <li> In addition, the box says very clearly made in USA, and the various items are clearly marked &amp;#34;China&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> The battery really does last a long time and charges quickly, the blades cut well, and the attachments all seem to perform as expected.  </li>
            <li> It stays charged for a long time and is always ready when you need it.</li>
            <li> , happy that it plugs directly into unit; no base charger (which I hate to would travel with!).</li>
            <li> If a longer stint away from home is required, its small wall-wart DC adapter would fit inside of a dopp kit without any trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gives a very close trim and the battery lasts long.  </li>
            <li> It charges fast and stays charged for a long time.</li>
            <li> Battery has lasted a long time without a charge, I do keep a very close beard by using the closest shave attachment.</li>
            <li> ok but not as wide as I thought it was , but I kept it for emergencies , only about 1 inch wide</li>
            <li> - Charges fast and runs long.  </li>
            <li> retail package has the usual number of cheap combs and brushes.</li>
            <li> I really like the long battery life.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t sound like a vaccuum cleaner at 6 am) and he has no &#x27;gripping&#x27; problems.</li>
            <li> and the whole bunch will be in the trash, and I will learn once again the truth of the old saying that \\&quot;poor people can&#x27;t afford cheap things.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> It is small and light weight.</li>
            <li> I barely got around 20 uses from the trimmer before it completely stopped working.</li>
            <li> I liked the small nose/ear trimmer head, but never once used any of the other attachments.    </li>
            <li> Last but not least,</li>
            <li> Wow - this little clipper really has the power and holds the charge!!</li>
            <li> It just seems such a waste that \\&quot;made in China\\&quot; products never seem to last more than two years.  </li>
            <li> It is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> I spent years using scissors to keep it under control before buying my first electric trimmer.</li>
            <li> I was able to trim my mustache and occasionally extend my haircut a few extra weeks.  </li>
            <li> First the wide width trimmer broke, then the ear/nose hair trimmer broke.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was pretty excited about the precision detailer attachment because I&#x27;m tired of having a bunch of grooming tools in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> Long story short,  It cuts evenly and smoothly, holds a charge forever and will last you at least 4 years (thats how old my original one is.)</li>
            <li> It was also pretty loud as other reviewers noted.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve taken this trimmer to many different places i&#x27;ve lived, other countries, and even on a cross country bicycle trip (to keep me from looking like a total bum).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for about 2.5 years, and the battery is only holding a charge for about 10 minutes, and the plastic case is separating where the attachments go in, so they don&#x27;t have as tight of fit as they should have.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing; especially since we are very happy with our Wahl clippers.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be doing a lot of changing either, but the little I played with the parts they seemed adequate.</li>
            <li> More expensive razors are washable - that would be nice but those are typically 2 - 3 times more expensive.</li>
            <li> The quality of clipper wins hand down.</li>
            <li> It is so powerful it always gets the job done with out any hang ups or clogs or bogging down.</li>
            <li> We took it out of the packaging and was surprised to see that it worked without even needed to charge it for the first time, man this battery must last a long time!</li>
            <li> power supply is small and light, but it&#x27;s only 120V - a problem for me because I live in a dual-voltage house.</li>
            <li> I constantly get &amp;#34;bare spots&amp;#34; where the hair is essentially clipped right at the skin, or just barely above.</li>
            <li> However, this one seems a little cheaply made and the on-off button has already popped off, but clicks back on.  </li>
            <li> You have to go over it several times to get a smooth feel and it can be a little noisy, but every one of these type of razors I&#x27;ve had were that way.</li>
            <li> Missed hairs on a regular basis but is very powerful and it makes for a quick trim, just requires a few extra passes than expected.</li>
            <li> only complaint, albeit minor, is that I use it to trim existing stubble... and the cutter with NO guard on it cuts very close, and the smallest guard leaves more stubble than I would like.</li>
            <li> Wahl cut more hair than my battery powered Panasonic nose trimmer, which was under powered, and had a hard time starting up.</li>
            <li> like other reviewers said, the clips are fragile, and even while gently trying to remove it, the whole head came off with the attachment.  </li>
            <li> It does not cut as short as I prefer, so I bought a new one a couple of months ago.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Two weeks later I received a brand new trimmer in the mail.</li>
            <li> Now I am in the market on buying a new one, possibly this one again.       </li>
            <li> So, instead of having my wife search all over creation for the parts and charger back home, I&#x27;ll just pay $40 to have a new set shipped.</li>
            <li> That being said, these trimmers set a new standard for power and trim level.</li>
            <li> This new lithium-ion battery (the same type as in notebooks/netbooks/tablets, etc.)</li>
            <li> I recently called to order a new head that had been lost.</li>
            <li> The product was receive in new condition and functions as advertised, the only negitive is I could not figure out how to store all the attachments in the holder provided.</li>
            <li> The variable length attachment and other single length attachments are extremely cheap.</li>
            <li> Fast charging that lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> It works very well for my use and it does hold a charge for very long.</li>
            <li> Was not very powerful when charged the first time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works great not only for beards but for trimming just about anywhere, though I&#x27;m still too chicken to try the clipper blade for a self-clipped #2 haircut - I think I&#x27;ll stick with a cost-cutters type vendor for those.  </li>
            <li> The blade and guard design never gave me a clean, even shave, and creating fades never worked as well as it had with my previous (or current) Norelco.  </li>
            <li> This is smaller than you would expect, but seriously cuts hair, trims beards better than my old clunky NiMH cordless clippers.</li>
            <li> A lot of times when companies make disposable electronics like this, they will at least make the battery easy to remove (once you&#x27;ve destroyed the thing by opening it up)</li>
            <li> But so far I am much happier than expected.</li>
            <li> All the accessories are nicely made, the unit lasts forever between charges, and the cutting blades seems to work very well...</li>
            <li> Battery last pretty long.</li>
            <li> I found that the only useful attachments are the blades and not really the shaver attachment.</li>
            <li> Holds a long charge and runs for a long time, lots of useful tools and attachments.  </li>
            <li> I said that they didn&#x27;t get back to me fast enough</li>
            <li> It can do everything from shaving to standard haircuts to more complex \\&quot;man-scaping.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I can charge the trimmer over night, but the next day when it comes time to use it, it will only fast for 5 minutes of use.  </li>
            <li> It has only 6 settings where most of the dedicated trimmers have at least twice that.</li>
            <li> I know I shouldn&#x27;t have expected much, but I was surprised at what I found.</li>
            <li> sure, the stand it comes with is largely useless as the moment you brush your hand against it, the whole thing collapses.  </li>
            <li> Only thing I wish was that there was a bar to show you how much power was left on the trimmer</li>
            <li> This product is not what I expected it does not hold a charge,stays on chager if not for  an hour or more it will be dead when needed</li>
            <li> It finally died out on me when I left it plugged in charging for 4 days straight.</li>
            <li> I only use them for my beard, of which I like to keep very trim and short...</li>
            <li> First and foremost, it still just doesn&#x27;t charge the battery long enough and the electricity isn&#x27;t a bypass.</li>
            <li> too much 4 me to getto p[ost office, but i have learned to buy local, since my recent purchases have been disapointing</li>
            <li> Not liking for a bar to waste space, just simple light.</li>
            <li> a man in his later mid-life who wants to maintain a well-groomed appearance, I find regular trimming of nose and ear hair</li>
            <li> This thing has plenty of power to easily cut through a thick beard without issue.</li>
            <li> I use this once or twice a week for routine trimming - nothing super heavy duty.</li>
            <li> Well built and strong for thick hair.</li>
            <li> It has stayed sharp and so long as I clean it properly, works as well as the day it was new.  </li>
            <li> Plus they are located right down the road in Sterling</li>
            <li> Right down to the skin.  </li>
            <li> I placed the cutter head along side the one off my aging MB200 on a scanner and it&#x27;s very apparent  </li>
            <li> I now have a 2 step process, I use this one first to trim down to close and then my old one to get even closer.</li>
            <li> I would MUCH rather have had a single higher-quality blade.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> It stays pretty sharp when oiled</li>
            <li> This was the one and major flaw I found with this product.</li>
            <li> Since I used none of the other attachments, I wonder - if they broke the first time used.... of course, they would no be covered either.  </li>
            <li> I have very coarse facial hair that usually has to be taken off with a Mach 3 or better blade.</li>
            <li> Acts like blades not sharp and/or sticking.</li>
            <li> i ever came across no other words for it</li>
            <li> Changing the attachments is a snap, and the trim blades cut close but are not sharp and don&#x27;t snag your skin.</li>
            <li> No other Wahl product I have owned has ever done that.  </li>
            <li> Then, the case is easily pried open, using a small screwdriver.</li>
            <li> Saved me from spending at least $70 more, and from the hassle and irritation of old fashioned shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After about 6 months, the battery holds almost no charge, so it must be plugged in for several minutes prior to and during use.</li>
            <li> Since your face isn&#x27;t a flat surface and it&#x27;s elastic, you are pretty much guaranteed to end up with a patchy beard because the curve of the comb will not successfully keep the blade at a consistent length away from your skin.  </li>
            <li> When changing accessories it is necessary to occasionally clean the hair shavings off of the driving areas, and they have grease on them - that&#x27;s what the little brush is for.</li>
            <li> It has both a small and large blade set, but I don&#x27;t see that I&#x27;ll ever use the large blade.</li>
            <li> It would be nice to just pop out the bad one and pop in a replacement vs. buying a whole new trimmer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It would be nice to just pop out the bad one and pop in a replacement vs. buying a whole new trimmer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The heads and the various cutting guides attach easily and precisely.    </li>
            <li> Also, the attachments are not long enough for my hair, which normally takes a 4 and a 5 attachment.</li>
            <li> This particular trimmer is Lithium-Ion (Li-Ion), and that means a long time between charges.  </li>
            <li> I rarely used any of the other accessories that came with it but for the price it definitely did what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But, I think  the blade teeth are too fine to accommodate thick hair.</li>
            <li> Product works very well, only reason for rating it a four stars is because it pulls the hair a little at certain angles.</li>
            <li> A great trimmer and the only minor complaint I have is that it doesn&#x27;t trim as close to my face as the previous trimmers did.</li>
            <li> This is one powerful little trimmer.  </li>
            <li> The attachments snap on and snap off a certain way that can be a little difficult at first, but gets easier as you do it more often.</li>
            <li> I have tried several other products, and this one is the best for overall cutting and trimming.  </li>
            <li> I expected a mediocre trimmer, similar to the other brands I&#x27;ve owned, but this is superb.</li>
            <li> Then I went back to my other trimmers and found out that this thing has power and will cut more and not bog down like the others.</li>
            <li> Very small, easy to transport.</li>
            <li> I think Wahl should be ashamed to ship one of their motors with cheap plastic accessories that fall apart if you stare at them too hard.  </li>
            <li> Seems fine, only used once, tried a few of the different fixtures</li>
            <li> The cheap Philips it replaced lasted 4 years, and was dull, but still running when I \\&quot;retired\\&quot; it.    </li>
            <li> Overall this is a powerful trimmer with sharp blades and nice construction, loaded down with attachments that either don&#x27;t work properly or add very little value.  </li>
            <li> great first few uses then went dull switched heads and that one went dull rite away</li>
            <li> I always trusted Wahl and spent a little more on this one compared to others I found that got the same reviews.</li>
            <li> When I do need to recharge it takes very little time to be up to full.  </li>
            <li> The last \\&quot;con\\&quot; is the real deal-killer for me, as I could live with the other ones.  </li>
            <li> In response to the Negative reviews below, I have not found them to be accurate.    </li>
            <li> first I was scratching my head a few times before I was brave enough to remove the default cutting attachment.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The attachments in general are a bit of a pain, as everyone else mentions.</li>
            <li> I bought this device about a year ago because Wahl is a brand of trimmers that I generally trust.  </li>
            <li> A wimpy razor - two star, and a confusing amalgam of plastic parts that don&#x27;t really fit so well together.</li>
            <li> Though the handle is comfortable to hold, hair and skin flakes stick to it and is almost near impossible to clean off.    </li>
            <li> This is quite minor... and more of a piece of information than a complaint.</li>
            <li> I ended up buying a second small foil head shaver for that detailed touch up work.</li>
            <li> Nothing about the performance of this trimmer&#x27;s shaver head has changed my mind, and for shaving the entire face it is clearly inferior to the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> and I really like the fact that the battery doesn&#x27;t drain when not in use (product claim as I haven&#x27;t owned it long enough to truly test this out).</li>
            <li> But I did that in the past and spent a lot more money, dropped it &amp; broke.  </li>
            <li> Cuts very close and battery lasts long enough</li>
            <li> only minor complaint is the head changing: To me part of the most important portion of the printed directions the pictures are too small to see.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t make it through an entire shave before switching to my old trimmer that has wider teeth.</li>
            <li> After using for a while a charge barely lasts for one trimming session.</li>
            <li> I only wish I&#x27;d have thrown away my old trimmer a year ago and bought this one.</li>
            <li> It has enough reserve power to give a complete haircut, assuming you are not an ape.</li>
            <li> - Wow, different opinion.</li>
            <li> (always don&#x27;t use too much pressure, be careful),</li>
            <li> already (actually it is 5 months old).</li>
            <li> They are sending me a replacement, and when I receive it, I am to send the old one back.</li>
            <li> say 3 days later and find that it had completely discharged of all power or did so within minutes of use, and thus needed my plugging into a socket.</li>
            <li> They barely trim stubble.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, it completely died after about the third month I had it.</li>
            <li> and so far have only charged the battery at the time I opened the box.  </li>
            <li> I too draw weary of the old cadmium rechargeable battery shortcomings (short charge durations + memory problems).     </li>
            <li> The handle material attracts hairs but a Wahl video on youtube explained that wiping with a wet cloth cleans it off very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this set barely over a year and use it twice a month.  </li>
            <li> The clipper blade could be larger as it takes quite a while to complete the job.  </li>
            <li> My only recommendation to Wahl is to add a light indicator that starts out red when you begin charging and turns to green when the battery is fully charged.</li>
            <li> My old drug store Conair lasted ten times longer.</li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected very unprofessional feel pulls a lot of hair</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m back to the old brand.</li>
            <li> Who wants to keep a wet towel with a bunch of hair in their bathroom?</li>
            <li> I bought this in March, now it&#x27;s barely August.  </li>
            <li> I use the shaver everyday, and it does ok, as long as I don&#x27;t actually try to use it on my entire face, because that just isn&#x27;t happening.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The wide trimmer and accessories meant for hair trimming I really haven&#x27;t tried and probably won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> but I barely had it for 4 months and</li>
            <li> The last star could be earned if Wahl fixed the two criticisms below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wahl needs to go back to the old design.  </li>
            <li> and it would last longer far from the truth</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this product would hold up under constant professional use, but it might.  </li>
            <li> Barely usable after a year of using once per week to trim beard.  </li>
            <li> After 6 weeks of use, he is wanting to replace it as it frequently pulls on his facial hair.  </li>
            <li> So far those are still built to last.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only 14 months old..</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how well it did until I had to revert back to my old unit to get by until I could replace this one.  </li>
            <li> I ended up having to fall back on my old Philips Norelco groomer anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Went back to his old one.</li>
            <li> To be fair, my trimmer is pretty old, maybe 5 years, and I&#x27;ve just sucked it up and lived with it even though it&#x27;s been getting worse and worse since there does not appear to be any way for the user to change batteries on this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> as big as the M/S attachment on old clippers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so upset that this one apparently had no durability at all.</li>
            <li> When you open it up the battery is a 3.7v 750mah AA size, but it is soldered directly to the circuit board.</li>
            <li> Had another trimmer (different brand completely) that crapped out on me.</li>
            <li> Only time will tell if this lasts longer than my old norelco.  </li>
            <li> Despite shopping around for some time and continuing to use my old model for facial and body grooming, I ended up purchasing the newer model with the Lithium battery.</li>
            <li> The 9818 was also apparently defective.</li>
            <li> and I used for body trim and never wet.</li>
            <li> But nowhere near enough to complain about unless it takes you 6~7 hours to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> time i used it, it wasn&#x27;t cutting nearly as well, and i knew i didn&#x27;t have much time before it died, so i had to apply more pressure to the skin and (which is of course my fault) cut myself.  </li>
            <li> It pulls on my hair, especially where it is shorter near the neck.</li>
            <li> After about 5 years, the battery finally died on my old one and I use this 2-3 times per week.</li>
            <li> Needs an indication on either the trimmer or the charger that shows if it is actually charging and if charging is complete.</li>
            <li> Second is no red / green light telling you if its done charging.</li>
            <li> Insult to injury, the cord to charge the trimmer apparently just sits there.  </li>
            <li> I have no regrets purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> Anyway, shortly after I rashly posted that review, Wahl got back to me in their normal course, and said just send it in</li>
            <li> After talking with A lady at Wahl, it is finally clear that you should not charge for more than a hour, even if completely dead, and not to charge it until completely dead.</li>
            <li> The attachments are kind of useless.  </li>
            <li> So many pieces, so poorly labeled</li>
            <li> The shaver barrier screen is to0 thick and as a result does not give a smooth result.  </li>
            <li> While I appreciate the quality and simplicity, it doesn&#x27;t do as good of a job as cutting the hair on my head.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the shaving head as it is mediocre at best.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There is no charging indicator (no indication that it is charging and no indication that the battery is full), the charging is totally open loop (plug, leave for a few hours and hope it is charged).&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are a few cons, but nothing worth taking off a star.  </li>
            <li> everyone has an outlet close to their bathroom mirror, you should be able to use the product plugged in or not, not solely on it&#x27;s poor battery</li>
            <li> There is no other rechargeable battery technology I&#x27;m aware of that could even approach, much less match</li>
            <li> It was very light weight and not like the other Wahl trimmers I&#x27;d seen in the past.</li>
            <li> Blades are garbage and go dull very quickly even when regularly</li>
            <li> This is less of an issue, because the T Blade is comfortable enough to use, and since it&#x27;s larger, it&#x27;s actually a bit faster to shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m only going to take off one star for this because I believe most users will settle on a single head, and a single comb, and put all the other attachments in a ziplock bag in their closet.  </li>
            <li> It works, but made me sorely miss my old Norelco Turbo Vacuum Trimmer, so I just gave the Wahl to Goodwill and bought another Norelco Turbo Vac.</li>
            <li> And I only use the main trimmer, not the little attachment guys, so I can&#x27;t really rate those bits.</li>
            <li> and this is a better trimmer than both in terms of power and versatility.s, and are easily knocked out when the flimsy base gets knocked around.    </li>
            <li> Upgraded to 2 stars (they really shouldn&#x27;t have both broken so quickly).</li>
            <li> The only positive thing I can say for this product is that the lithium battery does last for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s due to my own thick facial hair, but if you&#x27;re looking for a Trimmer that won&#x27;t pull on your hair, you may want to look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> blades have large gaps in the sides so all your hair &amp;#34;conveniently&amp;#34; gathers inside the motor cavity and the intricate parts that move the blades, and the provided brush is too poorly designed to clean that out, so be prepared to vacuum it</li>
            <li> but it took a few changes to get it right.</li>
            <li> i loved the old stand, hate the new carrying case, i want the stand not a case!</li>
            <li> The manual is not very useful if you are trying to figure out what attachment does what or how much hair each attachment will cut.  </li>
            <li> I bet the people at Walmart thought I look funny coming in with a half trimmed beard</li>
            <li> After reading the fine print it&#x27;s hard to tell if anything at all is actually covered - why not put 100 year warranty on the package?  </li>
            <li> The different blades are a little tricky to interchange, but not too much of a problem!!</li>
            <li> This Wahl trimmer is small, lightweight, charges quickly, and does it&#x27;s job well.</li>
            <li> I am using this to shave because I am not very fond of a clean cut and the troubles of conventional razors.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to clean after every shave.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know what some of these other reviewers are talking about -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for a couple of years and it still cuts fast and the blades are sharp.</li>
            <li> There is no charge indicator, direction really matters unlike other trimmers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This includes an every other day beard touch up and a whole head shave.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really used the other accessories.</li>
            <li> Although I can&#x27;t really complain about this one, I wish I&#x27;d gone with the other.</li>
            <li> and it is somewhat hard to clean off.</li>
            <li> Sharp and cuts very well.</li>
            <li> keep it on the charger.&lt;br /&gt;liion batteries would rather be charged after little use many times over being drained and few charges.&lt;br /&gt;it will kill the battery by draining it before charging</li>
            <li> It serves well enough, but it&#x27;s not the exact length I would like, and even this fixed attachment is still more difficult to remove and replace than other attachments I have used with cheaper trimmers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My belief with these trimmers was I wouldn&#x27;t use the guards since I have a steady hand and could just slide them down my beard to pick off all the wild hairs.</li>
            <li> I started searching for a new one and it didn&#x27;t take long to find this one!</li>
            <li> I never got the blades wet, but as other reviewers noted, the blade RUSTED QUICKLY.</li>
            <li> I have had no major problems so far</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great, it&#x27;s just that there are a few useless peices.  </li>
            <li> the razor is also extremely loud and vibrates accordingly in the hand, not pleasant or comfortable at all.&lt;br /&gt;i tried plugging it into the wall and turning it back on, but it does not bypass the battery charge.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is the cheap looking accessory holder.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a concern for me at all, and so far has only reinforced the initial impression I have of, well ...</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a concern for me at all, and so far has only reinforced the initial impression I have of, well ...</li>
            <li> Like the title says, I&#x27;m on my second one of these, as the old one finally gave out (battery issue).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not obvious at a glance -- or indeed, so far as I can tell, possible at all to tell -- when the trimmer is fully charged.  </li>
            <li> I did find that it&#x27;s slightly more difficult to get a closer trim than our old trimmer.</li>
            <li> Spent all day trying to put it back together again (again, thanks to not documentation).  </li>
            <li> Screen shaver is very tricky to open to empty the trimmings, and there is no instructions on how to do so.</li>
            <li> How can a company (especially Wahl) create a trimmer that completely stops working after only one month.  </li>
            <li> I use it as a personal groomer which seems to work better because of the thin hair on my chest and stomach.</li>
            <li> purchased this unit as xmas gift for my son who loved it til it died inexplicably 7 months later.</li>
            <li> I needed to clean the blades often and take it slow.</li>
            <li> I hated it and am looking forward to finding something better, even if that means paying substantially more.</li>
            <li> The adapters require a little giggle to attach it right and the plastic guides are sturdy enough to stay on place.  </li>
            <li> First being the bottom is not completely flat, slightly domed.</li>
            <li> After using this trimmer for several months I have discovered what I consider a major flaw in design after I wrote this review.</li>
            <li> and the next day they had a major rust issue.</li>
            <li> The blades were not sharp enough.  </li>
            <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t beat this little trimmer, and it charges fast!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any guard to trim my face, and the blades seem to have a sharp spot that occasionally seems to snag or snip at me.. not sure how to explain it, maybe one of the teeth protrudes slightly more or something.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have extensive experience with other trimmers, but this seems pretty solid to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The little clipper is beating itself to death somehow, and eventually, probably pretty soon, it will quit.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably decent at trimming a long beard to a short one but does not work well for trimming a short beard to stubble which is my 2x a week routine.</li>
            <li> thought I finally figured out what to order but reading all the reviews found one guy saying the combs did not fit quite right and another saying the comb was causing it to pull hairs.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money- spend a little more and get something that will last.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after using it only 4 times after 4 month (I don&#x27;t need to trim my dog everyday, once a month is good enough), the motor in the main body stopped running for no reason.  </li>
            <li> The only bad thing i can say is that i wish it had a charge light indicator to let me know if it is fully charged or not,even some of the cheap trimmers have this option.</li>
            <li> Disappointed that I can&#x27;t find any truly great ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I shave my head about every two days and also use this guy on general facial maintenance every day.</li>
            <li> However,like the previous reviewer said, the cut hairs stick to the rubber on the outside the shaver like glue, and spent about 15 minutes trying to clean them off.  </li>
            <li> i should have taken it back then, because this thing was clearly used in store or brought back because it didn&#x27;t work and just put back on the shelf by the target employees, or used at some point in shipping.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The clippers are sharp,  charge fast,  and the charge seems to last a while.  </li>
            <li> Now, it barely lasts 5 minutes on a \\&quot;full\\&quot; charge and 5-10 minute bump charges only give it around a minute.</li>
            <li> I still go to the barber every once in a while to get a professional clean-up, but not nearly as often as I used to.</li>
            <li> I do use professional hair clippers when the beard gets too long, then use the Wahl for clean-up. .</li>
            <li> elsewhere- the bare cutter (like pictured) does not cut close enough.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to replace my 20 yr old Wahl trimmer.  </li>
            <li> The battery lasts quite long between charges (I used it about 10 times and did not need to charge it so far).</li>
            <li> I do not understand why, but the one i got will no long turn on.  </li>
            <li> Barely acceptable for occasional use.  </li>
            <li> Choose the attachment(s) you need in the first few days of ownership, then store the rest.</li>
            <li> Save the box because it is much more helpful than the printed instructions that come in very small print and never really explain what everything is for,</li>
            <li> The reason I am writing this review is I want men to be aware of what they are missing on if they havent tried or used this before.</li>
            <li> Worked well for first few uses.  </li>
            <li> I learned that in the first few times I used it.</li>
            <li> This is an easy-to-use small but powerful trimmer.</li>
            <li> the past I have always &amp;#34;clean-shaven&amp;#34; my whole face, but recently I grew tired of shaving and decided to grow a simple &amp;#34;Van Dyke&amp;#34; just to see if I liked it.  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t hold ANY charge and often bogs down so much that it pulls my hairs out.</li>
            <li> I like using a disposable every other / every 3rd day to cut it nice and tight with a little stubble.  </li>
            <li> Too many little pieces!!!!  </li>
            <li> have had The exact same issues with the 2nd trimmer and its been less than a year!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first one was over 3 years ago, and the little battery finally just won&#x27;t go anymore.</li>
            <li> Nice to give something other than video game related things !!!!!</li>
            <li> It works alright, but every time you wana change the head unit on it you have to unscrew two screws and carefully put the new head on and then screw in two screws.  </li>
            <li> No thanks, for that shipping I can buy a new unit.  </li>
            <li> Hands down, this trimmer is super sharp.  </li>
            <li> But ... less than a year of once-a-week use, the rechargeable battery didn&#x27;t hold much of a charge.   </li>
            <li> B000XVXK12 Gillette Fusion Power Phenom Razor]], I have always believed that electric razors are for men who don&#x27;t really insist on a close shave (or less facetiously for men whose lifestyle requires shaving on-the-go).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d previously purchased an all in one Remington from Target, and it was absolute junk.</li>
            <li> , I had the previous version with NiCad battery, this one is much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Apparently Wahl packages this product with different options for different retailers.  </li>
            <li> The battery seams to last long time, again so far.</li>
            <li> So far I have had no problem with the battery, it holds a charge for a long time, I only charged it once a month</li>
            <li> Needless to say, it now takes over an hour for a full trim, which is absolutely unacceptable.</li>
            <li> Worse yet, the construction quality is pretty much junk.</li>
            <li> I found it no more effective than a real round headed ear/nose trimmer.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this not a bad product, but the quality could really have been improved.</li>
            <li> However, after about 6 months of use, most of the blades started cutting my skin (I guess they&#x27;re not as sharp), and the shaver itself rattles too much, it&#x27;s gotten too loud, and it just doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> A single one-hour charge has yielded seven shaves so far.     </li>
            <li> a single stubble guard that was adjustable, and very clearly marked for each depth setting- with Arabic numbers 1</li>
            <li> Previous clippers we have purchased when they got more dull would bend the hair, this does not do this.</li>
            <li> is the  third time I&#x27;ve been burned by thinking a German product was superior (Opel, the worst car I ever owned; Bosch dishwasher that doesn&#x27;t clean the dishes).</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to be a cheaply made, weak rip off.</li>
            <li> I rarely leave negative reviews, but this item and the company leave a GREAT DEAL to be disappointed in.</li>
            <li> My first beard trimmer was at least ten years old.  </li>
            <li> The first time I left it in a hotel and the second one I misplaced the blade attachments.</li>
            <li> The base to hold everything is pretty cheap and doesn&#x27;t hold all the components very well, but since I don&#x27;t use the attachments I have them in a baggie in a drawer.  </li>
            <li> The double headed trimmer does not fit anywhere except in the first drawer next to my sink.</li>
            <li> I use this where I work in a barber shop, I use it mainly for when I am cutting a small childs hair to go around the ears and neck line, well worth it!!!!</li>
            <li> My last trimmer never pulled hairs, and it cost half as much.</li>
            <li> Works very well for that function, at a lot less than the commercial stitch erasers.</li>
            <li> When it came time to prune it back, my Wahl was ready with a charge even though it sat, neglected, in my medicine cabinet for half a year.</li>
            <li> stand included, I&#x27;d advise anyone who wants to use it to somehow anchor it down with either double sided tape or such.  </li>
            <li> I followed user instructions and oiled it before every use still went dull fast!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad to say that the motor stopped working after three months of very light usage.  </li>
            <li> shipping the old unit back and won&#x27;t hesitate to grab another in hopes that this isn&#x27;t a product design issue instead of a single janky unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Wahl website says that both clippers have the same torque, but my new stainless 9818 runs slow and seems wimpy.</li>
            <li> His only complaint so far is that the small detail attachment does heat up a good deal if left running for an extended amount of time and burns the skin a little.  </li>
            <li> , i think you can find a shaver that  feel like its take that little hair at all!, and put it to that beuty ;)</li>
            <li> all these reviews where people talk about how much it vibrates had me a little nervous about this trimmer</li>
            <li> This little shaver really amazed me.</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to, but once you do, this is a very versatile set.</li>
            <li> complaints are that the little stand that comes with it doesn&#x27;t seem very well thought out.  </li>
            <li> and I cleaned the Wahl beard trimmer with a little too much water and</li>
            <li> The blades in this unit are sharp, sharp, sharp and give a smooth trim without irritation.</li>
            <li> but I really do think this foil shaver gets a little closer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had this trimmer at least six months now and haven&#x27;t had to charge it since the first charge!</li>
            <li> Unless you develop the habit of using it to trim your beard or are still maintaining that boot camp &#x27;doo, this will probably be the least useful blade unless you have a partner with some haircutting skills because while any idiot can eventually learn to trim his own beard, cutting your own hair in a manner you&#x27;d be willing to display in public is probably going to be beyond your abilities.  </li>
            <li> The packaging needs to be updated with the new tray design, and somewhere in the packaging or instructions I would think there should be instructions on how to store the guides and other attachments in the tray holder...  </li>
            <li> The packaging needs to be updated with the new tray design, and somewhere in the packaging or instructions I would think there should be instructions on how to store the guides and other attachments in the tray holder...  </li>
            <li> The blades are sharp and still cut like new.</li>
            <li> It held a charge and had decent run time for the first year or so of intermittent use, but since then it&#x27; has gotten much worse.</li>
            <li> Some of the hair gets into the nook and crannies of the heads or even down inside the main unit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, four stars (or maybe 3.75), due to the few (relatively) minor design flaws detailed above.</li>
            <li> So, four stars (or maybe 3.75), due to the few (relatively) minor design flaws detailed above.</li>
            <li> Very loud compared to other razors.  </li>
            <li> : powerful quality feeling motor, sharp close cutting blades, and easy interchangeable heads&lt;</li>
            <li> So that&#x27;s good, right?&lt;br /&gt;The shaving head is bad.</li>
            <li> Too bad since this is a good trimmer otherwise.</li>
            <li> I read some good and some bad reviews on this trimmer.</li>
            <li> But since it came with the bigger cutting head, i tried it out on buzzing my head and it worked amazingly.  </li>
            <li> That can be good and bad, especially if it quits in the middle of a trim.</li>
            <li> The cut is poor and it skips more hairs than would be expected...</li>
            <li> It also is powerful enough to handle my thick beard.</li>
            <li> The only real major flaw with this is the non-replaceable battery - you basically have to destroy the device to access the battery and that it does not power directly from the wall.</li>
            <li> One star is too high for a product only lasting one and a half months.    </li>
            <li> I used the shaver per the instructions and let the battery run down until it was empty when I first got it.  </li>
            <li> it took a hard plunge onto the floor); it hit just right and finally broke the head.</li>
            <li> No man in his right mind would choose such a product unless he was planning to at least experiment with facial hair, and for the purpose of shaving those parts of your face not covered by your beard or mustache, it is quite adequate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Changing the actual razors/trimmers takes a bit getting used to (or at least it did for me) as it&#x27;s a out and up technique that you have to get just right.</li>
            <li> first time having it in my hands, it felt very firm like and sturdy</li>
            <li> /&gt;The default trimmer blade that comes attached can sometimes be a little bit of work to re-attach after cleaning, but if I&#x27;m careful to line it up correctly and most importantly, NOT FORCE it back on, it&#x27;s a minor issue.  </li>
            <li> It does not have a vacuum, but I found that the vacuum type only collect about 50% of the clippings leaving me with a sink cleaning job regardless, so I have not missed the vacuum at all.  </li>
            <li> Those short and few times it did work, however, I wasn&#x27;t convinced that it was a product of high enough quality to supplant a razor, or one reliable enough for use during travel or vacations.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other shavers to keep myself groomed and this one is a far step above in terms of quality, comfort, and versatility.</li>
            <li> It replaced a Philips Norelco that finally quit and where that one could reliably pass through cleanly, leaving properly trimmed hair behind.  </li>
            <li> I bought it because my Norelco vacuum rechargeable was failing to hold a charge.  </li>
            <li> There is no hair vacuum which doesn&#x27;t matter to me</li>
            <li> B000FEF1V4 Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer]].  </li>
            <li> Could careless about the other accessories honestly.</li>
            <li> this Wahi Lithium Lon in one Trimmer w as a gift and it works for me really good and all the other combs are just the job for cutting and trimming</li>
            <li> They also come with the small guards up to the large guards and definitely edges well would definitely buy it again</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how long this little guy has been plugging away at the thankless task of managing my facial hair, but thanks to Amazon keeping track, I see that I&#x27;ve owned my Wahl Trimmer for just over three years.</li>
            <li> I sent the trimmer in for repair, and in less than a week Wahl replaced the entire unit with a brand new trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Decent little trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Barely 20 months - with fairly limited use?  </li>
            <li> The main things that I dont really like about this trimmer is the thin plastic construction of the trimmer and accessory tray.</li>
            <li> suspect that Wahl knows about ambient moisture damaging and destroying the products and they refuse to cover the electronics with moisture resistant conformal coating used as an inexpensive and standard way in the electronics industry to ensure a steady stream of failures and re-purchases by customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> b/c it will be completely worn out due to the rust.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Got this trimmer about 2 weeks ago, been using it about every other day so far.</li>
            <li> other set of clippers that I have is over 10 years old and is still giving premium cuts.</li>
            <li> so I can actually use it long enough to give a proper review....</li>
            <li> My second one lasted a few weeks (still on the first charge) and the on/off switch jammed.</li>
            <li> either they have little experience with these types of trimmers, or have unreasonably high expectations.  </li>
            <li> All the other heads and attachments seem to snap on and off just fine, as long as, again, they&#x27;re not manhandled or forced on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was looking for a cordless trimmer that would hold a charge, be powerful enough to trim a tough overgrown beard and not die in the process, and not have to remember to plug it in the night before, or charge it a few times and suddenly it won&#x27;t hold a charge or a sufficent charge to trim the whole beard.</li>
            <li> I use the guides to keep it at a specific length and bare (like it is pictured) to shave the neck and other parts of my face that I want as short as possible.  </li>
            <li> might as well buy a brand new black car then complain that it&#x27;s black!&lt;br /&gt;LOL</li>
            <li> The new battery requires less charging time, and seems like it lasts longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At that point I&#x27;ve bought half of a new unit</li>
            <li> These are certainly above average, but it&#x27;s a hassle to change the heads, and it takes me longer to shave with these compared to my old clippers.</li>
            <li> Shaver: I&#x27;ve had several of these in the past, and they all break me out almost as if I used a real razor.</li>
            <li> With that in mind, pretty much all of the accessories are useless for my purposes.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get over at how poorly it was a maintaining a clean shaven appearance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it is necessary or even very helpful since leaving it charge overnight</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only actually shaved my head a couple of times with it - it worked but took a long time.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t see this trimmer lasting long with regular use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s going to last twice as long just because of the extra blade.</li>
            <li> but subsequent charges didn&#x27;t last long at all</li>
            <li> The LI batteries last a long time and the various attachments make it flexible.</li>
            <li> Low cost, but last a long time.</li>
            <li> I have used various trimmers and hair clippers over the years and have always ended up with wahl trimmers for close cuts and long lasting clippers.</li>
            <li> with smaller attachments, MultiComb selector for different lenghs, long battery</li>
            <li> Pulls beard hair with plastic guard attachments but overall gets the job done and battery last long time between charges</li>
            <li> It makes quick work of even the thickest beards, and you may actually need to be careful when shaving around delicate areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Skip to the last paragraph for the main points if you&#x27;re not easily entertained.    </li>
            <li> He tried to use the dual shaver to no avail, but he never really had success with them in the past anyway.</li>
            <li> Does missing the stand detract from the main product?</li>
            <li> I have pretty thick facial hair, and use this clipper to keep my goatee in check.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, at about a year old, a full charge now runs for about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a receipt and they just sent me a new blade and told me flat out those blades just should break and no questions asked the next blade showed up a few days later.</li>
            <li> But, I only wanted a short stubble so the single short guide for the T-Blade was enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I guess this thing would be called either a large trimmer or small clipper.  </li>
            <li> But with little touble, and a modicum of common sense, the skill is acquired easily.  </li>
            <li> After full charge (12 hours) the trimmer starts and shut down after less than 20 sec...</li>
            <li> But several months down the road the blades were loud and pulling my beard hairs.  </li>
            <li> The little handbook does not give very clear instructions on the use of the various attachments.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had too many units that don&#x27;t have enough power that are terrible trimmers but they are quiet and smooth.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this product, been in use for a few weeks now...</li>
            <li> If you live with mom/wife/roommate, they will destroy your trimmer battery by ONLY unplugging it from the wall in the bathroom and not unplugging it at the shaver.  </li>
            <li> I was very hesitant because of various reviews on different products talking about how it&#x27;s hard to get a close stubble trim.</li>
            <li> I have owned several Walh trimmers in the past, but the ion battery sets this apart from all previous trimmers, definitely worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li> I left it in the shower room a single time, and then the next day there were just rust spots all over the metal shaver.</li>
            <li> The handle is also made of a rubberized finish that sucks all of your hair to like a magnet making a HUGE mess.</li>
            <li> That being said i really like the trimmer and Amazon as usual</li>
            <li> While some of the attachments are quite useful, some are flimsy and near useless, such as the eyebrow trimmer.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve been using it for my buzz cut at least every 10 to 14 days for about 3 months - still on the first charge</li>
            <li> Regardless, this thing pretty much sucks.</li>
            <li> I usually leave the hair trimming to a barber, so I don&#x27;t foresee much use of the hair</li>
            <li> The only negative part about the whole set is the lack of a carrying case to put all the accessories, which isn&#x27;t that big of a deal anyway.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very mechanically inclined person who can usually figure just about anything out.</li>
            <li> Seems powerful enough for what I want, but the squishy grip is a real pain -- it collects hair as you&#x27;re cutting off, so the trimmer ends up with a lot of cut pointy hair all over the place.</li>
            <li> Had a small problem figuring out how to switch the head on the shaver, but it was straight forward.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my clipper to trim and shave and got lazy of having to lug the whole kit out just to use it, so I bought this trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It shaves Real Close, even has a Shaver Attachment, though it&#x27;s small</li>
            <li> First off the tray sucks.  </li>
            <li> Some people mentioned that the bare trimmer will bite you, and it will, so be careful.</li>
            <li> The battery holds a charge for an extremely long time, and recharging only takes about an hour.  </li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t hold a charge long enough for me to trim my beard.  </li>
            <li> Battery last a long time.</li>
            <li> With the guard, I&#x27;d have to trim my beard daily and even then it would still be too long.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;Powerful, long lasting charge, lots of clipping/trimming/detailing options and a tray to keep all the parts together...</li>
            <li> These work well, seem durable, have a long lasting battery.</li>
            <li> The charge last long ..  </li>
            <li> Long lasting battery.</li>
            <li> The lithium battery version lasts plenty long enough between charges.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I flat out</li>
            <li> I just purchased it so don&#x27;t anything about how long it will last or hold up.</li>
            <li> I used this about 3 times per week to trim my beard with the 4 cm flat blade.</li>
            <li> I am at the point now of saying so long to both Amazon and The Nerds on any further orders.</li>
            <li> Long battery life and a well thought ouot series of adapters make this a must have for anyone into personal grooming.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t ship with the tray pictured on the website to hold all the tools conveniently for me, but that&#x27;s a minor set back.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last as long as others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Not an is to last long.</li>
            <li> is that the battery would last a fairly long time</li>
            <li> Long lasting battery.</li>
            <li> Battery is long lasting, invaluable for trips.</li>
            <li> The different heads snap off and on easily as long as you remember to remove the trimming guides</li>
            <li> Instead it fell completly flat in my book.</li>
            <li> The battery is so long lasting that I&#x27;ve yet to have to recharge it!</li>
            <li> Battery last long time.</li>
            <li> Short cords - This doesn&#x27;t have a cord at all, and the battery life is long, so</li>
            <li> He had one and all he did was complain everytime he used it, and avoided trimming his beard as long as possible.  </li>
            <li> Quality just isn&#x27;t where it&#x27;s at these days, if it&#x27;s built well and last a long time, they go out of business.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say just how long the batteries last, but they seem to go on forever.  </li>
            <li> Minor inconvenience only when changing guards.  </li>
            <li> last a long time.</li>
            <li> Well worth the small premium over imported junk from other makers.</li>
            <li> I currently sport a Van Dyke, which needs careful grooming since my beard comes in heavy, with no thin spots.  </li>
            <li> NO FURTHER, BUY IT, and stop paying more and getting absolute crap from PHILLIPS, NORELCO, REMINGTON, etc.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed because Wahl products are usually good.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s like complaining that they paid too little for a new car.</li>
            <li> it lasted and it finally started to loose power and charge despite constantly being plugged-in.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have is the heads are a bit difficult to attach, but once you figure it out, its fine.</li>
            <li> They both started off just fine, but in both cases the batteries failed shortly after their warranties expired.  </li>
            <li> The sticky plastic handle is a little bit of a draw back with its natural tendency to allow hair to stick to it, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  </li>
            <li> Other trimmers have adjustable blade depth without using a guard and I measured that my previous trimmer had a #1 guard that was much shallower.</li>
            <li> Have used for 3+ years with no major problems.</li>
            <li> As other people have mentioned, there is a major problem with the battery on this thing.  </li>
            <li> I got this for my husband after his other brand&#x27;s attatchments broke and there were no replacements and tried to replace it with the same brand (but different style) thinking that it would be the same...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to argue against 1700 strongly positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> The two metal trimmer attachment (one small one a little larger) work well and are sharp and smooth.</li>
            <li> This shaver keeps its charge for a very very long time, so it does not need to be constantly charged.</li>
            <li> Battery did not last very long.  </li>
            <li> Battery is very long lasting</li>
            <li> The packaging is terrible - light, flimsy and cheap!</li>
            <li> Actually, there is one, but it quite is difficult to fit on the head</li>
            <li> The clippings stick to it like glue and the only way I&#x27;ve found to get them off is to brush and rub it with a dry wash cloth.  </li>
            <li> , less frequent charging.  </li>
            <li> Dry only.</li>
            <li> These trimmer work well &amp; fit in my hand perfectly (not too big and bulky).  </li>
            <li> actual trimmer was fine, although I had a small complaint about it as well.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to hold enough for much more than one cutting.</li>
            <li> both it and my Wahl Trimmer fell in the toilet.  </li>
            <li> However, within a few weeks the finish wore off, and it looks like it is ten years old</li>
            <li> The model includes a few fixed length guards as well, of which I use the middle size instead.</li>
            <li> but I doubt that will be necessary for a long, long time).</li>
            <li> I only have to pass over my face a few times, compared to my old crappy $15 trimmer that I had to pass like 10 times.  </li>
            <li> My 20 year old son has heavy facial hair and hates to shave every day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve waited a long while to write this--two years--because electronic items often don&#x27;t last a long time</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t get better service, so you can&#x27;t go wrong trying this one.ference in how wide the teeth are.</li>
            <li> like them as much as discontinued Wahl that that the head rotated from wide to narrow blade.</li>
            <li> Long long lasting battery.  </li>
            <li> It cuts off my hair consistently because there is no mechanical failure.</li>
            <li> The guides are much harder to use than the single adjustable guide I had on my last trimmer that I only needed to keep track of two total attachments on.</li>
            <li> But - 14 months later, I can no longer get through my routine on a single charge.  </li>
            <li> battery last for week on single charge  time saver</li>
            <li> Here at the 11th month, it won&#x27;t even make it through a single beard trim (~7 minutes) even when starting with it plugged into the charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The various trimming attachments also attach loosely to the trimmer head and sometimes fall off while in use.</li>
            <li> The internal sub-assembly seems to have come loose, so when I move the switch I am moving the internals instead.</li>
            <li> Putting on the various guards is not easy or seamless.</li>
            <li> Just for fun, although I have a razor, I put the razor attachment on, shaved half my face, and used my Remington triple-head electric razor, which I also like a lot, on the other half of my face.  </li>
            <li> The battery last a long time with a single charge so no need to plug it in every day.  </li>
            <li> The three individual length (black plastic) guides all cut at the same very short length.</li>
            <li> noted several other similar complaints in amazon reviews (read on!!!!)  </li>
            <li> Looking at the other items for sale you find the corded trimmers, hair clippers and smaller facial air trimmers.</li>
            <li> All of the extra heads and attachments give you endless possibilities to shaving your facial hair.</li>
            <li> I was still using the same outlet as before, so I attempted other outlets with same results NO CHARGE.</li>
            <li> Since the instructions are the same for three different models one panel lists the other two models.    </li>
            <li> I DO NOT want another one of this model, or any other that uses the same or similar battery.</li>
            <li> I DO NOT want another one of this model, or any other that uses the same or similar battery.</li>
            <li> Purchased Wahl trimmer mainly for the small nose/ear/eyebrow attachment.  </li>
            <li> No clean cut for professional look</li>
            <li> The base was fine though and worked fine with the few heads I hadn&#x27;t lost yet.  </li>
            <li> And for those reading the reviews of noise and vibration...I don&#x27;t know what other trimmers you have tried but these trimmers are less loud and have less vibration than the last set of wahls that i owned and by far outperform any, even my corded clippers for closeness of cut.</li>
            <li> Ordering another one right now to leave at camp, for those long weekends away when I start looking a little shaggy!!!</li>
            <li> and it finally broke down not long ago.</li>
            <li> I use this for trimming and shaping my goatee and sideburns and these tasks are no trouble at all for this little shaver.</li>
            <li> , the device would stop every five seconds or so and had to be switched off and on again to get a little action.</li>
            <li> One way is (1) to put the flat side of the clipper head parallel to the skin and the other is (2) to put the flat side of the clipper head perpendicular to the skin.</li>
            <li> These are a little on the loud side.  </li>
            <li> The only other issue I&#x27;ve had with it is the small trimming head began to work a bit intermittently, so I ordered a replacement from Wahl with no difficulties and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> one main thing that I hate about most trimmers is that the battery dies after 15-30 minutes of use.  </li>
            <li> 60 Day Money Back Guarantee and 5-YEAR LIMITED WARRANTY!  </li>
            <li> Even being very careful and following instructions, the dual foil shaver still irritated my skin and left a bunch of stubble behind - after that happened, I ONLY used it to pick up a couple stray hairs below my sideburns that the trimmer blade didn&#x27;t get the first time around.</li>
            <li> After I got tired of shaving multiple times a week with a razor(Gillette Pro Glide), I decided on growing a short beard(a few weeks growth) but keeping my neck lined up and looking clean</li>
            <li> The shaving foil leaves a little bit to be desired, especially if your facial hair grows in multiple directions.</li>
            <li> The accessory set is cheap and cheesy.</li>
            <li> But because I seek the closest trim available in the 6-Position Guide, all trimming attachments are useless.  </li>
            <li> And to the person who complained about too much vibration:  </li>
            <li> The most disappointing.</li>
            <li> Once you get used to using this you&#x27;ll love the crazy long battery life.  </li>
            <li> Even though the razor heads seem to be of cheaper construction they are better at cutting.  </li>
            <li> we&#x27;ll see how long that</li>
            <li> which is what it&#x27;s supposed to do... and the smallest guard still leaves stubble a bit long, imo.</li>
            <li> it lasts so long that when it dies</li>
            <li> The battery does run for a long time but thats not what I got it for.</li>
            <li> The battery holds a charge for a long time and the attachments are a plus.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve waited a long time for Lithium Ion batteries to replace the inferior NiCad batteries in grooming appliances.  </li>
            <li> Holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> The issues I have with it are minor....</li>
            <li> Holds charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> It quit working completely, and unfortunately I misplaced the receipt, so</li>
            <li> My wife told me I should buy a quality trimmer I could keep for a long time.</li>
            <li> Often did not need to take the recharger cord with me on week long trips.   </li>
            <li> I use it for trimming the feet on 2 long haired dogs.  </li>
            <li> so I hope it lasts a long time for him.  </li>
            <li> This hair trimmer is not quiet what i expected.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> so I cant say how long the charge lasts, but</li>
            <li> I guess the only thing that is a bummer is that if you have a rough face or scars, it tends to dig into your face.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: it works and works well, but I don&#x27;t see it having the durability to hold up to long term use.</li>
            <li> In addition the handle has the ergonomics of a flashlight, but these are minor points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In addition the handle has the ergonomics of a flashlight, but these are minor points.    </li>
            <li> TJ max had a similar set with 1&amp;#34; wide attachements for 30.00, so I gave them botht to my dad, and he is going to decide which one he likes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed at how long the charge is holding.  </li>
            <li> Long battery life.</li>
            <li> Its incredibly long battery life allows it to be taken on a week-long trip without any worry of losing performance.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long</li>
            <li> Tested all the service attachments (blades &amp; dual-screen); 3 of the 4 seemed to work as well as any of the 5 or 6 shavers I&#x27;ve had in my adult life (though the dual-screen seems a skosh narrow for its intended purpose).</li>
            <li> I know I could probably send it to a service center since these come with a 5 year warranty, but that&#x27;s not something I&#x27;m likely to do.  </li>
            <li> I know I could probably send it to a service center since these come with a 5 year warranty, but that&#x27;s not something I&#x27;m likely to do.  </li>
            <li> It nicked me in a sensitive area a few times before the battery gave out.  </li>
            <li> my husband used it  an in the second week it quit working , sending back and find something different don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s in the military and likes to keep his hair short.  </li>
            <li> Been using it everyday for about a year and nor problems so far.</li>
            <li> oh, and the battery lasts an impressively long time.</li>
            <li> have used Wahl products for a long time and have had no complaints.</li>
            <li> Retains charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> Hair sticks to the handle causing some minor annoyances while shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer a few months ago when my old Wahl died.</li>
            <li> Once charged it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> As a hairy dude, I have used quite a few trimming products over my adult lifetime.  </li>
            <li> I found that this shaver has a long battery life which was no doubt a plus.  </li>
            <li> and when I do, it doesn&#x27;t have to be connected for long.</li>
            <li> No possible way for them to have gotten wet either.</li>
            <li> This unit hold a charge for an amazingly long time.</li>
            <li> I called WAHL, who said I can mail it to them to have it serviced as long as it is under warranty.  </li>
            <li> Have used the wide blade, the standard blade with the adjustable depth, and the razor.  </li>
            <li> Was smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> There were some minor issues</li>
            <li> But these were minor qualms.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Runs a long time before needing a recharge.</li>
            <li> Per my husband, battery stays charged a long time.  </li>
            <li> my son says He shaves his head and has a long beard.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair about 3mm long.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for quite a long time</li>
            <li> This thing will set by the sink for it&#x27;s entire life, and you put absolutely no thought into resisting corrosion?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a trimmer for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> , the unit just completely died after a few uses, in my case I think i used it about 6 times over the space of 8 weeks</li>
            <li> Battery lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll have to see how long this charge now</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long the battery lasts</li>
            <li> but mine has lasted a long time</li>
            <li> Anattachment for everything and long battery life.  </li>
            <li> Battery lasts a long time per charge.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that hair will get stuck to the rubber handle, and will need a wet cloth to remove the hairs.</li>
            <li> So long wahl, you won&#x27;t see me again.</li>
            <li> The charge lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I play Santa and have a long beard.</li>
            <li> Charge is held for a long time without the necessity to recharge, and battery life in use has always been sufficient for my uses.  </li>
            <li> We will see how long this one lasts.</li>
            <li> Also, the battery lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> :stubble was a bit too long for me.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand for a long time.</li>
            <li> One minor downside...</li>
            <li> It must be held in place carefully while I trim to prevent making my beard too short.</li>
            <li> there is a big difference in how wide the teeth are.</li>
            <li> Also that charge on mine lasts a really long time</li>
            <li> Charge lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> The razor works well and you can save money because you do not have to by replacement/disposable razors, but if you have sensitive skin using it everyday will irritate your face.</li>
            <li> I waited too long to return it to Amazon, so I replaced it with the 9818.</li>
            <li> You  have to keep it on charge or it will discharge and the power supplied by the cable isn&#x27;t enough to run the shaver with an empty battery.  </li>
            <li> When I checked it the following morning it was dead; wouldn&#x27;t run unplugged or plugged, wouldn&#x27;t charge on several different outlets.  </li>
            <li> AND LASTS AND LASTS FOR A LONG TIME.&lt;br /&gt;ETC.</li>
            <li> I expected this to last quite a bit longer.</li>
            <li> Used my old blades from my dead one.</li>
            <li> Stopped working completely after a few charges.</li>
            <li> - that&#x27;s a long time.</li>
            <li> If I had sent it in for a replacement or repair I would have been without a trimmer for who knows how long.</li>
            <li> The battery seems to hold a charge for a long time as well which is great!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The trimmer works very well, it cut through my thick grey mustache and sideburn area with ease.</li>
            <li> Of course, this too was built to be disposable technology, as the battery is clearly not intended to be user-serviceable.</li>
            <li> I purchased this since shaving was irritating, and i dont like the way i look with a fresh shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> last plenty long to shave your entire body or head without slowing down.</li>
            <li> I have been using this once each week to reduce my beard back down to stubble per my wife&#x27;s wishes, so I only use the #1 attachment and cannot speak to the others.  </li>
            <li> I disassembled the unit by pulling back the rubber cover down and splitting the plastic case open to expose the motor, battery and electronics.  </li>
            <li> I would like to have it in the box, but I&#x27;m not likely to sit down and actually order that part</li>
            <li> I would like to have it in the box, but I&#x27;m not likely to sit down and actually order that part</li>
            <li> The trimmer head is very narrow, which makes it harder to get an even trim on the beard, but the mini-shaver had works very well for trimming around the beard.  </li>
            <li> love it but hate new packaging.</li>
            <li> My only other complaint is that the attachments don&#x27;t always deliver an even trim/shave unless you are aware and careful.</li>
            <li> My previous one was from Sharper Image - much more expensive and wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge.</li>
            <li> my skin significantly more often than 90% of the trimmers I&#x27;ve used over the years, including less expensive Wahl trimmers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expect to get years of use out of this item and I am only deducting 1 star because I wish the \\&quot;stand\\&quot; were smaller and had less attachments to fool with</li>
            <li> I keep it at a 2-week length, well above \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; length but still quite short (less than ¼ inch).</li>
            <li> If you decide to take this puppy on an overseas trip lasting less than a couple of months, just charge the trimmer and leave the power supply at home to prevent blowing it up when plugging it into a 220V outlet... or am I the only one who&#x27;s ever done that?</li>
            <li> How can something with a 5 year warranty last only one month and a half?</li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer that replaces the several other models I&#x27;ve hated.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the grinder part doesn&#x27;t offer a shave even remotely close enough to be considered a clean shave.</li>
            <li> #4 Having had a sliding comb attachment on our former Panasonic shaver, it is a pain to have to change the combs and there is nothing to catch the hair, so it makes a big mess.</li>
            <li> The accessory stand is worthless, it only held the main unit securely, everything else fell out and created clutter.</li>
            <li> For a product at this price that&#x27;s designed to be used over several years, perhaps while traveling, the absence of a well-designed case costs half a star from my rating.    </li>
            <li> (There are at least 4 different models that look quite similar and may, in fact, be variations of the same basic design.</li>
            <li> Both attachments afforded me a very clean, close to the skin trim with no abrasion from the cutting guard teeth.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a back up because my other trimmer is dying</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update...Wahl recently had to be contacted, due the trimmer not working.  </li>
            <li> It just feels solid, and sounds sharp as it cuts.</li>
            <li> Especially compared to other rotary versions on the market, like the Remington.</li>
            <li> He definitely would recommend this to other buyers.  </li>
            <li> Basically the springs that return the blades to their original position during trimming snap off and render the unit useless.</li>
            <li> Word of warning, the #1 blade is definitely shorter than any other #1 i&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I ever replaced it was due to</li>
            <li> Oh, the only other thing is that it has a lot of attachments.  </li>
            <li> I, on the other hand, was actually looking for this here electric \\&quot;clipper\\&quot;.&lt;br</li>
            <li> TONS of power, which is a necessity due to my wire-like facial hair.  </li>
            <li> It is quiet and efficient and holds a charge so that every other day grooming of his mustache and beard is not a chore.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t measure the time from charge to charge, but it seemed to be quite a bit longer than other rechargeable devices similar to it.    </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t come with enough other sized filters</li>
            <li> Go for it as long as you remember to put oil on the blades after each use!</li>
            <li> It was also difficult to remove and insert the original razor head.</li>
            <li> Unlike 90% of the other trimmers out there, which do not require any oil at all, this one must be oiled on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I use it, with different attachments, both to cut my hair and trim my beard as well as for other assorted grooming purposes, and it does it all without a hitch.</li>
            <li> Shaving my head and neck takes 1/2 the time with the larger head than it used to with my other razors.</li>
            <li> only 3 months after I bought it due to steam from the shower.</li>
            <li> For example the trimmer and the shaver barley succeed at doing the same job other razors do that are dedicated to the task.</li>
            <li> The head attachment for nose trimming is flat and not really designed for that use.</li>
            <li> I recommend you find a bottle of Wahl or some other brand trimmer oil and use it regularly.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t count the number of times I&#x27;ve left my other electronic razor in the shower room and its head is still a shiny, tetanus-shot-free shimmer.</li>
            <li> Would rather use a razor than the beard trimmer due to face rash potential.</li>
            <li> I shave my head and trim my facial hair every other day.</li>
            <li> the other similar 3 models.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This razor has been used many times since it was ordered, and hasn&#x27;t failed me at all!</li>
            <li> and I could tell that the battery was discharging due to the heat coming out of the battery compartment, but it seemed like the internal motor had seized up causing it not to operate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Long life battery!</li>
            <li> The trimmer blade wasn&#x27;t as sharp as I thought after reading reviews here and various sites.</li>
            <li> One day I&#x27;ve finally gather the nerve to purchase this product cause of the Lithium recharge and the other attachments that comes with it.</li>
            <li> Better change you warranty to 1 year, because your product often fails to even meet that!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to give it a chance to prove itself before going back to my other clipper and trimmer.  </li>
            <li> The poach/bag that comes with it actually holds everything including the charging cable with a little extra room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very quiet compared to my old razor and the blades are well designed and hard.</li>
            <li> The lithium battery holds a charge for a very long time.</li>
            <li> But it works reliably, battery life is very long.</li>
            <li> We have owned Wahl trimmers for a very long time, this product was a replacement for one that the battery did not hold its charge, but after 7 years, I wouldn&#x27;t expect anything else.  </li>
            <li> It has never held a charge for very long once removed from the charger.</li>
            <li> It does not maintain a charge for very long.</li>
            <li> The battery doesn&#x27;t stay charged very long.  </li>
            <li> It has a very long life battery.  </li>
            <li> This item does what it is supposed to do, I do not use it very long each time</li>
            <li> , it lasts a very long time on a charge.</li>
            <li> Does not hold charge very long.</li>
            <li> The unit maintains its battery charge for a very long time.</li>
            <li> About the only thing I don&#x27;t like is the guards are a little cheap If you press down to hard the guards will be pushed down as well</li>
            <li> main issue, however, is that (at least the unit I got) did not seem to hold the charge for very long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also going to take mine apart and clean and protect the internals from corrosion, which is a silly thing to have to do.</li>
            <li> But I see it as more useful than annoying, since the sport of shaving can often involve slippage from the hand!</li>
            <li> Seriously, that&#x27;s a real benefit, folks.</li>
            <li> Seriously, that&#x27;s a real benefit, folks.</li>
            <li> And the textured handle was difficult to keep clean.  </li>
            <li> Also, the rubber on the handle attracts hair and is difficult to clean.</li>
            <li> On a couple occasions I would rinse the hair out of the blades and then leave it out to dry.  </li>
            <li> /once dry)</li>
            <li> The device is difficult to clean.</li>
            <li> Its loud and powerful, was afraid to cut myself.  </li>
            <li> I stored it in a dry enviroment not in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> You cannot use water to rinse this off, and dry towels won&#x27;t remove the hair.</li>
            <li> Smooth cutting trimmer with attachment for ears/nostril &amp; comb attachments for different heights.</li>
            <li> One thing that I noticed though is that it&#x27;s sometimes difficult to clean up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have to run the trimmer over the same areas several times and it still seemed to just keep missing spots.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve charged it maybe 5 times in the last few months, its basic, shaves my head every two days</li>
            <li> THe problem is NOT user induced, the trimmer could be left on on a table for 10 minutes a day and the same would occur within a few days.     </li>
            <li> I purchased this at Walmart a few months back and cleaned/oiled it regularly.  </li>
            <li> I never liked them because they were always a bit flimsy/tippy and mainly because I don&#x27;t want my trimmer to be on display on my bathroom vanity anyway.  </li>
            <li> If you use a drop or 2  every 6 months there is enough to last a few years.</li>
            <li> After one year, using it maybe 60 times total, it only vibrates for a few seconds and dies.    </li>
            <li> This trimmer is approximately 3/8\\&quot; wide, so it&#x27;ll let you cut a distinct edging to your fur.  </li>
            <li> next time I tried to use it, it was dead, though I had it plugged in for several days and was, hopefully, charging it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and they stated that it does a decent job with thick hair, so I figured it&#x27;d work well with my boyfriend&#x27;s beard.</li>
            <li> I believe it was not new as mentioned in the product page.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t grow my facial hair out that long (like a 3 on the trimmer, but I trim down to a 2).</li>
            <li> I had also tried a gimmicky one with a vacuum (girlfriend always complaining about tiny hairs in the sink) but that cut even worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this clipper a year ago and have used it 12 times for cutting thin under-belly hair and fine ear hairs of my Golden Retriever.  </li>
            <li> The smaller detail blade requires you to unscrew the current blade and attach the smaller blade, making that feature a little less convenient.</li>
            <li> B000TFNH1U Philips Norelco Body Groomer Limited Edition BG2022]], and</li>
            <li> use the trimmer once a week to shave my head and the charge on lithium ion battery lasts for couple months on a single charge.</li>
            <li> It also comes with a 5 year limited warranty.     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve charged this thing 2 times in over a month, and it&#x27;s had a charge every single time I needed to use it.  </li>
            <li> I thought that it would carry me through a single trimming if I just started with it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only ever charged it right before use and now the thing is useless.</li>
            <li> All the attachments come with a tray, but unfortunately there is no real way to organize anything on it, and I think it would be better to just toss everything into a little plastic storage container than to use this tray that came with it.    </li>
            <li> The following is quite long and not quite like a typical review.</li>
            <li> What sucks is the #2 is, instead of 1/4\\&quot; somewhere between a normal #1 and #2.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this for several months now and use it on average two times per week for about 5 minutes each.</li>
            <li> This is a far cry from the clippers I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> Only complaint so far is that after cleaning, the wide trimmer attachment can be a pain to click into place on the trimmer.</li>
            <li> It does not worth the money to use it only 4 times !</li>
            <li> One negative is that the hair is hard to clean off the trimmer.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed after unpacking is the poorly designed holder for all the head accessories.</li>
            <li> o the 6 position guide is very difficult to adjust and in the course of doing so the top part of it popped off.  </li>
            <li> Unlike my old Ni-Cd charged trimmer which would be dead within a few days if not left in the charger.</li>
            <li> One of the blades seems to be loose and the product no longer cuts hair.</li>
            <li> Head is extremely hard to remove to put new head on.</li>
            <li> My previous trimmer, which cost me less then $20, lasted for nearly 7 years.  </li>
            <li> I use my trimmer for my goatee and to trim down the hair on my head prior to shaving it.</li>
            <li> I also use it for overall body grooming, just take it into the shower, shave down, then shower.</li>
            <li> Only &#x27;down fall&#x27;</li>
            <li> big difference between the li-on and the nicad version - no slowing down before expiring.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m down to only the medium width</li>
            <li> If this one breaks down, I will definitely buy this product again.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> They could keep the price down if they would give us only what we need it for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It now only runs for maybe 1-2 minutes, and even noticeably slows down even during that time.</li>
            <li> Next day as I finished my neck, the battery was running down again.</li>
            <li> rare but not pleasant!  </li>
            <li> Only lasted a year, not worth the purchase if it fails so quickly.</li>
            <li> Very capable trimmer, unfortunately these used to last 4 or 5 years.</li>
            <li> The battery stays charged for a VERY long time!</li>
            <li> More crap made in some far off foreign land.</li>
            <li> But the two cutting and one trimming head pop off the body of the trimmer and are easily replaced.  </li>
            <li> I literally have 4 shavers plugged in as it seems impossible to get a shaver that does more than one thing well.   </li>
            <li> After becoming frustrated with the offerings from the market share leader, I sought advice from a friend who uses these tools daily.</li>
            <li> I had my last wahl for several years, not sure why this one could not survive 7 uses.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the second one I&#x27;ve bought and it failed, just like the first one, after about six months use.</li>
            <li> Half of the time instead of trimming/cutting, the blades will actually pull hair out.</li>
            <li> The noise level is not a problem at all for me - it&#x27;s noisy but not objectionable in your ear, about the same or less noise level as my rotary trimmer.    </li>
            <li> For beard trimming (I have a goatee that I keep fairly short), it works well but is slightly less convenient than the all-in-one beard groomers I have owned.</li>
            <li> The big problem is the black grip that you hold on to.</li>
            <li> I would have to recharge previous cordless trimmers daily.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only sported a beard for about six months now, so I&#x27;m still learning the tricks of the trade, but the previous trimmer I bought couldn&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> Dry, and wet.</li>
            <li> I only have to recharge my Wahl trimmer every month and a half.  </li>
            <li> The plastic beard-length guide looks and feels (as you&#x27;re trying to snap it on) cheesy and insubstantial, but it actually works pretty well.      </li>
            <li> This beard trimmer lasted only  year and half.  </li>
            <li> Bought this at a local store and couldn&#x27;t have been more disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I shall be buying myself and Wet &amp; Dry trimmer.</li>
            <li> The run time is barely enough to clip half a leg now.</li>
            <li> I had previously used a Wahl for several years before I &amp;#34;upgraded&amp;#34; to this model.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to getting only 4 to 5 trims per charge from a typical battery operated beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> My previous one lasted for several years.</li>
            <li> Other shavers and trimmers from other brands are simple pop-on, pop-off design.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;organizer\\&quot; that this set comes with is pretty useless, but only because it doesn&#x27;t weigh anything.  </li>
            <li> My only slight issue is the lack of a charging indicator.  </li>
            <li> Same product at Costco, with a slightly lower price.  </li>
            <li> This Wahl product is definitely a lower construction standard than past Wahl products I have owned.  </li>
            <li> However, the blades are of questionable quality and mine rusted quickly.</li>
            <li> The only other thing I&#x27;d mention, is that one has to be very careful when putting on the trimmer heads, as it is a bit tricky, and the parts could break if you&#x27;re a troglodyte about it.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a lie, that&#x27;s very irritating even on full</li>
            <li> so it can be brushed of instead of needing to be wiped down with a wet rag.</li>
            <li> Hair gets stuck to it constantly, and you have to wipe it down with a wet cloth in order to get all the hair off.</li>
            <li> In reference to the woman&#x27;s personal groomers, the batteries never lasted long, the clippers would always dull out and there were never enough accessories.</li>
            <li> main complaint about every other electric beard trimmer I&#x27;ve owned is battery life.</li>
            <li> The torque is rather robust, compared to other razors and the charge lasts fairly long.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a versatile tool that is well thought out and lasts a long time in comparison with some of the other products on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a versatile tool that is well thought out and lasts a long time in comparison with some of the other products on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only regret was cutting off the rubber sheath, which likely would have peeled off in one piece if I had tried that first.</li>
            <li> This is not a full sized Wahl trimmer so do not expect to open up a salon with this thing.</li>
            <li> other relatively minor issue is the tray for the attachments.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts long and I like the other attachments.  </li>
            <li> And the battery begins to peter out after 30 seconds, too slow to use after one minute, and completely without power at 1½ minutes!  </li>
            <li> After a 45 minute phone call and specifically telling the operator I was going to both cancel not only my service but my future prime membership (and even mentioned I was going to write a bad review along with other other in adequate product I received) she simply responded with, &amp;#34;Okay, sir.</li>
            <li> My only problem with this trimmer is that the cutting heads seem to rust rather quickly.</li>
            <li> Gets into tight facial spots with no problem.  </li>
            <li> If I spent $20, 30, 40 doesn&#x27;t matter how much - I expect at list a simple plain box to keep this ridiculous amount of attachments organized and neat.</li>
            <li> The markings to indicate which length each is are very hard to see and aren&#x27;t very intuitive either - Roman numerals for stubble guards 1 to 111.</li>
            <li> As of now, it can be \\&quot;fully charged\\&quot;, and it will last only a couple minutes using the trimmer attachment until it is fully dead, rendering it pretty much useless in this aspect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Such is unfortunately the case with the Wahl Lithium Ion All in one Trimmer, while having a large assortment of attachments, each on only half completes its task.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works just fine for trimming my beard and moustache, and also cutting my hair.</li>
            <li> It is especially alarming that the second one failed so quickly.  </li>
            <li> dO not waste your money on any other product like I did in the past.</li>
            <li> The foil head doesn&#x27;t always get every little hair, I&#x27;ve had to go back with scissors sometimes.  </li>
            <li> i would expect it to last a little longer than 7 months</li>
            <li> Feels a little cheaper than the last Wahl model.  </li>
            <li> Product seems a little frail and I&#x27;m not convinced it will last, time will tell.  </li>
            <li> Have been using about twice weekly for only a little over a month, so I cannot speak to it&#x27;s length of life.</li>
            <li> Changing heads from the regular one to the little trimmer can be a little problematic getting the head to seat properly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The little shaver attachment, which is a double head...  </li>
            <li> I have had a little experience with one of their beard trimmers that runs on a regular battery.</li>
            <li> seems to cut well, the head is a little smaller</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a little bigger</li>
            <li> Product stopped working after 3 months of moderate to little use.</li>
            <li> When this arrived and I saw the size (was expecting a full-sized Wahl, this was a little smaller than that)</li>
            <li> This little tool does the trick and is sometimes stolen by my husband to do some beard and facial hair trimming as well.</li>
            <li> secondly, I got a little water splash on the blade and</li>
            <li> He said the work really well with his tough textured hair.</li>
            <li> Currently owning this product for a little over a week and the blades are already rusting even being careful.</li>
            <li> The only draw-back is the rubber handle, which is a magnet for small hairs and is difficult to clean.</li>
            <li> Our old ones took batteries or had to be plugged in and the blades were dull.  </li>
            <li> The seam where the metal and rubber are joined had a fairly large &amp; uneven gap and some glue was dried, seemingly having oozed out of the gap onto the rubber grip and dried on</li>
            <li> A major complaint is that the trimmer has soft plastic or rubber ( I&#x27;m not sure which) to which trimmed hairs stick.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe it when every use included pulled hair; sometimes only slight tugs and other times outright hurtful pulls.</li>
            <li> The multiple attachments gave me the necessary tools to reach those hard to get spots on my face.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait until my replacement comes in later this week because No Shave November needs to get mowed down!  </li>
            <li> BG2022 Bodygroom, Limited Edition]] and the other a [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll order another just to make sure it wasn&#x27;t a bad piece.</li>
            <li> I perhaps would have hoped for better, but it&#x27;s not too bad.</li>
            <li> This is a huge disappointment and seems uncharacteristic for a Lithium-Ion battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also featured the worst power I have ever experienced for a shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had at least a handful of beard/mustache trimmers throughout my adult life</li>
            <li> Disappointing that it only lasted 6 months of light use a few time a week.</li>
            <li> Granted, I only use it once or twice a week for 10 minutes, but none of the rechargeable clippers I&#x27;ve owned in the past even would have held a charge that long WITHOUT being used.</li>
            <li> the lesser expensive 9854 now matter how much force I used.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find it to be excessively loud as others have complained about.</li>
            <li> but it does not really hold the charging cable</li>
            <li> It is not really a charging stand.  </li>
            <li> I got mine wet</li>
            <li> Update (March 2010): Received a partial refund, that moves it up from 1 star to 2.</li>
            <li> No really, this thing is a like a lawnmower on crack.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> The metal that the heads are made of is not very well chemically engineered.</li>
            <li> For a shaving heads, minimal amount of water should be tolerated however this Wahl had 0 tolerance.</li>
            <li> Dont buy it, try something else or suffer the same result in a few days.</li>
            <li> But be careful not to shave when you aren&#x27;t awake yet ...</li>
            <li> may result in divots that take a few days to grow back!</li>
            <li> trimming with absolutely no \\&quot;pull\\&quot; or pain</li>
            <li> It worked, but only for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last and was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> o One of the guides was missing, while the package contained two of the same size.  </li>
            <li> As expected.  </li>
            <li> However, in fairness, it was never really intended for this purpose.  </li>
            <li> However, Wahl made its name in hair clippers and could hardly be expected to leave one out of an all-in-one trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I replaced a basic rechargeable Wahl trimmer that had to be over 15 yr&#x27;s old (battery finally went belly up), &amp; will stop using a Braun trimmer that&#x27;s difficult to use.</li>
            <li> And, it comes with a wide assortment of attachments for almost any grooming task.</li>
            <li> While I have never been cut, it can give you a nip if you bring the blade perpendicular to your skin, so be careful.  </li>
            <li> The pieces do not fit well in the all-in-one holder like shown in the picture, but that was the only let-down.</li>
            <li> I used it a few times a week to trim my nose, facial hair, etc.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s really not meant for this</li>
            <li> I use it for a few minutes each morning, and have only had to charge it perhaps weekly or longer.</li>
            <li> It just so happens I was at Walmart looking for a pair of clippers I had bought in the past (apparently discontinued) and couldn&#x27;t find them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After only a few months, the unit would not hold a charge and had to be plugged in all day every day.</li>
            <li> There is no warning LED/LCD that recharge is needed soon, which is not critical with the lithium ion one of these but seems like a missing feature.&lt;br</li>
            <li> would absolutely NOT recommend this trimmer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Battery won&#x27;t hold a charge after only a few uses.  </li>
            <li> Just what I wanted and expected.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no complaints</li>
            <li> Well I got this thing a few months ago after several people recommended it to me.  </li>
            <li> Still have plenty of charge left after 15+ minutes of heavy use.</li>
            <li> The shaver attachment works well, though I prefer a wet razor.   </li>
            <li> /&gt;i tried using it while it was plugged in but it would only run for a few seconds then quit again.</li>
            <li> Figuring out the beard trimming features took a few minutes but wasn&#x27;t a big deal.  </li>
            <li> Does not hold charge like I expected from Li-ion battery.</li>
            <li> The only thing missing is the ear and nose hair attachment.</li>
            <li> I keep my sink empty now days while I use this one.  </li>
            <li> The only issue I have is that the guide is not smoothly adjustable.</li>
            <li> I found that some of the trimmer heads were not real helpful for me.  </li>
            <li> The blades are rusty - and I haven&#x27;t used it on wet</li>
            <li> I have only had it a few days.</li>
            <li> 13 months later it is completely dead.  </li>
            <li> But, if you carefully tilt it, it works well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Minus one quarter-star for lack of an LED charge indicator.    </li>
            <li> Minus</li>
            <li> but it was dead the next day.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s to be expected in any rechargeable product.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll have to carefully grab the plug and insert it into the bottom of the trimmer, after each time you use it, before setting it in the stand.</li>
            <li> Anyways that only works for another few weeks or so and then it becomes a paper weight as mine is now.</li>
            <li> lasted 14 months, and then stopped dead in the middle of a trim.</li>
            <li> I thought I would use it to get some straggling hairs around my eyebrows, and I had to make several passes before it would cut the hairs off - unevenly and not closely.</li>
            <li> The Wahl requires multiple passes and even then, lots of uneven and straggling hairs.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve attempted to use it twice (once wet</li>
            <li> After about 18-24 months the battery dies and that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Do NOT get wet.</li>
            <li> The arrival was before expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times since I received this trimmer and it has meet all my expectations.</li>
            <li> I can actually travel away from home for a few weeks and not need to bring the charger.</li>
            <li> I took it to the factory repair center to have it repaired.</li>
            <li> I called but the offices were closed.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using this to trim my beard for the last few years</li>
            <li> Still need to blow on the unit to get rid of the hairs, but it&#x27;s not nearly as much of an issue as when it was new.]&lt;br</li>
            <li> It just shouldn&#x27;t be this much trouble for something so ridiculously simple as a trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The trimmer itself works well, but be warned that it will RUST if you leave it wet.</li>
            <li> Not much to really say about a utility piece like this.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t get it wet as they don&#x27;t like water.</li>
            <li> But after a few times, it is actually quite easy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I had trouble with the adjustable length trimmer &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34; (not the comb above).</li>
            <li> It just kept missing hairs left</li>
            <li> (BTW you cant shave your head with wet hair...water or sweat.</li>
            <li> bought as a gift and performed as expected.  </li>
            <li> You can charge this all you want but the next time you go to use it, it will be dead.</li>
            <li> and if I unplug it, shave with it and forget to plug it back in, it will be dead on Monday when I need it again.  </li>
            <li> I can tell its working harder than it should need to.</li>
            <li> An eight-month life span was not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Received one of these for Christmas a few years ago and the battery only lasted about 5 months.  </li>
            <li> It has a rough edge to it so it snags and nicks the skin vs gliding across it</li>
            <li> Shaver head doesn&#x27;t work as well as I would have expected it to.</li>
            <li> The various attachments do not fit into it.</li>
            <li> It works just as I expected to do.</li>
            <li> There really is no comparision</li>
            <li> so i sent it to wahl with the charger, and a few weeks later they returned it</li>
            <li> After only a few uses, the battery in the trimmer would no longer retain a charge.</li>
            <li> I got 3 minutes 6 seconds until it was completely dead, and the last 45 seconds</li>
            <li> but when it arrived the instructions basically said be careful not to shave your eyebrows off</li>
            <li> However when I am overseas I have to bring a heavy voltage adapter because they only operate on US voltage.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would complain about is the adjustable attachment does not hold its setting firmly.  </li>
            <li> So, perhaps the earlier communication with them was not accurate.  </li>
            <li> Trimmed my beard four times, then two of the thin, fixed metal prongs (which separate the trimmer blades) simply broke off.</li>
            <li> I only use it for a few minutes at a time, but I expected the battery to die just sitting there.</li>
            <li> Wahl fixed my broken trimmer and send it back to me!!!</li>
            <li> Worst of all, the standard razor doesn&#x27;t do a good job of getting a close shave.  </li>
            <li> steel\\&quot; teeth broke after only 3 months of use by my husband (who doesn&#x27;t have thick or coarse hair)</li>
            <li> It also would have been nice if you could charge the unit in the base itself, but you have to plug the unit into the wall using a separate adapter.  </li>
            <li> It can be dusted off, but still, it&#x27;s kind of annoying for a trimmer that isn&#x27;t waterproof.</li>
            <li> It comes with a plethora of attachments and accessories, and everything stores nicely in a sturdy plastic base.</li>
            <li> Most of the other manufacturers include those hard plastic guides, which sometimes break (I have broken a few).  </li>
            <li> I have no idea why lithium trimmers are not more common; the battery keeps a charge for a very long time, recharges fast, and has plenty of power.</li>
            <li> being men doesnt mean you have to be harsh to your skin, be gentle rather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Battery was starting to fade a bit and the clippers got a little rusty due to negligence.</li>
            <li> The larger cutter actually broke a tooth and the other is rusting and dull.  </li>
            <li> I use the trimmer only for trimming sideburns and hairline on my neck, so I really don&#x27;t need the other accessories it comes with, and the base is just inconvenient, though it looks good in the picture.</li>
            <li> My second unit was shipped to me, which then lasted me 2 weeks before the same failure occurred.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy to knock the base over if you&#x27;re not careful -</li>
            <li> : the foil shaving head sucks on any area other than the mid to upper cheeks.</li>
            <li> All in all, if you have thick or coarse facial hair, look the other way.</li>
            <li> The gauge of wire used for the AC adapter is so stiff you can&#x27;t roll it up properly to store.</li>
            <li> The internal battery lasts longer on a single charge than anything else I have purchased in the past.  </li>
            <li> The attachments which were provided are all swapped out by removing the entire blade and snapping the other attachment firmly into place.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had to charge it once and the battery has lasted for a few months, and that&#x27;s while using it every other day.</li>
            <li> only use this to trim my sideburns, so all of the other attachments are a waste for me.</li>
            <li> It did seem that the charge on the unit might not last as long as some other trimmers I have used in the past, but I think that is due to</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ridiculous how many useless accessories came with the package.</li>
            <li> It was not powerful, slow to charge, intermittent in its operation and finally after only 4 uses died and fell apart!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re buying this one for its accessories and maybe because it has a Li-ion battery (though that is my, and a few other commenters&#x27;, main complaint).</li>
            <li> Not very powerful.  </li>
            <li> The one disappointment I had with this trimmer is the tool that is used to give you a clean shave.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, there seem to be a huge number that don&#x27;t make it past 1½ years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not good enough to shave with as a final shaver.</li>
            <li> The Wahl 9854-600 shaver is a decent, but not a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I started growing a beard back around November 2014 and by January 2015, had a long, thick beard.</li>
            <li> Had an older Wahl product quit on me and bought this to use in the interim, while I sent the broken one in for repair to</li>
            <li> New battery charger is very small and less of an eyesore.  </li>
            <li> other reviewers had a different experience, but for me, the dual foil shaver was NOT good for shaving facial hair.</li>
            <li> So once it was obvious that it was complete junk as a facial trimmer I thought to re purpose it for the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; areas too bad it didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m disappointed because the trimmer is clearly well made - I just wish I could put a guard on it that was the right depth for my needs.</li>
            <li> This personal grooming set has a lot of attachments, but unfortunately, it seems to try to do too much in one little unit.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing as I have owned and used other Wahl trimmers that worked fine for several years.</li>
            <li> However, putting them on and off is really easy - not as complicated (at least to me) as others have mentioned.</li>
            <li> I have had some of the other trimmers from other manufacturers and they typically come with the adjustable type of guides, or only a few attachments.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed dull after few months thought that I would get the better brand, the more expensive one</li>
            <li> Only complaint - a single blade on the the trimmer blade broke about a year ago - the replacement is $18.</li>
            <li> Beefier than other trimmers</li>
            <li> Some of the other reviewers have talked about the noise</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver based on other reviews.  </li>
            <li> Have had to have it replaced twice due to the PITA charging procedure.  </li>
            <li> I have seen those on other models).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will never use all of the attachments, so if you&#x27;re into all that then maybe you need to read other reviews.</li>
            <li> Other than that I like the machine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start with the points I did NOT find easily in other reviews    </li>
            <li> The other point I was unclear about in other reviews</li>
            <li> Other beard groomers I have owned (both Panasonic) died after a couple of years and had to be plugged in.    </li>
            <li> The blades are sharp and do their job.</li>
            <li> The adjustable length guide changes settings due to the slightest amount of pressure while using.</li>
            <li> the amount of other units.</li>
            <li> I wear a medium stubble trimmed beard which I trim maybe once a week, sometimes every other week.</li>
            <li> If other #1&#x27;s are</li>
            <li> But for some reason it didn&#x27;t come with the Stubble trimmer, but came with the other two.</li>
            <li> Definitely an improvement over past products.  </li>
            <li> I was using this product the other day and decided I just had to take some time to rave about it.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer and its accessories will trim all beards, mustaches, brows, and other body hair.</li>
            <li> our other one wore out</li>
            <li> A wet washcloth does wipe them off, but what a pain!</li>
            <li> I was always losing bit and pieces from other trimmers, but with this tray I can keep everything together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was always losing bit and pieces from other trimmers, but with this tray I can keep everything together.    </li>
            <li> Having used such trimmer combs in the past, I see no reason why they won&#x27;t work well as they&#x27;re comparable in design as anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.    </li>
            <li> - The plug doesn&#x27;t detach when lifting the trimmer due to the way it was designed.  </li>
            <li> At first somewhat skeptical of quality with all of the varied attachments.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased any other one.</li>
            <li> I have never had this problem with other Wahl trimmers before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hope Remington, Panasonic or any other razor manufacturer makes a quality product.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t, I instead use my other razor.  </li>
            <li> I did not notice any excess vibrations mentioned by other reviewers.</li>
            <li> On a recommendation from a friend I&#x27;ve started using this unit for my \\&quot;close\\&quot; shaves other than when I use a razor.</li>
            <li> All the other reviews complaining about \\&quot;noise\\&quot; and the rubber grips are being way too over-sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I used this shaver every other day for 3 years when one day, it would no longer take a charge.</li>
            <li> Threw it in the garbage at that point, but can describe other deficiencies which I found before throwing it away:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> (One note though: I have to keep the attachments in a small box next to the trimmer, because my wife and kids kept bumping the holding tray and scattering the assortment all around the sink counter-top.)</li>
            <li> My hair now takes an hour to cut, due to this clip/recharge cycle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for 4 years and never had a problem other than losing the attachments and charger when I moved.</li>
            <li> Over priced due to lithium battery.  </li>
            <li> However, unlike all other clippers, the Li battery will not discharge unless It&#x27;s on.  </li>
            <li> I just about can&#x27;t stand any other aspect of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought a replacement and after about 6 mo like the other reviewers it wont hold a charge or work when plugged into the wall.</li>
            <li> He was skeptical at first, but he tried it and he loves it.  </li>
            <li> not sure if this is the first hair trimmer that cannot get wet or it is just poorly made</li>
            <li> current problem is trying to find a trimmer with zero overlap that comes with guides that extend past 3/16 mm.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately after using the first one for 3 years, I accidentally dropped it in a sink of water.  </li>
            <li> other is</li>
            <li> agree with other reviewers that it seems too noisy.</li>
            <li> I called their support number (800-767-9245) and talked to Julie, who was extremely helpful.  </li>
            <li> Product arrived a day before due date.  </li>
            <li> The on/off switch is extremely flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He still uses his other hand shaver but he uses this to shape and form his beard</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried any of the other blades yet.</li>
            <li> try one other adapter but it to was not acceptable.</li>
            <li> The blades have always stayed sharp and don&#x27;t pull at all.  </li>
            <li> Returning it today and will begin looking at other brands.  </li>
            <li> Keeping in mind that replacement blades etc usually aren&#x27;t properly aligned.</li>
            <li> its that bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get around this, I literally just put masking tape around all of the &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; areas of the clipper which did the job, but certainly not a pretty sight.  </li>
            <li> Always hoping one or the other will prove to be a winner.  </li>
            <li> Other</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for a long time and it trims without missing.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be an indoor chainsaw!  </li>
            <li> This has never happened to me with other trimmers from Wahl or any other brand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> holds the charge extremely well.</li>
            <li> bought this based on my satisfaction with other Wahl products.  </li>
            <li> Also as I have read in other reviews the electric shaver attachment is pretty much useless.</li>
            <li> So it can not be used if you travel to some other country that uses 220V.</li>
            <li> I then went to use the trimmer the other night and it would not turn on.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if my beard hairs are too coarse or what the problem is, but I ended up just throwing the foil shaver away.  </li>
            <li> Other companies have trimmers in the $14-$21 range that will work just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After some abuse, one had damaged blades and the other one was &amp;#34;adopted&amp;#34; by another family member.  </li>
            <li> included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But other than that I&#x27;ve got no problems.  </li>
            <li> The teeth on the cutter head do not get caught in my pores/hair falical like other trimmers I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> IT TO OTHER&#x27;S</li>
            <li> The other reviewers are correct about hair sticking to the handle.</li>
            <li> This thing maybe works well 20% of the time, the other 80% leaves me cursing as it tugs and pulls the hairs out when i try to trim my beard.</li>
            <li> This unit was a bit weird to use at first</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use all the attachments, but the ones that I do are sharp and trim well.  </li>
            <li> Extremely rapid charge.  </li>
            <li> I am now looking for a other brand trimmer to buy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a quality product and other than the battery which will eventually die, I would buy it again and again.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day.</li>
            <li> wit othe trimmers due to the attachment piece breaking making attachments wobbly and unusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also read in the instructions any of these blades can be used on other parts of one&#x27;s body that are shaved or need to be shaved.        </li>
            <li> but I have used it every other day since getting it.</li>
            <li> Used weekly for beard and other nuisance hair trimming.</li>
            <li> /&gt;One other.</li>
            <li> Firstly, switch is sticky and difficult to turn on an off, the rubberised coating attracts any and all dirt and trimmed whiskers.</li>
            <li> The awkward stage between stubble and true beardiness.</li>
            <li> dont get any other one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel the tugging I&#x27;m used to from other foil shavers</li>
            <li> (They have made a lot of money due to my loyalty to the site), so I like to investigate before buying.  </li>
            <li> : Bought the second one a few weeks ago!  </li>
            <li> He has issues with razor burn on his neck and this seems to cause fewer issues than a razor or any other electric shaver he has used.</li>
            <li> at all.&lt;br /&gt;The wider metal blade attachment is too sharp like other reviewers have pointed out.</li>
            <li> Have had other Wahl trimmers before and wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else.</li>
            <li> But with all the other attachments for 25$</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s satisfactory, but I would have preferred a comb or other height adjustment for a &amp;#34;stubble&amp;#34; height.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Only other issue with it is the T-blade...</li>
            <li> One trimmer would have one item, and not the other item, needed.  </li>
            <li> Lives up to the other reviews I&#x27;ve read.  </li>
            <li> All my past trimmers had several problems.  </li>
            <li> Other trimmers offer &amp;#34;lube for life&amp;#34;, meaning you never have to oil the blades.  </li>
            <li> However, i don&#x27;t expect this one to go out anytime soon considering I put the other whal through about 10 years and still use it for body shaving.</li>
            <li> : 1) Have to use screw driver to remove default trim head and to put on other trim heads for Close shave&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> The blades are really sharp on every attachment.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this to cut any other types of hair</li>
            <li> I want to let other shoppers know about it.  </li>
            <li> Its small enough to take on trips</li>
            <li> a year of use (about 6 uses - every other month)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s up there with my other Wahl clippers.</li>
            <li> I usually have to go one size bigger for that not to happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other part to that is there is</li>
            <li> Extremely well built.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to have to wipe the handle down with a wet towel every time I shave.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I will even go a week without shaving, then use the wide blade to trim down my beard</li>
            <li> However, all you have to do is take a wet cloth, wrap it around the rubber grip, and pull down.</li>
            <li> The base unit is pretty worthless as far as organizing all parts that it comes with, but it&#x27;s nice not to have to keep this charged in all the time due to the Lithium Ion battery.  </li>
            <li> Second concern is that taking off the trimmer guards (one in particular) is a little difficult.  </li>
            <li> Wahl stood behind their product and sent a brand new replacement shaver in about 10 days time.</li>
            <li> But having recently moved back to a Norelco unit (Norelco Qg3280), I see now how poor a job the Wahl trimmer had been doing.  </li>
            <li> But having recently moved back to a Norelco unit (Norelco Qg3280), I see now how poor a job the Wahl trimmer had been doing.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s already gone through several different brands of clippers, which have all broken, and never worked well to begin</li>
            <li> Not only did it not hold all of the attachments, but was made from such a thin plastic that it crumpled just by trying to put the pieces in their slots.</li>
            <li> (What help is it for me if there are also Spanish instructions when the English ones are so poor?)  </li>
            <li> This caused me to press harder which cost me nearly half of my beard.</li>
            <li> The plastic blade guards are VERY flimsy, and the method for attaching the blades is really weird, so EVERYTIME he  tries to hange them, he seems to have to fiddle with them for a minute to get them on.</li>
            <li> so i am really confused why such a short life.</li>
            <li> Occasionally Ill see professional stylists using the same model.</li>
            <li> only problem is that I&#x27;ve had it for a short time, and the blades are already rusting!&lt;br /&gt;But that might be my fault for poor maintenance.</li>
            <li> After a single use the battery is dead.</li>
            <li> And speaking of charging, there is no light or any single indicator to let you know it is charging or is done.</li>
            <li> If I had known this I may have picked a different trimmer as I very rarely travel and prefer for home use to have a base rather then a travel bag.</li>
            <li> I thought nothing of it since it would still last 3-4 shaves (~30-40 min), but then as the months rolled on it got worse and worse to the point that it would barely make it through a single shave without needing a bump of juice (and about 5-10 extra minutes of waiting).</li>
            <li> The power is unbelievable and I would recommend this trimmer to anyone that has had problems with the current or previous trimmer.  </li>
            <li> of small parts that aren&#x27;t necessary for my use, not meant for travel, not very easy to change blades it</li>
            <li> I have continued to purchase trimmers over the past few years, only to have to continue to buy new ones because of the poor quality of them.</li>
            <li> a little rough sometimes</li>
            <li> attachments are a little harder to install.  </li>
            <li> (speaking of drops, my friend dropped his, be careful little drops will break of the blade tips which can result in cuts if you don&#x27;t notice.)    </li>
            <li> Not real easy changing heads.</li>
            <li> The remaining attachments should be grouped as optional accessories for particular purposes, such as hair cutting, beard and mustache trimming, etc.  </li>
            <li> Not only does this product not have this cutting attachment, it doesn&#x27;t even accommodate this particular accessory.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s less possibility of that because this model can hold it&#x27;s charge for up to 10x longer than other models.</li>
            <li> One note though is that hair does stick to the black part of the clipper due to the type of material used.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;ve been using it every other day for a week and a half since and it hasn&#x27;t died yet.</li>
            <li> It can hardly cut properly, so it pulls on the hair before it cuts.  </li>
            <li> only real downsides to this shaver are that it isn&#x27;t waterproof (so no rinsing it off in the sink) and that the process to change blades is a little bit awkward.</li>
            <li> The unit takes very little time to charge and it lasts a long time before needing a recharge.</li>
            <li> The material feels nice when you hold it, but looks messy and is a little annoying to keep clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They just sit loosely in the recessed areas, and are easily knocked out when the flimsy base gets knocked around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care about the sound of the buzzer, and the rubber isn&#x27;t as bad at</li>
            <li> /&gt;This may be just my bad luck, as I tend to have with electronics, or the fact that I use it lightly every day.</li>
            <li> All your trimming will stick to it and it is almost impossible to keep clean.</li>
            <li> Replaces another that lived only four years, but at least I now have two sets of attachments.</li>
            <li> The plastic holding tray is not exciting, but I don&#x27;t expect to decorate the bath with my trimmer</li>
            <li> Not worth the purchase or the brand name it carries.</li>
            <li> It seems to me that a battery should last at least 2 years.      </li>
            <li> I recharged it for a few hours only to unplug it and find it still dead!</li>
            <li> For $32 item, it is not worth it.   </li>
            <li> Certainly not worth the $40</li>
            <li> I paid ~$40 for a trimmer that no longer works without being plugged in for at least five minutes and with a ton of attachments that are essentially worthless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only complaint.  </li>
            <li> Its not fun trying to shave in 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li> My last trimmer was a Norelco and it lasted for at least 3 years.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> No success yet.</li>
            <li> and I really wanted to like this trimmer, but unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work out.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d rate this Wahl Lithium Ion Trimmer about AVERAGE (see update below).  </li>
            <li> But if all you are looking for is an average trimmer this will suffice.  </li>
            <li> my only complaint, and</li>
            <li> Not worth the money even with the warranty.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really rather unfortunate that, given the price and infrequency of my use of it, it has already stopped functioning.  </li>
            <li> Not worth for $ 39.</li>
            <li> Not the prettiest thing in the world, and the stand is useless, but the item is a real powerhouse.</li>
            <li> This is not worth the money I paid for it.</li>
            <li> only complaint I have is the tray that holds all the accessories.</li>
            <li> I used this Wahl trimmer for two years, on an average once a week for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> the black silicone type material that the trimmer is encased in is very difficult to clean; the clippings from my beard stick to it.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s only complaint... figuring out how to change the heads without breaking it.</li>
            <li> If you need different features, at least try to find a lithium or a trimmer that also works off AC while plugged in.</li>
            <li> the past few months the battery would only hold a charge for about 2 days.</li>
            <li> For the past few months the battery would only hold a charge for about 2 days.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; shaped trimmers and attachments worked really well, but now it is useless.</li>
            <li> His only complaint was that the handle of the trimmer was a bit sticky and all the shaved hair would stick to it, but</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have a really thick beard, just coarse hair.   </li>
            <li> Ni-cads are old school type of batteries and perform poorly.  </li>
            <li> 1st issue was/is poor battery contact, i.e., runs like battery is going dead when used at normal angles,</li>
            <li> the screen attachment, the wide cutter &amp; the narrow cutter are often used in my household.</li>
            <li> Additionally, if one&#x27;s hair is thin and sparse (as mine is), the trimmer will do one&#x27;s complete head.</li>
            <li> - The organizer base reduces accessory clutter on the counter top.  </li>
            <li> - The counter top accessory base does not hold things if/when bumped.  </li>
            <li> I was forced to keep it plugged in to use it until it finally quit working 2 months after I got it.</li>
            <li> I shave around once a week, and I don&#x27;t have thick facial hair...</li>
            <li> Not a huge turn-off, but you do need to use a wet paper towel or something to get the hair off.</li>
            <li> The stand, however, has got to be the most annoying stand I&#x27;ve seen with one of these trimmers.</li>
            <li> not even Chewbacca would appreciate them as most are worthless.  </li>
            <li> i am taking away a half star for that and a half star for not being as close as other shavers.</li>
            <li> At the second closet setting it did did a very messy, uneven trim.  </li>
            <li> Not very happy with this, my wahl hair trimmers have been working for over ten  years trimming my boys and my hair.</li>
            <li> I will see if this one lasts longer than the original or suffers the same premature failure and then \\&quot;I&#x27;ll be back\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> The unit is not made well - the top chrome plastic piece does not mate with the black base, leaving an unsightly gap.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m an idiot, but more than half the attachments do not fit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I consider it a lesson learned and forty dollars down the drain.</li>
            <li> but this product was/is a let down being from Wahl.</li>
            <li> (As for the product defect, the motor in mine would turn off when i flipped it upside down.</li>
            <li> Can get as close a cut as you need, all the way down to a shave (a shaver head is included).&lt;br /&gt;-  Lightweight, but sturdy.  </li>
            <li> it all fell down and everything went all over the floor.  </li>
            <li> After about 18 months I notice it slowing down and after two years it&#x27;ll die.</li>
            <li> (And the price hadn&#x27;t come down when i purchased it.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m down to one functional attachment.  </li>
            <li> the lithium battery has been great-the unit never bogs down.  </li>
            <li> i also noticed that the trimmer seemed to get louder as i used it, BUT after lubing it 1 time it brought the noise down and keeps it</li>
            <li> protection circuitry kicked in and shut it down, indicating that it was time for a recharge.  </li>
            <li> I assume this will die at some point down the road (they all do)</li>
            <li> Can use it corded if the battery runs down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll knock down what you have there</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got it down pat now</li>
            <li> I had narrowed it down to 2 trimmers.  </li>
            <li> I use it to shave down to the stubble</li>
            <li> other two blades, the hair trimmer and ear/nose trimmer, saw little use.</li>
            <li> but they need to get back to quality as that is what the Wahl name used to mean.    </li>
            <li> I would recommend this others or any of the other Wahl products!</li>
            <li> I can imagine what they&#x27;re describing because I had those little plastic organizers with some of the other like-products I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li> I initially noticed (as several other reviews have mentioned) that the accessories were EXTREMELY difficult to put on and off.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not changing my rating since I have purchased a different brand clipper in the mean time.</li>
            <li> After the failure of my last one about a year ago I opted for this model.</li>
            <li> On the down side, the many attachments included are nice, but it&#x27;s difficult to change from shaving attachments to hair cutting attachments and the plastic molded base does not hold the attachments well.</li>
            <li> attachements were a little hard to figure out, but I&#x27;ve had it for months and only charged it one time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very frustrating, and I&#x27;m very displeased with this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Also most of the extra crap is completely useless except for the extra blade and the guide combs.</li>
            <li> As with other one star reviews the same power failure happened with mine after a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> a nose trimmer, I prefer the round tip instead of this with sharp edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There was corrosion and a layer of green on the integrated circuit leads due to ambient moisture in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> prefer the Wahl narrow head to the wider head of the other manufacturers.</li>
            <li> Batteries in these little groomers cannot be replaced (at least not without a soldering iron and some technical</li>
            <li> Very small, I assumed it was a bigger hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the clip-on guards are a little flimsy.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, does not pull your hair.</li>
            <li> Use it for shaving a few other applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So that&#x27;s 2 dead razors now due to battery problems in less than 3 years, and these are supposed to have a 5-year warranty.</li>
            <li> So that&#x27;s 2 dead razors now due to battery problems in less than 3 years, and these are supposed to have a 5-year warranty.</li>
            <li> &quot; plastic piece was flimsy and weak), and I had to hold it very carefully when I trimmed, or else it would slip down to #1 and cut my beard too short.  </li>
            <li> but it needs to have a waterproofed PCB a slight rinse with water can kill it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Less than a year, that lasted.  </li>
            <li> There is a slight learning curve if you&#x27;ve never used a Wahl before.</li>
            <li> but it has a odd bug.  </li>
            <li> none the less.</li>
            <li> With that said, I&#x27;m moving on to the [[ASIN:B0037HP9OA Philips Norelco BG2040/34 Philips Norelco Bodygroom Pro Grooming System, Black / Silver]] for all my trimming needs.</li>
            <li> Shaving doesn&#x27;t irritate like with previous Wahls.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used previous rechargeable razors for 3-5 years before the battery stopped holding a charge.</li>
            <li> For much less money, I could have bought this unit and had them all.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it died on me after only about a month or so of moderate use.</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t want a trimmer that lasts less than 90 days b/c of rust</li>
            <li> My previous comment explained the annoyance of Wahl&#x27;s warranty service.</li>
            <li> The easy-switch heads make do-it-yourself trimming take less time.</li>
            <li> Had this trimmer less than a year and the battery will not hold a charge.</li>
            <li> I had previously</li>
            <li> I paid around $40 for this when I bought it, compared to the typical $20 ish that I paid for others (Which outperformed this by a longshot)</li>
            <li> Basically this was a downgrade over what I had previously.</li>
            <li> So, I decided to try the Wahl Li-Ion Trimmer as a replacement of my previous, 3 year-old wahl trimmer/shaver, which was beginning to have charging &amp; power issues.</li>
            <li> seriously, something this simple shouldn&#x27;t require it.</li>
            <li> I was going to give it less stars after using it</li>
            <li> /&gt;- pieces of hair stick to the black finish of the trimmer handle and is a hassle to remove.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this trimmer for slightly over a year now, using it about twice a week.</li>
            <li> The Remington is less than $20 too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost like the cutting head is too thick to accurately control it.</li>
            <li> I had done this 2 previous times and it still worked</li>
            <li> Had hoped would be as well made as my previous trimmer.</li>
            <li> There is a slight difference in the shape of the clipper blades.  </li>
            <li> Bought my first one about 8 years ago and was shocked by how long it stayed charged.</li>
            <li> Works well, but it&#x27;s not an all-in-one as it lacks the ear/nose hair rotary trimmer attachment for some odd reason.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had this trimmer for a little over a year, and the other day one of the little arms of the spring that holds the two blades of the trimmer head broke.  </li>
            <li> At this point I was just tempted to throw it away considering the components cost less the amount I was going to spend on a replacement battery (~$2.50).</li>
            <li> I previously owned a Remington and Conair.</li>
            <li> Finally the heads for the different pieces are difficult to change.</li>
            <li> I agree that it is noisier than previous models.  </li>
            <li> The black rubber on the handle is not slippery</li>
            <li> I used one previously, but lost it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried previously.</li>
            <li> like the previous commenter, the blades are already showing rust just from use.</li>
            <li> so you didn&#x27;t have a half dozen pieces laying around.  </li>
            <li> It is not super fancy but works well.</li>
            <li> This thing cost $36.99 and died in less than a year.</li>
            <li> The lithium battery lasts a lot longer between charges than previous models.  </li>
            <li> It holds a charge and is much less messier on the bathroom counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Product will work for less than two minutes even if plugged in.  </li>
            <li> So go ahead and buy this if you want something that will break and stop functioning in less than a year.</li>
            <li> I charge it over night and it literally dies after less than 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> Wahl has typically been a trustyworthy name</li>
            <li> The paper is folded in half and then has seven folds.</li>
            <li> have had it less than 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;will</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also quite a bit lighter than my previous trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hair trimmings stick to &#x27;sticky&#x27; rubber black handle area, under your grip.</li>
            <li> Batteries die and you have to throw it away after 1 year or less.</li>
            <li> If I unplug it, the battery drains itself completely in less than 12 hours.  </li>
            <li> Also, recommended charge time was typically 12 - 15 hours.  </li>
            <li> Came in less than 36 hours from order time via Amazon Prime too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This also trim my mustache and half gotee</li>
            <li> So after basically a half dozen uses the motor will no longer move any of the blades.</li>
            <li> B003YJAZZE Braun Series 7-760cc Pulsonic Shaver System, Black and Silver]] is louder, my Norelco [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> the battery started to show sign of problems and the trimmer worked for less than 10 minutes after 10 hours charge.&lt;br /&gt;18</li>
            <li> Wish this product would have performed half as well....</li>
            <li> It went a year and a half with perhaps weekly use before the motor went out.</li>
            <li> Lasts about a year like all previous trimmers i&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> He trims it  in about half the time now.</li>
            <li> less than a year</li>
            <li> All parts do not fit in storage base and some fit way to loose and fall out.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see how anyone can go wrong with this razor -- I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I realize pretty much every relatively inexpensive all-in-one trimmer has an annoying stand, but this stand seems to eject every attachment if you even look at it wrong.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s less than a few hours of total usage before failure.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the battery is not the worst part - the little cheap plastic &amp;#34;depth guides&amp;#34; have prongs that are too far apart</li>
            <li> First is that it takes two hands to alter the setting, or to remove and reattach it ... and because it&#x27;s a clip-on-top, rather than a fully enclosed attachment, you have to be careful around folds and wrinkles, to avoid getting nicked, especially on a shallow setting.  </li>
            <li> Also, the instructions that came with this trimmer are pretty bad, and it made it difficult at first to figure out how to attach some of the accessories and which ones to use...</li>
            <li> The people who say the blades broke just made a mess of it themselves by forcing.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed from the start since the product had a cheap feel to it.  </li>
            <li> My beard is a mess since I got this item.</li>
            <li> There is not much way to engineer that out of a hand held device that small.</li>
            <li> This will mess up your medicine closet/</li>
            <li> That stand is a mess.</li>
            <li> At least it gave me an excuse to stop ripping hair out with the Conair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t mess with the others.</li>
            <li> The batery least long time without have to charge again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, you don&#x27;t need to wear ear protection when you use it, but the sound can be heard (albeit faintly) through a closed bathroom</li>
            <li> The device feels cheap and I&#x27;m extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> the majority will probably get tossed into a drawer making a mess and never to be seen again.</li>
            <li> NOT cool... not a deal breaker though</li>
            <li> but I got tired of the beard and used the bare clippers to help shave them off since they would have clogged up my razor each swipe.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other trimmers and got tired of ones that pulled hair, took forever to trim my beard or were just lowsy quality.</li>
            <li> They offered me a refund and informed me that, due to the Wahl warranty, I could mail my broken Peanut for repair at a cost of only $15.</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair it takes really long to cut all of it.  </li>
            <li> i only charge it when i can tell it start to slow down, usually over night.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Little details matter less when compared to the quality and functions of this trimmer &amp; all around shaver and hair cutter.</li>
            <li> my previous trimmers batteries went bad too quickly, and otherwise wore out.</li>
            <li> However, experimentation will be required in order to narrow down your choices.  </li>
            <li> The bummer though is when trimming my beard within a few seconds it bogs down and jams.</li>
            <li> After using this trimmer for a few months I would have to knock it down a star.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on other trimmers when this one has it all !</li>
            <li> Also holds a very long charge, I hardly ever had to charge it.  </li>
            <li> The nicks weren&#x27;t from the blades knives but from the edge of the clipper blade tearing into my neck on tight corner of my face and neck.</li>
            <li> But I returned this trimmer after only a couple days for one annoying and seemingly trivial reason - without a guard, the blades cut very, very close.  </li>
            <li> Parts w sh almost as expensive as new unit.</li>
            <li> The only issue i would say is that the holder for all of the pieces is a little small and it is hard to keep them all in place.</li>
            <li> The adjustable facial hair head has a really weak slide mechanism, so it sometimes slipped down a few millimetres while I was using it and caused me to have to shave at an undesirable length.</li>
            <li> I was too quick to enter a bad review of this trimmer when the battery died, and I apologize to Wahl, Amazon and Amazon customers.</li>
            <li> I have only owned it for about 3 months and its pretty much worthless now.</li>
            <li> A tad annoying, but, problem easily solved, nevertheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A tad annoying, but, problem easily solved, nevertheless.  </li>
            <li> my only complaint is the small tip which I wanted to trim between my dogs paws.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for less than a year and the battery is about dead.</li>
            <li> It cuts close and has very little vibration compared to my other hair clippers.</li>
            <li> Very loud making it uncomfortable to trim close to the ears.  </li>
            <li> But now that it&#x27;s down to $30 on Prime, that may not be a bad price for a year&#x27;s worth of use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for little over a year and it has stopped functioning.  </li>
            <li> No significant amount of water was put on the heads however there were stains/signs of a beginning rust reaction.</li>
            <li> It sounds like any other one I have had in the past.  </li>
            <li> I was a little unsure of how to remove and attach blades but found a Wahl video on you tube that walked me thru the process.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll wait a little, and if they can&#x27;t get it in stock, I&#x27;ll buy the Remington MB 200.</li>
            <li> I have had this trimmer for a little over a month</li>
            <li> and I buy a lot of things, so you have to allow me to gush just a little.  </li>
            <li> And that little plastic \\&quot;hold</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;+ Comes with a well thought out tray for holding everything (including the little oil bottle that comes with it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;^---</li>
            <li> The foil shave attachment worked as well &amp; no better than other foil shavers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Within a week it mine was covered in little hairs.</li>
            <li> Within a week mine was covered in little hairs.  </li>
            <li> It took me a little time to get the hang of changing the grooming heads, but once you know how to do it, it&#x27;s literally a snap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s due to my having small nostrils or what.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s due to my using it in a small bathroom, but don&#x27;t expect to use it and not have others in rooms around</li>
            <li> I kept the box and use it to store and organize my unused and little used accessories.</li>
            <li> It finally fell apart, but it lasted for at least a decade!  </li>
            <li> The crappy little instruction paper said to stretch your skin and shave against the grain.</li>
            <li> , the rubber handle gets hair clinging to it a little bit</li>
            <li> sometimes it seems a little underpowered</li>
            <li> I would say that the weak point is the actual shaving head, but I don&#x27;t use it for that purpose.</li>
            <li> You have to keep them in a little bag that comes with it.</li>
            <li> After six months, the little spring on the blade attachment broke.</li>
            <li> but you&#x27;d have to steal this kit as I&#x27;d never give it up even if it is a little noisy.</li>
            <li> It took me a little trial and error to get all the attachments figured out.  </li>
            <li> The picture is not true to what you get, unless the green flimsy thing that was used in the packaging is the item that holds all the accessories and trimmer, we did not receive anything else.  </li>
            <li> Its battery eventually died and I wanted to upgrade to something that would hold a charge and would power through a beard a little</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried vigorously scrubbing it with a cotton towel which helps a little</li>
            <li> My hair seems to a little tougher then some</li>
            <li> I like a little scruff, so I do not use any of the attachments.</li>
            <li> They could have provided a little housing for all this stuff, so as to protect them from the bathroom&#x27;s environment, but nope.</li>
            <li> Changing attachments is a little cumbersome.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes the it takes a little bit of &amp;#34;fiddling&amp;#34; to change the heads but otherwise no complaints.</li>
            <li> This unit is rechargeable, and comes with a handy-dandy little station to hold all the attachments and the razor itself.</li>
            <li> I never tried the little attachments like the nose trimmer or shaver.</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned when I opened the box that this would be underpowered given its size and</li>
            <li> The motor seems well constructed and this little trimmer has some power.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other trimmers with a small LED to indicate when a charge is completed or needed.  </li>
            <li> A little noisy but works well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Dislikes: Attachment changes take little getting used to</li>
            <li> The little tray to hold everything is a joke.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before I bought this &amp; still had a little skepticism about it</li>
            <li> All I ask for is a little LED or something that lights up or blinks when charged.</li>
            <li> I had looked all throughout the Amazon.com store, and was not satisfied with reviews of other products.  </li>
            <li> I have used it for almost a month and there is no significant change in the power.</li>
            <li> and sometimes i have to give it a little tap to get it to start</li>
            <li> My first impression was way wrong!</li>
            <li> a little bit&lt;br /&gt;3-</li>
            <li> Bought this trimmer a little over two years ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m bald and cut what little hair I do have about 3x/week.  </li>
            <li> helps keep all the little attachments together.  </li>
            <li> I have a little quarrel with the nose hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> It could trim a little closer.</li>
            <li> A little while longer</li>
            <li> but there is confusion about the combs (sold separately) and compatibility between model and blade types plus little documentation from amazon or the manufacturers web site.</li>
            <li> The trimmer feels a little flimsy, thus the quarter star knock.  </li>
            <li> how little trimming I do with it</li>
            <li> this little guy just keeps crankin&#x27; like the Energizer bunny.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like this little trimmer,shaver,groomer,I&#x27;m a hairy guy</li>
            <li> even little peach fuzz on the neck.</li>
            <li> Also, the instructions could stand to be a little clearer.  </li>
            <li> The heads are a little tricky to change,  you must be at the correct angle or it is not going on or risk breaking the plastic tabs .</li>
            <li> Would have given 5 stars if the stubble guide was a little shorter.  </li>
            <li> The old head on the new base doesn&#x27;t pull.  </li>
            <li> After reading a few reviews I was a little iffy on what to expect.</li>
            <li> I have a five month beard going on, wanted to trim down to the longest setting on the trimmer and BAM!  </li>
            <li> The other negative reviews talk about bogging down in heavy beards or trimming hair.</li>
            <li> A VERY minor flaw which would be a ridiculous reason to return it,</li>
            <li> Given the cutting edge &amp; angle it provides, I found it more difficult to use on my ears &amp; nose.</li>
            <li> Not only did it come with a plethora of attachments for body trimming but also a different cutting tool for hair cuts.</li>
            <li> A big disappointment compared to my earlier model.  </li>
            <li> If you do not, you will not get much accomplished in terms of cutting your hair.  </li>
            <li> and I trim my beard, usually short, the beard cutting head/guards work well, but i prefer to use the larger (wider) head, just because it goes faster.</li>
            <li> Used it  it a few times.  </li>
            <li> I thought maybe the battery was dead</li>
            <li> It saw use maybe once a month for 20 minutes and it&#x27;s done dead on me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this a few months, and use it every day.</li>
            <li> a couple of the blades are missing.</li>
            <li> Then eventually it stopped working after a few minutes even with the cord plugged</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I picked up this trimmer a few days ago</li>
            <li> so I give it some heavy use.  </li>
            <li> Broke within a few months.</li>
            <li> Went completely dead within 6 months.</li>
            <li> The battery is now dead.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve been unable to find a replacement battery.  </li>
            <li> I plugged it in again for a few hours and still nothing.</li>
            <li> and it died again in a few seconds, this time while still plugged in.</li>
            <li> I started to cut my hair on the 19 of October, and the clipper went dead, I charged it for 2 minutes, and finished my hair cut.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> Days after use, I&#x27;d come back to find it still had enough charge for another round of cutting.</li>
            <li> but it still worked another year after being dried out.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take alot of time (few minutes) to recharge also.  </li>
            <li> The unit is not noisy unless compared to dead silence.</li>
            <li> This trimmer was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> I use an electric shaver (Braun 7680) for day-to-day and the Wahl every few days for the goatee.</li>
            <li> As a habitually clean-shaven man, I might seem a poor choice to review such a product, but a fortuitously timed job layoff has allowed me to grow a beard in order to fully test the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have been using it everyday for about 3 weeks</li>
            <li> So for the purpose of trimming ear &amp; nose hairs, I will continue to use my round headed ear &amp; nose hair trimmer (from Sharper Image - Turbo Groomer 5.0).     </li>
            <li> My beard is not too heavy and it works well for all of my needs.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is dead until it recharges, even when plugged in.</li>
            <li> have changed the heads quite a few times and still have trouble with getting them to click into place.</li>
            <li> After using it for over a few months I still haven&#x27;t recharged it and still works like the day I got it.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re redundant.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one unnecessary extra step.</li>
            <li> Wahl rechargeable are a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;Switching to Philips from now on.</li>
            <li> After about a year the battery is dead and no longer will hold a charge.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have used this trimmer for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> Thing started rusting after a few months of use.</li>
            <li> If you like a close shave, after a few days away from home</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through few of these.</li>
            <li> Battery doesn&#x27;t hold a charge when unplugged, even for a few hours.</li>
            <li> but there is no light that goes on while it charges or goes off when it&#x27;s fully charged.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a go-to trimmer for a few months now, and this is the one.</li>
            <li> The foil shaver would probably work well on peach fuzz, on my face it left too much behind.</li>
            <li> The power unit, narrow trimmer, nose trimmer and two of the beard trimming guides go in a ziplock bag and travel with me.  </li>
            <li> I probably should have bought the heavy duty one to trim my husky dog.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s dead.</li>
            <li> At 1 it would make it so thin that it was barely above stubble.  </li>
            <li> The attachments don&#x27;t securely fit in the base.</li>
            <li> Now dead all together.  </li>
            <li> It can be used for heavy duty purposes.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> but now it&#x27;s dead even when I have it plugged into the wall.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few occasions where it&#x27;s given me some patchy uneven results.</li>
            <li> It would start for a few seconds and then stop.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I will never again waste money on a somewhat cheaper trimmer.  </li>
            <li> and she said the part will ship out and should arrive in a few days.  </li>
            <li> I use this trimmer everyday ,I&#x27;ve had it for over three months , I charged it when I got it and its still working on that one</li>
            <li> , there are a few things to get used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had to charge it yet (it&#x27;s been a few weeks)</li>
            <li> Dead after 1 year of use.</li>
            <li> I use it a few times then plug it in for like 2 hours and unplug--good to roll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and then it wasn&#x27;t even completely dead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this for about a year and the battery is already dead.</li>
            <li> And, if all you need this for is to trim your sideburns or neck every few weeks, know that you are severely overpaying.</li>
            <li> It charged for few minutes</li>
            <li> Ive had this trimmer for a few years.</li>
            <li> Broke after just a few uses.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Its completely dead.</li>
            <li> what a waste of money and time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So in case you lose the wall-brick, don&#x27;t try to replace it with a 5V USB brick, I suppose that you can destroy the battery.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I dealt with the problems periodically for a few months until I replaced it with a trimmer from another company.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> and I had my last one for approximately seven years.</li>
            <li> to hair sticking to the rubber-grip, I was forced to carefully rinse the handle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> few drops must&#x27;ve worked their way into the mechanism and fried the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this sort of trimmer for everyday shaving.</li>
            <li> and now it&#x27;s completely dead.</li>
            <li> The charger will charge another clipper i have from another manufacturer but this clipper seems to be completely dead now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No matter how slow or carefully I control the pressure and the angle, I always get a &amp;#34;surprise&amp;#34; during every session where I get &amp;#34;balded&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> and I have owned a few.</li>
            <li> Really, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time buying this brand.</li>
            <li> Damn thing after running it under the water a few times to get the beard trimmings out.</li>
            <li> The circuit boards, battery, and motor all show fairly heavy corrosion.</li>
            <li> Even plugged in it goes dead.</li>
            <li> Its been a few months since I recharged it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time with inferior units.</li>
            <li> I will no longer purchase this type of trimmer nor will i waste my money on cordless.</li>
            <li> so I would suggest returning it once the battery is dead.</li>
            <li> we wasted our money</li>
            <li> There is no light or indicator anywhere letting the user know whether the shaver is charging or not, you just have to guess.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dead.</li>
            <li> Garbage...don&#x27;t waste your money....</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, I misplaced my receipt and am now needing to purchase another</li>
            <li> It has no light or anything to tell you when it&#x27;s fully charged.</li>
            <li> kept looking at it and using it trying to determine why I was having trouble with it.</li>
            <li> This machine is just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> it if you want to waste your money</li>
            <li> However, the base in which you store everything is incredibly cheaply made, compared to the components it houses.</li>
            <li> ive used it a few times alredy</li>
            <li> This trimmer replaced one purchased earlier that had poor battery life.</li>
            <li> do not fit in the holder.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had quite a few trimmers over the years.  </li>
            <li> I did put one blade under the sink once when I got it, and that rusted in just a few days, but that was my fault.  </li>
            <li> lose it&#x27;s charge in a few days if not plugged in,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> then as the battery drains switches to like a broken coffee grinder, further drain</li>
            <li> I have used it every few days since then to trim my mustache.</li>
            <li> He uses it every few days and has to charge about once every couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> Dead.  </li>
            <li> DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll trim your hair uneven.</li>
            <li> (The attachment of this type offered by Wahl does not fit this model trimmer.)</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s really not a huge surprise.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got a travel bag, which, dont get me wrong, is good to have when I might need this when I travel; but I was hoping to have the base</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t even really a way to get the trimmer to charge in the dock unless you lift up the base, pull the cord through the dock, plug it in, then put the trimmer back into the dock.</li>
            <li> Once I got to the thicker part of my beard (chin), the trimmer started to pull hairs left and right which was painful and annoying while STILL leaving even more uncut randoms.</li>
            <li> Was a little skeptical about the compact size and the endless attachments, however, it&#x27;s become a part of my daily grooming.</li>
            <li> and now I see that Amazon is selling it for even less than I paid for it!).  </li>
            <li> LESS THAN A YEAR!</li>
            <li> LESS THAN A YEAR!</li>
            <li> Compared to this set of clippers all the other clippers that I&#x27;ve owned were like shaving with a dull knife.</li>
            <li> &quot; clean (taint your mouth and it taint your nose - the area between my mustache and my nose, as I think letting your facial hair merge with your nose hair is disgusting).</li>
            <li> I mainly just used it when my beard would come in thick or for the random body trimmings once in a while.</li>
            <li> Other people that have bought this complained about the vibration, which I felt was not an issue at all.</li>
            <li> ONLY down side to this is that the caddy it comes with to hold all of your accessories fails to hold them all and the ones that it does hold does not fit at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not as sleek looking with its plain industrial design</li>
            <li> The method of attachment is awkward, with attachments held on by stiff plastic clips which I don&#x27;t believe will last particularly long if used often.</li>
            <li> The hair cutting attachments that come with it are too small to really cut any measurable amount of hair.  </li>
            <li> They are not easily changed and some will never be used.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;dual shaver\\&quot; attachment is small and works poorly, even on my lightweight facial hair.</li>
            <li> The charging system is just a small and light AC adapter with a cable you plug into the unit, not a charging base type setup.</li>
            <li> As for the genital area, the curly hairs don&#x27;t go through the combs well and are not easily trimmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, switching guides was not easy.</li>
            <li> However, it also grabs clippings and does not easily let them go.</li>
            <li> :  The blades are not easy to put on.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The usual challenge that every man faces is when our beard is grown for like 5 days grows little think</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a little small for me</li>
            <li> Beware, it makes a mess!</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t hold a charge very long and quits cutting after several uses.  </li>
            <li> They would occasionally pull hair instead of cutting it, the batteries wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge very long, the charge they would hold would diminish over time, and the motors seemed to lose some power.  </li>
            <li> the too-firm power button is virtually impossible to slide into the &#x27;on&#x27; position if your fingers are wet, as they are frequently in a bathroom.  </li>
            <li> I hardly ever write negative reviews -- I rarely need to -- but this product is so disappointing</li>
            <li> Once you get the hang of changing them it is not too bad, but I almost broke some of them by forcing the issue when I first got it.</li>
            <li> Hurts pretty bad and doesnt cut well.</li>
            <li> and when it does cut one it pulls the hair first making it quite a painful ordeal.</li>
            <li> Finally, and this is the nail in the coffin, though they have a long warrantee, they put the cost of return shipping on you, and the fact is, the quality of this product is so bad that it is just not worth the trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to trim the adjustable small guide (with a utility knife) for it to trim the eyebrows at a predictable angle.</li>
            <li> I took away one star for not having a charging indicator which isn&#x27;t really needed, but the lack of it is very annoying since it is expected in such gadgets.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, this past week I dropped my Wahl onto my bathroom sink from a height of just a few feet and the head popped off.</li>
            <li> The battery was charged, and the unit didn&#x27;t slow down as if the battery were dying.</li>
            <li> Still, these small concerns pale in comparison to the unit&#x27;s virtues.</li>
            <li> the \\&quot;holder\\&quot; (shown) is worthless and putting it back in its original box is difficult.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Ultimately, a poor choice for anything other than beard trimming, and completely and embarrassingly useless for shaving.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the poor instructions.  </li>
            <li> Narrow blade head made it difficult to trim evenly because it required multiple passes.  </li>
            <li> This did not really impede the item&#x27;s functioning, but with the constant nicking this thing causes, having the risk of cutting myself with a rusty blade every time I trimmed was not fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to have to charge my previous trimmers at least once, sometimes twice, a week.</li>
            <li> Battery loses charge quickly if not plugged in just before I use it.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer, although it cuts well, loses battery capacity in less than a year.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really frustrating to move the clippers so slow across the same spot on your chin, or your jaw, or your lip just to see that its still not even, spots where still missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Little pieces of cut hairs will stick to it like glue!  </li>
            <li> Little pieces of cut hairs will stick to it like glue!</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is the base, it&#x27;s small and very easy to break.</li>
            <li> I bought this model for the better battery and am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The latter doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for very long anymore, &amp; I got tired of skin scratches as the cutting guard teeth were too sharp.    </li>
            <li> First of all, I did not get to even use the product itself because I did not receive the black base as pictured with the item.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> or so I found the blades to get a little dull.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a little hard to compare it because I&#x27;ve never used a trimmer before</li>
            <li> The main blade is also very uncomfortable on my face</li>
            <li> have read few reviews where people have been little disappointed, now that could be a fault with any of those particular pieces.</li>
            <li> For closer shaves, the dual-foil blade handles the rest with very little irritation.</li>
            <li> I saw a few comments that changing the heads is hard but I have not found that to be the case.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While you won&#x27;t regret this shaver, you will just be a little disappointed that Wahl didn&#x27;t think the whole package through.</li>
            <li> The bad:  - Rubber material covering body of unit grips TOO much.</li>
            <li> I was trimming per usual and heard a snap.</li>
            <li> the comb teeth width is too small.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for an amazingly long time so this is not really that inconvenient.  </li>
            <li> Wahl blades do seem to remain sharp longer than those of other trimmers, and at the relatively low cost of this trimmer, replacement every few years is annoying but acceptable.</li>
            <li> Rusted after a few months!</li>
            <li> The biggest downside was its inability to trim facial hair without leaving scraggly uncut pieces.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First thing I noticed was that the different heads are difficult to change.  </li>
            <li> The plethora of attachments should have been combined into a small handful of adjustable ones instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> just wish I hadn&#x27;t bought all those separate pieces in the past (trimmer, nose clippers, T-blade, etc.).  </li>
            <li> Not sure if you can buy longer attachments for it or not.</li>
            <li> Sorry WAHL, you&#x27;ll have to go back to the drawing board!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure of the necessity, but then that&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> unlike past trimmers I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li> unbelievable charge life</li>
            <li> the usual collection of heads and combs clutter</li>
            <li> Not really sure why it stopped working.  </li>
            <li> It has all the accessories that make it look good,but as far as cutting perfomance,it doesn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li> Difficult to put back together.  </li>
            <li> The second one failed after three months.</li>
            <li> I needed a small foil shaver to keep my \\&quot;face taint\\</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve bought this trimmer four times in the past 3-4 years.</li>
            <li> Plus, I&#x27;m not sure where I&#x27;m going to keep all of them, as there isn&#x27;t a container or case</li>
            <li> I threw it out and put everything in a small plastic sandwich</li>
            <li> The shaver, however is a small dual foil contraption that I wanted to like because I bought this as a &#x27;</li>
            <li> This thing is unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> It will be given as a gift, so ill be back to let you know how he likes it!</li>
            <li> This one, despite following directions, never held a charge &amp; is completely useless.</li>
            <li> Not sure if my unit is defective or what.</li>
            <li> I purchased a small overnight shaving bag and keep everything inside.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what the issue is</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will say that the heads begin to rust almost instantly, which seems weird.</li>
            <li> (or in my case goatee trimming) -- was useless because there weren&#x27;t enough finite settings for the trim comb/guard.  </li>
            <li> The tray is a bit pointless IMHO, I just keep it all in a ZipLoc in my bathroom draw.</li>
            <li> It also comes with a small zipper pouch, so I have had no problem keeping track of the accessories.</li>
            <li> The small &#x27;detailer&#x27; for shaving designs into your hair, can also be used as a nose hair</li>
            <li> but i am not sure.</li>
            <li> this one the shaver head pops off and is difficult to put back on</li>
            <li> : Apparently the one I ordered awhile ago is not the current model which does have an improved accessory base.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate it, but it needs improvements in order to make it a useful</li>
            <li> coming from a guy who always bought the norelco trimmers in the past......</li>
            <li> The weakness is its use as a shaver: the head is small</li>
            <li> usually shave with a razor every 4 days, but my razor doesn&#x27;t get every nook and cranny.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is intentional to keep sales up or if they just started using cheaper parts</li>
            <li> This one is small and lightweight and has all the attachments.  </li>
            <li> Also, all the extra parts were useless to me: I don&#x27;t change my beard style</li>
            <li> not much more you could ask for.</li>
            <li> Overall, it is not terribly impressive.</li>
            <li> The attachments were too cumbersome, sliding the guard on the unit was extremely difficult.. sent it back and exchanged it for a Braun</li>
            <li> , I recommend cutting those hairs the old fashion way, scissors.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if its because of the interchangeable head set up</li>
            <li> I prefer having the small pouch to keep it in along with all of the attachments.</li>
            <li> Others trimmers I&#x27;ve purchased in the past do not even compare to this one.  </li>
            <li> I usually use a PEANUT trimmer (corded) to clip my Yorkie&#x27;s face and ears.</li>
            <li> Even if the motor hadn&#x27;t failed, the switch probably wouldn&#x27;t last to the two year mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wahl</li>
            <li> No more Wahl products for me..</li>
            <li> The one I just had purchased has a small bag to put the attachments in, which I like because it can be put in a drawer rather than a stand on the vanity.  </li>
            <li> Bough it at Target for $37 thinking it was going to last a while, guess I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I bought their newest model for hair cutting and its complete junk</li>
            <li> This device stopped working just past the 30 day return window.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this does come with small bottle of blade lube, and i recommend using it.</li>
            <li> Not sure if we would buy a Wahl again.</li>
            <li> I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Was worried to use the small detail trimmer in my nose.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really difficult to get the heads seated properly.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure what happened to this company.  </li>
            <li> Not much more to say.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The warranty is pointless, too, as you would either receive the returned trimmer repaired, or get a replacement....</li>
            <li> No more &amp;#34;sharp&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I was never able to find a barber that could shape it the way I wanted it.</li>
            <li> A mere six weeks later the product does not turn on.  </li>
            <li> Also included is a brush for cleaning the blades, a small comb, and some blade oil.</li>
            <li> There are some drawings that are somewhat helpful but they are small.</li>
            <li> The attachments are all just too small for me and force me to trim way too close for my taste.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t plan on keeping it plugged in an charging all the time, plan to plug it in at least a few minutes before you need it to give the battery a head start.</li>
            <li> Switching between attachments is a breeze, so I&#x27;m not sure why some people find issue with that</li>
            <li> I appreciate the small size considering</li>
            <li> (it is a trimmer not sure why that would be a problem...</li>
            <li> tray is also no better than a small bowl.&lt;br /&gt;charged</li>
            <li> bought this item as a xmas gift, not sure how it works out</li>
            <li> Unfortunately 2 years later it will not hold a charge at all</li>
            <li> I would suggest this trimmer to anyone looking, don&#x27;t waste money on the others out there!</li>
            <li> Some say a lot of vibration, but I don&#x27;t notice any excessive vibration.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> Small and compact.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a Remington and Philips norelco trimmers in the past for beard and mustache maintainence.</li>
            <li> I have had 3 trimmers over the past 30 years, 2 Wahls and 1 Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this unit 10/29/2014 and today is 3/6/2015 (just four months ago allowing for delivery time) and have used it lightly no more than once a week.  </li>
            <li> Not pleased at all by the quality of this trimmer.</li>
            <li> usually Wahl products are fine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I threw it out immediately since it was past return and needed a trim up before an event.  </li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> I finally figured what went wrong.</li>
            <li> So, for ordinary use, the Wahl is just a trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have purchased Wahl products in the past from hair trimmers to dog trimmers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- horrible sink top stand.</li>
            <li> : Comb (plain mustache comb) is VERY scratchy - almost dangerously so!</li>
            <li> All others I&#x27;ve tried were weak, had bad attachments, short battery life or could barely cut hair.</li>
            <li> Quality must have suffered recently because all of these reviews for new models seem very bad.</li>
            <li> My one complaint is the trimmer is coated with a rubberized grippy material that gets coated with beard trimmings that are not easily cleaned off</li>
            <li> Default head is very narrow (though it comes with wider ones).&lt;br /&gt;-  </li>
            <li> After several months with the device, I still had difficulty swapping out the trimmer and clipper blades, it always felt like I was forcing those heads on incorrectly, the different guards were especially difficult to attach &amp; remove, I suspect were I to continue using this device long term</li>
            <li> But all the other brands are worse....</li>
            <li> Other review have described rusting and poor quality rubber grip, I agree.  </li>
            <li> I wish there was a way to not need them, but i tried a new trimmer with fully adjustable one-piece head, and it worked terribly for very short haircuts (uneven).</li>
            <li> This particular guide is badly designed.</li>
            <li> (Too bad the battery on my old shaver is dead).  </li>
            <li> Even after I went over the uneven areas multiple times, it still wasn&#x27;t cutting them.</li>
            <li> I used my Wahl lithium ion trimmer for the first time today and I am disappointed to say the least.  </li>
            <li> Only thing I could say is the storage tray should be alittle bigger and the charger should be permantly attached to the base</li>
            <li> The old Conair chewed on my thick beard, barely cutting it.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it does not have enough torque to mow any sort of &#x27;thick&#x27; hair.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s not a terrible thing when the worst complaint is &amp;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very good at doing what it&#x27;s supposed to do, but that has nothing to do with the function.</li>
            <li> first the base that holds the unit and the attachments needs improvement...</li>
            <li> /&gt;However after using this product it basically is too small in the clipper teeth for thick beard hair.</li>
            <li> disappointed in the Norelco Body Groomer and much prefer this.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a slow task, and I find it needs to be done essentially daily because it cannot handle whiskers that have escaped cutting for a few days.  </li>
            <li> and/or they work well at first and then crap out.  </li>
            <li> The big base makes it very stable and unlikely to be knocked over.  </li>
            <li> Both were very weak and did not hold a charge for very long.</li>
            <li> The attachments feel very stiff and it takes a while to get used to changing the heads.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the 2 pronged wire that connects the blade to the power supply had broken in half.</li>
            <li> I previously used a cheapo Remington beard trimmer that game with five chintsy heads on it.</li>
            <li> But Wahl couldn&#x27;t have picked a worse material for the handle grip (the black part of the trimmer).  </li>
            <li> I have used this for a couple of months now and it has become unusable as the metal spring inside the head that puts pressure on the blades has broken in half,</li>
            <li> I had the previous model with its poor quality battery and</li>
            <li> Difficult to remove attachments as the cutting unit wants to detach as well!</li>
            <li> Sorry, it doesn&#x27;t cover this defective part, no matter how limited the use.  </li>
            <li> Bits of hair stick to the grip of the trimmer and it&#x27;s hard to get off.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to beat.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is so hard to use.  </li>
            <li> Attachments hard to remove.  </li>
            <li> , I still don&#x27;t know what all of them are for, but wonder would it be so hard to just have one adjustable beard trimmer?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to see in the picture, but the guide combs curve toward the trimming blade at the end.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- 6 position trimmer is hard to adjust and semi-impossible to get off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It shouldn&#x27;t be that hard.</li>
            <li> , hard working trimmer.</li>
            <li> The rubber grip does attract hair that is hard to remove.  </li>
            <li> I found it hard to use the rack, so I have clutter on the shelf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s why: 1) how hard would it be to provide a charging stand?</li>
            <li> /&gt;Blades are hard to install</li>
            <li> The tech said the battery is not swappable, it is \\&quot;hard wired\\&quot;/soldered on.</li>
            <li> I received this the other day and was disappointed that what I got and what the picture showed is close but not the same.</li>
            <li> Hardly use any of the accessories.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone, you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> it is hard to control because the designer did not plan the connection to the base unit very well.  </li>
            <li> I think I can deal with the relative lack of power and overnight charge time to gain the convenience of never having to switch out another attachment or cutting head.</li>
            <li> Again, common sense</li>
            <li> I never really liked it.  </li>
            <li> hair cutting capability in addition to facial trims&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product sucks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m cutting my losses and switching to a different brand.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps even perceptibly to those of particularly delicate sensibilities.</li>
            <li> I buzz my hair at 1/4 inch, and have been tired of tearing through expensive \\&quot;professional\\&quot; clippers every 9 months when the \\&quot;precision hardened blade that is ground, precision lapped, and titanium nitride coated and by leprechauns in a German factory\\&quot; wore out and start tugging my hair out...  </li>
            <li> The nose trimmer looks dangerous but works well enough.</li>
            <li> Biggest complaint -</li>
            <li> This was after I complained here in this review.</li>
            <li> I called Wahl and they said to send it in on my dime and they will decide if they should repair or replace this and it will take at least 3 weeks - month or longer.  </li>
            <li> and ive used it at least 4 times w/o having to recharge.</li>
            <li> Have ZERO complaint toward either the product or seller.</li>
            <li> Of course by then it was too late to send it</li>
            <li> Clumsy me.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased Wahl for at least 20 years and never was I disappointed...until this time.</li>
            <li> I use this at least three times a week to trim mustache and nose and sideburns.</li>
            <li> This sucker trims like a demon.</li>
            <li> Not nice.  </li>
            <li> I think that the negative comments about things breaking off could be attributed to this.</li>
            <li> No matter how cautious and slow I take it, the blade inevitable will catch and pull hair without cutting.  </li>
            <li> it takes RPMs which move the cutting blades back and forth</li>
            <li> I shave once a week and it least like 3 months.</li>
            <li> i have owned it for at least 6 months with no issues.</li>
            <li> It lasted at least 10 years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The battery sucks</li>
            <li> It stopped functioning in December 2013, and it is now too late to return it.  </li>
            <li> Then I started using the smaller attachment for my head and beard and that too stopped cutting my hair</li>
            <li> He uses this at least 3-4 times a day.</li>
            <li> never own another wahl</li>
            <li> At least I think so.</li>
            <li> Two, the plug sucks and falls out if you try to leave it plugged in during use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I use it at least once a week.</li>
            <li> Used it two to three times per week for at least five years.</li>
            <li> I use a trimmer at least once a week.  </li>
            <li> The detail trimmer that is suggested to use as a nose and ear hair trimmer is not only awkward to use but may also cut not just hair.</li>
            <li> Then I picked it up a few days ago and the blades ran rough and jerked my beard hairs instead of cutting them.  </li>
            <li> least there was no quibbling about purchase date or proof of purchase.</li>
            <li> At least there was no quibbling about purchase date or proof of purchase.</li>
            <li> Charging sucks, blade changes suck, battery life sucks, and to to things off it wont hold a charge anymore.</li>
            <li> By late October of 2014, the battery no longer holds a charge.</li>
            <li> It is now late August of 2012.</li>
            <li> and you have to go mega slow.</li>
            <li> Maybe my boyfriend and I are just unskilled, but we cannot get the comb attachments to attach and stay on when trying to trim the length of his thick beard.  </li>
            <li> If you want to use it to keep a thick beard trimmed at a longer length, you will need a trimmer with attachments that do not pop off every time you try to comb through your beard.  </li>
            <li> I gave the trimmer 4 out of 5 stars because the shaving head is way to slow.</li>
            <li> They must have some course, thick hair because I&#x27;ve never had a trimmer that works this well.</li>
            <li> The base does not take up to much space.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t use the base to hold the razor while plugged in.  </li>
            <li> You have to keep in mind that I do not have a thick beard at all.</li>
            <li> When I try to trim off stubble it cuts my skin and pulls the hairs no matter how slowly and deliberately I use</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, I now believe the cutters do not accommodate thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have a thick beard and it cuts through it without issues.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve charge it once and used it at least 10 times or so on my thick beard, trimming my head hair, and on some body hair and it still doesn&#x27;t need to be charged.</li>
            <li> you have a lot of thick beard</li>
            <li> or so it was running so slow it would have been virtually unusable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> With the trimmer (and thick hair) you have to move/cut your hair slowly</li>
            <li> The times when it did have a charge, it struggled to cut through my beard, which was not even that thick.  </li>
            <li> Not very happy at all with purchase.</li>
            <li> I had remembered that I had previously had a terrible experience with my Philips-norelco rechargeable razor, and also remembered that my Wahl Chrome Pro Clipper set has far exceeded my expectations, so I went with Wahl just from my previous experiences, and could not be happier.</li>
            <li> started out as a quality little trimmer, but failed after one year with very little usage.  </li>
            <li> The base is ridiculous as you have to gently place the trimmer in there with the cord, hoping that it doesn&#x27;t interfere with anything else or cause a mess.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would take this over any other expensive brand.  </li>
            <li> UNBELIEVABLE!</li>
            <li> After putting up with other lousy models, we feel we now have a \\&quot;Cadillac.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I mean, come on ...</li>
            <li> I mean, come on ...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It even comes with a small container of oil to lube up the blades!  </li>
            <li> It even comes with a small container of oil to lube up the blades!  </li>
            <li> and they want me to ship it to them, but what do I use in the mean time?  </li>
            <li> Also, like other reviews, the hair clippings stick to the body and are difficult to get off.</li>
            <li> if when they are no longer sharp since the motor or battery will fail soon after.</li>
            <li> I mean, no water.</li>
            <li> I mean, soldering iron?</li>
            <li> 4 stars out of 5 because it tends to damage the nut bag if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> you know what I mean.  </li>
            <li> I mean clipper</li>
            <li> After a few months - the charge would randomly cut off, with or without the cord plugged in, and as there is no light or indicator - it is next to impossible to know if the shaver is charging, fully charged, or not.</li>
            <li> , lucky Amazon stands behind the products they sell because this one was BAD !</li>
            <li> I was also disappointed with the closeness of the dual shaver -- it was nothing near razor quality, and again, having no indication of it needing or having a charge, the razor would abruptly stop halfway through shaving, which proved especially irritating on a recent trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so the failure is in the motor.</li>
            <li> It has a very weak motor and bogs down when I am trimming my beard.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a less expensive Wahl trimmer, and I&#x27;m not thrilled.</li>
            <li> Essentially it&#x27;s a small version of hair trimmers for your head, so not easy to follow contours, peels some skin if you go the wrong way, flings hair everywhere.  </li>
            <li> But worst of all the blade heads rust if you don&#x27;t dry them off completely</li>
            <li> Now the blades have also dulled to uselessness, despite the \\&quot;self-sharpening\\&quot; claim, and it painfully pulls hairs and generally drives me nuts.  </li>
            <li> The shaver blade was very uncomfortable on the back of my neck.</li>
            <li> Everything about this product is below average to blatantly lacking ability to perform the task which it was designed for.</li>
            <li> Only drawback is the rubber like grips that attract hair that sticks and is  almost impossible to get rid of.  </li>
            <li> Seriously how is this allowed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Seriously?  </li>
            <li> one *potentially* serious concern I have about its design is the Li-Ion battery.</li>
            <li> The one *potentially* serious concern I have about its design is the Li-Ion battery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bent a few of the &#x27;tines&#x27; and it is getting difficult to run through my fairly thick haired beard.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> That said, one year of utility is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Inevitably, those shavers would sputter and die mid-shave at the worst possible times.</li>
            <li> Totally ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Seriously?  </li>
            <li> even if you figure 15 minutes a month over 14 months (worst possible scenario), that&#x27;s only 4.5 hours of use and it&#x27;s worn out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you wanted to use the trimmer for your nose it will be a little difficult.</li>
            <li> Even the expensive razors and shaving cream don&#x27;t prevent the irritation on my neck, but this little attachment works.</li>
            <li> All in all due to the overall bad design and poor quality of construction I would not buy this unit again if this one fails.</li>
            <li> even which of them correspond to the descriptions in tiny print, with bad diagrams, in the multi-lingual instructions.</li>
            <li> This effect happens particularly badly with the short guide (3mm) though I have gotten &amp;#34;balded&amp;#34; by the 6mm one as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They kept it for over 3 months only to tell me the battery was bad and they would not fix it.</li>
            <li> I thought my last trimmer was bad,  I used this trimmer one time and it stopped working.  </li>
            <li> And Wahl&#x27;s customer service is appalling.  </li>
            <li> wide clipper attachment stopped cutting hair all together meaning it would not cut hair at all, and didn&#x27;t have the strength to cut.</li>
            <li> no good</li>
            <li> Never a good idea with any piece of equipment.  </li>
            <li> There is no good way to store it -</li>
            <li> Well, the trimmer attachment is junk, and not good for detail trimming whatsoever.</li>
            <li> To make matters worse, even when it&#x27;s plugged in, it won&#x27;t work unless it&#x27;s been plugged in for at least 10 or 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> Not a good value for $40.</li>
            <li> No really good nose/ear hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Now the only things I will use is the Dual Shaver and Precision head because the trimmer and clipper painfully pulls hairs.</li>
            <li> or maybe I&#x27;m just not good at using it?</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE, I don&#x27;t have long facial hair at all</li>
            <li> This is a piece of crap not comparable to my old trimmer.</li>
            <li> Blades didn&#x27;t last long and it pulls your hair real bad while trimming your face.</li>
            <li> This is really annoying since I am a frequent traveller.</li>
            <li> It goes through thick or thin beard or mustache.</li>
            <li> ; is just plain lame.</li>
            <li> Very poor work after a few cuts.</li>
            <li> The cutting blades are sharp and never tug on the beard.</li>
            <li> Multiple passes to try and get it to trim everything is problematic because the Wahl requires VERY slow movement and prayer to avoid painful pulling of</li>
            <li> Such a bad material used, I can&#x27;t help but think that the rest of the materials inside were poorly conceived.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer does trim... but it has serious battery issues that make it extremely frustrating to use.</li>
            <li> It has a weak motor.</li>
            <li> Using the small nose/ear/eyebrow attachment felt weird</li>
            <li> The problem with this is that the support prongs are so small they&#x27;re uncomfortable used like this.&lt;br /&gt;Thanx,&lt;br /&gt;Dan</li>
            <li> Once I got the hang of it, those suckers went on &amp; off with panache!</li>
            <li> Once I got the hang of it, those suckers went on &amp; off with panache!</li>
            <li> My blades were wearing out and the battery getting weak.  </li>
            <li> Awful, it worked well at first and then</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s some pretty terrible quality.</li>
            <li> I had a Remington (gave it away too weak) and used Phillips norelco but combs kept breaking.&lt;br /&gt;Rate</li>
            <li> so it probably was me being dumb.</li>
            <li> Makes awful noises after the first use.</li>
            <li> It is also very hard to keep all of the items to stay put in the tray.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and has no problem cutting or triming your beard or mustache.</li>
            <li> I mean seriously, was the industrial designer drunk?  </li>
            <li> It leaves just a slight bit of stubble, but has no problem with cutting or pulling hairs.</li>
            <li> l have previously owned two Philips Norelco cordless groomers and had disappointing experiences with both.  </li>
            <li> After examining it, I confiscated it and gave her my Remington which is weak and a poor cutter by comparison.</li>
            <li> the hair just gets stuck to it and is tough to get off.  </li>
            <li> It cuts through my tough hairs like buttah!&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> If you trim tough mustaches and beards or even use them on your head, buy these.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Whilst Wahl does offer a five year warrantee, they do not issue RMAs, so if you send it to them, and they lose it, tough, and also, when we  called, we were told that the turn around time is about two to three weeks.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing product - the second time I used it</li>
            <li> I HAVE VERY THICK BEARD.</li>
            <li> and I do have a very thick beard.</li>
            <li> I mean heck, they come with a five year guarantee, so they won&#x27;t want to be seeing them that often!</li>
            <li> all I was not satisfied with this product at all!!</li>
            <li> She uses their hair cutting kit to trim our son&#x27;s hair and believe it or not, to groom our two little dogs.</li>
            <li> It is a little awkward and there is a learning curve.</li>
            <li> For the price it is hard to find anything wrong with this.</li>
            <li> Battery life was a mere few minutes with an overnight charge, and the motor seemed unable to handle any trimming job.</li>
            <li> The preset cutting length attachments avoid slippage of the head cutting too short by accident.</li>
            <li> The battery lasted a while but the overall quality was crap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a much cheaper POS Wahl for a year, and it&#x27;s been miserable.</li>
            <li> maybe a silly complaint, but</li>
            <li> The ON/OFF Switch came broken in the package</li>
            <li> Total crap.</li>
            <li> So not happy with it...</li>
            <li> This thing is really narrow, even with the wider cutting head attached.</li>
            <li> WORSE yet</li>
            <li> these days, this is a marketing gizmo that is over-hyped and actually a piece of crap.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t base my purchasing decision on such a finding.    </li>
            <li> Conair snares buyers with looks that have no substance behind them.</li>
            <li> The included stand does not hold all the attachments, or at least I was unable to figure out how to get them all in.</li>
            <li> The beard trimmer comb is dificult to attach and to set the beard trimming height(the supplied directions are worthless) and there is nowhere to store the trimmer comb in the supplied stand so it must be left on the trimmer.</li>
            <li> It is irritating to use.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t get worse.</li>
            <li> Biggest complaint is that the longest length of beard it can leave you with is 3/8 inch - which is lame.  </li>
            <li> Really poor design.  </li>
            <li> Not great</li>
            <li> The length shield or whatever it is called, is even worse.</li>
            <li> I would have given 5 stars but the trimmer head arrived with 2 broken teeth...</li>
            <li> To make it worse</li>
            <li> this machine is garbage and poorly manufactured.</li>
            <li> * Trial and error, plus a bit of patience, will overcome the poor instructions.    </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like using it for nostril hair, so I bought the battery powered Wahl nose hair trimmer for that, and it also works well (even though I hate buying a household appliance that only has one use).</li>
            <li> The unit comes with several attachments that - for me - are of doubtful value.</li>
            <li> But alas.</li>
            <li> I bought these clippers one month ago and they have already broken.</li>
            <li> They should just leave that attachment behind and replace it with something else.</li>
            <li> Bathrooms get dusty and the dust in a bathroom gets moisture, which means that all those combs, brushes and everything else will need cleaning.</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer in January 13, and it was broken by December 13.  </li>
            <li> At the time I had a goatee and a thin jaw-line beard.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tired of getting my half-leg butchered by this thing.</li>
            <li> the hairy handle is irritating and 2)</li>
            <li> This is the trimmer set for men who have broken their flimsy plastic man-groomers.  </li>
            <li> It was purchased as a Fathers Day gift for my husband and it has already broken.</li>
            <li> and I was tired of replacing the batteries every month.</li>
            <li> , however, both listed a return and called the help line to see what I could do to simply receive my base.</li>
            <li> I inspected it but cannot find any broken area.</li>
            <li> not great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The system for changing the heads on the handle is poorly designed, I felt like I might break the head every time I changed it.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was the least expensive Wahl I found with a lithium ion battery.</li>
            <li> The product was broken when I recieved it.</li>
            <li> I could see it was broken through the package.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to supply a plethora of attachments, provide a base that can actually organize them.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> I thoroughly read the instructions, watched the Wahl videos, cleaned and oiled the blades but the pulling is getting worse.</li>
            <li> Default Trim head needed an expertise to Shave close without leaving any itch or dents behind</li>
            <li> The installation and removal of the accessory trimer&#x27;s to the base, especially the 2 metal ones needs some improvement or modification, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> stand behind our product</li>
            <li> Wahl stands behind their product.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I recommend it, but not a great product the I would give as a gift.</li>
            <li> : Directions are poor and the heads could be easier to change.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve managed to place all the attachments except this one on the poorly designed stand; instead it resides in a Ziploc bag in one of the bathroom drawers.</li>
            <li> So dont just build any false notions by reading those comments.</li>
            <li> My only problem with this product is the storage base - It does a poor job of holding all the attachments.  </li>
            <li> The connector does not mount to the base and none of the accessories fit in the base as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Trimmer came with all the usual accessories however i also bought this item because it showed it came with the black base picture.</li>
            <li> The other negative is all the attachments and the base unit...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this one seems to been either defective, designed with a serious flaw, or built poorly.</li>
            <li> The other bad thing is it pulled their hair.</li>
            <li> My husband takes twice as long using this to shave than he does with a razor which was very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> Sloppy packaging.  </li>
            <li> Recharging is inconvenient compared to past rechargeable Wahl trimmers.  </li>
            <li> and you get a base, with no clear idea</li>
            <li> I tried this item several times and its cutting capacity was bad.</li>
            <li> i am very disappointed in the seller of this item that they would send me a clearly used shaver.</li>
            <li> Much grief can be avoided by reading instructions carefully.  </li>
            <li> issue is that for some reason the accessory base does not have slots for the wide trimmer attachments.</li>
            <li> Blade changes are sometimes quite difficult and frustrating.</li>
            <li> Compared to the old Wahl, the quality of this one is horrible.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the worst trimmer I have ever used.</li>
            <li> disappointed but not worth the bother to return.</li>
            <li> To be clear, it works well and all, but the rubber grip is a horrible choice for a beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> I was sick of buying junk trimmers, so I figured I would pay little and get a quality one.</li>
            <li> problems: the stand that holds all the little attachments is a terrible, flimsy plastic thing; the body of the trimmer is shaped in a way that makes it roll off the shelf if I set it down the wrong way.</li>
            <li> As some other people said, the precision detailer attachment was completely worthless.</li>
            <li> I have to say I am a little disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> I was also a little disappointed in how this product felt.  </li>
            <li> When it came I was a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> I ordered this trimmer after some bad battery experiences with Conair trimmers in the past.  </li>
            <li> Wasted my money.  :-(</li>
            <li> The base doesn&#x27;t hold the charging cable down</li>
            <li> My previous trimmer allowed the plug to be attached to the base so that the trimmer detached from the plug when lifting it, which I prefer.  </li>
            <li> , attachments don&#x27;t work half the time, worthless, don&#x27;t bother buying this.</li>
            <li> This is inconvenient and weak.</li>
            <li> Then once you DO get the cutting head you want on, the guards are VERY hard to get on and off.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t just set it on the base, you have to plug the little cable in.</li>
            <li> my shave was painful and eventually gave up to use my silly little &amp;#34;Gilette Pro Fusion Styler&amp;#34; thing that I got for 20$.  Seriously disappointing this thing.</li>
            <li> I use it 1-2 times per week to trim my beard and today it failed.</li>
            <li> As others have said, 90% of the attachments are useless and should be thrown out.</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> Nose trimmer is a bit uncomfortable</li>
            <li> For this price it is not perfect but I will buy it again when this one quits working.</li>
            <li> Bottom line: a mediocre product.</li>
            <li> There are two springs in it, one spring snapped rendering clipper useless.</li>
            <li> This product has a fatal flaw; the trimmer&#x27;s internals can&#x27;t handle the torque of the motor and fail within days.</li>
            <li> I used it one time before it failed.</li>
            <li> When you call Wahl they say sorry not our fault you must have done something wrong.</li>
            <li> They have all burned out, failed, ALWAYS DULLED or had eventual battery problems.  </li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> So it appears if the battery has any issues at all, the unit is useless.</li>
            <li> o the blades and guides are frustratingly difficult to change  </li>
            <li> The attachments can be difficult to remove.  </li>
            <li> I think there&#x27;s something wrong with the battery or the power supply.    </li>
            <li> of the tools are useless and it stains after a while.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;adjustable\\&quot; trimmer guard is a nightmare and extremely difficult to both adjust and remove for cleaning.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t people realize that the number one reason why rechargable devices fail so often is because they are plugged into a charger all the time?  </li>
            <li> Sorry, Wahl,</li>
            <li> bought this thing in December of 2012, and it has failed in July 2013.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this unit did not.</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> and I was not impressed with this.</li>
            <li> Today it failed to turn on after being plugged to charge.  </li>
            <li> And again - what&#x27;s wrong with you people producing these devices?</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only truly bad part of the trimmer is the accessory base.</li>
            <li> I just wish the replacement blade wasn&#x27;t so expensive.  </li>
            <li> It is in no way uncomfortable to use or difficult to handle because of it.  </li>
            <li> So maybe I&#x27;m doing it wrong by not doing that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Despite the name of the product, this device is almost useless on the rest of the body.</li>
            <li> The trimmer worked well for 8 months before the battery began to fail holding a charge.  </li>
            <li> I am an out of work drunk.</li>
            <li> I gave her the model number, a description of the failed part, and my address</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t caught me yet, but some day I&#x27;ll guess wrong and run it out of juice.  </li>
            <li> sorry).</li>
            <li> Sorry Remington &amp; Norelco....</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> Battery failed after 3 months use.  </li>
            <li> This basically makes them useless.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it&#x27;s built to fail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> took it apart to see if it was repairable, but it appears to be the motor that failed.</li>
            <li> I do not &amp;#34;hate it&amp;#34; because it broke and is now useless, as things brake from time to time</li>
            <li> Sorry,</li>
            <li> But I think that Wahl&#x27;s Marketing is not, and did some wrong choices about cost saving of the charger.</li>
            <li> They fail to mention that this is a &#x27;disposable&#x27; device.</li>
            <li> It would then randomly start working again.</li>
            <li> failed to even work - made in the USA is why I purchased this trimmer -</li>
            <li> of the attachments are useless</li>
            <li> Also, the attachments I received look like they were randomly selected.</li>
            <li> They are difficult to put on and take off.</li>
            <li> I bought this expensive set and it arrived without a charger.</li>
            <li> After one month the battery failed.</li>
            <li> Now its useless.</li>
            <li> Useless, in the end.  </li>
            <li> Some of the heads are difficult to replace and the adjustable head slips to a closer setting  while you are trimming your beard.  </li>
            <li> The combs/guides for trimming my beard do a horrible job at directing my facial hair to the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> How difficult is it to put in some LED bulb to indicate when charging?</li>
            <li> but I was completely wrong.</li>
            <li> It did a mediocre job with the stubble guard that snaps over the head.</li>
            <li> After purchasing 3 electric personal groomers made specifically for women and then having them all fail miserably, I decided to purchase something advertised specifically for men.</li>
            <li> It does not seem to fail at all in the quality department.  </li>
            <li> However it is not perfect:  CONS</li>
            <li> Switch is just a tad difficult to move at times.</li>
            <li> So you have to plan ahead your trimming needs.&lt;br /&gt;Holder for accessories is useless.</li>
            <li> They seem to expect one to simply throw it away when the battery goes bad and buy another  trimmer from them!!</li>
            <li> However, using the supplied oil on the blades caused them to rust, which I thought was weird.</li>
            <li> I was unable to stop</li>
            <li> it worked, it worked well, unfortunately the longevity needs to be questioned.</li>
            <li> Will try to remember to update this post if the battery fails again.</li>
            <li> Completely useless.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ou reason it doesn&#x27;t get a 5 is because the body hair foil is virtually useless.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect</li>
            <li> Looks expensive</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this a couple of months and keep giving it a chance to prove me wrong.</li>
            <li> Wiping it off is difficult</li>
            <li> Not an expensive item</li>
            <li> Wahl replaced my broken one (well done Wahl!)</li>
            <li> plugged into the charger - wrong...  </li>
            <li> I have a very tough beard, and the Wahl glides through it effortlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very tough to trim a beard like that</li>
            <li> Very poor battery Life.</li>
            <li> Direction were very poor.</li>
            <li> This makes it very frustrating to use.</li>
            <li> charge the trimmer you plug in a small plug in its base.</li>
            <li> I hate it because it is very messy to use as a lot of hair</li>
            <li> My only disappointment is that both the photo and product description indicated that it would come with a base to hold the trimmer and accessories, mine came with a travel bag not the base.</li>
            <li> So me, sick and tired of his non shaven face, got him a razor that won&#x27;t give him razor burn.</li>
            <li> The cutting blades are not rust proof.</li>
            <li> biggest disappointment for me is the trimming itself.  </li>
            <li> The leading disappointment has been the much-hyped battery.</li>
            <li> It is awkward to change the heads; you have to line them up</li>
            <li> Crazy deal.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gif tand after two shaves, the cutting head broke.  </li>
            <li> Hair is attracted to the surface and it looks horrible after a few minutes of trimming.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> water)...call me crazy</li>
            <li> CUTTING HEADS:</li>
            <li> It does everything from cutting your hair to trimming your beard.</li>
            <li> It pulls on whiskers before cutting.  </li>
            <li> After 7 months mine stopped cutting well and sounded like a mini chain</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting some rust on the cutting area.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking to upgrade your trimmer than don&#x27;t be afraid to buy this one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The worst attachment by far is the shaver head, which is a real disappointment because I was hoping I could use it instead of buying a separate electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> It practically rips the hair apart instead of cutting it.</li>
            <li> It pulls out the hair instead of cutting it.</li>
            <li> I go through beard trimmers like crazy too.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a body trimmer that could also function as a hair cutting tool.</li>
            <li> Too much trouble, very bad design!   </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a Wahl hair cutting clipper for 16 years and it still runs well.</li>
            <li> I always use the full-size cutting head rather than bothering to swap it out for the ½ inch trimmer head.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The head trimmer lasted all of 1 trimming before it decided to stop cutting.</li>
            <li> As regards the attachment with the two cutting hedges, one of the two cutters inside of the housing just disintegrated like a piece of charcoal.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t pull any hairs while cutting.</li>
            <li> It also attracts any dirt or dust it comes in contact with, which causes it to look dirty and dingy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten to the point that I&#x27;m afraid to use it.</li>
            <li> or it pulls hair instead of cutting it.  </li>
            <li> If you travel this is really inconvenient.</li>
            <li> Instead of a recharging base unit that you set the trimmer into, you have to plug a small connector into the base of the unit and then set it on the stand while trying to ensure that the power cable doesn&#x27;t knock out your accessory pieces.  </li>
            <li> What a horrible waste of money!</li>
            <li> At times, it would completely fail to even turn on!  </li>
            <li> It also did a horrible job trimming my nose hair - it pulled on the hairs and hardly cut anything.</li>
            <li> Attachments are awkward and painful to switch.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> The plastic base is useless.  </li>
            <li> The base that everything stands on was useless and I thought the pictures implied that you could just drop the device into the cradle and it would charge.  </li>
            <li> They are very difficult to remove - a cleanliness concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The base itself is just useless.</li>
            <li> I was very sad.</li>
            <li> Maybe it was just the one I got, but it pulls hairs out instead of cutting them making for a very uncomfortable and painful trim.</li>
            <li> From day one it was very difficult to trim without nicking myself with the blades.</li>
            <li> Very difficult.</li>
            <li> This seems a bit silly to bitch about, but it&#x27;s incredibly annoying.</li>
            <li> Changing accessories was very difficult and the shaver head routinely fell off during use.  </li>
            <li> The base is completely useless so I just let it lay on the counter connected to the charger</li>
            <li> It is almost impossible to change the head on it.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s virtually impossible to get all of the clippings off.  </li>
            <li> The heads are almost impossible to remove and replace.  </li>
            <li> For those that complain about the nose attachment, I can&#x27;t use it anyways because the vibrations make it impossible</li>
            <li> Hovering around impossible.</li>
            <li> The heads are almost impossible to interchange because the manufacturer did not bother to produce any instructions.  </li>
            <li> It is almost impossible to brush off the hairs from the body of the trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed, this has already broken.</li>
            <li> the bad.</li>
            <li> bad : the foil shaver accessory is really bad.</li>
            <li> bad :</li>
            <li> Too bad</li>
            <li> Either this isn&#x27;t a lithium ion battery or it was part of a bad stock.  </li>
            <li> Purchased another thinking that I got a bad one.  </li>
            <li> bad quality .&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are bad clippers.</li>
            <li> Charge this bad boy up</li>
            <li> Battery, charger or motor went bad.</li>
            <li> I have used this product all my life with no problem....just bad batteries..........</li>
            <li> so badly you cant brush them off, I had to use a damp towel, what do I need with a rubber handle?</li>
            <li> it continues to get quieter until it stops working, which is bad for the battery.  </li>
            <li> Bad</li>
            <li> It broke and did a bad job of trimming my hair.  </li>
            <li> I specifically wanted to get a Lithium Ion Beard Trimmer because I was frustrated with my Ni-Cad trimmer which could not hold a charge any longer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not so painful</li>
            <li> It is painful to use.</li>
            <li> Attachment  Storage is insane and is poorly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s painful.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Absolutely atrocious product.</li>
            <li> My husband did not like this trimmer at all, it pulled out his hairs instead of trimming them which proved to be painful.</li>
            <li> so I was disappointed</li>
            <li> I was also disappointed in the tray the unit comes with for storing.  </li>
            <li> My husband tried the shaver and was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> Then so dissappointed :( .</li>
            <li> However, I was really disappointed with what I got.  </li>
            <li> Truly disappointed.</li>
            <li> Quite disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m immediately disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> This fails miserably at that.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when the motor burned out, and looking to replace it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, I will say I am highly disappointed with this product, and will be returning it from where I bought it.</li>
            <li> This fails miserably at that task.  </li>
            <li> After years of trusting the Wahl name, I&#x27;m disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I like the lithium battery but am highly disappointed in having the trimmmer go on the fritz so soon after I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in this wahl product.</li>
            <li> Lasted about 1 year; disappointed in durability.</li>
            <li> So I was disappointed to find that a circular trimmer was not included.</li>
            <li> The plastic attachments are horrible and made out of a very poor plastic.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing from WAHL...  </li>
            <li> wrong!!</li>
            <li> The stand is worthless as a holder.</li>
            <li> So yeah, I hate this trimmer.</li>
            <li> What a piece of crap.</li>
            <li> the accessories change system its to annoying, you have to unscrew 2 screws each time . . .</li>
            <li> Additionally, the cord itself doesn&#x27;t stay attached to the base which I found to be annoying.  </li>
            <li> The 6-Position Guide is worthless if you want to use \\&quot;position 1\\&quot; setting (the setting that gives you the closest trim).  </li>
            <li> Changing the head is annoying, so</li>
            <li> - Use a material for the handle that is not sticky.  - Deepen the accessory (charging) base.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worthless.  </li>
            <li> The rubber stuff on the grip is annoying...</li>
            <li> I used to hate wahl clippers and swore them off two years ago.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Changing cutting heads is just awful.</li>
            <li> If I keep this thing, the parts are going in a drawer and the base is going in the trash.</li>
            <li> The base that everything sits on is like all of these trimmers -</li>
            <li> I hate shaving with a razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Crap quality</li>
            <li> By September it was worthless.  </li>
            <li> The base holder thing can be thrown out and replaced with a plastic bag.</li>
            <li> I owned their base level bear trimmer (Wahl 9918-6171 Groomsman Beard and Mustache Trimmer) and it lasted me almost 5 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to repurchase the base level (non-lithium ion) version.</li>
            <li> I hate shaving.  </li>
            <li> Really annoying since i want a cordless.</li>
            <li> Worthless eyebrow/nose/ear attachment&lt;</li>
            <li> The clippers work well, but the shaver is crap.</li>
            <li> and I typically hate foil shavers.  </li>
            <li> The one drawback for me is that you have to remove the trimmer from the base and plug the charger cord into the trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Although this would be a plus for travel, as you don&#x27;t need to bring the base with you.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Two improvements that I&#x27;d recommend is a charge status indicator and an improved base for all the attachments.  </li>
            <li> The 5  year warranty on this thing is worthless if they just keep it and never fix it when you send it in.</li>
            <li> and it is annoying.  </li>
            <li> &quot; that can be attached to the base.</li>
            <li> Crap.</li>
            <li> This product is a terrible disappointment.  </li>
            <li> Advertised/Shown as having a base stand to put parts in.  </li>
            <li> The plastic stand for the trimmer and accessories is worthless.  </li>
            <li> how flimsy the base is.  </li>
            <li> They are always falling all over the place because they are not secured in the base at all.  </li>
            <li> He doesnt use them all and would rather have a sturdier base with fewer accessories that snap in and stay put.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s annoying as hell</li>
            <li> I thought this was annoying</li>
            <li> a deal-breaker, but annoying nonetheless.</li>
            <li> I hate it.</li>
            <li> The base will not store all the attachments well at all.</li>
            <li> Bad design and terrible quality.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After this time, things went from bad to awful.  </li>
            <li> worst product ever its painful when i use it</li>
            <li> My bad!  </li>
            <li> Bad idea to offer  a review without using product for a while!</li>
            <li> A real disappointment.</li>
            <li> The base is just terrible.  </li>

            <li> His remington has been running horribly for about 2yrs now.  </li>
            <li> this beard trimmer is the worst I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> I find this outrageous.  </li>

            <li> Worst Wahl beard trimmer they ever made.</li>
            <li> The battery life is insane:</li>
            <li> It is made out of this rubber-silicon material that hair clings to like grim death.  </li>
            <li> Another Wahl piece of crap!!!</li>
            <li> Terrible!</li>
            <li> Pathetic</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> So far so good. Fairly silent and good power for thick beards.  Hasn&#x27;t snagged or pulled at all yet like many do.</li>
            <li> Battery life on this is amazing.</li>
            <li> worked great until almost one whole year later. it stopped working over night, with no warning, now it wont charge, or run at all. Also, not that I want to, but i cant just buy the razar itself. i have to buy a whole new pack. Very unhappy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it ....&lt;br /&gt;Finally I throw it in my trash  :)</li>
            <li> Owned the Wahl trimmer for 1.5 months. I use it 1-2 times per week to trim my beard and today it failed. I was trimming per usual and heard a snap. One of the blades seems to be loose and the product no longer cuts hair. I had my last wahl for several years, not sure why this one could not survive 7 uses. Will be returning ASAP.</li>
            <li> really good one, battery back is too good :)</li>
            <li> Great product.  All the attachments do everything that I needed it to do.</li>
            <li> By the price this is a great product. It&#x27;s practical and easy to use. I also have to say, I received the product on time.</li>
            <li> I read many of the reviews and I decided to give this trimmer a try. The comb rusted after the first use and the comb teeth width is too small. Because the teeth on the comb are too small for facial hair it misses a lot of the hair and you have to go over your face many times. I bought this as a back up because my other trimmer is dying but I didn&#x27;t make it through an entire shave before switching to my old trimmer that has wider teeth. Packaged up and is headed back.</li>
            <li> This is very lightweight but does the job faster ad better than most other trimmers. i love it!</li>
            <li> Its great my husband love it..</li>
            <li> i love it its lion but it needs to have a waterproofed PCB a slight rinse with water can kill it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also keep it on the charger.&lt;br /&gt;liion batteries would rather be charged after little use many times over being drained and few charges.&lt;br /&gt;it will kill the battery by draining it before charging</li>
            <li> Bit of a plastic feel but works well. Much cheaper than the prices available here in Australia. I&#x27;m very happy with it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good .. charge is very good also .. but if clene it by water Once intercourse with her exposed steel water directly</li>
            <li> I almost didn&#x27;t buy this trimmer because of the large number of negative reviews, but took a shot anyway based on the good reviews. I cant speak about how long it will last, but I am very happy with it, so far. My last trimmer was much more expensive and didn&#x27;t do nearly as good a job. I only needed one of the guides for my beard, so I have all the others I don&#x27;t need. It is a bit loud, but not unbearable. The ear trimmer actually works, and so does the shaving head. Some people mentioned that the bare trimmer will bite you, and it will, so be careful. The only problem I have is the heads are a bit difficult to attach, but once you figure it out, its fine. I definitely recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I got this item because it was an all in one and the reviews on it were overall good. While I haven&#x27;t been able to try out all the attachments that come with since my beard isn&#x27;t long enough I will not grade those items. I&#x27;ve used the default blade that comes per-attached and it works wonderfully however the so called smooth shaver attachment is just abysmal. Not only does it take forever to shave due to the small head size but it doesn&#x27;t do that good of a job at shaving(doesn&#x27;t get very close unless you really PUSH it into your face). If I could I could return this set I would.</li>
            <li> I have had Wahl products in the past with good results. This time I messed up.To many accessories! A better design could keep it more simple&lt;br /&gt;Standard Wahl narrow blade head not as good for faster trims.</li>
            <li> my title says it all.  I&#x27;ve kept this thing in my medicine cabinet.  Used it  it a few times.  I thought maybe the battery was dead so I left it charging.  But still it won&#x27;t turn on anymore.  I was ripped off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m leaning towards 5 stars as I am very happy with this.  The only things I would say is that it is mainly made out of plastic (except for the blades of course) which gives it kind of a cheap feel however it does work great.  The handle part has a rubbery cover which tends to collect clippings on it as well.  The stand it good but it does not really hold the charging cable so really you have to plug the cable in while the trimmer is out of the stand and then set it in after.  It is not really a charging stand.  It holds a charge for an amazingly long time so this is not really that inconvenient.  I was surpised with the number of usefull attachments that this comes with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great value for what I paid - $24.95</li>
            <li> Got mine from Target and had it about 2 years. It saw use maybe once a month for 20 minutes and it&#x27;s done dead on me. I&#x27;ve only ever charged it right before use and now the thing is useless. Wahl has a warranty for 5 years but why bother when you have to pay to ship it. I can get a new one from another brand for just a little bit more and no hassle or waiting. It was okay while it lasted, but for the amount I used it, it should have lasted a lot longer.</li>
            <li> I have good experience with purchase</li>
            <li> Feels really solid in my hand and the head is well-designed, it&#x27;s easy to get a nice clean line. Overall, my beard looks better than ever--the 2 other trimmers I used to use were both in the same price range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 problems: the stand that holds all the little attachments is a terrible, flimsy plastic thing; the body of the trimmer is shaped in a way that makes it roll off the shelf if I set it down the wrong way.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for a friend and so far he loves it.  His remington has been running horribly for about 2yrs now.  No complaints so far, but we&#x27;ll see how long that lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update...Wahl recently had to be contacted, due the trimmer not working.  Less than a year, that lasted.  And Wahl&#x27;s customer service is appalling.  It took 4 calls and several messages left on their facebook page to get anywhere with them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a rechargeable trimmer for a couple of years that was doing a good job, but I was noticing the recharge life was getting shorter and shorter, then the charger died. I&#x27;ve known the Wahl name for many years because my barbers have used them. I figured if it&#x27;s good enough for professionals, it&#x27;s good enough for me to try out. Then I realized it was also Lithium Ion! That should help! The first thing I noticed after unpacking is the poorly designed holder for all the head accessories. It&#x27;s not very good at doing what it&#x27;s supposed to do, but that has nothing to do with the function. It was already charged, so I gave it a try. WOW! This is a much better trimmer that I&#x27;ve ever had! It just feels solid, and sounds sharp as it cuts. The heads interchange perfectly, once you get the hang of it, and feel very solid. I have been extremely happy with this Wahl trimmer, and to top it off, it is Made In America by U.S. workers! I couldn&#x27;t be happier, unless they redesigned that storage tray and sent me one!</li>
            <li> Replaces another that lived only four years, but at least I now have two sets of attachments. Wahl blades do seem to remain sharp longer than those of other trimmers, and at the relatively low cost of this trimmer, replacement every few years is annoying but acceptable.</li>
            <li> This is far superior to other trimmers. It runs strong for a long time and it does not cut or catch at all.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to replace a Peanut. I use this for everything including shaving and trimming beard and head. Love the fact it can be used without the cord.  It is surprisingly powerful for being battery operated.There are accessories that are not needed for novice use I have only owned this for two months, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> I have to say I am a little disappointed in this product.  I had always thought that Wahl trimmers were supposed to be some of the best grooming products out there.  I&#x27;ve had this for little over a year and it has stopped functioning.  I maybe used it once every two weeks and that was it.  I was also a little disappointed in how this product felt.  It felt very &amp;#34;weak&amp;#34; and not the best quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s possible that the more expensive Wahl trimmers are what I am expecting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this a few months, and use it every day. All the accessories are nicely made, the unit lasts forever between charges, and the cutting blades seems to work very well...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint, albeit minor, is that I use it to trim existing stubble... and the cutter with NO guard on it cuts very close, and the smallest guard leaves more stubble than I would like. This is quite minor... and more of a piece of information than a complaint. My old trimmer, with no guard, did not cut as close... so I was used to that setting. This one, without the guard, cuts even closer... which is what it&#x27;s supposed to do... and the smallest guard still leaves stubble a bit long, imo. But no biggie... great unit, great design, good feel in the hand, and lasts a long time between charges.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get a chance to use the shaver, i assume it works great according to other people&#x27;s reviews. i was sent what looks to be a used unit, packaging is all torn up with tape holding everything together. a couple of the blades are missing. there is still hair on the trimming blades. i am very disappointed in the seller of this item that they would send me a clearly used shaver.</li>
            <li> So far it is performing well.  I bought this for myself with an amazon gift certificate and I am quite happy with it.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer does the job perfectly.</li>
            <li> Mine broke after one charge. I guess the battery was defective. It gave a good shave, but there are over a dozen different pieces that will probably get scattered all around some drawer. I hope yours works better than mine.</li>
            <li> Compact system has all the attachments you should need. Beefier than other trimmers and that is the reason for the better power.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my hair stylist; it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> Just used once, but very good. It works well, just couldn&#x27;t be used in shower. And, it&#x27;s not very easy to clean it. But the battery is powerful, and just need to be recharged in one hour. Hope it could be used in shower and cleaned by water.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a cordless personal trimmer and Wahl has a reputation for being some of the best hair trimmers on the market so I bought this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> No one ever mentioned about the rust. This the trimmer attachment starts rusting after the first use.I contacted WAHL and they said this should not be used anywhere near water and they refused to replace or help.</li>
            <li> After using for a while a charge barely lasts for one trimming session. The accessory set is cheap and cheesy. The comb teeth will almost draw blood when you use it. The stand is worthless as a holder. If you bump it the pieces go flying everywhere. The gauge of wire used for the AC adapter is so stiff you can&#x27;t roll it up properly to store. I only ended up using the one trimming attachment and it feels like it will break every time I remove it. When I trim around the edge of my goatee it feels like it is ripping the hairs out of my face. Bits of hair stick to the grip of the trimmer and it&#x27;s hard to get off. So yeah, I hate this trimmer.</li>
            <li> worked fine until about 2 weeks ago...then it just stopped working...found others with the same issue....i would have thought Wahl would be better then this....waste of money?</li>
            <li> I am getting ready to buy this trimmer for the third time. The first time I left it in a hotel and the second one I misplaced the blade attachments. I really like the results I am able to achieve with this trimmer. Whether I have a full beard or switch it up with a goatee, this trimmer allows me to groom and style any way I want. Some of the other reviewers have talked about the noise but I haven&#x27;t found it to be a problem. Its a clipper and its not going to be whisper quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am aware that these devices are designed to be disposable and after about a year or so I found the blades to get a little dull. I have no idea if these can be sharpened. But for 30 bucks I find it to be an outstanding value and have no problems justifying its purchase. My barber charges 10 bucks for lineups and trims in between full blown haircuts so this allows me to skip the weekly trips to the barbershop. Depending on the look I am trying to keep I can almost go a month without a trip to the barber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charge lasts a while....it lasts so long that when it dies I cant remember when it was last charged up. Then I just charge it and its always fully charged when I come home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers mentioned the stand and they are right..its not convenient nor have I found a way to make all of the attachments fit securely although there is a diagram in the manual on how to do so...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion this is a great buy for the money and Amazon had the lowest price..Local drugstores and Target had this for 39.99.</li>
            <li> the clippers were OK at first but then the battery started declining and couldn&#x27;t last more than a few minutes before having to plug it in again. Then eventually it stopped working after a few minutes even with the cord plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the wide clipper attachment stopped cutting hair all together meaning it would not cut hair at all, and didn&#x27;t have the strength to cut. so had to resort to the smaller cutters.</li>
            <li> I think the battery never loses charge. I dont use these clippers very often; maybe once in 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;And I have had this product for over an year now and it required charging only once. If you use it daily, I am sure it needs more charging but for my usage I barely charge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clippers work just fine and the motor does not make too much sound. I am happy with the product. Although, I must add that I use it sparingly.</li>
            <li> this beard trimmer is the worst I have ever owned. with all the attachments I still couldn&#x27;t get my beard the length I wanted it. I had problems keeping it charged, it throws hair all over the place and when I settled on an attachment to trim my beard. My hair got caught between the plastic attachment and blade and pulls just as much hair out as it cuts. very time consuming. don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I like this trimmer. It&#x27;s the second one I&#x27;ve bought and it failed, just like the first one, after about six months use. Another review stated that moisture from a steamy bathroom degrades the internals, which I have to imagine is the case. At this point, I&#x27;m spending $100 a year on trimmers. I&#x27;m also going to take mine apart and clean and protect the internals from corrosion, which is a silly thing to have to do. Maybe instead of a flimsy plastic tray filled with junk accessories they could have spent the money to make a more solid product.</li>
            <li> REVIEW UPDATE: After using this trimmer for several months I have discovered what I consider a major flaw in design after I wrote this review. The cutting blades are not rust proof. I got mine wet and the next day they had a major rust issue. I would not given this 5 stars originally if I new that this would happen&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the power of the razor and the lithium battery provides for weeks of daily use without recharging. I almost gave it 4 stars because the attachments are tricky to change. Once you get the hang of changing them it is not too bad, but I almost broke some of them by forcing the issue when I first got it. I mostly use it without the attachments so that is not a big deal to me. If you switch attachments I would look for a different product.</li>
            <li> Rusted after a few months!</li>
            <li> The other reviews are right, I&#x27;m glad I trusted them.  This trimmer works very well, especially compared to the Conair 13-piece that I had before this.  It&#x27;s great that it charges so quickly and keeps its charge for so long.</li>
            <li> Easily the best and most powerful I&#x27;ve used.. And I&#x27;ve used more than a few.    I actually bought this one to replace the wife&#x27;s trimmer. After examining it, I confiscated it and gave her my Remington which is weak and a poor cutter by comparison. LOL    I agree, like most trimmers of this sort it&#x27;s not a hair cutter. It&#x27;s a hair trimmer. Meaning it&#x27;s just not designed to give full service haircuts. But will do in a pinch.    For trimming between haircuts, body hair management, beards, etc.. it&#x27;s hard to beat. Lithium ion is definitely the way to go.    The blades are incredibly precise and are reminiscent of a bygone era. They are carbon steel, so they aren&#x27;t rinsable and must be oiled occasionally. But the extra performance and longevity of the ground carbon blades are a big plus, especially for a tool of this type.    The attachments and stand work very well and are well designed. There is a slight learning curve if you&#x27;ve never used a Wahl before. And no travel case or blade protector is included. The nose/ear/eyebrow attachment works very well and like the other blades is a very precise cutter. Especially compared to other rotary versions on the market, like the Remington. It&#x27;s made for outlining the brow and removing stray hairs, not trimming the entire eyebrow. If you wish to do this, just use the #00 or the #000 beard attachment guide and the regular blade.</li>
            <li> The Lithium Ion is great!!  This is your mans friend!!</li>
            <li> After owning this Wahl Lithium Ion facial hair trimmer for 2 weeks one of the blades began making a high pitched buzzing noise. I took the blade apart to see what was going on and the 2 pronged wire that connects the blade to the power supply had broken in half. After a few more months the other blade also broke the same exact way. The battery lasted a while but the overall quality was crap. I threw it in the trash can and will not buy another Wahl product again.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2L8X0JEQZWSNN]]I purchased this unit in August 2009 and it broke after about 5 uses. Watch my review to see the cheap construction inside. The battery does run for a long time but thats not what I got it for. All i wanted was a stubble trim!    Update (March 2010): Received a partial refund, that moves it up from 1 star to 2.</li>
            <li> Charges very quickly but it has a odd bug.  If it runs out of charge and you charge it back up it will not turn back on till you plug it in while the device is turned on then let it charge for a second or two then turn it off unplug and then it will turn on again. i am taking away a half star for that and a half star for not being as close as other shavers. Still a great shaver none the less.</li>
            <li> I have been using this once each week to reduce my beard back down to stubble per my wife&#x27;s wishes, so I only use the #1 attachment and cannot speak to the others.  I bought it because my Norelco vacuum rechargeable was failing to hold a charge.  I charged this one the first time and did not have to charge it again for 9 months.  I was surprised at how long it lasted and it kept good power right up until the end.  It is now a year since purchase and I am only on my second recharge. It cuts better than the Norelco because it has more power.  It is narrower, but that is not a problem.  The ergonomics are very good --it is comfortable, compact, and light.  The handle is a magnet for beard clippings, but a quick swipe with a damp sponge will clean it adequately.  The plastic holding tray is not exciting, but I don&#x27;t expect to decorate the bath with my trimmer -- it goes in a drawer in a cabinet.  It does not have a vacuum, but I found that the vacuum type only collect about 50% of the clippings leaving me with a sink cleaning job regardless, so I have not missed the vacuum at all.  It make short work of the job, needs recharging only once a year, is more reliable than the Norelcos I have had, and is quite comfortable to use -- so I am very happy with the product and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> The Wahl 9854-600 shaver is a decent, but not a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The battery is great. It charges quick and run for a long time, before it needs to be recharged again.&lt;br /&gt;- The shaver has a nice grip.&lt;br /&gt;- Cordless&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Loud. No really, this thing is a like a lawnmower on crack.&lt;br /&gt;- It has a weak motor. Half of the time instead of trimming/cutting, the blades will actually pull hair out. That might be great for tempering your pain tolerance. Not so much for shaving, before work.&lt;br /&gt;-  You can&#x27;t rinse it, or it will rust. If you want to clean the beard trimmings, you need to spend an hour using the provided brush.&lt;br /&gt;- While the rubber handle has a great grip, it works like a magnet for the trimmed hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing personal against Wahl. They have some great products. However, the 9854-600 is not one of them. Do yourself a favor and pass on this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Very light, easy to charge, and versatile.</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer that I have used. This is better than Philips. Charges very quickly and retains its power after long use, I am impressed. This is the product to get if you don&#x27;t have time to charge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a much cheaper POS Wahl for a year, and it&#x27;s been miserable. Battery life was a mere few minutes with an overnight charge, and the motor seemed unable to handle any trimming job. I picked up this trimmer a few days ago and I&#x27;m very pleased with its performance. It charges very fast, it is very powerful, and so far the charge is holding nicely. As others have said, 90% of the attachments are useless and should be thrown out. The only one I can ever see myself using is the very nice 6 position adjustable head. It attaches to the trimmer head very securely, and holds its setting very securely too. Also previously mentioned is the fact that the rubber grip tends to attract and hold clipped whiskers, which is true. But who cares? All in all, definitely worth every penny. I only wish I&#x27;d have thrown away my old trimmer a year ago and bought this one.</li>
            <li> I bought this just over a year ago and was extremely happy about how well this worked, and continued to work. About 6 months ago, I started noticing that the battery wasn&#x27;t holding as much of a charge as it used to. I thought nothing of it since it would still last 3-4 shaves (~30-40 min), but then as the months rolled on it got worse and worse to the point that it would barely make it through a single shave without needing a bump of juice (and about 5-10 extra minutes of waiting). Now, it barely lasts 5 minutes on a \\&quot;full\\&quot; charge and 5-10 minute bump charges only give it around a minute. Needless to say, it now takes over an hour for a full trim, which is absolutely unacceptable. With that said, I&#x27;m moving on to the [[ASIN:B0037HP9OA Philips Norelco BG2040/34 Philips Norelco Bodygroom Pro Grooming System, Black / Silver]] for all my trimming needs. I think I can deal with the relative lack of power and overnight charge time to gain the convenience of never having to switch out another attachment or cutting head.</li>
            <li> I only use it to shave my face, I don&#x27;t use any of the attachments. That being said, this is the best Wahl I have ever used. Shaving doesn&#x27;t irritate like with previous Wahls. The improvement has made my life better. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I PURCHASED THIS FROM AMAZON A WHILE BACK.. IT CAME OPENED AND IT IS GARBAGE.. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.... U WILL REGRET IT.. I AM CURRENTLY LOOKING AT NORELCO OR BRAUN PRODUCTS...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GARBAGE!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a cool product. It&#x27;s convenient and comes with more attachments than I&#x27;ll ever need in this lifetime. I also believe it&#x27;ll be much more durable than the cheapo shaver I bought some years ago.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver based on other reviews.  It is a powerful shaver however my last trimmer did a better job of getting cleaner closer trim of my beard.  This one took a bit more work so I was disappointed</li>
            <li> So far I am extremely impressed with this trimmer. It has enough reserve power to give a complete haircut, assuming you are not an ape. The rubber grip feels good in the hand, and with the attachements you get with it, you can trim every place on your body.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this shaver after his bit the dust.  It comes with a ton of attachments so you can trim everything up nicely.  He definitely would recommend this to other buyers.  It&#x27;s a great shaver at a great price.</li>
            <li> Great item, would buy again.</li>
            <li> bought it for my hubby and he loves it!</li>
            <li> I had to ding 1 star on this one, the shaving attachment really doesn&#x27;t work that well at all. I definitely expected more from the Wahl brand. With that one caveat out of the way, it has been superb in every other area. I&#x27;m currently deployed in Afghanistan and it is holding up against the conditions here with out any issues.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with this trimmer at first but after about 8 months it quit holding a charge. When new it was powerful enough to get through my head and beard with ease several times. Now, it seems to drain overnight whether used or not. I agree with previous posters that the extra attachments would be better suited as an addition purchase if desired. They are not easily changed and some will never be used. I will try to contact Wahl&#x27;s customer service department since they seem to offer a generous warranty, but the original packaging is long gone.</li>
            <li> After I got tired of shaving multiple times a week with a razor(Gillette Pro Glide), I decided on growing a short beard(a few weeks growth) but keeping my neck lined up and looking clean so I bought this trimmer. It&#x27;s ridiculous how many useless accessories came with the package. Every one of the attachments didn&#x27;t even work correctly. Anyways, it was alright the first couple of weeks but I got tired of the beard and used the bare clippers to help shave them off since they would have clogged up my razor each swipe. Wow...this thing pulls hair all over my face and neck while leaving many uneven hairs. Even after I went over the uneven areas multiple times, it still wasn&#x27;t cutting them. Once I got to the thicker part of my beard (chin), the trimmer started to pull hairs left and right which was painful and annoying while STILL leaving even more uncut randoms. I don&#x27;t even have a really thick beard, just coarse hair.   All in all, if you have thick or coarse facial hair, look the other way. There are better trimmers/shavers out there for nearly the same price. I haven&#x27;t had a problem with the battery although I do charge it overnight if I am going to use it the next day. The biggest downside was its inability to trim facial hair without leaving scraggly uncut pieces. I use it as a personal groomer which seems to work better because of the thin hair on my chest and stomach. After an overnight charge, it turns on like a chainsaw and goes to work on the body grooming, but not on my face for some reason. I like the \\&quot;3 days growth\\&quot; look so I will be buying a stubble type trimmer soon. One thing is for sure, I will never buy WAHL again.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works very well, it cut through my thick grey mustache and sideburn area with ease. The attachments work well. And changing trimmer heads is straightforward and snap into place with precision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the bad. Have had to have it replaced twice due to the PITA charging procedure.  After talking with A lady at Wahl, it is finally clear that you should not charge for more than a hour, even if completely dead, and not to charge it until completely dead. Sorry but I have more important things in life to do than to be tied to a charging routine. When this baby dies again, it will be back to a regular battery trimmer.</li>
            <li> I see a lot of positive reviews so I suspect perhaps my style of trimming just isn&#x27;t compatible with this device?  I had been using a Norelco for some years, but I had lost some of the guards for the unit, rather then looking at replacements on the guards I thought I&#x27;d just upgrade to a new trimmer, and this seemed like a good unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First thing I noticed was that the different heads are difficult to change.  After several months with the device, I still had difficulty swapping out the trimmer and clipper blades, it always felt like I was forcing those heads on incorrectly, the different guards were especially difficult to attach &amp; remove, I suspect were I to continue using this device long term I would have eventually damage the guards in the process of interchanging them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And maybe a silly complaint, but I was also disappointed in the tray the unit comes with for storing.  My last trimmer had a great tray that tucked the wire in a way that I could easily pull it off and pop it on the charger, and had a tray they fit all the accessories to store them in a very clean manner.  This unit does nothing with the wire, so every time you lift the unit off the wire is going to come with it, and you have to detach it from there.  And its genuinely just a tray, so the attachments more or less just lay in there against the other accessories, so even after you get everything in there all nice and organized as soon as you pick up a different accessory everything is just going to shift and move.  I also found cleaning the accessories and blades to be a pain, hair seems to really find a way to get tucked in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest disappointment for me is the trimming itself.  The blade and guard design never gave me a clean, even shave, and creating fades never worked as well as it had with my previous (or current) Norelco.  I&#x27;d have to run the trimmer over the same areas several times and it still seemed to just keep missing spots.  I somehow learned to settle with the results, though mostly by cleaning up the beard with a pair of scissors after.  But having recently moved back to a Norelco unit (Norelco Qg3280), I see now how poor a job the Wahl trimmer had been doing.  Without sounding like too much of an ad for Norelco, the Norelco guards and blades on my current unit very simply and easily provide the clean, even trimming that I had been struggling to get with the Wahl unit.  The first time trying my Norelco to see if it&#x27;d be a suitable replacement proved to be such an immediate and obvious improvement that I immediately discarded the Wahl unit and have not looked back.o settle with the results, though mostly by cleaning up the beard with a pair of scissors after.

            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why companies are still using ni-cad on shavers and trimmers.  I had a shaver that died in just over a year.  Ni-cads are old school type of batteries and perform poorly.  This Wahl uses Li-ion, besides being lightweight, is more powerful, lasts a long time between charges, and charges quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very versatile with multiple attachments for trimming beards, as a nose-ear-eyebrow timmer, stubble shaver and hair clipper.  There are different comb lengths included (but why not combine these into one adjustable comb- I have seen those on other models).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a nose trimmer, I prefer the round tip instead of this with sharp edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Hair clipper is very narrow.&lt;br /&gt;- Not as sleek looking with its plain industrial design&lt;br /&gt;- Nose trimmer is a bit uncomfortable</li>
            <li> I have owned several Walh trimmers in the past, but the ion battery sets this apart from all previous trimmers, definitely worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li> My huband says the are the best pair of trimmers he&#x27;s ever own. He said the work really well with his tough textured hair.</li>
            <li> Pulls beard hair when at the closest setting.</li>
            <li> Despite the price of this product and it carrying the brand name &amp;#34;wahl&amp;#34; and being made in the USA, I do not thing that this product was up to expectations. The metal that the heads are made of is not very well chemically engineered. For a shaving heads, minimal amount of water should be tolerated however this Wahl had 0 tolerance. No significant amount of water was put on the heads however there were stains/signs of a beginning rust reaction. Not worth the purchase or the brand name it carries.</li>
            <li> The box was not in good condition. There were rust / corrode in both blades / trimmers. I believe it was not new as mentioned in the product page.</li>
            <li> I have had a beard for 33 years and i keep it short.This is my 5th Wahl trimmer and i can say that it is the best one i have owned.The battery holds a charge for a long time and the attachments are a plus.The only bad thing i can say is that i wish it had a charge light indicator to let me know if it is fully charged or not,even some of the cheap trimmers have this option.That being said i really like the trimmer and Amazon as usual had it for a great price.Changing the different heads is very easy and the holder is just okay.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t live without this trimmer. Wahl is by far the best I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> Great battery life!! Also with all the different heads that come with it you can trim, shape, line up just about any part of your facial hair and hair line !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now March 2012 ... I bought this through Amazon in June 2011.  For this price I did not buy it expecting it to shave lots of hair away or shave my face baby smooth (haha).  I just wanted something for those emergency shaves, but most important as a daily beard and mustache trimmer and for haircut touchups.  I find it a great instrument for those tasks.  If I find myself running late in the morning the shaver works okay, but nothing I would use every day.  The trimmer is a great device; use it just about every day until it dies and have only charged it THREE times so far!  I don&#x27;t &#x60;brush&#x27; the  trimmer clean as much as I should, and have oiled it once since I bought it; and it still runs like the first day I used it.  As for the accessories: I kept the six-position Guide, Dual Shaver, Precious Detailer, and the Clipper Blade.  The other plastic parts I would never use I just threw away, considered them \\&quot;fluff\\&quot; to make me think I got my monies worth.  To each his own.  For this price it is not perfect but I will buy it again when this one quits working.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve charged it maybe 5 times in the last few months, its basic, shaves my head every two days so I give it some heavy use.  I would take this over any other expensive brand.  Great little buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other trimmers and got tired of ones that pulled hair, took forever to trim my beard or were just lowsy quality. This one is different. I wasn&#x27;t sure it would be easy to use and work well at first, came with lots of attachments and seemed confusing. But after browsing the instructions and realizing how easy it was to change heads and adjust accesories - Wow, different opinion. Works Great, seems like Pro Quality and most important - does the job. I&#x27;m happy.&lt;br /&gt;Jeff</li>
            <li> This trimmer is so hard to use.  It is almost impossible to change the head on it.  My husband dislikes it so much that I am looking for a replacement for him and he is not a fussy person.</li>
            <li> Bottom line: a mediocre product. It&#x27;s easy to change the attachments, though most of them seem low quality. The \\&quot;dual shaver\\&quot; attachment is small and works poorly, even on my lightweight facial hair. The leading disappointment has been the much-hyped battery. It seems to have \\&quot;wore out\\&quot; rather quickly. I&#x27;ve used previous rechargeable razors for 3-5 years before the battery stopped holding a charge. The battery on this product stopped holding a charge in less than 2 years of light use. Already it won&#x27;t hold enough charge to operate for more than 3 minutes. I&#x27;m in the market for a similar product again, and this brand is off my list of considerations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Note: I&#x27;ve upgraded from 2 stars to 3 stars because of the service the company provided when I wasn&#x27;t happy w/ the product. So now if you&#x27;re unsure if you want to try this product, I can recommend you give them a chance.</li>
            <li> Made very cheaper. The ON/OFF Switch came broken in the package</li>
            <li> I will never use all of the attachments, so if you&#x27;re into all that then maybe you need to read other reviews. In my case I just wanted the stubble beard look so the 1/8 or 1/4 attachment worked perfectly. I won&#x27;t be doing a lot of changing either, but the little I played with the parts they seemed adequate. They stayed on and snapped in place securely. However, they are plastic and will not last a lifetime... but what does now days. It that were a concern I would just order a second set as a backup. Can&#x27;t cost more than a few dollar.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.  1st issue was/is poor battery contact, i.e., runs like battery is going dead when used at normal angles, speed zips right up when turned to non-useful angles.    2nd issue: The beard clipper gave up the ghost after about 8 or 9 uses.  There are two springs in it, one spring snapped rendering clipper useless.</li>
            <li> This product has a fatal flaw; the trimmer&#x27;s internals can&#x27;t handle the torque of the motor and fail within days. Basically the springs that return the blades to their original position during trimming snap off and render the unit useless. It buzzes erratically and that&#x27;s that.     I purchased my first unit in september and it last for 3 days before the springs snap. My second unit was shipped to me, which then lasted me 2 weeks before the same failure occurred. THe problem is NOT user induced, the trimmer could be left on on a table for 10 minutes a day and the same would occur within a few days.     On a positive note, it trimmed really well while it worked. Battery lasted far longer than anything I&#x27;ve used and it had plenty of power. It&#x27;s a real shame because i was staring to love this thing.     Dont buy it, try something else or suffer the same result in a few days.</li>
            <li> Idk what the guy is talking about when his review states that this trimmer is too loud.  It sounds like any other one I have had in the past.  The attachments are kind of useless.  The power of this trimmer is tremendous.  A great trimmer and the only minor complaint I have is that it doesn&#x27;t trim as close to my face as the previous trimmers did.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to shave often - about three times a week - and I&#x27;ve only charged this shaver once in the 9 months I&#x27;ve owned it so far.  It works great.  The attachments go on and off easily, yet stay on firmly.  Solid build quality. I&#x27;d buy it again and recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> Overall, a great product.  It has met my husband&#x27;s grooming needs.  He has told me that the large trimmer attachment does well with his manscaping, while the medium attachment does well with face and neck.  His only complaint so far is that the small detail attachment does heat up a good deal if left running for an extended amount of time and burns the skin a little.  He would recommend this product but would advise against prolonged use of the detailer.</li>
            <li> I sent this unit back because I could not get one use without it pinching my beard ..... no good</li>
            <li> Battery died in 2 years.  Got reduced power/duration after a year.  Only runs for 5 minutes now.  Attachments hard to remove.  Would not buy another Wahl.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Had my hair trimmed with it for more than a year.  As long as the person using it knows basic haircutting techniques, then your hair looks good without the expense of a salon hair stylist.</li>
            <li> Great thing for the great price.</li>
            <li> I have tried several other products, and this one is the best for overall cutting and trimming.  This Wahl trimmer is lightweight plastic, and probably not built for the ages.  But the two cutting and one trimming head pop off the body of the trimmer and are easily replaced.  The size of the heads is perfect.  The largest one is big enough to clip my entire (bald) head.  The littlest one is the right size to go around the ears and catch the stray hairs on the top of my head without creating big bare rectangles if I accidentally touch the skin.  The plastic guards that set the length of hair fit on and off easily and do not flex when I trim.  The battery has sufficient charge to finish the job.  High marks to this product - a very reasonable price for a very good trimmer.</li>
            <li> If you want to save money and time, and still look great, this groomer is a product you&#x27;ll want to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though made specifically for men, a little experimenting convinced me that parts of the system can be used effectively for women&#x27;s grooming too. (Why not?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple examples of how women can best use the groomer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) the dual head shaver does a great job with little \\&quot;touch up\\&quot; grooming jobs (as in toes, and around ankles, or anywhere else that you missed when you didn&#x27;t have your glasses on, or were grooming by candlelight in the bathroom).&lt;br /&gt;2) the clipper blade is great for those of us with short-hairdo&#x27;s--to touch up necklines between salon visits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These pieces, as well of the rest of the system (11 pieces total) is an efficient way for men to get a fresh from the barber/stylist look at a fraction of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, for any man or woman who hates the commitment of stylist/barber appointments -- time is money, as they say, and you&#x27;ll save both with the Wahl groomer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The long-life-charge of this system is also worth the price of admission. Ever had a trimmer run out of juice in the middle of trimming someone&#x27;s hair? There&#x27;s less possibility of that because this model can hold it&#x27;s charge for up to 10x longer than other models. (This means almost no charge-loss while the unit is in storage.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, if you&#x27;re into home grooming, you&#x27;re going to like this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve waited a long time for Lithium Ion batteries to replace the inferior NiCad batteries in grooming appliances.  Finally Wahl has caught on used the powerful, long lasting batteries in a great little trimmer.  The battery holds a charge for an extremely long time, and recharging only takes about an hour.  It also provides enough juice to tackle just about any facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer is indeed quite powerful, one of the most powerful on the market today.  It makes quick work of even the thickest beards, and you may actually need to be careful when shaving around delicate areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the battery choice is excellent, and the cutters are solid, the flaws in this device lie with the accessories.  This is not due to lack of attachments, as there are nearly a dozen included.  There actually are too many attachments, which overcomplicate using the device and create far too many small parts that could be lost.  While some of the attachments are quite useful, some are flimsy and near useless, such as the eyebrow trimmer.  The plethora of attachments should have been combined into a small handful of adjustable ones instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although lacking an adjustable trimmer attachment, this device is still an excellent trimmer, with a rock solid motor and great battery.  While I can&#x27;t give it five stars, it is definitely a purchase worth considering.</li>
            <li> Happy with the selection of tools. Holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> Plenty of power.  Many cuts between charges.  I use this to cut my entire head</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this product in that it never seemed able to charge to the point where I could use it for more than a few minutes at a go, a problem compounded by the trimmer&#x27;s lack of any kind of charge-indication light that would let me know if it was fully charged, or even in the process of charging.  I was also disappointed with the closeness of the dual shaver -- it was nothing near razor quality, and again, having no indication of it needing or having a charge, the razor would abruptly stop halfway through shaving, which proved especially irritating on a recent trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering the numerous 4- and 5-star reviews here, it would be fair to guess that I may have received a defective trimmer.  Those short and few times it did work, however, I wasn&#x27;t convinced that it was a product of high enough quality to supplant a razor, or one reliable enough for use during travel or vacations.</li>
            <li> Very simple here: Had everything going for it, price, attachments, versatility, etc.  #1) Take home charge, run it once-it never ran again return for new one  #2) Runs for a week &amp; then the razor head device completly falls apart inside  #3) Never again will I buy a Wahl</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had numerous Wahl clippers over the years, this is best so far, battery charge seems to last \\&quot;forever\\&quot;, well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Wide variety of attachments&lt;br /&gt;Anti-clog guards&lt;br /&gt;Strong motor&lt;br /&gt;Battery life&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Cheap construction&lt;br /&gt;Junky accessory tray&lt;br /&gt;Charging plug&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is a nice one, but I think looking back on it I would have gotten the Norelco bodygroom trimmer. The main things that I dont really like about this trimmer is the thin plastic construction of the trimmer and accessory tray. It is also very hard to keep all of the items to stay put in the tray. When looking at the photos I figured that the trimmer would charge by placing it in the holder...not true. You have to plug the cord into the bottom then set it into the tray.&lt;br /&gt;On the good side it has a great battery life and its a workhorse. It stays pretty sharp when oiled regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compare this to the norelco and make your own decisions based on the features.</li>
            <li> This works fine for the price.  One of the smaller trimmer heads, when mounted and running for about 10 seconds, absorbs a lot of heat and will cause a stinging pain on contact with your face.  The foil head doesn&#x27;t always get every little hair, I&#x27;ve had to go back with scissors sometimes.  Everything else is fine.  Very small, easy to transport.</li>
            <li> I am replacing my old Wahl shaver with this new All in One Trimmer.  My wife gives me a trim on the weekends..I have very little hair on top which means I need haircuts often to look nice.    I am impressed with this new shaver.  It is well made and the design is well thought out.  The issues I have with it are minor....first the base that holds the unit and the attachments needs improvement...you really don&#x27;t know what goes where and they don&#x27;t really fit well.  The wire that charges the shaver is unruly...it is hard to control because the designer did not plan the connection to the base unit very well.  It should be like the new Norelco razor platform!  The manual is not very useful if you are trying to figure out what attachment does what or how much hair each attachment will cut.  The attachment for getting a close shave works in some ways better than my everyday shaver!  It retains charge very well.  The fit and finish of the shaver is very good.  I would recommend this shaver to anyone.</li>
            <li> Total crap. Broke within a few months. The second defective Wahl trimmer that I have bought, in a row.</li>
            <li> I have had this incredible trimmer for over two weeks.  Charged for just over an hour when I received it, it has been running full strength ever since.  The claims for the lithium battery are not hype.  Wahl has scored big with this model.  Its design and execution are superb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish I hadn&#x27;t bought all those separate pieces in the past (trimmer, nose clippers, T-blade, etc.).  For much less money, I could have bought this unit and had them all.  The pieces are easily interchanged, once used to the process, and the components are beautiful designed and engineered to fit perfectly.  The blades are highest quality, easily maintained, and the high torque of the motor make them great trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wahl could have written a better manual, better describing how to change blades.  But with little touble, and a modicum of common sense, the skill is acquired easily.  The people who say the blades broke just made a mess of it themselves by forcing.  Never a good idea with any piece of equipment.  Though well within reason, the unit is not as quiet as a good Andis trimmer, but you get many more options for less money.  A fair trade-off in my book.  And nobody else has the battery and power of this Wahl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaving attachment is rather amazing, and useful, but don&#x27;t expect the kind of close shave that a dedicated Norelco will give.  It is just for convenience and, considering the cost of this set, a rather nice throw-in -- especially for traveling when you don&#x27;t want a bunch of extra things to pack and carry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comb attachments fit securely and, when used with the trimming blade, do a beautiful, easy job.  Again, common sense required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may need, or want, a larger clipper for big hair cutting jobs but, for any kind of trim, this is your tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRODUCT UPDATE:  One full month after that same one-hour charge mentioned above, this amazing unit is still going strong.  No diminishing of power at all.  Bought a second unit when price dropped radically one day.</li>
            <li> The handle made of something that doesn&#x27;t feel so good and hair stick to it so it&#x27;s hard to clean after every shave. besides that it&#x27;s a strong machine that does it job.</li>
            <li> Nice size-not big, nor too small. Really powerful. Holds charge for a long time. Exactly what I wanted !!!!!!!</li>
            <li> What a piece of crap. I used it one time before it failed. Going to another brand and not wahl again. Returned to amazon.</li>
            <li> This product used to be the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used. It was powerful, and the charge would last a VERY long time. However, after about 6 months of use, most of the blades started cutting my skin (I guess they&#x27;re not as sharp), and the shaver itself rattles too much, it&#x27;s gotten too loud, and it just doesn&#x27;t work as well. I&#x27;m going to call Wahl to see if they will fix it.</li>
            <li> Wish these had a lil&#x27; nose hair attachment. Great for everything beard and tache.</li>
            <li> Easy to operate and smooth.  Very happy with it and all the attachments.</li>
            <li> Good quality, sharp blades, handles well, but tends to pull at hair a little.</li>
            <li> Excellent excellent excellent. Battery is INCREDIBLE. very powerful and would absolutely recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought this gift for my Father in law.  He has had several beard trimmers and has one for travel, one for at home etc.   He suggested this as his birthday present and I purchased it.  Each time in mentioning his new trimmer, he as told me it was an excellent trimmer and that all the reviews he has read have been true.  Wahl is a really good brand.  His beard is nice and tidy and he is not a man that will not tolerate a crappy piece of equipment. I would suggest this.</li>
            <li> Went completely dead within 6 months. Otherwise it was a good product.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm with terrific battery.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer.  I use it cut my hair and trim my beard.  Every man needs one.  I am glad I found this trimmer while searching the internet.  Excellent price for it here on amazon.    James</li>
            <li> This trimmer completely stopped working 3/4 of the way through my first trim with it.  My previous trimmer, which cost me less then $20, lasted for nearly 7 years.  This one didn&#x27;t even last 7 minutes.</li>
            <li> I bought this knowing I had a Wahl product for scalp hair cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However after using this product it basically is too small in the clipper teeth for thick beard hair. This thing PULL my bread hair like nothing else. I had another clipper before this that was much better that I would have kept if it wasnt for TSA smashing my bag. (Thanks BTW)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is decent for fine hair but thicker beard hairs are very hard to be cut and you must be sloooow as to not pull your hair because it feels like it doesn&#x27;t fully cut through the hair at first and you have to go mega slow. So not happy with it...</li>
            <li> I purchased this at Walmart a few months back and cleaned/oiled it regularly.  It quit working completely, and unfortunately I misplaced the receipt, so it looks like I&#x27;m out of luck for warranty service.      The upside would be that it worked pretty well for the price at first, it was better than a similiar $30-40 trimmer from another brand that I&#x27;d previously purchased(that one also quit working in under a year).</li>
            <li> Very nice little trim and worth the money. Low charge time and accuracy are excellent. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about this product is the cheap case used to hold all the attachments and accessories. It just has two big trays that doesn&#x27;t hold anything in place. Other than that I like the machine.</li>
            <li> Great so far - only had clipper for a month so I can not comment on durability.  Clipper is everything that was advertised on the web page.  I was a little unsure of how to remove and attach blades but found a Wahl video on you tube that walked me thru the process.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this trimmer for 21 months, using it about once a week.  The battery is now dead.  It won&#x27;t hold a charge long enough for me to trim my beard.  It seems to me that a battery should last at least 2 years.      I never really liked it.  It is noisy.  It pulled a lot (i.e. didn&#x27;t cut cleanly).  I liked the small nose/ear trimmer head, but never once used any of the other attachments.    I will buy a different trimmer to replace it.  I would like to buy the Panasonic ER 389k, but it is out of stock.  I&#x27;ll wait a little, and if they can&#x27;t get it in stock, I&#x27;ll buy the Remington MB 200.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of the reviews and that helped me make my decision. I&#x27;ve had this trimmer a couple of months now, and really love it. I&#x27;ll start with the points I did NOT find easily in other reviews    Yes, it does a great job trimming the edges of your mustache above the lip, etc. I&#x27;ve had all-in-one beard groomers where the trimming attachment did not cut well. Not so with this one. The first time I used it I was instantly showing a lot more lip than I had planned on. In other words, it trims mustaches better than anything I have used before.    The other point I was unclear about in other reviews was the usefulness of the nose/ear trimmer attachment. I have owned 2 or 3 of those battery powered rotating types before, and always found them so-so. This trimmer attachment does a much better job than those, and is faster. Just stick it in your ear or nose and you&#x27;re done in 2 seconds, whereas the rotary types make you keep doing it for a while before it seems like you&#x27;re done. The noise level is not a problem at all for me - it&#x27;s noisy but not objectionable in your ear, about the same or less noise level as my rotary trimmer.    For beard trimming (I have a goatee that I keep fairly short), it works well but is slightly less convenient than the all-in-one beard groomers I have owned. You have to switch attachments, which is frankly very easy, though not as easy as just dialing in a 3 or 4 on one of those beard groomers. And the attachments are a bit of a pain because you have to either pick, for instance, a 2 or 3 beard trimmer, or else use the 6-position trimmer attachment. That 6-position trimmer attachment is what I use, and it&#x27;s fine, though adjusting it&#x27;s height requires a little more effort than it should.    Battery life is outstanding, and what puts it above everything else. It lasted 2 months of frequent use on its first charge, and I expect it to last for years. Other beard groomers I have owned (both Panasonic) died after a couple of years and had to be plugged in.    The attachments in general are a bit of a pain, as everyone else mentions. However, putting them on and off is really easy - not as complicated (at least to me) as others have mentioned. I keep them all in the tray on my countertop and it works fairly well. The tray gets really crowded, so I&#x27;ve take some of the attachments I&#x27;m never going to use and put them in a drawer. It is nice to have your oil and brush right there whenever you need them - otherwise I would not clean and oil it as often as I should:)    For haircutting, I agree with everyone else. This thing is really narrow, even with the wider cutting head attached. It&#x27;s about half the width of my corded Wahl trimmer, which is what I&#x27;ve been using to cut my hair (and does a great job). Also, the attachments are not long enough for my hair, which normally takes a 4 and a 5 attachment. Not sure if you can buy longer attachments for it or not. I think the best solution is just to spend another 30 bucks on the corded Wahl unit like I did. It&#x27;s a beast, seems to actually dim the lights when you turn it on (semi-kidding here but you get the idea).    For all around trimming, meaning sideburns and hairline at back of neck, it&#x27;s super. The normal attachment does a great job of shaping your hair and cuts super sharp.    In sum - it&#x27;s outstanding for moustache/ear/nose trimming as well as shaping your beard or hair at the edges. Don&#x27;t bother thinking it&#x27;s going to be very good for actually cutting your hair.</li>
            <li> Fantastic Trimmer.  Have one but broke the adjustable length comb when I dropped it.  My daughter bought me another brand for Christmas.  It was a good one but my shelf broke and both it and my Wahl Trimmer fell in the toilet.  Soaking in toilet water over night doesnt really help a trimmer.  So it is time to buy a new one and it has to be a WAHL.</li>
            <li> This is a sturdy and dependable product. The blades are well-machined, and the battery life is phenomenal. It is barbershop quality. The vast selection of included attachments should address every need. No one person needs them all, but it is important to have the options to try when you receive the machine. Choose the attachment(s) you need in the first few days of ownership, then store the rest. This is an outstanding product.</li>
            <li> Battery last for quite a while, strong motor, good attachments.  Overall I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I use this trimmer regularly and recommended it to a friend, who also bought one.</li>
            <li> This is a very powerful trimmer, but it has a major flaw in the design. I love the power and the attachments, they all work perfectly. The big problem is the black grip that you hold on to. It&#x27;s made of a high grip type of rubber that does make it very easy to hold, but your trimmed hairs will stick to it. You can not just wipe them off or brush them off, you have to use a wet towel to clean it. To me this is a very bad design and I can&#x27;t believe it made it through testing without people complaining about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it an overall score of 3 stars, 5 for trimmer functionality, and 1 for handle design.</li>
            <li> I have always had a cheap trimmer. My wife told me I should buy a quality trimmer I could keep for a long time. Her mother is a hair stylist and recommended this brand. It has been by far the best trimmer I have ever owned. I strongly recommend it to anyone who is willing to invest a little more in a quality product that performs well and will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> Way more options and attachments that I should ever need, but once I found the right settings it works great. Nice size and good trimming capabilities. But be careful not to shave when you aren&#x27;t awake yet ... may result in divots that take a few days to grow back!</li>
            <li> After a year or so the battery wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge AND using it while it&#x27;s plugged in doesn&#x27;t help.    So far I&#x27;ve been unable to find a replacement battery.  I haven&#x27;t managed to get it apart yet either.  Looks like rolling the silicone sleeve over itself and off the back may allow you to get to a place where you can pop some plastic clips to open it up.    Maybe I can find a battery model number so I can order one for replacement.    Looks like planned obsolescence...</li>
            <li> Product stopped working after four uses.  Would not turn on, tried every outlet in the house, piece of junk.  Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> not as good as the norelco but a good buy nonetheless... a little rough sometimes</li>
            <li> Bought this because we had a WAHL years ago and it served us (and our dog) well. PROS: I liked the idea of its light weight due to a lithium battery.  That part is great.  It also gives a fairly decent haircut.  CONS: #1 My husband tried the shaver and was disappointed.  His Norelco is far superior.  #2 We didn&#x27;t need all 17 attachments for beard, mustache, nose or a face shaver, but they don&#x27;t sell a lithium battery one for just hair cuts. So we had to purchase the whole kit and caboddle!  #3 It is awkward to change the heads; you have to line them up just right. I fear that a piece of the plastic holder will snap off easily. #4 Having had a sliding comb attachment on our former Panasonic shaver, it is a pain to have to change the combs and there is nothing to catch the hair, so it makes a big mess. #5 The packaging is terrible - light, flimsy and cheap! #6 There is no good way to store it - the \\&quot;holder\\&quot; (shown) is worthless and putting it back in its original box is difficult.  And finally, #7 there is no pouch you can use to transport it to the office or on vacation. Sorry WAHL, you&#x27;ll have to go back to the drawing board! And keep it simple! More is not better.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works great, but there are so many attachments, one needs a file system to keep track of them.  I&#x27;m not sure of the necessity, but then that&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> I specifically wanted to get a Lithium Ion Beard Trimmer because I was frustrated with my Ni-Cad trimmer which could not hold a charge any longer.  Within two days I had to recharge it.  This was the only Lithium Ion beard trimmer I found.  I had a Lithium Ion shaver and the battery life on it was great.   Often did not need to take the recharger cord with me on week long trips.   I have had this trimmer for a little over a month and I have not recharged it since the initial charge.  There are a lot of attachments if you are just looking for a facial hair trimmer.   The trimmer is geared towards trimming up or shaving hair anywhere on the body.  If I were to downgrade it anywhere it is on the noise hair trimmer.   Works ok but my previous trimmer was better in this regard.   I saw a few comments that changing the heads is hard but I have not found that to be the case.  They come off easily and as you long as you align the head correctly it goes back on quickly also.   After doing it a couple of times should not have any issue.    Hats off to Wahl for developing the first Lithium Ion Trimmer.  While it is slightly more pricey than the Ni-Cad versions it is well worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Very loud compared to other razors.  The blades were not sharp enough.  Ended up buying a different cordless razor.</li>
            <li> Very good clipper. Great battery life. Good accessories.  Useful Hair sticks to the rubber grip though.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Battery last pretty long.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer for trimming and shaping purposes. The blades are sharp and do their job. I found that the only useful attachments are the blades and not really the shaver attachment. All in all, it&#x27;s a solid trimmer for the price.</li>
            <li> Crazy deal. In just 2 uses, it paid for itself. As I have less hair than most, and pay the same.. it made me think how costly it was just getting hair trimmed after waiting for 30 minutes and then tipping the guy for 4 minutes work. It also works for the dog, trims his ear&#x27;s pretty nice.</li>
            <li> Was great while it worked. Unfortunately it died on me after only about a month or so of moderate use.</li>
            <li> Not bad....the screen attachment, the wide cutter &amp; the narrow cutter are often used in my household.</li>
            <li> The Wahl All In One Trimmer, has worked out just fine for me. Best price I could find was at Amazon  I use it for trimming the feet on 2 long haired dogs.  Also for trimming around the face and eye&#x27;s on the dogs.  It seems to hold the charge longer than any battery operated clippers I&#x27;ve used before.  Also no electrical cord to worry about.  I found it a great investment for the money, and I&#x27;m 100% plus glad I purchased it.                                      Capt&#x27;n   Tony</li>
            <li> Bought as a Christmas gift for my nephew.  I like the Wahl brand so I hope it lasts a long time for him.  Looks to be well made, and he&#x27;ll make use of all the attachments!</li>
            <li> Edit from initial review which follows;&lt;br /&gt;After about 1 years use I find the charge life is no-where near what was advertised.  In addition, the switch seems a bit fiddly.  Battery/motor power can sound really week but slight pressure on the switch toward off suddenly makes it sound as full power.  Should take advantage of the 5 yr warranty and see what happens?  Unit cuts and trims well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initial review follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Impressive power and no pain trimming....unlike past trimmers I&#x27;ve owned.  Worth every cent of the higher cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;. US company (although mfg overseas)&lt;br /&gt;. tons of power&lt;br /&gt;. unbelievable charge life (travel with no charger)&lt;br /&gt;. short and shorter charge times (5min/1hr)&lt;br /&gt;. 5 yr warranty&lt;br /&gt;. 30 day return available&lt;br /&gt;. spare parts available&lt;br /&gt;. trimming with absolutely no \\&quot;pull\\&quot; or pain&lt;br /&gt;. hair cutting capability in addition to facial trims&lt;br /&gt;. shaver head actually works for a pretty good shave where needed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;. the usual collection of heads and combs clutter</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this in February and it only lasted for 2 months.  Not really sure why it stopped working.  Stay away from WAHL.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using my new Wahl shaver/beard trimmer. The battery life is excellent, and it is perfect for beard trimming. The guides that come with it are not as precise as I expected, but they get the job done.</li>
            <li> Trimmer charges quickly and is powerful.  Does a good job on trimming beards etc.  Only drawback is the rubber like grips that attract hair that sticks and is  almost impossible to get rid of.  A smooth surface would solve this problem.</li>
            <li> This is a great little trimmer. I use it to keep my head trimmed close and it worked great. The lithium battery is a great plus.It runs faster and longer than the older model I had for 10 years before the battery gave out.  I like the variety of trimmer heads.</li>
            <li> I owned a barbershop at on time and thought all Wahl brand products were great.This item doesn&#x27;t quite measure up.It has all the accessories that make it look good,but as far as cutting perfomance,it doesn&#x27;t cut it.It pretty much rattles and vibrates but not much cutting.    I&#x27;ll give it away to somebody.</li>
            <li> I bought this above all the rest because of the Lithium Ion battery. I know they work great in my laptop, camera, and cellphone so I thought \\&quot;why not my trimmer?\\&quot;  The battery worked well for 3 months, and then crapped out. May be because the battery drains if you unplug the adapter from the wall but leave it plugged into the trimmer. If you live with mom/wife/roommate, they will destroy your trimmer battery by ONLY unplugging it from the wall in the bathroom and not unplugging it at the shaver.  Save your money and buy a corded trimmer.</li>
            <li> I would give it ZERO stars if it let me. I bought this trimmer and was very disappointed. It NEVER held its charge and would always die after 2 minutes of use. When you call Wahl they say sorry not our fault you must have done something wrong. Not on a new product. NEVER EVER BUY A WAHL!</li>
            <li> It keeps my beard trimmed and my nose/ear hair under control. I have been using it daily for a couple of months with no issues. Will it last for a year or more? Maybe. But for the price I am pleased.</li>
            <li> Good trimmer with very long battery life. The variable length attachment and other single length attachments are extremely cheap. The three individual length (black plastic) guides all cut at the same very short length. I had to regrow my goatee as a result of using them (the longest one cuts the length of stubble). The adjustable length guide changes settings due to the slightest amount of pressure while using. Keep shopping - there are several other trimmers under $20 that are better than this one.</li>
            <li> high quality trimmer with tons of attachments. it keeps me from looking like a homeless person or maybe a mountain man. it holds a charge for quite awhile and i really only need to plug it in every six or seven uses. my wife&#x27;s a stylist and uses this in the salon and has been for years without issue.  well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I will try and keep this VERY simple and relatively short.  I have extremely coarse hair all over my entire body. I have been trimming it since I was young. My hair notoriously kills trimmers and razors of all kinds.  I have purchased and replaced EVERY supposed quality BODY GROOMER and rechargeable trimmer available for years. They have all burned out, failed, ALWAYS DULLED or had eventual battery problems.  Do NOT buy into \\&quot;super strong titanium coated blades\\&quot; \\&quot;blades that never need oiling\\&quot; and any other claim from trimmers with standard batteries and CHEAP blades that WILL fail and need to be replaced.  WAHL is making the BEST and most POWERFUL rechargeable all in one groomer you will ever find to date. I have never been able to trim all my body hair at once EVER simply because a standard charge is 30-50 mins.   You will lose power and have to charge for 8-12 hours. This is inconvenient and weak. This trimmer has a ONE HOUR CHARGE, a quick charge function and keeps its power full on for 3 HOURS!  The blades are extremely high quality and it powers through any hair type without choking ever. The competition simply has not lived up to this trimmer/shaver/all in one. DO NOT PAY MORE, DON&#x27;T LET THE PACKAGING HYPE FOOL YOU.  POWERFUL, ULTRA FAST CHARGING, PLENTY OF TRIMMER LENGTHS, SHAVER FOILS etc, NEVER NICKED ME ONCE...(always don&#x27;t use too much pressure, be careful), MADE IN THE USA.    LOOK NO FURTHER, BUY IT, and stop paying more and getting absolute crap from PHILLIPS, NORELCO, REMINGTON, etc.  If this trimmer can deal with my whole body in one charge...it can handle anyones.</li>
            <li> I purchased this battery powered hair trimmer after reading the specs. It arrived quickly and it performs just as advertized. Very powerful, versitale, and holds charge for a very long time.</li>
            <li> This is the best groomer out there, I have used the conaire and the phillips norelcos for years.  The conaire I thought was very underpowered for the beard trimmer and would require many passes to get an even cut.  The Norelco groomers were much better but I had issues with the trimming guide, the plastic norelco used on the guides easily broke.  The Wahl not only has great battery life, but an amazingly powerful motor that allows for even cutting with only one or two passes of the beard.  I highly recommend this product if you are looking for a good beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> Pretty good shaver. Still using it.</li>
            <li> purchased this unit as xmas gift for my son who loved it til it died inexplicably 7 months later. he liked the unit enough to want to purchase another but for $30 (albeit a good price!) i would expect it to last a little longer than 7 months which is why i (initially) gave the 3 star rating (have calld &amp; emaild wahl &amp; will update this review if i get a positive response fr them). noted several other similar complaints in amazon reviews (read on!!!!)  -------------------  just heard back from wahl (&lt;1 day later) &amp; they will repair if i mail back! wow!!!!  didnt expect that much less this quickly. will actually buy a product for myself after that kind of a response. receommend highly!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My original title for this review was:  \\&quot;OK if you consider $40 reasonable for a disposable razor!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I have since updated from 2 to 4 stars after the update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very disappointed with this razor. I have only owned it for about 3 months and its pretty much worthless now. The razor worked OK while it was operational, but OK is all I can say. I didn&#x27;t notice anything special to justify the price which was roughly 3X the amount of other units. I have NEVER had good luck when it comes to these types of razors. I wear a medium stubble trimmed beard which I trim maybe once a week, sometimes every other week. For some reason, these type of razors always die within a matter of months. After reading lots of positive reviews and using the 5yr warranty as a feel good reinforcement, I decided to give the Lithium Ion a try, even with the high price tag, I figured \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot;. I was wrong. Like I said previously, the unit worked OK for about 3 months (used it 10-20 times MAX). The razor ran on the initial charge that entire time which surprised and pleased me. The problem came when the battery finally died (it just shut off in the middle of the shave, it doesn&#x27;t have an indicator light). I recharged it for a few hours only to unplug it and find it still dead! I plugged it in again for a few hours and still nothing. I then turned it on while plugged in, then unplugged it. It was like jump starting a car! It worked, but only for a few seconds. I plugged it in again and turned it on and it died again in a few seconds, this time while still plugged in. So it appears if the battery has any issues at all, the unit is useless. I moved a month ago and I threw away the box so I&#x27;m not even going to bother seeking a replacement from Wahl. I consider it a lesson learned and forty dollars down the drain. I just bought the Remington All-In-1 for fifteen dollars and I&#x27;m going to give that a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update  3-22-12&lt;br /&gt;About 3 months after I wrote the initial review I decided to pull this trimmer out of the draw to throw it away. I tried to turn it on out of curiosity and sure it enough it worked! There must have been a short circuit or something because the unit has worked fine ever since. I have even recharged it and that didn&#x27;t kill it again so I&#x27;m happy. I initially replaced this with the previously mentioned Remington (which wasn&#x27;t very good). In comparing the two, the Wahl has a MUCH stronger motor and solid feel. The attachments are more accurate as well. I really wish they put some sort of charging indicator light on this but I&#x27;ll live. I originally didn&#x27;t think this was built any better than competing products but after more time I was proven wrong. I think this is definitely worth more $ so long as it stays alive!</li>
            <li> Got this for my bf for christmas, im sure he will like it alot better than what he has now, its just one setting and with this new one he will have more options</li>
            <li> This trimmer definitely does what it&#x27;s intended to do, although a bit sparatically. Missed hairs on a regular basis but is very powerful and it makes for a quick trim, just requires a few extra passes than expected. The attachments are functionable, and provide a very close trim, the precision trimmer is quite impressive but heats up a little bit after prolonged use, be hasty with the nose hairs. The shaving foil leaves a little bit to be desired, especially if your facial hair grows in multiple directions. Very sleek and contemporary design makes it visually pleasing, the rubberized gripping is a nice touch. Trying to make all the accesories fit in the tiny tray that is supplied can be frustrating at times. . . But definitely not a dealbreaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a quality product for the price paid. Thanks for the great deal!</li>
            <li> At first, I used to have to keep my old cordless trimmer on the charger anytime i wasn&#x27;t using it.  Eventually, my old cordless basically became corded.  The Wahl LiIon is amazing.  I probably shave my head every 2 weeks and my beard once a week and I charge my Wahl probably once every 2-3 months.  It&#x27;s the greatest thing ever.  The shaver attachment is useless on my face, YMMV but the beard and hair trimmers are perfect.    Word of warning, the #1 blade is definitely shorter than any other #1 i&#x27;ve used.  If other #1&#x27;s are 1/8\\&quot; this thing is like 1/12\\&quot; or something.  It&#x27;s noticeably shorter by about 4 days growth.  What sucks is the #2 is, instead of 1/4\\&quot; somewhere between a normal #1 and #2.  So consider the #1 more like #.75 and the #2 more like a #1.5.  I wish this was adjustable but I&#x27;ve gotten used to the super close #1 and it&#x27;s fine I guess.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as replacement for an old failing electric hair clipper. It does a good job on hair trimming, since my hair is quite short, but the shaving is not so good with the foil attachment.  I do like the fact that it has a lot of attachments, and the LI-Ion battery holds a decent charge (about a week with daily use.  Considering it cost just over 30 bucks it is a good deal, and it travels well.</li>
            <li> got this for my husband as a gift..he loves it. says the blades are great and so is the charge. very nice!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had maybe a dozen personal trimmers over the years, and for the price, this is by far the best - well-made, powerful motor, long-lasting battery, and every kind of useful attachment you&#x27;ll possibly need.  I really don&#x27;t know what some of these other reviewers are talking about - either they have little experience with these types of trimmers, or have unreasonably high expectations.  Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> When it runs, it works fine. But ... less than a year of once-a-week use, the rechargeable battery didn&#x27;t hold much of a charge.   WORSE yet, the trimmer doesn&#x27;t run off A/C power.  It&#x27;s just as convenient for me to leave it plugged in, but it only runs off the battery.  And the battery begins to peter out after 30 seconds, too slow to use after one minute, and completely without power at 1½ minutes!  Very disappointing as I have owned and used other Wahl trimmers that worked fine for several years.</li>
            <li> This product sucks. It was great for 2-3 months. After simple cleaning and taking care of it, it just stopped working.   I never submerged in water or dropped the trimmer. When it worked it was great. Then it just stopped working. It started and then shut off ever two seconds. Then it just wouldn&#x27;t turn on.  It gives a good trim, but on durability, I give it a ONE star. I won&#x27;t buy this brand again. It doesn&#x27;t last and was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> All in all a good buy, comes with a micro screen for shaving but don&#x27;t expect a close clean shave, good for travel, small lightweight, good trimmer, lots of attachments.</li>
            <li> We just recently tried the Wahl trimmer. It is very easy to use and so much better without a cord. Since there are so many variables, I&#x27;m still getting used to which attachment works best but that will just need some using to find which I like best. The charger was also very quick and ready to use. Think we have a winner.</li>
            <li> I was excited when I first got this, as it seemed to be everything I needed in a beard trimmer. However, within a few weeks the finish wore off, and it looks like it is ten years old already (actually it is 5 months old). However, the battery, which was wonderful at first, will not keep a charge long enough for me to trim my beard! I keep it clean, oil after every use (after I blow it off with the air compressor-I really do this, my wife thinks I&#x27;m nuts) and am anal about caring for all my tools and devices.  After a full charge (overnight) it will run about 2-3 minutes, maybe. And I can&#x27;t find a replacement battery anywhere! I&#x27;d be better off with a plug-in model, but they don&#x27;t seem to exist in this convenient size. (Who uses this where there is no outlet handy?)  Like most products these days, this is a marketing gizmo that is over-hyped and actually a piece of crap. I&#x27;m extremely disappointed. But all the other brands are worse....so what do I do?  Well-at the suggestion of a battery vendor, I contacted Wahl via email, and wonder of wonders, they responded within minutes! They are sending me a replacement, and when I receive it, I am to send the old one back. Outstanding response, and wonderful service. I&#x27;m amazed, but of course, very pleased with Wahl. they&#x27;ve earned my \\&quot;customership\\&quot; back!</li>
            <li> This product seems to be high quality, and has lots of attachments. It&#x27;s everything i need.  Nice product all the way around.</li>
            <li> Received this trimmer as a 2011 Christmas gift.  It stopped working after one month of light use - I only shave about two to three times a week.  Will soon learn how good Wahle&#x27;s customer service is.</li>
            <li> Junk, did not work after 1 month</li>
            <li> This is the second one I have purchased.  I purchased the first one for my son.  He loved it and kept telling me how good it was, so I purchased one for myself.  The two best features, how well it trims and how long the lithium battery lasts.</li>
            <li> This hair trimmer is not quiet what i expected.  It works alright, but every time you wana change the head unit on it you have to unscrew two screws and carefully put the new head on and then screw in two screws.  the screws and holes are not well made and this item is very easy to break.  I dont really recommend it due to inconvenience, because for the price you should be able to easily just pop one head unit off and a new one on.&lt;br /&gt;otherwise, this trimmer loud, which is fine with me, and it definitely cuts hair.</li>
            <li> Seriously how is this allowed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this unit last night from a local store. After a single use the battery is dead. Leaving it on the charger all day is of no use. My 10 year old cheaper Remington still works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes the motor is powerful. The dual foil shaver actually does a good job. But what&#x27;s the point if it breaks after one use?</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE, I don&#x27;t have long facial hair at all &amp; it cut&#x27;s my face every time</li>
            <li> I used to use an electric razor/trimmer made by remington. When it died, I didn&#x27;t want to spend the $100+ on a new razor, so I decided to try this. Right out of the box, I was impressed. It even came charged. This thing works great for a pretty clean shave, or just trimming your goatee,mustache, or sideburns, etc. Now obviously it&#x27;s not as close as a razor and shaving cream, but it&#x27;s as close as any electric razor I&#x27;ve had. Even though this was only $32 for me, compared to my $150 remington, it cuts through the hair probably about 10 times as fast, without snagging,(when properly used,) is easier to clean, and is more solidly built. As long as you aren&#x27;t the type of guy who HAS to shave with a regular razor in order to not have scruff, the Wahl should fit most, if not all of your needs. Just as an example of how powerful it is, let me tell you, if I wanted, I could easily use this thing to shave all the hair off my head, probably in about 2-3 minutes... and I have a very large and bushy head of hair. This product is well worth the money. Saved me from spending at least $70 more, and from the hassle and irritation of old fashioned shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After about 6 months, the battery holds almost no charge, so it must be plugged in for several minutes prior to and during use. This is no problem for me. It still works great and I have no doubt it&#x27;s the best electric for the price by far.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gif tand after two shaves, the cutting head broke.  I called the company and they replaced it promptly and cheerfully.  I have one Wahl product that we have used for 30 years, but this isn&#x27;t as sturdy and reliable.</li>
            <li> second hand fall off .watch dont work</li>
            <li> Great little trimmer - long battery life - lots of accessories.  Good value for the money.  Of all the trimmers I&#x27;ve owned, I like this one the best.</li>
            <li> Okay everyone this is the first time I ever wrote a review on the items I purchase from amazon and I buy a lot of things, so you have to allow me to gush just a little.  This is absolutely the greatest clippers I have ever purchased.  I have purchased several clippers between 1998 and now.  Maybe about 4 or 5 of them, none lasted but one and it was one of those three circle razor deals.  The wahl lithium Ion is simply a great product I never seen anything like it.  I received my clipper on September 11, I charged it over night and used it for the first time the next day.  I didn&#x27;t use it with the charger while I was using it and never put it on the charger again.  During the time it was off the charger I maybe used it 6 times.  I cut my own hair and it takes me about 40 - 45 minutes, this because I also trim my bread. This single charge (and here&#x27;s the amazing part), last exactly 1 month and 7 days, or 5 weeks.  I started to cut my hair on the 19 of October, and the clipper went dead, I charged it for 2 minutes, and finished my hair cut. I never saw anything like this, this product would be a perfect travel companion, many time I&#x27;ve traveled and have to take two different clippers and there chargers and if I don&#x27;t charge them right away, they lose there charge with this product you won&#x27;t have to worry about that. I really love this item.</li>
            <li> Wahl has a reputation for good professional trimmers, but they really dropped the ball on this one due to poor quality accessories.  The advertising brags at length about the battery, and I guess its a good one, and the motor seems high quality, but the blades and guides are junk.  Here are my complaints:  o the blades and guides are frustratingly difficult to change  o the 6 position guide is very difficult to adjust and in the course of doing so the top part of it popped off.  Difficult to put back together.  o I dropped the trimmer blade (about two feet) and it popped apart into three pieces.  Trying to get it back together I bent the spring.  I guess I could have been more successful by unscrewing it and reassembling it, but why am I bothering with this in the first place?  I just want to trim my mustache.  o The plastic base is useless.  o There are too many pieces.  o One of the guides was missing, while the package contained two of the same size.  Sloppy packaging.  I think Wahl should be ashamed to ship one of their motors with cheap plastic accessories that fall apart if you stare at them too hard.  Instead, I bought the Remington MB-200 and the difference is like night and day.  The Remington has only one guide and an easy to use thumb wheel to adjust the length.  Much easier to use  UPDATE:  The battery died after 6 months.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is so good I hardly need my razor anymore.  It cuts through hair like a hot knife through butter.  I got lazy and buzzed a good chunk of my goatee out with it by accident, but that was my fault.  Holds a long charge and runs for a long time, lots of useful tools and attachments.  Strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> So I bought this and a month later it stopped working. It worked great for that one month, but not sure what happened to make it stop working. It runs around 1/4 of the original speed and barely cuts hair at all anymore and when it does cut one it pulls the hair first making it quite a painful ordeal.</li>
            <li> I replaced an older trim unit I&#x27;ve had for 10 years.  I miss the adjustable trim guard that one had, but this unit provides greater on time and more flexibility with the assortment of heads.  The base unit is pretty worthless as far as organizing all parts that it comes with, but it&#x27;s nice not to have to keep this charged in all the time due to the Lithium Ion battery.  I also like the feel in my hand; I appear to have better control.</li>
            <li> The mechanical parts work just fine, but the material on it rusts within a few uses.  Invest in something better.  I don&#x27;t know what that something is yet, but reply to this review if you find it, please.</li>
            <li> Trimmer is what I&#x27;d hoped for.  Battery is exceptionally strong and long lasting.  Trimmer is well made and very useful.</li>
            <li> I have owned many trimmers through out the years and this is by far the best I have come across yet. Solidly built, runs a very long time with a full charge,charges quickly,comes with enough attachements to fit any trimming needs. Fits well in your hand, comfortable to use. I will never buy another brand. This will be my choice from now on.  Great price, great value all around A+</li>
            <li> No nonsense.  Works great.  Lithium battery is wonderful.  Shipped with head misaligned...took 60 seconds to note and fix.</li>
            <li> very nice, but not what I expected.  It&#x27;s great for very fine and very very short hair.  My two boys had about 3 inches of hear that I wanted to shave off, well, this trimmer did not do it! My bad!  Again, great for fine and short hair, great to trime facial hair as well, not good for long and thick hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered this gift for my nephew and didn&#x27;t think it would get there till like after Christmas. Surprisingly he received the gift Christmas eve, that was so nice,very pleased with the order. Especially being so hectic around the holidays for delivery, that was amazing it got there that quickly.</li>
            <li> My husband loved it, worth every penny bought at christmas &amp; yet never had to charge it!!!&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re guy will love it &amp; all the attachments!!! Recommended greatly!!</li>
            <li> I bought this ONE MONTH ago and it works well, very well. It is much better than the garbage trimmer I bought at Marshall&#x27;s for $10 a year ago. But for some reason it didn&#x27;t come with the Stubble trimmer, but came with the other two. The one I needed it didn&#x27;t come with. It is a great all in one trimmer, but the main reason I give it a 3 out of 5 is the fact that it has rusted in 30 days. The regular trimmer has rust all over it and the hair trimmer has rust on it as well. I keep it secured and this never happened to my Remington trimmer I had for two yrs. Really pisses me off b/c it says it has a 5yr warranty but through one month out of the 60 months it says it should last it already is showing signs of wear and tear. I have used the beard trimmer maybe 7 times and it has rust that shows signs of over 50 uses. The hair trimmer I have used twice and looks like it has been used for two months. I think within two months I will have to return it b/c it will be completely worn out due to the rust.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is a good trimmer. But I don&#x27;t want a trimmer that lasts less than 90 days b/c of rust</li>
            <li> Trimmer was only used to trim a short beard and mustache twice a week.  It will no longer charge or even work if left plugged in!  Stand that holds everything is overcrowded and things tend to fall out every time you pick up razor.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  It&#x27;s inexpensive for a very good reason.  Very disappointed in Wahl.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for another beard trimmer that I had used for more than ten years. The Wahl trimmer is great. 2 sizes for cutting head and many attachments make it adept at beards, moustaches, necks and around ears. The lithium battery holds a charge for a very long time.</li>
            <li> This shaver comes with more attachments than I will use. That&#x27;s nice, maybe they&#x27;ll get used sometime. I use only the 1/8\\&quot; stubble guard, detail trimmer and foil shaver. The foil shaver isn&#x27;t a high end electric shaver, but it is more than good enough for me. I can quickly shave and trim my goatee in minutes. It works well for me.</li>
            <li> I dont know what you guys are all positive about ?  This thing is not made with staleness steel and got rusted just after the first wash.</li>
            <li> When it worked it was good but after 3 uses it has not been able to hold a charge.</li>
            <li> the accessories change system its to annoying, you have to unscrew 2 screws each time . . . other then that it works good, not practical though</li>
            <li> It is a good trimmers with lots of options for variety of purposes. Shaver is not good but as far as trimming is concerned, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> So disappointed. I bought this product to replace a Wahl trimmer that I had used for nearly 15 years. It was metal and had great steady power, but needed to be plugged in to work. This was a great idea because it could be cordless. NOPE!!! It was not powerful, slow to charge, intermittent in its operation and finally after only 4 uses died and fell apart! UNBELIEVABLE! The handle is made of some sort of rubberized grip material over the plastic housing. Hair is attracted to the surface and it looks horrible after a few minutes of trimming.&lt;br /&gt;I would give it no stars if I could. What a horrible waste of money!</li>
            <li> First one never worked and was returned. The second one failed after three months. It won&#x27;t turn on even while using cord. Bad design and terrible quality. Going to buy Oster now.</li>
            <li> This is a good trimmer when it was working. I have been using it once or twice a month. After about 5 months, it just died. There is no way to contact manufacturer for warranty service. I will have to take the item to a service center more than 50 miles away. For $32 item, it is not worth it.   Do not buy Wahl products. You will be out of luck if you need service.</li>
            <li> I really had no problem with this trimmer/razor until it just died..quit working. I believed the motor in it has just quit working. No warning....loud noises sluggish cuts...nothing just died. I had only had it for about 2 months.  When it was working it did very well. The battery life was excellent as well. Did notice that the blade did seem to rust pretty quickly, so it had to be cleaned almost daily.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because of charging problems with my current Wahl trimmer that is not lithium powered.  The charge time is great.  The power is unbelievable and I would recommend this trimmer to anyone that has had problems with the current or previous trimmer.  This has answered all my concerns and made me one happy puppy.  Definitely an improvement over past products.  Buy it, it works![[ASIN:B001GQ3GEY Wahl Lithium Ion All In One Trimmer]]</li>
            <li> I bought this device about a year ago because Wahl is a brand of trimmers that I generally trust.  I was disappointed from the start since the product had a cheap feel to it.  The base that everything stands on was useless and I thought the pictures implied that you could just drop the device into the cradle and it would charge.  That is not the case though as you need to plug the cord in manually each time.  Additionally, the cord itself doesn&#x27;t stay attached to the base which I found to be annoying.  The attachments can be difficult to remove.  It would often remove the trimmer piece itself which doesn&#x27;t always snap on easily.  Last but not least, after about a year the device just died on me.  I thought it just needed to be charged but after charging it for an entire day, it still didn&#x27;t work.  I will find a different brand to replace this unit.</li>
            <li> I personally feel the \\&quot;lithium\\&quot; battery was trumped up in terms of creating the impression of charge holding longevity. My former Norelco was a class act when it came to battery life. Days after use, I&#x27;d come back to find it still had enough charge for another round of cutting. And that brings me back to this product. After use, I&#x27;d come back say 3 days later and find that it had completely discharged of all power or did so within minutes of use, and thus needed my plugging into a socket. This was the one and major flaw I found with this product. So, no, I would not recommend this to a friend, &#x27;cept of course you don&#x27;t mind the aforementioned issue I had with it.</li>
            <li> Father&#x27;s Day gift for good ol pops. We took it out of the packaging and was surprised to see that it worked without even needed to charge it for the first time, man this battery must last a long time! My dad loves all the great accessories that came with it and I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;ll be sporting some new cool designs into his white hair or some great new beard designs. Or maybe he&#x27;ll just continue to trim his mustache like he always has, either way I was happy to get him a quality product off Amazon.</li>
            <li> Working great as a trimmer - I&#x27;ve had it a few months and only charged once. Does everything you could ask. The way the different heads snap in is a bit clunky, but it does the job. I could see where fatigue might lead to breakage over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I really need the foil shaver head to work. If you&#x27;re counting on the foil head portion of this shaver for your daily cleanup, look elsewhere. I needed a small foil shaver to keep my \\&quot;face taint\\&quot; clean (taint your mouth and it taint your nose - the area between my mustache and my nose, as I think letting your facial hair merge with your nose hair is disgusting). I ended up buying a second small foil head shaver for that detailed touch up work.</li>
            <li> Maybe my boyfriend and I are just unskilled, but we cannot get the comb attachments to attach and stay on when trying to trim the length of his thick beard.  For trimming the edges of his beard, or hair elsewhere, this is a very nice trimmer.    If you have a beard that you keep trimmed at a short length, this trimmer will probably work.    If you want to use it to keep a thick beard trimmed at a longer length, you will need a trimmer with attachments that do not pop off every time you try to comb through your beard.  If you have a trimmer for a long thick beard you would like to recommend, we would love to know the brand and model!</li>
            <li> When I first saw this product I had high expectations and maybe that&#x27;s my fault, but this product was/is a let down being from Wahl. Currently owning this product for a little over a week and the blades are already rusting even being careful. They barely trim stubble. The handle is also made of a rubberized finish that sucks all of your hair to like a magnet making a HUGE mess.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice trimmer for the price.  Has attachments I&#x27;ll personally never use (maybe) but better to have more than not enough</li>
            <li> After reading all the glowing reviews I decided to give this one a try. I actually didn&#x27;t have to charge it alot since it held it&#x27;s charge for a long time. Over the last two months I noticed I was charging it more since it wouldn&#x27;t even turn on. Today after a full charge it died until I plugged it in. I always trusted Wahl and spent a little more on this one compared to others I found that got the same reviews. I cannot return it so now I have to use it plugged in only or purchase another one.</li>
            <li> Hair sticks to the handle and this hurts when I use it against hair growth.</li>
            <li> (This is an updated review)  My previous comment explained the annoyance of Wahl&#x27;s warranty service. The warranty description sent with the product says to \\&quot;mail your product prepaid\\&quot; and to \\&quot;enclose a check or money order in the amount of $6.50 to cover handling.\\&quot; This would result in around $10 (or 25% of the purchase price) to get it fixed.    Instead, I ignored this and contacted Wahl via their website, and ended up getting the warranty done with no cost to me.    A Wahl representative responded to my original amazon comment stating that my comment (that is, my quotation of product warranty) does not accurately reflect Wahl&#x27;s service. And indeed he&#x27;s right; warranty service worked as it should. So, when in doubt, contact someone, and don&#x27;t follow the written instruction unless you have to.    It&#x27;d be nice if the warranty description that comes with the product was accurate, but given that the instruction booklet that comes with the trimmer is rather generic (describes features of other models as well), I&#x27;m guessing they haven&#x27;t updated that text in a long time.    (As for the product defect, the motor in mine would turn off when i flipped it upside down. Run yours through warranty if you experience the same)</li>
            <li> This is my second Trimmer. and this is much better than the 1st one.&lt;br /&gt;It performs perfectly and has lots of options.</li>
            <li> This is the one you want.  The LI batt is the shizzzazz.  This is my 2nd...the 1st had fallen to the floor about 100 times (don&#x27;t ask).  I re-assembled that one about 20 times.  Arrived next day on Prime.  This does your beard right. Period.</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these 2 years ago that got dropped in a toilet (and fortunately it was clean water)...call me crazy but it still worked another year after being dried out. The only reason I ever replaced it was due to it being knocked off a counter top onto a marble floor (this was about the 5th time in the course of 2 years it took a hard plunge onto the floor); it hit just right and finally broke the head. Otherwise, it was still a great trimmer. The only thing that I think could be improved upon was the sharpness of the \\&quot;self-sharpening\\&quot; blades. They eventually dulled and would pull every now and then if I went to fast. And that little plastic \\&quot;hold all\\&quot; cradle which never holds everything. But over all for the price and battery performance of these trimmers they get a 10.</li>
            <li> I have purchased three of these as gifts. The recipients love them!</li>
            <li> Feels good in the hand. This was purchased to replace an older wahl trimmer, and I wish I had replaced it sooner. This one feels much better in the hand and is easy to maneuver. The blades are sharp, and it seems that this will be a great little work horse.</li>
            <li> It was fantastic while it worked.  I think there&#x27;s something wrong with the battery or the power supply.    Navigating their customer service website is also a nightmare.  I&#x27;m cutting my losses and switching to a different brand.  One that&#x27;s more consumer-focused.</li>
            <li> This personal grooming set has a lot of attachments, but unfortunately, it seems to try to do too much in one little unit.  The hair cutting attachments that come with it are too small to really cut any measurable amount of hair.  I gave my two year old a haircut and even using the longest clipper, it was way shorter than I would have liked (almost a buzz cut).  The shaver attachment did not shave very well the first time I use dit.  The second time was ok, but again, the attachment was so small it would have taken all day to try to shave.    All the attachments come with a tray, but unfortunately there is no real way to organize anything on it, and I think it would be better to just toss everything into a little plastic storage container than to use this tray that came with it.    If you are looking for a personal grooming set, this would probably be ok, but if you&#x27;re looking for an all-in-one trimmer set that you can use for haircutting, you should probably look at something else.</li>
            <li> Right out of the package I was impressed with all of the included blades and attachments. They can be used interchangeably by easily snapping on or off of the main unit. I have never seen a similar product that charged up as quickly as this one did.  I loved the way the lightweight trimmer felt in my hand.  It was easy to hold on to and I was able to easily guide it where I needed it as I was trimming my husband&#x27;s hair.  It was quick and easy to give him a short even cut using the comb attachment.  I was very happy also that after removing the comb I was able to clean up the neckline and remove the little fine neck hairs in a Jiff.  The blade was sharp and cut cleanly and quickly without any skin pinching or nicks. Dave trimmed up his mustache and eyebrows quickly, too.  There is several different beard attachments also included  which we did not test since Dave is clean shaven except for his mustache.  I recommend this trimmer for it&#x27;s ease of use, variety of specialty attachments that snap on and off and for it&#x27;s superb cutting power.</li>
            <li> I have owned for a while. Battery last a long time. I used it at marine combat training. It ran better than everyone&#x27;s electrical ones. I cut many heads on one charge. Never snags on hair or gets caught up. The only thing that doesn&#x27;t work well is the shaver for your face. Hurts pretty bad and doesnt cut well. Besides that, great buy.</li>
            <li> As expected, this doesn&#x27;t have the power of a corded trimmer, but is pretty good for a cordless.  It also has a smaller head than a corded unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This won&#x27;t be replacing my corded Wahl, but it&#x27;s great for a quick touch-up type job.</li>
            <li> Great battery life. Unfortunately the metal pins (for lack of a better word) on the trimmer blade broke off and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for even a year. Shame because I really liked this product.</li>
            <li> The Wahl lithium all-in-one is 4-star clipper... not perfect, but damn good for the price. Read the #1 Most Helpful Customer Review entitled, \\&quot;All In One\\&quot;, but What It Does Well, It Does Very Well\\&quot; By  D. R. Jeanclerc for more info. There&#x27;s nothing I could add to that review.</li>
            <li> This is the best grooming kit my husband has ever owned.  He loves.  I bought it for a Christmas gift.  He liked it to much, I bought my son one also.  The battery stays charged for a VERY long time!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how much better this trimmer is compared to the NiCad Wahl version.  It charges fast, and works great.  Only wish it had an attachment that gave a length between the 1 and 2 levels.</li>
            <li> Good for 5 years. This is my second on. Holds charge forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes with too much junk -- inflates the price for cheapo plastic &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works well though!</li>
            <li> When I purchased this, I was concerned if it would be good enough to shave my head, which I do frequently. I am pleased to report that as a head shaver/trimmer it is amazing and probably better than my corded Wahl I have had for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beard and other trimmer shaver attachments work great as well. For the price, you can&#x27;t beat this little trimmer, and it charges fast! I just bought this so I cant say how long the charge lasts, but maybe I can update this review soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need a cordless powerhorse trimmer, this one is for you!</li>
            <li> Update:  Wahl replaced under warranty without receipt and I received an entirely new set which is still going strong.  Made a mistake of buying another Braun due to loving their regular electric shavers but it paled in comparison to this ones battery life and powerful motor.  Added back 2 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchased this trimmer 2 years ago and after a year and a half of great use it has become dull and no longer holds a charge have to charge for an hour and keep plugged in to shave my face and then I am lucky if it finishes without dieing.  Contacted Wahl and they will fix or replace under warrenty but I of course have to pay shipping will see how much that will cost.  Added star for this.</li>
            <li> I was using this product the other day and decided I just had to take some time to rave about it.  I bought it more than a year ago to replace two different razor sets. I use it to trim my husband&#x27;s sideburns, ears, neck and chest hair. I can&#x27;t say enough about how wonderful this set is compared to others I&#x27;ve used in the past. The razor is always roaring with energy and gives a close shave of the neck. The smaller razor attachment is great for the ears and will fit a little inside the ear. The attachment we use to do chest and body hair (we use the 3/8\\&quot; one) just glides through the hair with no pulling. After putting up with other lousy models, we feel we now have a \\&quot;Cadillac.\\&quot; I don&#x27;t see how anyone can go wrong with this razor -- I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works great and the close shaver gets surprisingly close. It does rust easy and collects hair on the handle as you shave. All in all its a great cheep trimmer.</li>
            <li> Great Mustache trimmer. I have tried just about every manufactures trimmer and this one by far is the best. Good value too!</li>
            <li> The clippers are nice but the kit came with a bunch of attachments that I didn&#x27;t need.  I would rather buy the clippers with the basic guards rather pay for stuff I will never use.</li>
            <li> Really cheap stuff but works very well.&lt;br /&gt;Some of the tools are useless and it stains after a while. Hard to clean and maintain.&lt;br /&gt;Battery lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Invest in something better.</li>
            <li> This item had alot of great reviews, so I decided to get it.  I was really impressed with the power.  It cuts close with plenty of power.  Doesn&#x27;t take alot of time (few minutes) to recharge also.  I guess the only thing that is a bummer is that if you have a rough face or scars, it tends to dig into your face.  To fix that, make sure you lay it flat when trimming.  Besides that, it is great.  Oh, the only other thing is that it has a lot of attachments.  Don&#x27;t think that I&#x27;ll use all 17, but who knows.</li>
            <li> I ordered this trimmer after some bad battery experiences with Conair trimmers in the past.  The battery and motor are in fact higher powered than the ones on the trimmers I&#x27;d used before and it felt good to know I wouldn&#x27;t run out of charge in the middle of a trim.  But I returned this trimmer after only a couple days for one annoying and seemingly trivial reason - without a guard, the blades cut very, very close.  But with the #1 beard guard, they cut almost nothing off my goatee with 3 days worth of growth on it.  I&#x27;ve used a #1 guard on my beard for several years and this one is simply too deep.  I tried using it without the guard and it looked like I was trying to trim off my beard entirely.  With the guard, I&#x27;d have to trim my beard daily and even then it would still be too long.    Other trimmers have adjustable blade depth without using a guard and I measured that my previous trimmer had a #1 guard that was much shallower. Overall this is a powerful trimmer with sharp blades and nice construction, loaded down with attachments that either don&#x27;t work properly or add very little value.  The tray for the attachments is huge (as others here have noted) and would take up too much space on my countertop, too.  The non-slip grip surface of the handle is also a dust and lint magnet.  But I&#x27;m disappointed because the trimmer is clearly well made - I just wish I could put a guard on it that was the right depth for my needs.</li>
            <li> This product is great! The multiple heads offer great flexibility for trimming and close shaving. I&#x27;ve used various trimmer types but this is the best of them all. I&#x27;ve recommended it to my male family members.</li>
            <li> great : battery life. it&#x27;s been out of the charger for a month and it still works everytime i shave.    bad : the foil shaver accessory is really bad. it takes forever to do and yet it leaves stubbles. don&#x27;t but it if you really need the foil shaver part.    bad : 110v only. As a frequent traveler i wish it was 220v compatible as well.    overall excellent product save for the foil shaver accessory.</li>
            <li> Had this product NOT quit working w/o explanation after 75 days of ownership / 50 days of use.....I would be giving it a 5 star rating.  Powerful motor that provides a great tight clip for beard and scalp.  I prefer not to shave my head clean with a blade....I like using a disposable every other / every 3rd day to cut it nice and tight with a little stubble.  I also keep facial hair and trim on the same time frame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon customer service is excellent....shipping the old unit back and won&#x27;t hesitate to grab another in hopes that this isn&#x27;t a product design issue instead of a single janky unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, I don&#x27;t like my defective unit....because it quit....but when it works....it is my favorite rechargeable unit.</li>
            <li> Come on people, really complaining that they give you too much?  Like you didn&#x27;t read the description and see that it had all that?  Seriously?  If you had a tool box in the garage would you rather it have one tool in it or twenty?  It&#x27;s just funny you guys complain about stuff that helps the consumer.  Just because I only use one attachment 90% of the time doesn&#x27;t mean the others wont come in handy once in a while.  It&#x27;s advertised as \\&quot;All in One\\&quot; and clearly has lots of options....might as well buy a brand new black car then complain that it&#x27;s black!&lt;br /&gt;LOL</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for a couple of years and it still cuts fast and the blades are sharp. Lithium batteries are the way to go.</li>
            <li> Great beard trimmer and even does a pretty close shave.  Seems durable and well made.  I now have two and hope they will last longer than the crappy conair thing I used to use.  Haven&#x27;t really used the other attachments yet, but hope they will be useful and as well made.</li>
            <li> This trimmer and its accessories will trim all beards, mustaches, brows, and other body hair. Additionally, if one&#x27;s hair is thin and sparse (as mine is), the trimmer will do one&#x27;s complete head. I did mine in fifteen minutes, going from safer to shorter in two passes.    A PERSPECTIVE: Concerning the comments of those who choose to nitpick what they perceive as shortcomings -- perhaps the comments of those who shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to own mechanical devices of any kind -- this is my take on that criticism. VALUE: There are very few better bargains in the world than the 32 bucks one will pay for this comprehensive grooming kit. NOISE: The unit is not noisy unless compared to dead silence. HEAT: Eventually, after many minutes of use, some of the cutters will become warm. Perhaps even perceptibly to those of particularly delicate sensibilities. CUTTING HEADS: All of the heads perform their respective functions for which they were designed. QUALITY: The power unit is outstanding. The heads and the various cutting guides attach easily and precisely.    A RECOMMENDATION: Spend the 32 bucks for the trimmer and enjoy hands-on personal grooming. --Ron    UPDATE 07-12-2011: WHOA, THERE! LET ME SAVE YOU SOME MONEY. If you go bald on top or wear a buzz cut, don&#x27;t spend the bucks for a larger, more powerful clipper. I did, along with 10 clipper combs, and I don&#x27;t use the larger clipper at all. I&#x27;ll hold on to it, however, maybe someday I&#x27;ll have a dog. The Wahl All In One Trimmer will handle your buzz cut and your beard trimming. A foil shaver for my head and neck and the All In One for beard, eyebrows, nose, and ears are keeping me neatly trimmed. --Ron</li>
            <li> Comes with more stuff than I needed. Almost too many parts and pieces. But it works great. It is so much better than the cheaper consumer brands I have owned, such as Conair and Panasonic.  They were fine for awhile, but got plugged and dull no matter what you tried to do to clean. This is a quality piece of kit.</li>
            <li> This has great battery life as well as all the attachment you could need.  It cuts well and looks good.  If you need different heads, this is the trimmer to buy.</li>
            <li> This trimmer will cut you. It is too aggressive to use without a comb attachment. Even with a comb it will still cut you if there is ANY slack in the skin being trimmed over. This trimmer was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> our other one wore out so we bought this one after 5 yrs. not sorry at all. very powerful and quiet. We both can use this one!!</li>
            <li> This the best little trimmer you could ask for. It does everything from cutting your hair to trimming your beard.</li>
            <li> well work the money works perfectly</li>
            <li> gets used everyday and is always ready when called upon - just the right accessories were included with this purchase</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve bought this trimmer four times in the past 3-4 years. I use it to shave my facial hair because I burn through razors after 3-4 uses. I cannot find a trimmer that does a better job.</li>
            <li> The trimmer worked great while it worked. With all the attachments that come with this you will find the piece that does your beard the way you want it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it completely died after about the third month I had it. Also the blades were rusting even though I took good care of them. It has since been replaced. I wouldn&#x27;t get a Wahl trimmer again, even if this was a defect.</li>
            <li> best mechine ever that i use ,stronge and yet gentle, i 100% suticfied ,i love it,recomend to everybody .eyal shazar eyalman64@gmail.com&lt;br /&gt;the only problem that i have i lost the charger but the mechine is the best</li>
            <li> The li-on battery is a great feature on this trimmer, as it lasts for a long time and charges quickly. Otherwise this product is a bit sub-par. I use the trimmer exclusively to maintain my beard, which I keep short and neat yet longer than stubble. The \\&quot;adjustable\\&quot; trimmer guard is a nightmare and extremely difficult to both adjust and remove for cleaning. The model includes a few fixed length guards as well, of which I use the middle size instead. It serves well enough, but it&#x27;s not the exact length I would like, and even this fixed attachment is still more difficult to remove and replace than other attachments I have used with cheaper trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rubberized grip attracts hair trimmings like a magnet, which then stick and do not brush off easily. A wet washcloth does wipe them off, but what a pain! There&#x27;s no need for a sticky rubber grip on a trimmer, and it&#x27;s not even that comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worst of all, I occasionally feel the trimmer pull one of my hairs rather than clip it. It&#x27;s not so painful but it&#x27;s certainly uncomfortable, and I would expect better from a product in this price range. My last trimmer never pulled hairs, and it cost half as much. This is a rare problem, but there&#x27;s really no excuse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The excellent battery combined with the $40 I&#x27;ve spent keeps me using this trimmer, but I&#x27;ll happily abandon it in the future for a better li-on model should one become available.</li>
            <li> On time.  As expected.  Would recommend.  Would order again.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent item and a handy one to have. It stays charged for a long time and is always ready when you need it.</li>
            <li> Best beard trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used. Heads are sharp, easily changed and perform wonderfully. I&#x27;ve even been able to use this for (short) hair cuts. Feels good in your hand, well balanced and sturdy, not like a cheap, plastic contraption like so many others I&#x27;ve used. Great product.</li>
            <li> This is an incredible trimmer.  Powerful, with many attachments.  If you need to trim something, this can definitely do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside to this flexibility is the box of replacement heads, combs, and shavers that come along with it.  I&#x27;m not even sure which attachment to use, as the single page of tiny instructions doesn&#x27;t identify them.  At first, I thought it was really cool to have all these options, but now I&#x27;m just wondering if they couldn&#x27;t have narrowed it down by using a smaller number of more adjustable items.  Plus, I&#x27;m not sure where I&#x27;m going to keep all of them, as there isn&#x27;t a container or case provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m only going to take off one star for this because I believe most users will settle on a single head, and a single comb, and put all the other attachments in a ziplock bag in their closet.  At that point, you are left with a clipper that is very powerful, does exactly what you need it to do, and doesn&#x27;t require a cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-  Powerful.  More powerful than the plug-in versions from other manufacturers.&lt;br /&gt;-  Very good at cutting the hairs without pulling them.&lt;br /&gt;-  Can get as close a cut as you need, all the way down to a shave (a shaver head is included).&lt;br /&gt;-  Lightweight, but sturdy.  Easy to hold and maneuver.  Feels very professional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-  Too many attachments&lt;br /&gt;-  Instructions do not cover the purpose of most of the attachments.&lt;br /&gt;-  Default head is very narrow (though it comes with wider ones).&lt;br /&gt;-  Not washable or waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;-  No case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sean P. Logue, 2008</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer for my nephew for last Christmas.  This fall, 2013, he survived an F4 tornado by getting to the basement of his house in the nick of time. From where he was in the basement, he could suddenly see daylight where the home&#x27;s bathroom had been only seconds before.  His Wahl trimmer had disappeared along with the bathroom.  The first thing he asked me was, &amp;#34;You know that trimmer you got me last year for Christmas? Can you get me another one? I loved that thing! It held a charge forever!  So, this year for Christmas, he got another one.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start right into it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;^+++ Pros +++^&lt;br /&gt;+ Compact size (diameter is between a C and D sized battery)&lt;br /&gt;+ Excellent power&lt;br /&gt;+ Comes with 4 Blade options; Trimmer, Detailer, Dual-Shaver and Clipper&lt;br /&gt;+ Comes with 7 Blade Guides: Facial Hair, Ear, Nose &amp; Brow, Sideburns, Neckline, Body Grooming and Hair Cut...One of them being a 6-position trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;+ Easy Pop in/out design for the Blades&lt;br /&gt;+ Comes with a well thought out tray for holding everything (including the little oil bottle that comes with it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;^--- Cons ---^&lt;br /&gt;- No charge indicator...Not really a big deal, considering it&#x27;s got a 1-minute quick charge ability.&lt;br /&gt;- The Tray is great for holding all the blades and accessories, but the Shaver itself sits a bit loose and the charge wire doesn&#x27;t stay in place well (if you wanted to keep it on the tray).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;^** Thoughts &amp; Opinions&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a goatee for going on 15 years now, so I&#x27;ve been through my fair share of trimmers/detailers. My most recent trimmer (before getting this Wahl) is the Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum. I love it, the capable vacuum alone makes it great but it also plows through my copperwire-like face hair with ease and has a built-in multi-position trimmer. It&#x27;s great for what it does as a trimmer, but woefully deficient as a detailer (hence wanting this Wahl with all the options).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Wahl, on the other hand, is also quite the capable beast but where the T980 is really only good as a Trimmer, the Wahl tries to be a little of everything and in my opinion fairly well succeeds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The high-torque motor partnered with LiOn power is a great combo. I use an electric shaver (Braun 7680) for day-to-day and the Wahl every few days for the goatee. The high-torque means a fast and accurate trim (lesser trimmers you have to keep running over the same area over and over) and the LiOn means I don&#x27;t have to worry if I&#x27;ve got enough charge left to get a good trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit that I really appreciate the shaver/blade/accessories tray that comes with this Wahl. I was always losing bit and pieces from other trimmers, but with this tray I can keep everything together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Powerful, long lasting charge, lots of clipping/trimming/detailing options and a tray to keep all the parts together...This is a nice set, I certainly recommend it.with this Wahl.

            <li> We have owned several of this type of trimmer over the years, and this one falls somewhere in the middle of the pack. While we liked that Wahl is still a family-owned company, and the shaver was made in the US, the quality feels a little cheap for the price. Lightweight plastic components don&#x27;t say \\&quot;long-lasting quality\\&quot; to me. The method of attachment is awkward, with attachments held on by stiff plastic clips which I don&#x27;t believe will last particularly long if used often. It takes quite a bit of force to snap them on; making me feel pretty sure they will snap off at some point before I&#x27;m ready to be done using this product. The shaver does, however, hold a charge remarkably well, which is its main selling point. It comes with every conceivable attachment, making it versatile for any use you can think of. And it does what it claims to do: it trims and shaves hair admirably. The motor seems to have significantly more power than its predecessor at our house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: it works and works well, but I don&#x27;t see it having the durability to hold up to long term use. Higher quality materials would have made this a 5 star product.</li>
            <li> The standard against which a multiple use product like this is to be measured is NOT whether it is the best performing product at each task, but rather whether it performs well enough to replace two or more items in your bathroom or more importantly in your carry on luggage.  As a habitually clean-shaven man, I might seem a poor choice to review such a product, but a fortuitously timed job layoff has allowed me to grow a beard in order to fully test the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BATTERY: This is the major selling point; I fully charged it when I received it and have been using it off and on over the last two months ON THE VERY FIRST CHARGE, and it is still going strong!  There is no other rechargeable battery technology I&#x27;m aware of that could even approach, much less match that performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SHAVER HEAD: As a blade shaver whose weapon of choice is the [[ASIN:B000XVXK12 Gillette Fusion Power Phenom Razor]], I have always believed that electric razors are for men who don&#x27;t really insist on a close shave (or less facetiously for men whose lifestyle requires shaving on-the-go).  Nothing about the performance of this trimmer&#x27;s shaver head has changed my mind, and for shaving the entire face it is clearly inferior to the [[ASIN:B001FA1F8K Braun Series 1 1-150 Men&#x27;s Shaver]] I have also been testing.  However, in fairness, it was never really intended for this purpose.  No man in his right mind would choose such a product unless he was planning to at least experiment with facial hair, and for the purpose of shaving those parts of your face not covered by your beard or mustache, it is quite adequate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DETAIL HEAD: For delicate work, like separating that unibrow into two separate eyebrows, the detail head works fine, though perhaps because of the small size of its face plate, it becomes uncomfortably warm during sustained use.  However, as a nose hair or ear hair trimmer, it is clearly inferior to any with rotary heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TRIMMER HEAD: The main trimmer head comes with far too many attachments IMHO, and I don&#x27;t say that just because in mine all of the plastic attachments displayed in the box window were duplicated inside.  Unless you are planning a career as a traveling beard stylist, a six-position trimmer guide and 3 fixed-length attachment combs is probably going to be more than you will ever need.  However, experimentation will be required in order to narrow down your choices.  The adjustable trimmer guide provides more choices without switching attachments, but it is susceptible to slipping under pressure, resulting in a closer trim than you intended.  For body hair trimming, this device is clearly inferior to the [[ASIN:B000EG8HLE Philips Norelco BG2020 Bodygroom Shaver]], [[ASIN:B000TFNH1U Philips Norelco Body Groomer Limited Edition BG2022]], and probably to the [[ASIN:B001E0C9LI Philips Norelco BG2030 Professional BodyGrooming System]] as well, in everything except battery, but unless you are a performer in the adult film industry, it will probably do an adequate job, especially if you have someone who can assist you with the underbrush thinning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Unless you plan on regularly maintaining yourself in that condition, it is not advisable to shave yourself too closely between the waist and the knees.  Two words -- \\&quot;razor stubble\\&quot; -- in close contact with your most tender areas should be explanation enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;T-BLADE HEAD:  Unless you develop the habit of using it to trim your beard or are still maintaining that boot camp &#x27;doo, this will probably be the least useful blade unless you have a partner with some haircutting skills because while any idiot can eventually learn to trim his own beard, cutting your own hair in a manner you&#x27;d be willing to display in public is probably going to be beyond your abilities.  However, Wahl made its name in hair clippers and could hardly be expected to leave one out of an all-in-one trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Defects?  The lack of a carrying case is particularly felt with such a large number of attachments, and a vacuum feature to capture hair clippings would be a nice-to-have. In addition the handle has the ergonomics of a flashlight, but these are minor points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summation for a bearded or mustachioed man on the go this device CAN adequately replace everything it claims to replace with the exception of a nose hair trimmer.vacuum feature to capture hair clippings would be a nice-to-have.

            <li> This is my first beard trimmer but I have been very pleased with it.  Have been using it everyday for about 3 weeks and so far have only charged the battery at the time I opened the box.  Instructions could be better, there is one adjustable attachment that so far I haven&#x27;t been able to adjust due to fear of breaking it.</li>
            <li> In the beginning things were great. After 6-months the battery only held a 3-5 minute charge and requried a full 8hrs to charge back up. Very poor battery Life.</li>
            <li> Contrary to some reviews here, you cannot use it when it&#x27;s not charged (but plugged-in). It only works after charging, and plugging it in while using it does not bypass the battery (so that it can be used when the battery is dead).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this reason, it gets 3/5.</li>
            <li> Just as advertised, Buy with confidence. No problems, works great, (I wrote this review after having it about 15 months).&lt;br /&gt;I pretty much only use 2 attachments. This baby holds a charge for months.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer to replace a much older rechargeable Wahl trimmer. The old one had gotten to where it didn&#x27;t cut very well, and it required recharging after every use. This new one cuts much better than the old one ever did, and a battery charge lasts much longer. I have taken this one along to places where recharging was not an option, and if worked fine for several beard trims and even touch-up haircuts.</li>
            <li> Still learning to be a beard owner/operator. I would like a guard between the 1 and 2 for my mustache; I like it a tad shorter than the beard so it does not tickle my nose.</li>
            <li> Gave this as a gift to the Hubby. He loves the attachments included and it holds a decent charge!</li>
            <li> It does a good job of shaving, although some parts of my face need several passes to get a fairly close shave. A single one-hour charge has yielded seven shaves so far.     The little handbook does not give very clear instructions on the use of the various attachments.</li>
            <li> Great little trimmer with all the necessary addons to do some basic maintenance at a good price for li-ion.</li>
            <li> I replaced a basic rechargeable Wahl trimmer that had to be over 15 yr&#x27;s old (battery finally went belly up), &amp; will stop using a Braun trimmer that&#x27;s difficult to use. The latter doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for very long anymore, &amp; I got tired of skin scratches as the cutting guard teeth were too sharp.    I bought the Wahl Lithium Ion trimmer primarily for sideburn, neck, &amp; \\&quot;nether\\&quot; region trimming purposes, as well as for the Lithium Ion battery. I too draw weary of the old cadmium rechargeable battery shortcomings (short charge durations + memory problems).     I used the trim &amp; clip attachments for sideburn, neckline (front &amp; back), &amp; groin trimming. The latter for me has become habit for 20+ yr&#x27;s as I&#x27;m a former long distance cyclist, &amp; you learn quickly that that area is better off smooth for cycling purposes. Fortunately, many women love it also. Both attachments afforded me a very clean, close to the skin trim with no abrasion from the cutting guard teeth. Just as important, the teeth are close together &amp; I experienced no grabbing of skin or hair.    The foil shave attachment worked as well &amp; no better than other foil shavers I&#x27;ve used. I currently own a Braun rechargeable foil shaver, &amp; neither provides me a skin smooth shave. Given my experience, I don&#x27;t expect skin smooth shaves from a foil shaver. That&#x27;s why I use a blade for all of my shaving - to achieve the actual skin smooth results.    I also used the detail attachment on my ears &amp; nose. I found it no more effective than a real round headed ear/nose trimmer. Given the cutting edge &amp; angle it provides, I found it more difficult to use on my ears &amp; nose. So for the purpose of trimming ear &amp; nose hairs, I will continue to use my round headed ear &amp; nose hair trimmer (from Sharper Image - Turbo Groomer 5.0).     At this time I have no reason to test all of the guide combs for moustache &amp; beard trimming purposes as I no longer have either at this time. Having used such trimmer combs in the past, I see no reason why they won&#x27;t work well as they&#x27;re comparable in design as anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.    Some reviewers have noted that the trimmer is loud &amp; bothersome. I guess it depends on what you&#x27;re used to, but in my experience, it&#x27;s no louder than anything I&#x27;ve ever used, &amp; quiter than some. Some have also pointed out that hairs stick to the silicone rubber grip. Personally, I find that a mute point, as it&#x27;s easy to wipe them off by hand or with a towel. I wouldn&#x27;t base my purchasing decision on such a finding.    Bottom line is that it&#x27;s light weight &amp; easy to use. The battery provides more power than cadmium rechargeable batteries, &amp; having experienced Lithium Ion batteries in other products I own, I look forward to no longer wondering whether or not the battery will be there for me when I need it if I&#x27;ve not kept it plugged into the charger. The trimmer attachments provide a clean &amp; close trim. All in all, this trimmer is worth the $40.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it is so difficult to find a good trimmer/groomer these days.  I purchased a \\&quot;cheapy\\&quot; in 2001 that lasted for 9 years and worked great (I forget the brand).  Since it finally conked out, I&#x27;ve been through two units - including this one - and just purchased another model - Philips Norelco Qg3280/41 - in hopes to find one I can be happy with.  This trimmer could&#x27;ve been great.    The pros include:  - Long battery life  - solid construction and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap while holding  - Good customer service.  I called asking about the nose trimming attachment, and they sent me one for free! YMMV on this one.  Cons:  - The heads and attachments are tricky to attach.  Each time, I worry I&#x27;m going to break the plastic tabs (haven&#x27;t yet, though, thanks to the solid construction).  - The plug doesn&#x27;t detach when lifting the trimmer due to the way it was designed.  My previous trimmer allowed the plug to be attached to the base so that the trimmer detached from the plug when lifting it, which I prefer.  - The 6-Position Guide is worthless if you want to use \\&quot;position 1\\&quot; setting (the setting that gives you the closest trim).  Every time I use that setting, I end up with bald patches along the trim line, and end up having to shave the entire area down/off to match. I&#x27;ve been stuck using position 2, which doesn&#x27;t give me the close trim I prefer.  The last \\&quot;con\\&quot; is the real deal-killer for me, as I could live with the other ones.  But because I seek the closest trim available in the 6-Position Guide, all trimming attachments are useless.  As I write this review, the Philips Norelco Qg3280/41 is on sale for 32 dol. so I&#x27;m going to give that a try and hope that I can end my hunt for a trimmer I can be satisfied with for the next several years.</li>
            <li> **** Update ****  Within a day of posting this original review, I received different information from the company.  Perhaps this was my error in initial communication, but the end result is that THEY COVERED IT FULLY UNDER WARRANTY.  I had to send in the full unit with power supply.  The new trimmer head works great and looks a little different - maybe it&#x27;s the same, but appears to be better quality than what was initially supplied.  I&#x27;m leaving this at 1 star for awhile in case people who recently read this might find it easier to see the update.  Given the ultimate outcome, I would change my rating to 4 stars.  *** Original review ***  This product performed great for 7 months, with being used about 5-6 times a month for light trimming.  The battery life is amazing (curious how battery life is the biggest thing touted on this - it is impressive).  The teeth on the main trimmer head started falling out or breaking off causing the product to chomp on my face.  Obviously the trimmer blade is defective and one would expect this to be covered by their highly touted FIVE YEAR WARRANTY.  Sorry, it doesn&#x27;t cover this defective part, no matter how limited the use.  Since I used none of the other attachments, I wonder - if they broke the first time used.... of course, they would no be covered either.  After reading the fine print it&#x27;s hard to tell if anything at all is actually covered - why not put 100 year warranty on the package?  They want $17.45 to send a replacement for the defective part.  Eg, more than 50% of the cost to buy an entire new unit.  I find this outrageous.  They should be apologizing and rushing out a replacement at their expense.  Never had Remington or Norelco fall apart like this even after years of use.  When it comes to Wahl, MADE IN AMERICA means, GIVE US MORE MONEY BECAUSE WE SOLD YOU JUNK THE FIRST TIME.  I expected more from an American based company.  Do I really want to buy a new trimmer head twice a year and by the end of the 5 yr warranty have paid for the product 5 times over?  Maybe they would offer a discount to buy a 10pack... sort of like those disposable packs of shavers.  **************UPDATE  By the end of the day, it appears they are going to cover this under warranty.  I need to send the entire unit and power cord back to them and I&#x27;m told they will waive the return shipping fee.  So, perhaps the earlier communication with them was not accurate.  Will post an update about whether this gets fixed and the timing.  I may need to rewrite this entire review, or delete it - we&#x27;ll see how it turns out.</li>
            <li> I really had my doughts about a rechargable trimmer but this product is all it claims to be. It is the most powerful rechargable trimmer I have ever had and charges in as little as an hour. The multiple heads and combs allows me to take care of all my haircut and trimming needs. It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Pleased with everything I bought</li>
            <li> At first somewhat skeptical of quality with all of the varied attachments.  Found all were very good with a quality, powerful power unit to run them all.  My beard is not too heavy and it works well for all of my needs.</li>
            <li> Despite the whisker trimmings attracting rubber grip, the trimmer is adequate and the battery lasts about two months on a charge (for trimmings three times per week).</li>
            <li> This is a great product - does everything you need but...the first two I owned each lasted two years to the month then just stopped working.  Done Liked it so much I just bought my third.</li>
            <li> Purchased in February, died by September.  Wahl trimmers don&#x27;t look as nice as the Conair line of beard trimmers. But don&#x27;t be fooled; Wahl trimmers work better. Conair snares buyers with looks that have no substance behind them. As others have noted Conair products are g_rbage.   The only flaws in this design are   1) the too-firm power button is virtually impossible to slide into the &#x27;on&#x27; position if your fingers are wet, as they are frequently in a bathroom.  2) When you turn it on and it&#x27;s plugged in, it won&#x27;t switch from the ni-cad cell to just direct power. The trimmer is dead until it recharges, even when plugged in.</li>
            <li> Pos never charged would shut off mid trim</li>
            <li> Works good, my husband said holds a long charge, hasn&#x27;t charged it since he got it. Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is my second Wahl trimmer, the first one died after about 10 years. Wahl includes a nice array of trimmers and guides. Getting the various attachments on and off takes practice but once you get used to it it&#x27;s easy. The handle material attracts hairs but a Wahl video on youtube explained that wiping with a wet cloth cleans it off very well. The included stand does not hold all the attachments, or at least I was unable to figure out how to get them all in. I threw it out and put everything in a small plastic sandwich container.&lt;br /&gt;It has a lot of power and easily handles the basic trimming operations I use it for. The foil shaver is pretty good if you just want to get things looking acceptable but doesn&#x27;t get nearly as close as a razor and requires multiple passes. But it&#x27;s better than I expected at this price (check out the cost of a decent dedicated shaver). Overall a great value, no complaints.</li>
            <li> I have to return this product to the company because it does not work as I would have liked it to work, however it may still be useful to most buyers but it was not what I was expecting in performance.</li>
            <li> I bought for my Dad and paid 50.00 bucks for it. When it came I was a little disappointed. It was very light weight and not like the other Wahl trimmers I&#x27;d seen in the past. TJ max had a similar set with 1&amp;#34; wide attachements for 30.00, so I gave them botht to my dad, and he is going to decide which one he likes.</li>
            <li> These work well, seem durable, have a long lasting battery. I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased any other one. One note though is that hair does stick to the black part of the clipper due to the type of material used.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to do line ups or shave your head, this is not for you. Look into the Andis T Outliner or Wahl Detailer, those cut close. This is good for trimming a beard and stuff like that.</li>
            <li> Better than my previous Wahl rechargeable beard trimmer but not as good as they used to be. This model seems to have plenty of power and came with more fancy accessories than I&#x27;ll ever need. My one complaint is the trimmer is coated with a rubberized grippy material that gets coated with beard trimmings that are not easily cleaned off so my trimmer usually has a beard of its own.</li>
            <li> My last Wahl lasted over 7 years before it finally stopped working, and I never did any sort of upkeep for it. I shaved and put it away. That was it. I bought a Remington trimmer after my first Wahl and it broke in about two months... so back to Wahl!&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer provides plenty of useful attachments, some of which I&#x27;ll never use but they seem good enough. This thing has plenty of power to easily cut through a thick beard without issue. The attachments are easy to interchange and simply snap on and off. The trimming guides work great as well.&lt;br /&gt;The best part about this trimmer to me is without a doubt the battery. I&#x27;ve owned this for several months now and use it on average two times per week for about 5 minutes each. I didn&#x27;t charge it when I took it out of the box, and I still haven&#x27;t charged it to this day! This thing just keeps on going and it&#x27;s great! I have no doubt that this will last just as long as my original Wahl.</li>
            <li> I was too quick to enter a bad review of this trimmer when the battery died, and I apologize to Wahl, Amazon and Amazon customers. I said that they didn&#x27;t get back to me fast enough so I&#x27;d have to buy another trimmer. That was thoughtless of me, not taking into account any of the realities of doing business, even when supporting your products. Anyway, shortly after I rashly posted that review, Wahl got back to me in their normal course, and said just send it in and they&#x27;ll repair or replace it. I don&#x27;t know how anyone could ask for more.    This is a very good trimmer - long lasting working time, excellent detail capability, lots of blade and comb options, which are easy to change with a flip of the thumb - I highly recommend it. The battery did die after only 6 months of thrice weekly use, but Wahl answered my email within a week, telling me to simply send it in and they&#x27;d fix it. Of course, I had to buy another Wahl trimmer to fill in, but I&#x27;m betting they&#x27;re getting the battery issue fixed. I mean heck, they come with a five year guarantee, so they won&#x27;t want to be seeing them that often!</li>
            <li> I used my Wahl lithium ion trimmer for the first time today and I am disappointed to say the least.  The first thing that you notice is that the supplied stand is not a charging stand. To charge the trimmer it must be plugged in with the supplied charger which is one more thing that must be stored with this unit. The beard trimmer comb is dificult to attach and to set the beard trimming height(the supplied directions are worthless) and there is nowhere to store the trimmer comb in the supplied stand so it must be left on the trimmer. Then if you want to use the trimmer without the beard comb it must be removed to use the trimmer. The silicone handle on the trimmer gets covered with hair while you trim your beard and the only way to clean it is to put some water on your finger and wipe it off. After one use the chrome plastic trim around the blade is wearing off.  The two saving features are the quick charging lithium battery which charges the unit in one hour and the second saving feature is the quick releasing interchangeable trimming heads. All in all due to the overall bad design and poor quality of construction I would not buy this unit again if this one fails.</li>
            <li> Cuts just as well as my Andis T clipper but I nicked my face 3X on my first use. The nicks weren&#x27;t from the blades knives but from the edge of the clipper blade tearing into my neck on tight corner of my face and neck. The edges of the clipper is shaped such that the edge can get caught on neck skin. I think I&#x27;m so use to the Andis professional clipper (heavier, noisier, get hot and reliable.    Its a good purchase though for Lithium battery life and when in countries that use weird 50Hz AC, I now have a rechargeable clipper. I don&#x27;t bother with the accessories, better off buying a foil and rotary separate for that close face shave.</li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer that replaces the several other models I&#x27;ve hated. Much to my surprise, this trimmer works great. I expected a mediocre trimmer, similar to the other brands I&#x27;ve owned, but this is superb. There are four completely different heads with different functions, and a slew of clip-on grooming attachments.  OK, the plastic clip-on attachments aren&#x27;t all good, but a few of them are perfect.  To the reviewers who whined about the stand not being a charging stand or the shaver having too much vibration:  Boo-hoo.  Plug the shaver into the charger to charge, then put it in the stand! Don&#x27;t people realize that the number one reason why rechargable devices fail so often is because they are plugged into a charger all the time?  This shaver keeps its charge for a very very long time, so it does not need to be constantly charged. The separate charger is brilliant solution to making the rechargeable battery last a long time.  And to the person who complained about too much vibration:  I&#x27;ve had too many units that don&#x27;t have enough power that are terrible trimmers but they are quiet and smooth.  I will gladly put up with a little extra vibration from a great powerful motor.</li>
            <li> I buzz my hair at 1/4 inch, and have been tired of tearing through expensive \\&quot;professional\\&quot; clippers every 9 months when the \\&quot;precision hardened blade that is ground, precision lapped, and titanium nitride coated and by leprechauns in a German factory\\&quot; wore out and start tugging my hair out...  This set came highly recommended from a friend, so I bought it.  I had my doubts when ordering because after all, it&#x27;s a trimmer, not a clipper.    Well, my doubts were completely baseless - this trimmer is a wolf in sheep&#x27;s clothing with impressive performance.  It did not hesitate at all with the clipper attachment and cut through my hair like OJ cut Ronald Goldman.</li>
            <li> The problem is the same as all Wahl Trimmer products. You can&#x27;t replace the battery, so no matter how well the trimmer is built, once the battery goes, it is ready for the trash.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a cordless trimmer that would hold a charge, be powerful enough to trim a tough overgrown beard and not die in the process, and not have to remember to plug it in the night before, or charge it a few times and suddenly it won&#x27;t hold a charge or a sufficent charge to trim the whole beard. This Wahl Lithium Trimmer seems to cover the whole spectrum. It would be nice if it had a charging indicator light on it. However it works great and has worked exactly as I have desired it to. I&#x27;m very pleased with it. Kudos to the Wahl Company for another great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for almost 2 months now.  I bought it for getting my Doberman ready for the show ring &amp; so far, it has worked perfectly for what I needed.  I wanted a trimmer with the lithium battery so I didn&#x27;t have to worry about it dying on my when I needed it the most.  It shaves really close, too, which is another feature I needed.  It&#x27;s fairly quiet which is nice because I have to shave the inside of his ears and his whiskers.  It&#x27;s small in size so it fits nicely in my show bag, too.</li>
            <li> Its all about horsepower, not sophistication. Like back in the day when it didn&#x27;t matter what kind of foreign iron you showed up with, you were going to get smoked by a big bore Chevy even if its doors didn&#x27;t quite shut.  Until the first curve.&lt;br /&gt;This is a good beard and body trimmer - four star. A wimpy razor - two star, and a confusing amalgam of plastic parts that don&#x27;t really fit so well together. Made in America, except for the bits that are made in China. Save the box because it is much more helpful than the printed instructions that come in very small print and never really explain what everything is for, how it fits and what it does.&lt;br /&gt;When you crank this over it really kicks in with great satisfaction and gives the impression that it will do the job. Given the lithium battery it will probably do so for quite a while and take a quick charge when it runs low. The shaver, however is a small dual foil contraption that I wanted to like because I bought this as a &#x27;&#x27;All In One Trimmer&amp;#34;. Well, so it may be, but not at the level I want to live with.  Seems like it would have been easy to attach a real razor head, but alas this did not happen.&lt;br /&gt;I have changed the heads quite a few times and still have trouble with getting them to click into place. Ditto for the combs which cannot be put on the heads until they are in place. So many pieces, so poorly labeled, I still don&#x27;t know what all of them are for, but wonder would it be so hard to just have one adjustable beard trimmer? Actually, there is one, but it quite is difficult to fit on the head and I found that one of the individual combs is handier. The nose trimmer looks dangerous but works well enough. These guys need to get together with some Italian and Japanese designers and make this basic motor a more versatile and more easily handling &amp;#34;All in One&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this trimmer for a number of years. I received it as a gift. I can say without reservation that this is the best trimmer I have ever owned. The unit takes very little time to charge and it lasts a long time before needing a recharge. The blade is self-sharpening. Hair never gets stuck in the clipper. They are easy to clean (a damp face cloth will get the hair off the handle (for the person who gave it a one star because he had hair on the handle)). And, it comes with a wide assortment of attachments for almost any grooming task. I like it so much that I am getting one for my grandson today.</li>
            <li> SUPER smooth, lightweight, and inexpensive. Best clippers I&#x27;ve EVER owned.  Hands down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was disappointed in the Norelco Body Groomer and much prefer this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this set barely over a year and use it twice a month.  The  battery does not hold its charge for more than a couple minutes after a full nights charge.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> For the 3 months that it worked properly, it worked great. The blades are sharp and they do a good job. Then, the battery stopped taking a charge after 3 months. I can use it while plugged in, but that defeats the point of having a cordless trimmer. I followed the instructions in the package to send it in for warranty repair, I am hoping to get it back quickly.</li>
            <li> Nice shaver and more attachments than I need.  Attachments work well except for the shaver assembly.  The shaver barrier screen is to0 thick and as a result does not give a smooth result.  It pulls on whiskers before cutting.  It is irritating to use.</li>
            <li> great product, very good power.  best trimmer i&#x27;ve had ever.  this is great as a &#x27;balding&#x27; razor for a tight, clean look.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made. Switch was falling out on the one I got.  All this would be acceptable, but as another reviewer indicated hair sticks to it like glue. I used it for the first time to trim my beard and it took me twice as long to get the cut hair off the sticky rubber as it did to cut the beard.  Sorry, Wahl, but this is going back.</li>
            <li> Great for trimming up around the ears and back of the neck. It cuts very close, almost to a fault.  While I have never been cut, it can give you a nip if you bring the blade perpendicular to your skin, so be careful.  So many attachments and uses, all without wires!</li>
            <li> Love it. Strong and great battery life.</li>
            <li> If you just need to do a buzz cut, or only want to use this as a beard trimmer then this is for you.  Don&#x27;t expect to be able to do any kind of hair styling with this thing.</li>
            <li> Great product cuts hair as described</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the wireless feature because my apt bathroom has no outlets. The easy-switch heads make do-it-yourself trimming take less time. The pieces do not fit well in the all-in-one holder like shown in the picture, but that was the only let-down. Better off keeping them in a sandwich size ziploc bag.</li>
            <li> Great beard trimmer. Husband loves it. Thanks for the quick delivery!</li>
            <li> 3rd time using it and one of the springs breaks inside the blade assemly...I guess I won&#x27;t shave for a bit and just look like a bum.</li>
            <li> A well made product. I wish all the items I&#x27;ve purchased were as dependable and versatile as this trimmer has proven to be.</li>
            <li> I bought this on Amazon about 14 months ago for about $50.  I use it without guards to shave my neck and face every 3 or 4 days.  Nice, sharp blades (which are ground, not stamped), clean cuts, and overall a great product.  But - 14 months later, I can no longer get through my routine on a single charge.  This is a huge disappointment and seems uncharacteristic for a Lithium-Ion battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here I am shopping Amazon once again for different clippers.  But now that it&#x27;s down to $30 on Prime, that may not be a bad price for a year&#x27;s worth of use.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews - probably should - but this Wahl trimmer is so much superior to any other product out there I had to.  And, it is priced similar to the others (2) that I tried.</li>
            <li> Works great, battery life is awesome.  It&#x27;s not too loud, it&#x27;s hair clippers after all.</li>
            <li> This is a piece of crap not comparable to my old trimmer. Too many parts, no decent storage, incnvenient o change heads.    My beard is a mess since I got this item. I&#x27;m in the market for something better.    John</li>
            <li> Wow - this little clipper really has the power and holds the charge!! Also pretty loud and a good bit of vibration. I almost dropped it the first time I turned it on because I was so surprised by the noise and vibration. But I&#x27;ve been using it for my buzz cut at least every 10 to 14 days for about 3 months - still on the first charge and it&#x27;s still going strong.  I&#x27;m amazed at how long the charge is holding.  My last clippers (ConAir) would only work for two clippings before dying.  I guess this thing would be called either a large trimmer or small clipper.  I&#x27;ve only used the T-blade clipper and foil head shaver.  The clipper blade could be larger as it takes quite a while to complete the job.  The foil shaver head is small also, but works good for a foil shaver.  I&#x27;ve only actually shaved my head a couple of times with it - it worked but took a long time.  If you really want it smooth though, you&#x27;ll still need a blade.  The small size makes it good for travel. However, the storage tray is a piece of junk. It&#x27;s very flimsy, looks more like a packaging tray, and if you touch anything it all falls out.  It would be much better if it came with a closing storage case.  Biggest complaint - the rubberized covering on the handle, while very comfortable to grip, is like a magnet for the hair clippings.  The clippings stick to it like glue and the only way I&#x27;ve found to get them off is to brush and rub it with a dry wash cloth.  And it&#x27;s virtually impossible to get all of the clippings off.  Overall, though, I really like this clipper and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> First off... People, be aware of \\&quot;Vine Program\\&quot; reviewers.  Keep in mind that these people did not pay for the item and did not actively go out and search for the product they now own.  I, on the other hand, was actually looking for this here electric \\&quot;clipper\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One PRO:&lt;br /&gt;1-  At first I was glad to see that WAHL had finally designed a shaver with a lithium battery because the nickel-cadium battiers in their other units die out way too fast.  As it turns out, the battery was the only positive thing about this trimmer. I only needed to charge it fully once and it would last for approx 6 shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1-  Rubber material covering body of unit grips TOO much.  Little pieces of cut hairs will stick to it like glue!  Within a week it mine was covered in little hairs. Messy.&lt;br /&gt;2-  The metal blades rust easily even though they were never exposed to water, only to sweat.  I have never had this problem with other Wahl trimmers before.&lt;br /&gt;3-  This thing is loud when it&#x27;s new and getts louder as it ages. After 7 months mine stopped cutting well and sounded like a mini chain saw.&lt;br /&gt;4-  Short life span - 7 months.  Only used it 3 times a week, face only, and oiled it once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****UPDATE*****&lt;br /&gt;Wahl customer service is excellent. If you ever have any problem with their trimmers - use the warranty.&lt;br /&gt;Even after warranty, mail the problem piece to them and they will fix or replace at fair cost.&lt;br /&gt;I have found Wahl to make the best cutting blades.  Don&#x27;t know what happened with this particular model.&lt;br /&gt;I now use the model 9818 with lithium-ion battery and it&#x27;s very good.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> ** UPDATE ** Note that this would have been a one-star review. However I decided to increase the rating as the company made good on replacing the item with a brand-new boxed Wahl Lithium Ion Trimmer. This was after I complained here in this review. They did not, however, offer to replace it on the phone (see below original review). For their customer service after-the-fact, I decided to give it an \\&quot;average\\&quot; rating of three stars. I appreciate them sending me a brand-new item and it works so far as advertised. I will see if this one lasts longer than the original or suffers the same premature failure and then \\&quot;I&#x27;ll be back\\&quot;! ** END UPDATE **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this thing in December of 2012, and it has failed in July 2013. I used it a few times a week to trim my nose, facial hair, etc. Never used it in water and took care of it. Went to use it one morning and nothing. Won&#x27;t turn on. Yes, it is plugged in to charge as it always has been. It was good when it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a \\&quot;five year warranty\\&quot; supposedly on this trimmer. I called Wahl and they said to send it in on my dime and they will decide if they should repair or replace this and it will take at least 3 weeks - month or longer.  I said thanks for nothing. I need a trimmer to stay trimmed and this would not suffice ... and by the time i pay for shipping and my time it will be easier to purchase something else. Not recommended!</li>
            <li> The unit is amazing, I&#x27;ve had mine awhile,maybe 2 months, I&#x27;ve charged it once. This is the first trimmer I&#x27;ve owned that I didn have to plug in all the time. The battery alone makes it worth buying</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer for my husband and he is so happy with it,he said its the best trimmer he had so far, its clean cut and very quiet,it is deffinately a good product and would recomend to any one looking for a good trimmer service and delivery was prompt</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for two months. It is still running on the original charge. I use it to shave my head weekly and trim my beard. It takes me 5-7 minutes to do this. Great for travel as the charger is unnecessary to bring along. I have not found it too noisy, nor has it cut me. I have not used the attachments.    My only recommendation to Wahl is to add a light indicator that starts out red when you begin charging and turns to green when the battery is fully charged. Otherwise, it&#x27;s an excellent trimmer.</li>
            <li> works well for beard trimming.. but comes with a lot of attachments that will never get used or will have been lost by the time their need is recognized..</li>
            <li> good product. lots of options. a bit powerful though. you have to change the machine between hands while shaving/trimming. overall I am satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> Have used many Wahl products over last 25 years &amp; have always been very satisfied.  This review will be about 2 models including this particular product. Recently purchased 2 of the Groosman Beard &amp; they have stopped working within 2 weeks.  Battery no longer takes a charge.  The 3rd one seems to work fine.  Seller has taken them back each time but Wahl customer service (Michelle) doesn&#x27;t care &amp; or their corporate policy is to tell you to \\&quot;send it back to them &amp; they will look at it.\\&quot;  So I have to spend money to send it back &amp; be without a razor. Customer service says no bad batch of product &amp; offer no assistance that matters. Then bought this exact prodduct with a lithium battery which worked on an initial test, just running it but not using it, which worked fine.  Went to actually use it &amp; stopped working.  Won&#x27;t take a charge.  Wahl, these products I have purchased &amp; customer service are inferior.  Will never buy another Wahl product.  Hope Remington, Panasonic or any other razor manufacturer makes a quality product.  Wahl has permanently lost an excellent customer.</li>
            <li> Have had this for quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;Works very good and hold a charge for a long time.  Too bad I&#x27;m getting some rust on the cutting area.  I&#x27;ll use more of the included oil so it doesn&#x27;t get worse.</li>
            <li> Was good when it worked...after 4 months of use it quit working</li>
            <li> Excellent replacement for 5 year old earlier version of the same trimmer. With a full beard it saves all those hours of trying to be proficient with scissors.</li>
            <li> Item just as described with super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> My bathroom looks like a barbershop. I literally have 4 shavers plugged in as it seems impossible to get a shaver that does more than one thing well.   Pros: The torque is rather robust, compared to other razors and the charge lasts fairly long.  Cons: I don&#x27;t know why they bother with the flimsy and cluttered shaving rack. Most men I know don&#x27;t have the patience to use it.   The two blades provided provided a close shave - too close for my taste, not the ideal length for that groomed, evening shadow look and you have to press hard to get a good line up.  The most disappointing. After a few months - the charge would randomly cut off, with or without the cord plugged in, and as there is no light or indicator - it is next to impossible to know if the shaver is charging, fully charged, or not.</li>
            <li> I could just say \\&quot;Made in USA\\&quot; for my review but Amazon wants me to write more.  So I will say that this is the best hair trimmer product I have ever purchased.  Of course it is Made in USA so it is considerably better quality than its chinese competitors.  Great battery life.  Durable solid unit.  Lots of attachments.  Feels great in your hands and easy to use.  I highly recommend Wahl hair trimming products!</li>
            <li> Very good device with many accesories for most of the beards and moustaches.</li>
            <li> Received the product very fast and in perfect shape.  The item is as described and has completely met and exceeded my expectations.  I would definitely order this again and I&#x27;m glad I read all the reviews first.  In response to the Negative reviews below, I have not found them to be accurate.    These clippers work wonderfully and come with all the needed attachments.  Very durable and hold a charge for several weeks at a time.</li>
            <li> This is a nice machine.  Much smaller and nicer than using hair clippers to trim a beard.  Biggest complaint is that the longest length of beard it can leave you with is 3/8 inch - which is lame.  Changing the head is annoying, so I don&#x27;t, I instead use my other razor.  Pros - battery life, great size and functionality for trimming, holding, very clean cut, and so forth.  Runs Quieter than my Whal hair clippers so I don&#x27;t mind the noise.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great, it&#x27;s just that there are a few useless peices.  The shaver doesn&#x27;t cut close but if you use the buzz upside down it gets close enough, great battery life and perfect size.</li>
            <li> Being the kind of guy that goes through phases of not wanting a clean shave all of the time, I have purchased and used quite a few trimmers over the years to keep my stubble neat. Most have done the trick just fine. Unfortunately, this unit did not. It worked GREAT for about 3 uses and then seemed to lose some of its \\&quot;umph\\&quot; and power. Now, when I use it, it sounds like it is dying and this is after a full night recharge. It looks like plenty of people here have had a good experience with this trimmer while some have not been so lucky. To me, it seems as if perhaps Wahl&#x27;s manufacturing standards aren&#x27;t consistent enough to keep this trimmer a guaranteed winner for all of us. Purchase at your own risk.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer now for almost a year. Keep in mind I only trim my beard (that&#x27;s all I use it for) about once or twice a week. It has WAY too many attachments for me - but that&#x27;s because I use it only as stated above. For the cost, it is great. When I first got it, I didn&#x27;t have to recharge the battery for greater than 6 months! It&#x27;s always been powerful enough that it didn&#x27;t pull my beard.   If you read the reviews for items at this price range, this one of the best. You have to make the jump to over $50 to get a better unit imho. I say that having used none of the others - so take it with a grain of salt. But overall, an excellent unit with a five year warranty. The battery works great, charges last a LOOOOOONG time and it recharges quick. Also, if you run out of juice, it recharges quickly. Just plug it in for 5 minutes and do a crossword puzzle. Then come back and do your shave - works great. Then set a timer for an hour or so and leave it plugged in to fully charge. Then you&#x27;ll have several months of use from it.</li>
            <li> I was a part of No Shave November and at the end of it I looked like a grizzly man. It needed to be cleaned up and the Wahl Trimmer was the perfect item to do so. Looking at the other items for sale you find the corded trimmers, hair clippers and smaller facial air trimmers. They just didn&#x27;t seemed like the right item for my needs.  After using it for over a few months I still haven&#x27;t recharged it and still works like the day I got it. Well worth the buy.</li>
            <li> I bought one for my son and then got another for my Dad for Father&#x27;s Day as my son gave it rave reviews. It&#x27;s a great item!</li>
            <li> DOA. Did not work. Trimmer would not charge when plugged in according to instructions. Wahl wait time for customer service is unreasonable. Last Wahl product I will ever purchase. You will be best off by buying like product at a local beauty supply brick and mortar store where you can get customer service without wasting one half of a day on phone calls and returns.</li>
            <li> First, I would like to point out is that this is a beard-size trimmer. I don&#x27;t think the picture or the description really make this clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;- The trimmer itself is strong, relatively quiet and has good battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;- another disposable product with no serviceability.&lt;br /&gt;- the plastic \\&quot;chrome\\&quot; feel lends a cheap feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the main problem:&lt;br /&gt;- too many poor quality attachments. What&#x27;s the purpose of the standard and t-blade? They&#x27;re redundant. I would MUCH rather have had a single higher-quality blade.&lt;br /&gt;- The razor? I&#x27;m sure everyone tried it, and it worked \\&quot;OK\\&quot;. They all, just like myself, returned to their regular method of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the bashing aside, I believe this is probably the best value in the pricerange.</li>
            <li> Had this trimmer less than a year and the battery will not hold a charge. My old drug store Conair lasted ten times longer. Over rated, trust me!</li>
            <li> +++&lt;br /&gt;+ Wahl, well known brand used by pros&lt;br /&gt;+ Variety of options to customize to your preferences&lt;br /&gt;+ Lithium Ion batteries charge quickly &amp; can charge often with no memory effects&lt;br /&gt;+ Great price especially for the quality&lt;br /&gt;+ Easy care, just clean &amp; oil the blades&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; After becoming frustrated with the offerings from the market share leader, I sought advice from a friend who uses these tools daily. His advice was &#x27;look at what the pros use&#x27;. That lead me away from the market leader &amp; to try Wahl. These clippers are well built, versatile, good features &amp; dependable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers !</li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected very unprofessional feel pulls a lot of hair and it really hurts.</li>
            <li> I know you will not believe this, but I got this for a gift for Christmas in 2010.  It is now November of 2011 and I have not recharged it.  I have a goatee and use it about every three days.  I would have to recharge previous cordless trimmers daily.  This thing is unbelievable.  The blade is fantastic.  It cuts mor precise than previous conair and braun models.  You cannot go wrong with this trimmer.  It has a great very short attachment that most models struggle with.</li>
            <li> This is a great man&#x27;s (and gurlz) tool for good grooming! This is my second Wahl, same model. First one lasted me about 8 years before the battery died. I feel I get great value and use-ability with this trimmer. Used this trimmer for my wedding to my beautiful gurl! Great for facial, ear, back neck, side burn trimming. Love the straight blade nose trimmer...far superior cut/trim compared to round headed nose trimmers. I can travel without having to bring extra weight charger, for about a couple of weeks and with moderate use.&lt;br /&gt;If I do bring charger, happy that it plugs directly into unit; no base charger (which I hate to would travel with!). Lots of great grooming accessories. Just be nice to the plastic pieces, and it will last you.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend any thing else for head hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m unimpressed with this product. Had I seen it in person beforehand I would not have purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer itself is not total junk.. it does work.. but it&#x27;s far from high quality. Note that the shiny segment of the body near the blade is plastic, not metal as it may appear in the pictures. All of the attachments are very flimsy and feel like they&#x27;ll break easily. It includes a #1, #2, and #3 snap-on guard, and a 6-position adjustable attachment that only fits the narrower of two included blades.  The adjustable attachment very nearly broke in my hands when I tried to adjust the length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see this trimmer lasting long with regular use. If you want a quality trimmer you&#x27;re going to have to spend more money.</li>
            <li> I had a bottle of the line trimmer that i used and it finally went out.  I wanted to make sure my next trimmer was a wahl since they are known for their quality.  This product does not disappoint at all.  Wonderful trimmer with numerous attachments.  It does a wonderful job on my thick beard and I also use it to clean up my neck line which grows rapidly.  If you are looking for a great razor for all your trimming needs and more... then pick this thing up.</li>
            <li> I bought this back in January and have yet to find an easy, reliable way to change the heads or settings.  I owned a Norelco/Phillips for years and I don&#x27;t know what possessed me to change.  So new Amazon order today and I&#x27;m back to the old brand.</li>
            <li> Great for grooming the body.</li>
            <li> Purchased Wahl trimmer mainly for the small nose/ear/eyebrow attachment.  I did not notice any excess vibrations mentioned by other reviewers. The trimmer feels and sounds solid when it is turned. Trimmer was more expensive since it is uses Lithium ION and the attachments has ground blades vs stamped blades. Using the small nose/ear/eyebrow attachment felt weird but it did not pull any hair and did cut plenty of hair. Wahl cut more hair than my battery powered Panasonic nose trimmer, which was under powered, and had a hard time starting up. I was pleased with the shaver attachment, which did do a close shave.     After comparing and reading the reviews for the Remington 8-in-1 and Norelco All-in-one, I will return both unopened.     Here is you chance to buy Wahl \\&quot;Made in America\\&quot; as opposed to Remington and Norelco.</li>
            <li> Long battery life. Many attachments to trim/sculpt hair. Used it on my son&#x27;s head when leaving for the navy &amp; the battery didn&#x27;t die. It easily shaved his head.</li>
            <li> Great item. Plenty of power and the attachments work very well.</li>
            <li> It lasted 6 weeks before it died entirely.  Wasted my money.  :-(</li>
            <li> To be honest, I expected more. These are certainly above average, but it&#x27;s a hassle to change the heads, and it takes me longer to shave with these compared to my old clippers. That being said, they&#x27;re very sturdy, and they never pinch, which isn&#x27;t something I could say for my old clippers.</li>
            <li> Wahl has a great product here.  Love all the attachments and the power it has.  Just used it the other day to cut my husbands hair and it turned out great with the clipper attachments.  This is a must for any man to keep neat and trimmed.</li>
            <li> Item was not for me but for my husband and he says it works great Only thing he doesn&#x27;t like shout it is the electric razor it will only shave really fine hair and have to go over many times for a real close shave but other than that has a lot of attachments and works great. He is not a fan of electric shavers to begin with so can&#x27;t go on his opinion on the razor.</li>
            <li> Brought this Trimmer and was not disappointed.Built sturdy love the coreless.And  blade is sharp and the motor is strong.Cuts better and closer than the Pro Glide.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Wahl girl and I was not impressed with this. Very cheaply made. I&#x27;m still a fan of Wahl clippers over all just not this product.</li>
            <li> Good shaver with one serious flaw. The rubber grip is a hair magnet. I don&#x27;t want to have to wipe the handle down with a wet towel every time I shave. Who wants to keep a wet towel with a bunch of hair in their bathroom? Or wash a hairy towel every time they shave. It&#x27;s one unnecessary extra step. The handle should be chrome. I would not buy this razor until this flaw is fixed.</li>
            <li> By far the best trimmer I&#x27;ve owned.  TONS of power, which is a necessity due to my wire-like facial hair.  Charges super fast, attachments work great.</li>
            <li> Wahl has a good trimmer that just needs some refinements.  The good:  - Strong motor with excellent battery performance (6 months old).  - Cuts fast and the combs work well.  - All attachments work as advertised.  - The organizer base reduces accessory clutter on the counter top.  The bad:  - Rubber material covering body of unit grips TOO much. Little pieces of cut hairs will stick to it like glue! Within a week mine was covered in little hairs.  - The foil shaving head is great for touching up but too small for daily shaving. So I use my &#x27;regular shaver&#x27; for that.  - The counter top accessory base does not hold things if/when bumped.  - It would be a better haircut tool with an adjustable comb for the widest cutter head.  Suggestions for Wahl.  - Use a material for the handle that is not sticky.  - Deepen the accessory (charging) base.  - Provide an adjustable comb for the widest cutter head.</li>
            <li> Worked great until 3 weeks after purchase, now it just doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe mine is faulty, however there is no way to return or exchange it.</li>
            <li> Worked well for 10-months of very light duty trimming a goatee and sideburns and being kept clean and oiled up.  Today it failed to turn on after being plugged to charge.  Took the head off and inspected inside, very clean and the unit looks brand spanking new.  Wahl doesn&#x27;t have good customer service or warranty return service and their web site support is a joke.  So it is up to me to deal with the repair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested the charger and it is producing a steady 4.30 V.  I disassembled the unit by pulling back the rubber cover down and splitting the plastic case open to expose the motor, battery and electronics.  There was corrosion and a layer of green on the integrated circuit leads due to ambient moisture in the bathroom.  Cleaned it off with vinegar and distilled water and checked the leads and the unit worked again.  The internal battery is an industrial a 3.7V 750 mAh 2.3 wh AA Lithium Ion and it was 3.95 V showing a full charge.  I will re-solder the weakened and corroded leads and put a waterproof layer of conformal coating on all the exposed leads and chips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suspect that Wahl knows about ambient moisture damaging and destroying the products and they refuse to cover the electronics with moisture resistant conformal coating used as an inexpensive and standard way in the electronics industry to ensure a steady stream of failures and re-purchases by customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice is open the unit up and waterproof the electronics by covering the leads and chips with a liquid or spray-on conformal coating.  If you&#x27;re not mechanical enough to do that, I suggest go buy another product and hope for the best.</li>
            <li> I have been using Wahl clippers to cut my hair for about 15 years now. Mostly the electric ones.&lt;br /&gt;Bought these to use as a beard trimmer once a week.&lt;br /&gt;It produces a very fast, good even cut. The biggest problem is the battery lasts about 7 months. I have bought 3 of these in the last 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;I have finally decided to stop wasting my money.&lt;br /&gt;The Wahl electric trimmers are great. Wahl rechargeable are a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;Switching to Philips from now on.</li>
            <li> Not the best I had ..  But it&#x27;s good enough ..  Worth the price ..  The charge last long ..  Cheap finishing ..</li>
            <li> My only gripe is that it doesn&#x27;t remain on while corded. It cuts off my hair consistently because there is no mechanical failure. Anyways, it&#x27;s an A+ product!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband for Christmas because he saw the commericals for it and he loves it uses it quite often :)</li>
            <li> This shaver replaced a Remington I had previously and I am quite pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are many good qualities to this trimmer.  It&#x27;s hard to argue against 1700 strongly positive reviews.  And it is certainly powerful as promised.  However, it is an absolutely terrible variable length beard trimmer.  It comes with 3 fixed length guides, which seem okay, but I didn&#x27;t use them because 2 were too short and 1 was too long.  If you&#x27;re okay with always using one of these lengths, this trimmer is probably leaps and bounds ahead of any competition.  The variable length guide has 6 settings but it&#x27;s worthless.  It&#x27;s hard to see in the picture, but the guide combs curve toward the trimming blade at the end.  This means that the guide will cut your hair at different lengths depending upon what angle you&#x27;re holding the trimmer.  Really poor design.  Since your face isn&#x27;t a flat surface and it&#x27;s elastic, you are pretty much guaranteed to end up with a patchy beard because the curve of the comb will not successfully keep the blade at a consistent length away from your skin.  If you are trying to grow a beard and keep it groomed while it lengthens, or you want the flexibility of multiple lengths....THIS IS NOT THE TRIMMER FOR YOU.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have had I&#x27;m sure is unique to me. I&#x27;ve already lost some of  the smaller parts and have chosen to store the stuff in a small wire basket rather than the nice rack provided</li>
            <li> On a recommendation from a friend I&#x27;ve started using this unit for my \\&quot;close\\&quot; shaves other than when I use a razor. I can push it into my face and not worry about nicks. It works great on long hair; I wanted to clear a spot around a cut on my leg so I wouldn&#x27;t yank the hair with the band aids.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really not meant for this but I used in on my Doberman. It worked better than the pet clippers I have and she had very coarse hair.</li>
            <li> This is a Fantastic kit, everything you want or need in trimmer. A comb or attachment for every need. A foil shaver attachment that actually does a great job. Best bang for the buck in an all in one trimmer, the way it runs, feels in your hand you know this thing is built to last.</li>
            <li> I bought this in March, now it&#x27;s barely August.  That&#x27;s just over 4mnths of using this buzzer - once a week.  Battery is completely DOA.  Won&#x27;t hold a charge for more than 2mins or so.  All the other reviews complaining about \\&quot;noise\\&quot; and the rubber grips are being way too over-sensitive.  I don&#x27;t care about the sound of the buzzer, and the rubber isn&#x27;t as bad at people say.  It&#x27;s a good buzzer itself, just the battery is a POS.  For 30$, I&#x27;d expect more than 4mnths use - especially out of a company like Wahl.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the kind of buyer that does hours of research on a product before I make my decision and for those of you that just started looking I have a word of advice for you, stop wasting time and just buy the damn thing. I have owned many personal trimmers in the past and this one is by far the best one. I personally bought mine from Amazon for $23.00 W/ shipping which is way cheaper than any retail store and for the ladies that are looking to get their boyfriend/husband/family member a gift this will definitely put a smile on anyone&#x27;s face.    You can just tell when you take it out the box that it is very well build and they did not sacrifice any cheap material for price.  I got my Wahl Lithium Ion Trimmer in the mail yesterday and even without a complete charge up this thing is very strong. I managed to clean up my goatee, sideburns, and my eye brows in just 10 min. All extra pieces really work well especially the shaver piece. All in all this is a great product and if you take care of your personal belongings this will last you for years to come.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be buying this again. After about a year the battery is dead and no longer will hold a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was great if not for the battery dying on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last non-lithium trimmer lasted me 5yrs before that battery died.  I&#x27;m a bit dissappointed.</li>
            <li> work good , the battery hold the charge for a long time , easy to handle ,small,but to much stuff i just used for a couple weeks but i don&#x27;t know if the plastic parts have a long life because you have to put  it on or take off depend what you want do ,loud sound when you work with it</li>
            <li> Have used this trimmer for a few weeks now. The charge it holds is truly incredible. I use it for a few minutes each morning, and have only had to charge it perhaps weekly or longer. The interchangable heads are nice and change out easily.  Cuts pretty good also.</li>
            <li> Have had it a couple of months now, and it&#x27;s ok.  It trims reasonably well.  I like the lithium ion battery, less frequent charging.  More attachments than I need, but I can&#x27;t complain.  The rubber stuff on the grip is annoying... the hair just gets stuck to it and is tough to get off.  I don&#x27;t use any guard to trim my face, and the blades seem to have a sharp spot that occasionally seems to snag or snip at me.. not sure how to explain it, maybe one of the teeth protrudes slightly more or something.  The base to hold everything is pretty cheap and doesn&#x27;t hold all the components very well, but since I don&#x27;t use the attachments I have them in a baggie in a drawer.  Big downside is the lack of water-resistance to the device, which would negate the problem of hair sticking to the rubberized handle.  All in all, for $30 I can&#x27;t complain too much, but I was expecting a little more from Wahl.</li>
            <li> And again - what&#x27;s wrong with you people producing these devices? If I spent $20, 30, 40 doesn&#x27;t matter how much - I expect at list a simple plain box to keep this ridiculous amount of attachments organized and neat. I don&#x27;t want to have a product in a blister pack, give me a case damn it! So far I keep Panasonic clipper, Philips groomer and Wahl trimmer each one in a separate ZIPLOCK PLASTIC BAG with attachments heaped inside!!! Come on!!! Why Remington for $10 10 years ago managed to give a nice strong box for the trimmer I had and you can not?</li>
            <li> I never leave reviews but this one needed it.  Blades didn&#x27;t last long and it pulls your hair real bad while trimming your face. Not great</li>
            <li> I use a trimmer regularly to trim my beard when it starts to get a little too long and have always just kind of excepted that the trim was not that even. After charging this trimmer fully I used it right away to trim my beard and eyebrows. This gave me an extremely even trim on my beard so good that I came out bragging to my wife about how even it was. The heads are easy to switch out and I really like the fact that the battery doesn&#x27;t drain when not in use (product claim as I haven&#x27;t owned it long enough to truly test this out). If you are looking to upgrade your trimmer than don&#x27;t be afraid to buy this one.</li>
            <li> Update: battery still great but once again walh fails to deliver a good product. Thing started rusting after a few months of use. For the second time I am officially done buying wahl products.  I used to hate wahl clippers and swore them off two years ago. It just so happens I was at Walmart looking for a pair of clippers I had bought in the past (apparently discontinued) and couldn&#x27;t find them. Against my will I bought wahl. This thing is awesome and powerful and more importantly for me is that it cuts super close to my scalp because I shave my head. Love these things so far! I will update my post if they turn south like my last pair.</li>
            <li> Used it for the first time today. Works great. Use it for beard trimming. I had bought a similar Wahl trimmer recently locally, but it had nickel-cadmium batteries. Took it back immediately and ordered this one. Same price, way superior battery.</li>
            <li> Good shaver for the price! I chuckle at the reviews that complain it&#x27;s too loud. It&#x27;s an electric shaver what do you want it&#x27;s not like your shaving with a lawn mower! I&#x27;ve had two of these now and the first one works just fine still but I dropped one of the Clippers in the sink and broke off some teeth on it so I decided to just get a new one all together so now I have a spare I guess! I would recommend this!</li>
            <li> My wife purchased this trimmer for me for my birthday and I have been very pleased so far.  The various attachments ensure that you have the appropriate tool for any trimming job you may come across.</li>
            <li> I used this shaver every other day for 3 years when one day, it would no longer take a charge. I checked the Wahl website and it had a 5 year warranty.  I emailed Wahl and got a quick response telling me to send in the shaver and charger.  Wahl stood behind their product and sent a brand new replacement shaver in about 10 days time. But with a new shaver and blade, the 10 days of growth came off in a snap.  I love this shaver and all it&#x27;s attachments. Wahl is pretty good too.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is garbage. I was excited to buy a made-in-USA product ... until I used it. Trimmed my beard four times, then two of the thin, fixed metal prongs (which separate the trimmer blades) simply broke off. Didn&#x27;t notice that until I got cut. Threw it in the garbage at that point, but can describe other deficiencies which I found before throwing it away:&lt;br /&gt;1. the various combs just don&#x27;t fit well and sometimes loosen and come off while trimming (giving you a really crappy, uneven beard until you see what&#x27;s happened)&lt;br /&gt;2. even when things work right, and the parts stay on, you get a pretty uneven trim--especially at the #1 setting. My old Norelco (which died a natural death after years of great service) gave a 100% even trim at any length setting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had at least a handful of beard/mustache trimmers throughout my adult life and I can truly say the Wahl Lithium Ion is by far the best. I bought it about 8 weeks ago on Amazon.com (right after Christmas because Santa forgot to bring me a new trimmer). I charged it once I received it, used it daily ever since, and it&#x27;s still going strong on the initial charge. The lithium ion battery is great. I used to have to charge my previous trimmers at least once, sometimes twice, a week. This trimmer is solidly built and comfortable to use. The cutting blades are sharp and never tug on the beard. I strongly recommend the Wahl L/I Trimmer for your personal use or as a gift. (One note though: I have to keep the attachments in a small box next to the trimmer, because my wife and kids kept bumping the holding tray and scattering the assortment all around the sink counter-top.)</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: I didn&#x27;t buy this on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;- Powerful trimmer but needs work.  While the rubber covering makes it easy to hold it acts like a vacuum cleaner - most of the hair you trim sticks to it.&lt;br /&gt;- Too many attachments&lt;br /&gt;- 6 position trimmer is hard to adjust and semi-impossible to get off.&lt;br /&gt;- Only way to get a good 5 o&#x27;clock shadow is to use the 6 position trimmer at a right angle to face.  The problem with this is that the support prongs are so small they&#x27;re uncomfortable used like this.&lt;br /&gt;Thanx,&lt;br /&gt;Dan</li>
            <li> Had this product for just under two years.  I shave my head every two weeks.  The clippers are cheaply made, but they are light and easily maneuverable.  Comes with many attachments, but you&#x27;ll only end up using two or three, over and over again.  They worked great for the first 1.5 years, but alas, their demise has finally come.  The battery no longer accepts a charge for more than five minutes, so I have to use them for five minutes, then wait 10 minutes for them to recharge.  My hair now takes an hour to cut, due to this clip/recharge cycle. Time to move on. It just seems such a waste that \\&quot;made in China\\&quot; products never seem to last more than two years.  At least Wahl products are better than the Conair junk. Time for a new pair.  Like I said, works good while it lasts...</li>
            <li> This is the second Wahl beard trimmer and shaver I&#x27;ve owned.  I travel nationally and internationally and only take this as both my trimmer and shaver.  It is a great little trimmer and this version is slimmer, more solid and better looking than the previous model.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This product has plenty of power. I&#x27;m impressed with the charging capacity and the ease of use for the interchangeable heads. I believe the tray to hold all of the components could have been better designed. It is quite cumbersome, and does not hold all of the attachments well. The electric foil shaver does not cut razor close; which was great for my use. I did not want razor close, as this would give me hair bumps. I would definitely recommend this product, especially given the price.</li>
            <li> Great little machine. I like the way the different heads are changed. They just snap into place and seat well.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item from another store locally. I was sick of buying junk trimmers, so I figured I would pay little and get a quality one. I paid around $40 for this when I bought it, compared to the typical $20 ish that I paid for others (Which outperformed this by a longshot) Well, the trimmer attachment is junk, and not good for detail trimming whatsoever. The length shield or whatever it is called, is even worse. It takes chunks of hair out if you don&#x27;t hold it just right. The shaver attachment however, is pretty good, kinda. I really only use this thing to trim my goatee and shave my \\&quot;mexistache\\&quot;. I use the shaver everyday, and it does ok, as long as I don&#x27;t actually try to use it on my entire face, because that just isn&#x27;t happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After only a few months, the unit would not hold a charge and had to be plugged in all day every day. If left unplugged for more than a couple days, and used only for a combined time of a couple minutes on a FULL charge, it would be dead. As of now, it can be \\&quot;fully charged\\&quot;, and it will last only a couple minutes using the trimmer attachment until it is fully dead, rendering it pretty much useless in this aspect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may be just my bad luck, as I tend to have with electronics, or the fact that I use it lightly every day. Regardless, this thing pretty much sucks. I can&#x27;t recommend this to anyone, and would actually tell people to stay away.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Solid-feeling trimmer&lt;br /&gt;Well-constructed blades&lt;br /&gt;Wide array of attachments&lt;br /&gt;Powerful motor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;ill-conceived base&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The WAHL Lithium-Ion All in One Trimmer is a reasonably good all-in-one trimmer. It has quite a strong motor that has no trouble going through very coarse facial hair. Its incredibly long battery life allows it to be taken on a week-long trip without any worry of losing performance. If a longer stint away from home is required, its small wall-wart DC adapter would fit inside of a dopp kit without any trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the blades included seem very well-constructed. They have very fine teeth that move smoothly. Unlike other inexpensive groomers, these blades are meant to be maintained (a good thing, in my opinion), and come with a small bottle of lubricating oil. Unfortunately, only two of the four blade attachments are truly useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The standard trimming blade with its four guide attachments handles the majority of trimming needs. It handles beards, sideburns, and *other* areas with comfortable ease. For closer shaves, the dual-foil blade handles the rest with very little irritation. I have very coarse facial hair that usually has to be taken off with a Mach 3 or better blade. The foil shaver (and great torque from the motor) managed to get through nearly all of the facial hair except for a few sensitive neck areas that weren&#x27;t used to an electric trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other two blades, the hair trimmer and ear/nose trimmer, saw little use. The nose trimmer is much too large to fit comfortably in a nostril, and - though it has seven guide attachments in total -- there are no guide attachments for use on eyebrows (only a hand-held comb, which is easy to move). I usually leave the hair trimming to a barber, so I don&#x27;t foresee much use of the hair trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only truly bad part of the trimmer is the accessory base. It is much larger than the trimmer itself, yet doesn&#x27;t hold the attachments well. They just sit loosely in the recessed areas, and are easily knocked out when the flimsy base gets knocked around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve used in this price range. I own the Remmington PG-350 (listed on the WAHL All-in-One box as the \\&quot;competition\\&quot;) and the WAHL 5570 and this is a better trimmer than both in terms of power and versatility.s, and are easily knocked out when the flimsy base gets knocked around.    This is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve used in this price range. I own the Remmington PG-350 (listed on the WAHL All-in-One box as the \\&quot;competition\\&quot;) and the WAHL 5570 and this is a better trimmer than both in terms of power and versatility.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is very high quality and has made for easy maintenance of my beard. I&#x27;ve only sported a beard for about six months now, so I&#x27;m still learning the tricks of the trade, but the previous trimmer I bought couldn&#x27;t compare. Not only are the blades on the Wahl much higher quality, the various attachments cover all the bases. I still go to the barber every once in a while to get a professional clean-up, but not nearly as often as I used to. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> As far as trimming goes, it does a fabulous job.  This is the perfect tool for those quick in-between barbershop touch-ups, especially around the neck.  It&#x27;s also incredibly useful for touching up brows, nose, and ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer from Wahl offers all the trimming capabilities that any man could want.  Actually, if I have any complaint, it&#x27;s that it offers too many different capabilities by having way too many different attachments.  I&#x27;ve found that I have to keep the instructions right next to it on the bathroom vanity just to figure out which attachment does which kind of cut and how to connect it, etc.  The footprint it leaves on the bathroom vanity is substantial, as well.  My space is precious and I would have preferred less attachments and a smaller footprint on my bathroom vanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expect to get years of use out of this item and I am only deducting 1 star because I wish the \\&quot;stand\\&quot; were smaller and had less attachments to fool with and I wish it had some sort of cheat sheet on the bottom of the stand for how to use all these attachments.  In terms of trimming, I give this 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This is my second Wahl Trimmer.  My first one lasted over eight years with weekly go-tee &amp; side-burn trimming use.  This one is light years ahead of my 8 year old model.  It works perfectly.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems.  I especially appreciate the quickness of charge.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and he loves it. Says it is so much better that the one he had be using. And is very happy with all the applications on this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this for a bit over a year now and with the trimmer plugged into the wall it stops running and needs to recharge after only about 15 seconds of use. Unless you want to do your trimming spread out across a day I&#x27;d recommend going with something else.</li>
            <li> I expected a lot more.  First of all, it&#x27;s very loud.  Second, it gets hot very quickly (yes, I used blade oil).  Third, the most important attachment (to me) is the rotary blade that trims nose hair and inside the ear hear, and this is not included, it has to be ordered separately.  Basically this was a downgrade over what I had previously.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for 4 years and never had a problem other than losing the attachments and charger when I moved. The battery lasted two years without me charging it. I only used it to trim my beard and man parts but I was impressed with the battery life!</li>
            <li> Product works very well, only reason for rating it a four stars is because it pulls the hair a little at certain angles.</li>
            <li> I have had a couple of (All in one trimmers) over the years.&lt;br /&gt;I would have to say this one is the best one I have ever had.&lt;br /&gt;I would strongly recommend this trimmer !!!&lt;br /&gt;Also there are plenty of different attachments included which is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;It also has a attachment to shave although my regular shaver does better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great trimmer !!</li>
            <li> The best trimmer we have ever purchased! Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased! Does everything it said it would do! That&#x27;s all!</li>
            <li> Best trimmer! I use it to trim my beard, since I can&#x27;t shave because of my sensitive skin.  Purchased a bunch of different brands before this one and they all stopped working after a while.&lt;br /&gt;The battery lasts a couple of days, the accessories are very complete, and the trim is very fine.</li>
            <li> No clean cut for professional look</li>
            <li> Does not hold a charge.  I think I got a defective one and would like to give it another try, if manufacturer would please work with me on this.</li>
            <li> The unit stopped working, I think it&#x27;s a battery issue.&lt;br /&gt;It worked as advertised for a short while.</li>
            <li> item works great, holds great charge nice and sharp</li>
            <li> I use this great trimmer all the time. I am still on my first charge of the unit. Long lasting battery. Great accessories.</li>
            <li> Although gift hasn&#x27;t been opened, I&#x27;m happy to say it came in perfect condition, original box and packaging- which made me so happy! It will be given as a gift, so ill be back to let you know how he likes it!</li>
            <li> Review for:  Wahl 9854-600 Lithium Ion Trimmer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  Don&#x27;t get the version of this that doesn&#x27;t have the lithium battery, it only lasts a very short time.  I swapped for this lithium ion one which works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Fits great in the hand for control.&lt;br /&gt;- Perfect for pre-shave cut-down of hairs under the chin and on the neck, makes the actual shave quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;- The lithium battery version lasts plenty long enough between charges.&lt;br /&gt;- Made in the U.S.A they say, for those that care about that.&lt;br /&gt;- Certainly powerful enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- There is no warning LED/LCD that recharge is needed soon, which is not critical with the lithium ion one of these but seems like a missing feature.&lt;br /&gt;- There is no hair vacuum which doesn&#x27;t matter to me but others might care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:&lt;br /&gt;------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I don&#x27;t know how well it works on mustache or goatee.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous about this purchase as someone I know had a Wahl trimmer that they were less than impressed with.  When I used it for the first time I thought this was the closest to a professional trimmer I have ever used.  It was almost like the salon trimmers.  I highly recommend this to anyone looking for an all in one trimmer.  It did seem that the charge on the unit might not last as long as some other trimmers I have used in the past, but I think that is due to it being a little more powerful.  Great overall product.</li>
            <li> The shaver is great! No question about that one. It cuts close and has very little vibration compared to my other hair clippers. This is a perfect product for bald men like me and it&#x27;s a perfect travel companion. If you like a close shave, after a few days away from home I&#x27;m ready for a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My issue is with the decision to include the stand as opposed to a travel bag. The issue is that the holder is not well conceived. There is no cover for it or a travel bag, which would have been the most ideal solution. The included stand is not practical at all. I&#x27;d never showcase something like this in my bathroom which relegates it to a drawer or cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While you won&#x27;t regret this shaver, you will just be a little disappointed that Wahl didn&#x27;t think the whole package through.</li>
            <li> Lasted two months and died. Over priced due to lithium battery.  I bought a $15 shaver that runs on AA bateries that has out lasted this piece of junk.</li>
            <li> I bought this clipper a year ago and have used it 12 times for cutting thin under-belly hair and fine ear hairs of my Golden Retriever.  It won&#x27;t hold a charge very long and quits cutting after several uses.  I bought more cutter blades thinking that would work.  Overall, I am very dissatisfied with the product and advise - Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I am surprised by the quality for the $30 I spent. The core unit is strong and solid in the hand. Not too loud, it&#x27;s got a good torque to it. Seems it would be at home in a professional portable kit. It feels like it could handle most of the same jobs as a full-size plugin unit, and has the benefit of being light and nimble. The attachments, which click off and on easily, are lightly built but seem functional and not about to fall apart. The shaver head is good, it makes a quick and close shave. I haven&#x27;t had it long so I can&#x27;t speak for the battery life, but it was fully powered out of the box. The charging system is just a small and light AC adapter with a cable you plug into the unit, not a charging base type setup. You can&#x27;t just set it on the base, you have to plug the little cable in. Anyway, a good to go little unit, and you can take the little charger with you when you travel.  EDIT  the attachments get rusty, they are made from cheap metal.</li>
            <li> very pleased with the quality and performance of this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for 5 - 6 months now and am satisfied with features and quality. The shaver adapter doesnt trim great but does work fine if ur in a pinch. All other features are great tho.</li>
            <li> [3 week Update: I omitted this before, but, I bought this unit primarily to shave my head. (I keep my pate at about \\&quot;stubble level\\&quot; because I prefer that over complete smoothness.) So, I decided to try the Wahl Li-Ion Trimmer as a replacement of my previous, 3 year-old wahl trimmer/shaver, which was beginning to have charging &amp; power issues. And I have to say that, -for this specific purpose- the Wahl Li-Ion doesn&#x27;t quite \\&quot;cut\\&quot; it. In fact, despite offering a more consistent beard trimming experience, it actually takes more passes over my head to get the hair down to that afore-mentioned stubble. (Go figure.) Apart from this, the rest of my review remains pretty much in tact...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About shipping/handling: I received the unit in only 3 days (ordered Sun.; arrived Wed.) despite my choosing the cheapest (read: \\&quot;free\\&quot;) shipping option. Kudos to Amazon for that! (I&#x27;m sure it doesn&#x27;t hurt that I live in Los Angeles.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the unit: Seems like a good, solid buy. Tested all the service attachments (blades &amp; dual-screen); 3 of the 4 seemed to work as well as any of the 5 or 6 shavers I&#x27;ve had in my adult life (though the dual-screen seems a skosh narrow for its intended purpose). The one attachment that seemed the least useful is the nose-hair trimmer. It just didn&#x27;t seem functional enough to warrant inclusion in the kit (though I think I understand why it was, given the niche for which this unit was designed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some have mentioned a qualm with the rubberized handle, noting that hairs seem to \\&quot;eagerly\\&quot; cling to it. Well ...duh. But I see it as more useful than annoying, since the sport of shaving can often involve slippage from the hand! Ergo: rubber is good! (c: (Here, I&#x27;ll also note that on the front of my unit - where the rubber meets the plastic - the upper edge of the rubber doesn&#x27;t perfectly align with the bottom edge of the plastic. A VERY minor flaw which would be a ridiculous reason to return it, but, it is what it is.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Vibration\\&quot; issues have also been noted by some as problematic. Here, I wonder about the experience of most folks - as, a good, strong unit is bound to feel &amp; sound like it - especially at this price point! It wasn&#x27;t a concern for me at all, and so far has only reinforced the initial impression I have of, well ...a \\&quot;good, strong unit.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for a word of pure praise: Kudos to Wahl for their quickly interchangeable head system. Wowie-zowie but is that ever useful. Once I got the hang of it, those suckers went on &amp; off with panache! (It certainly raises the \\&quot;useful\\&quot; quotient by more than a bit!) I sure hope this feature keeps working for years to come. If so, then, it&#x27;ll definitely be a winning feature, in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one *potentially* serious concern I have about its design is the Li-Ion battery. I say &#x27;potentially&#x27; because, for the most part, I think the battery is a strength(!) I mean, come on ...a full shave after only a quick, 3-minute charge?! Seriously, that&#x27;s a real benefit, folks. I have yet to test it myself, but, am thinking I may need to, given the fact that (and here&#x27;s my \\&quot;concern\\&quot;) a company representative admitted that the battery&#x27;s \\&quot;smart-chip\\&quot; -tasked with overcharge prevention- may also prevent any charge at all if the unit is left plugged in for more than 3 hours. (Note to self: unplug after 3 hours!) A tad annoying, but, problem easily solved, nevertheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, four stars (or maybe 3.75), due to the few (relatively) minor design flaws detailed above. Ultimately, though, I see this unit as a pretty decent deal - especially given the $32 price (sans shipping).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: the plastic stand isn&#x27;t quite as shabby as others have made it out to be. I&#x27;ve found it to be of pretty standard grade. Though, admittedly, it doesn&#x27;t do the best job of housing all the accessories.some as problematic.

            <li> I don&#x27;t know what y&#x27;all use to trim your facial hair, but Wahl&#x27;s Lithium Ion Clipper is the best. I&#x27;ve gone through about five different clippers in the last six years or so, and this is by far the best. I&#x27;ve always had the issue of my clipper&#x27;s battery dying out super quick and eventually losing it&#x27;s charging capabilities. I bought the Wahl in the first week of June and after about 2-3 uses per week, I have yet to charge it. The charger is still wrapped in the box. The clipper is easy to handle and has a lot of different attachments. I have pretty thick facial hair, and use this clipper to keep my goatee in check. It&#x27;s perfect. The attachments don&#x27;t pinch or poke my skin and the blade is sharp, keeping everything nice and even. Another great thing about it is the ability to be able to see where I&#x27;m cutting. This thing is no joke! I&#x27;ll never buy another clipper. The only negative part about the whole set is the lack of a carrying case to put all the accessories, which isn&#x27;t that big of a deal anyway. As long as it&#x27;s charged (which it always is) who takes more than maybe two clips? No need to hassle with the charger and 10 accessories.</li>
            <li> The only good thing about this device is that it&#x27;s a Lithium Ion battery (have not opened to confirm that). There is no charge indicator, direction really matters unlike other trimmers I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s probably decent at trimming a long beard to a short one but does not work well for trimming a short beard to stubble which is my 2x a week routine. Essentially it&#x27;s a small version of hair trimmers for your head, so not easy to follow contours, peels some skin if you go the wrong way, flings hair everywhere.  Ended up ordering a new battery for my Norelco 7775x and figuring out how to solder since that device works as I expect (the trimmer attachment) and is waterproof, has a charge indicator and is much easier to clean.</li>
            <li> Excellent choice and product.  Read reviews and decided this would be the trimmer I needed and I believe I was right.  Shipped promptly and had all the items.  Fair price.</li>
            <li> My grandson really likes this trimmer. It really helps him to keep his beard and sideburns in shape easily and neatly</li>
            <li> Awesome trimmer and I&#x27;ve gone through few of these. Quality and wow does it hold a charge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of personal groomers and this has remained my favorite. The first one I had stopped working recently after 6 or 7 years. I shopped around a bit but easily decided to order another one of these. Works great on sensitive areas, if you catch my drift.</li>
            <li> Amazon wouldn&#x27;t post my first comment, so let me try again.&lt;br /&gt;I would absolutely NOT recommend this trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;It is underpowered, and the battery dies quickly, then within a couple months is un-rechargeable...&lt;br /&gt;I could post a video of me taking a fully charged one, and I will turn it on and show you  how it dies within 30 seconds..&lt;br /&gt;oh, and if the battery conks out while you&#x27;re using it...it hurts.&lt;br /&gt;So, my review, do NOT waste your money on this trimmer.</li>
            <li> So I went into the store looking for the vac trimmer, and they were all sold out. I picked this one up and I am glad I did. I needed something that gives me a close shave w/o the blade. I use w/ pre shave lotion and this does the job perfect. Could careless about the other accessories honestly. Does its primary function well. Chargers in an hour and ive used it at least 4 times w/o having to recharge.</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer.  It gives a very close trim and the battery lasts long.  I have owned 2.  I just wish the replacement blade wasn&#x27;t so expensive.  It&#x27;s cheaper to buy a new set than a new blade.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this item; the first lasted three years. This one, despite following directions, never held a charge &amp; is completely useless.</li>
            <li> Battery doesn&#x27;t hold a charge when unplugged, even for a few hours. Not sure if my unit is defective or what. I like the razor, I just keep it plugged in at all times.</li>
            <li> Battery did not last very long.  Operated great but after 8 months the battery would not recharge and it would not operate from the cord.  Very disappointed in this brand.  Try Braun products.  Never regretted anything I bought from Braun.</li>
            <li> Like the title says, I&#x27;m on my second one of these, as the old one finally gave out (battery issue).  I got about four years use out of the old one, it had a Ni-MH battery in it, so I guess it&#x27;s really not a huge surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about this new one:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Same design as the older model, but it has a newly redesigned holding tray which will now hold all of the attachments (though the product packaging displays the old one).  The older designed tray never would hold them all, so some wound up sitting in a drawer.  As a bonus, now that I have this newer model I have backup attachments since WAHL stayed with the same design *nice*.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ New Li-ion battery -- it seems like it&#x27;s more powerful than the older version, though both work well.  The new battery requires less charging time, and seems like it lasts longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Plenty of attachments -- This is a biggie for me as I use this trimmer to trim all of the parts of the body that have hair on them.  I have had some of the other trimmers from other manufacturers and they typically come with the adjustable type of guides, or only a few attachments.  I flat out dislike those adjustables for detailed work, and I often forget what setting I need, resulting in having no eyebrows for a week or two *yikes*.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Well made attachments -- All of the guides are made of a durable, yet not \\&quot;plastic-y hard\\&quot; material.  Most of the other manufacturers include those hard plastic guides, which sometimes break (I have broken a few).  The blades all seem well made, they seem to be more precise than the others I have used from other makers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Soft rubber grip on the handle of the trimmer -- this is fantastic, unlike others I have used, this one does not slip around when using it.  On the downside, it does tend to collect hair on the grip when I am using it.  No big deal, as a quick wipe down/brush off will get it off, and I MUCH prefer the accuracy of not having it slip around in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things which I think could be improved:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I would like to get the rotary attachment with this, for the asking price, or just charge me a little more.  I would like to have it in the box, but I&#x27;m not likely to sit down and actually order that part separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The packaging needs to be updated with the new tray design, and somewhere in the packaging or instructions I would think there should be instructions on how to store the guides and other attachments in the tray holder...  Not a biggie, as with this one I was able to figure it out, but I can see some people not realizing that the front of the trimmer storage area is for storing a blade/shaver head.  The storage is one of the great features, at least in my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Replaceable battery would be nice -- as my old trimmer wasn&#x27;t what I would refer to as \\&quot;all used up\\&quot;.  I know I could probably send it to a service center since these come with a 5 year warranty, but that&#x27;s not something I&#x27;m likely to do.  I suspect that these use an 18650 Li-ion battery, if that&#x27;s the case I already have some of those.  It would be nice to just pop out the bad one and pop in a replacement vs. buying a whole new trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Back to the tray, I think the new design is much, much better (Kudos WAHL!).  It holds everything this time, but for me it would be nice if the tray had the charging adapter built into the bottom of the trimmer holder.  I find it kind of odd to have to guide the wire and plug it in separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this trimmer and the attachments that come with it, as can be evidenced by the fact that I bought a second one :)  This is a great trimmer for the \\&quot;semi-pro\\&quot; in you, that wants to have that chiseled look, and control body hair all over.  It&#x27;s a versatile tool that is well thought out and lasts a long time in comparison with some of the other products on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this trimmer!and.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things which I think could be improved:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I would like to get the rotary attachment with this, for the asking price, or just charge me a little more.

            <li> This is a far cry from the clippers I&#x27;ve used in the past. First, i was amazed at the number of attachments included in the set. It can do everything from shaving to standard haircuts to more complex \\&quot;man-scaping.\\&quot; It comes with a neat holder for the rechargeable device and the aforementioned attachments, though I wish it were big enough to keep the instruction book with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It recharges quickly and cleans easily. The power adapter has a detachable cord so you can focus on the hair and not the trimmer. If you&#x27;ve got a safe spot to sit this set on the counter, you may find yourself doing little grooming tasks that seemed too much hassle to do before. It took me a little time to get the hang of changing the grooming heads, but once you know how to do it, it&#x27;s literally a snap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d particularly recommend this for men with beards or high maintenance haircuts that need to be trimmed every couple of days. It will save you a fortune not to mention all the time it might take to run to a hairdresser or barber, and the cordless possibilities free you up to move away from the mirror. I used it to cut my elderly father&#x27;s hair, and we went out in the yard so I didn&#x27;t have to sweep up the hair. No mess in the house, a quick, clean cut, trimmed eyebrows and groomed neck in just a few minutes. What an amazing convenience!</li>
            <li> This is one great trimmer, however it&#x27;s not perfect.  It comes with just about all you need to trim, cut, style hair on any part of your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to charge (just plug the bottom in) but there is no light that goes on while it charges or goes off when it&#x27;s fully charged.  So you need to time it (directions included).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Changing the actual razors/trimmers takes a bit getting used to (or at least it did for me) as it&#x27;s a out and up technique that you have to get just right. But when you do it&#x27;s easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nose hair trimmer I found to be a bit large and I have to angle it to work right.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s due to my having small nostrils or what. But it does cut those nose hairs well and gives a tickle as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is loud.  Perhaps it&#x27;s due to my using it in a small bathroom, but don&#x27;t expect to use it and not have others in rooms around you not knowing you have it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As some others posted here, there are a lot of parts to it.  However that&#x27;s good as they are clipper attachments for those who shave their hair.  Example say you shave your sides with a number 4 and the top with a number 2.  Then you have the attachments to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would of bee nice for Wahl to include a bag or such to keep everything inside (cord, attachments, etc.).  I purchased a small overnight shaving bag and keep everything inside.  And yes, it does include a stand but this is my next topic...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand included, I&#x27;d advise anyone who wants to use it to somehow anchor it down with either double sided tape or such.  The reason being is the stand that comes with this is way to light to support everything without it falling.  I had it all set up nice, used the trimmer and put it back in the stand and BAM....it all fell down and everything went all over the floor.  Luckily nothing broke and I found everything.  So now I keep it all inside my bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the one thing I&#x27;d say is Wahl could add some weight to the stand.  Otherwise, when you&#x27;re finished just give the trimmer you&#x27;re using a good blow of air to get the hair out and you&#x27;re good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It even comes with a small container of oil to lube up the blades!  And the blades well oiled (you&#x27;ll smell it on your fingers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise this trimmer does a great job trimming, shaving, etc.  any hair on your body.trimmer you&#x27;re using a good blow of air to get the hair out and you&#x27;re good!

            <li> the foil cutter cuts my stubble better than a $90 brawn i bought or a $200 Phillips norelco trimmer I returned.</li>
            <li> my husband love this trimmer. He said it is very strong and works well. He actually says something about just about every time he uses it.</li>
            <li> Many different attachments.  Works great!</li>
            <li> Did what its supposed to do until the battery won&#x27;t hold a charge. With the trimmer plugged in, it still doesn&#x27;t have enough juice to actually cut hair.  I bought this model for the better battery and am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I can charge the trimmer over night, but the next day when it comes time to use it, it will only fast for 5 minutes of use.  I called customer service and they want me to ship it to them, but what do I use in the mean time?  There is clearly an issue with their batteries. I wouldn&#x27;t mind if i can continue using the trimmer while its plugged in, but the trimmer doesn&#x27;t run off the power outlet.</li>
            <li> I use these tools all the time, and this particular model has been very reliable.  The various tools are fairly easy to change, once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for the same model that I bought in a store several years ago.  Good strong battery and motor. Works well. Charges fast (1 hour).  Attachments for everything.</li>
            <li> This tripper came to my home without one of the attachment advertised in the Amazon site.  The trimmer is light and has good power.  A major complaint is that the trimmer has soft plastic or rubber ( I&#x27;m not sure which) to which trimmed hairs stick.  They are very difficult to remove - a cleanliness concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  gh</li>
            <li> Battery won&#x27;t hold a charge after only a few uses.  It nicked me in a sensitive area a few times before the battery gave out.  There are better options out there, avoid this one.</li>
            <li> Worked great at first. Had it for two months and now it runs only for about 30 seconds at a time before quitting. Not sure what the issue is but I&#x27;m pretty disappointed. Tried to return it but the return policy doesn&#x27;t allow for a return after 30 days.</li>
            <li> Looked for a trimmer set that was all incompassing and found it. Love the lithium battery too, lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a go-to trimmer for a few months now, and this is the one. I keep about a 1/2-3/4&amp;#34; beard, and it has to be neatly trimmed for the office. A lot of these trimmers have an obscene amount of attachments and accessories, but I was basically just looking for one that 1) had an accurate variable length trimmer 2) had a nose hair attachment and 3) didn&#x27;t require multiple passes to trim the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a Remington for $20 at a TJ Maxx, but multiple passes had to be completed to cut all the hairs. I had also tried a gimmicky one with a vacuum (girlfriend always complaining about tiny hairs in the sink) but that cut even worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great value for the money and had everything I was looking for. The super close attachment also works well to clean up the neckline after the first pass with the metal head. Would recommend to anyone looking for a reliable beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> Have ZERO complaint toward either the product or seller. A thumbs up for both. Just what I wanted and expected.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done well!!</li>
            <li> Pros: Li battery makes a HUGE difference. Good strong motor and the charge time is exactly as advertized.  It says that it has three hours of battery life which seemed too short at first.  However, unlike all other clippers, the Li battery will not discharge unless It&#x27;s on.  So it&#x27;s three hours of actual use.  The precision detailer works great lining up my mustache.  The trimmer leaves an even shave with or without the guide comb.  I&#x27;m a safety blade shaver so I haven&#x27;t used the foil shaver.  Again, the difference with this thing is the battery.  It claims more power, and it definitely delivers with a very strong motor. The rubberized grip is a nice feature, even with wet hands.   Cons:  Really the same cons as most clippers.  The base doesn&#x27;t hold the charging cable down so it&#x27;s easy to knock the base over if you&#x27;re not careful - but every clipper I&#x27;ve owned had the same issue.  Overall It&#x27;s the best trimmer I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> Bought it here on Amazon for a very reasonble price and it was shipped really fast, the price could not be beat. Works great on the kids when linning up there hair cuts, battery holds a good charge, not a bad product, would recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s looking for a cordless trimmer.</li>
            <li> I have already 1 month and I am very pleased with the product. There are many accessories that can freely remove unwanted hair from the body.</li>
            <li> 60 Day Money Back Guarantee and 5-YEAR LIMITED WARRANTY!  I had to say that first because so many negative reviews obviously missed these words on the Operating Instructions that came with the unit, and they also do not appear on the Amazon website.  Much grief can be avoided by reading instructions carefully.  They also say &amp;#34;Do not use the trimmer while it is charging.&amp;#34;  It only takes 1 minute for a Quick Charge to provide 5 minutes&#x27; use, they say, or 60 for a full charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned a Wahl 8900 for a long time, maybe 15 or more years; it was a gift from a professional cosmetologist family member.  I was originally planning to replace the battery and blades, but that would have been two-thirds the cost of a new one.  While comparing prices on a new replacement I discovered this model.  I was already sold on Wahl based on the quality of my first one, but leaped at the opportunity to purchase Lithium-Ion technology based on my 30-years&#x27; experience with battery-powered hand tools and the evolution of battery technology in them.  Lithium-Ion is the current state of the art for most consumer-level products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opened the box, read the instructions, and gave the unit its recommended 1 hour charge before first use.  I struggled a little to understand the instructions for adjusting the trimming guide, but once I understood it was pleased by its beard-trimming performance.  Then a little more effort to understand the instructions for changing heads, but they are literally a snap to change once you get it.  I am also pleased with the Detailer head, and thrilled with Dual Shaver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, I&#x27;ve only had my new Trimmer/(Shaver) for one day, but I&#x27;m looking forward to 59 more days to be convinced that I&#x27;ll be happy with this purchase for at least 5 years (as per Guarantee, Warranty, and previous experience).  If not, I&#x27;ll let you know.</li>
            <li> I use my trimmer for my goatee and to trim down the hair on my head prior to shaving it. For those uses it gets 5 stars.   The foil shaver would probably work well on peach fuzz, on my face it left too much behind. I got a closer shave from a well used safety razor, 3 stars.  The wide trimmer and accessories meant for hair trimming I really haven&#x27;t tried and probably won&#x27;t. Its that whole billiard ball look I sport.  The nose/ear hair trimmer works well as the various combs and rakes for the beard trimmer. They can be a little challenging to set on the power unit but that gets easier with practice.   The biggest advancement over older Wahl models is the Li-ion battery! A one hour charge gets me through 2 weeks of use. This includes an every other day beard touch up and a whole head shave.  As far as noise and vibration, its a hair trimmer. Its going to make noise and it will vibrate. There is not much way to engineer that out of a hand held device that small. It is in no way uncomfortable to use or difficult to handle because of it.  The little organizer really isn&#x27;t worth much. I kept the box and use it to store and organize my unused and little used accessories. The power unit, narrow trimmer, nose trimmer and two of the beard trimming guides go in a ziplock bag and travel with me.  I&#x27;ve owned trimmers from Wahl, Norelco, Remington and Oster. This particular trimmer from Wahl is my all time favorite.</li>
            <li> I purchased a Wahl trimmer years ago that I just LOVED!  It finally fell apart, but it lasted for at least a decade!  I couldn&#x27;t find that trimmer again, so I purchased a Phillips/Norelco that partly broke almost immediately (the attachment \\&quot;length adjustment\\&quot; plastic piece was flimsy and weak), and I had to hold it very carefully when I trimmed, or else it would slip down to #1 and cut my beard too short.  Well, I dealt with that for about a year, and then found this Wahl!  So excited!  Then so dissappointed :( . the unit itself is strong and powerfull, and feels well built, but I have yet to find an attachment I like.  The attachments are flimsy and cheap, and there isn&#x27;t a good one for a short (#2) beard like mine.  I found one attachment (again, the adjustable one) that trims o.k. on setting #2, but the length of the cut is VERY dependent upon the angle at which you hold this too your face.  Change the angle, change the length.  Some people might like this, but I don&#x27;t.  I really don&#x27;t want to be thinking that much about it.  I just want to trim and go.  Oh, well.  I&#x27;ll probably keep it and just deal with it, but I really wish I could find a *new* one of my old Wahl trimmer!</li>
            <li> It does exactly what I need it to do. The battery lasts for months without needing to be recharged. Solid purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that the heads begin to rust almost instantly, which seems weird. They still work fine, but look kinda gross. And I only use the main trimmer, not the little attachment guys, so I can&#x27;t really rate those bits. Cheers.</li>
            <li> IT DID HAVE TO TOLLS THAT CAME WITH IT BUT BLADES WERE GREAT PRODUCT WAS NOT AS LOUD AS OTHER PEAPLE SAID IT IS VERY GOOD FOR PRICE!</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer because my former trimmer, also a Wahl, no longer held a charge after many years of faithful service.  This particular trimmer was attractive also because of its rechargeable feature and the fact that it&#x27;s made in the United States.  Unfortunately the unit had too many attachments for which I have no use, and I had to discard them.  It would be preferable to buy the basic unit with charger and one trimmer.  The remaining attachments should be grouped as optional accessories for particular purposes, such as hair cutting, beard and mustache trimming, etc.  Hopefully grouping accessories as separate items would also lower the cost.</li>
            <li> About the only intuitive thing about this thing is the on-off switch. I bought this to replace a cheaper Remington model on which the guard I use most frequently finally broke. On the positive, the stubble guards on this work  work better once you manage to get them on and it seems to cut better -perhaps because it operates at higher RPM, or just that it is new. But that&#x27;s about the only nice thing I have to say about it. I just about can&#x27;t stand any other aspect of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Changing cutting heads is just awful. This stumped me for a good ten minutes of trying before I got frustrated and referred to the directions. Yeah, I know RTFM, but seriously, something this simple shouldn&#x27;t require it. I&#x27;m a very mechanically inclined person who can usually figure just about anything out. It shouldn&#x27;t be that hard. Then once you DO get the cutting head you want on, the guards are VERY hard to get on and off. The markings to indicate which length each is are very hard to see and aren&#x27;t very intuitive either - Roman numerals for stubble guards 1 to 111. I wasn&#x27;t sure the little lines were even indicators at first, until I examined all three in bright daylight. I don&#x27;t know about you, but I shave in the morning. My eyesight isn&#x27;t that great first thing. This is where the Remington had an advantage- a single stubble guard that was adjustable, and very clearly marked for each depth setting- with Arabic numbers 1-6.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;charging base&amp;#34; is just plain lame. I had to refer to the instructions just to figure out how to fit everything on it, and even at that, it was a total puzzle. Basically, it is just a place to set the handle after you plug it in. The cord doesn&#x27;t mount to it, there&#x27;s just a cut out to allow room for it. And speaking of charging, there is no light or any single indicator to let you know it is charging or is done. The base itself is just useless. If I keep this thing, the parts are going in a drawer and the base is going in the trash. Then again, I may just take advantage of Wahls 60 day money back satisfaction guarantee and return this piece of junk.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!  Works well. Great value.</li>
            <li> it comes with cheap plastic add-ons that no one will ever use. Meanwhile my package was clearly used since it had finger marks all over it. Certainly not worth the $40</li>
            <li> Does a good job, I reccomend very much</li>
            <li> An excellent beard trimmer with a number of attachments at a very reasonable price. I&#x27;m buying one for each of my two sons.</li>
            <li> A really nice, complete grooming set. I would have given 5 stars but the trimmer head arrived with 2 broken teeth... so now I have to deal with getting it replaced. Not a good showing for build quality, but the rest of the kit is great so I will get over it I guess.</li>
            <li> This also is a great trimmer &amp; I love how It makes me look.</li>
            <li> I have owned this model before and this one is great just like the last one.  Many different attachments and length guards.</li>
            <li> I probably should have bought the heavy duty one to trim my husky dog.  But I did that in the past and spent a lot more money, dropped it &amp; broke.  So, for a much cheaper price, this does fine, just takes a little more time.  Also use on my horse&#x27;s mane.&lt;br /&gt;Good, hard working trimmer.</li>
            <li> Bought this trimmer from Target about 18 months ago. The attachments leave a lot more to be desired. The battery is a joke and no longer works. I have to leave the trimmer plugged in to &amp;#34;charge&amp;#34; up before I can even use it and then if I take it off the cord, it no longer works. Essentially I have to power up a wired charger before I can use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It trims facials hair so it&#x27;s got that going for it. I paid ~$40 for a trimmer that no longer works without being plugged in for at least five minutes and with a ton of attachments that are essentially worthless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also tried leaving the trimmer plugged in overnight and then using it in the morning unplugged, it won&#x27;t work without being plugged in, it used to work wireless, but it will not work without being wired now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably would not purchase again</li>
            <li> First impression:  this thing is loud.</li>
            <li> Great item! Son loved it.</li>
            <li> Feels a little cheaper than the last Wahl model.  I liked my older Wahl because it was all metal. This model has a body made mostly from plastic.</li>
            <li> I bought this at my husband&#x27;s request for Father&#x27;s Day. He loves it! It is quiet and efficient and holds a charge so that every other day grooming of his mustache and beard is not a chore.</li>
            <li> I bought this machine and literally used on my two kids to cut their hair one time each. First week, I had to request a refund, it just stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did good when it did work but I thought I was buying a bigger machine. This one is slim. More for facial than hair cuts. The other bad thing is it pulled their hair.</li>
            <li> A real piece of junk. It never held a charge and stopped working entirely after 6 weeks. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This is one powerful little trimmer.  It&#x27;s nicely shaped rubber handle provides a sturdy, precise feel.  As others have stated, there are a lot of attachments, almost too many.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the small precision attachment is my favorite.  It works well in the nose and ears, although I wish there was an even smaller attachment for these areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst attachment by far is the shaver head, which is a real disappointment because I was hoping I could use it instead of buying a separate electric shaver.  Not only is the shaver too small, I just can&#x27;t get it to cut anything, no matter how short the hair is first or how taught I make the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The docking base is a nice touch, although a cover for keeping it dust free would have been nice.  It also would have been nice if you could charge the unit in the base itself, but you have to plug the unit into the wall using a separate adapter.  Also, the instructions that came with this trimmer are pretty bad, and it made it difficult at first to figure out how to attach some of the accessories and which ones to use... they refer to the attachments by name throughout the instructions, but don&#x27;t provide illustrations of each attachment with their names next to them so sometimes I found myself saying \\&quot;which attachment is that?!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, 4 stars for the flexibility, power, and quality of the trimmer.</li>
            <li> Trimmer is ok. I was going to give it less stars after using it but it grew on me. It is more effort to use than my other trimmers that have different settings for the trim. It uses combs like a pro set of clippers. More maintenance is required for the blade that regular trimmers. At first it was a pain switching combs. Then I went back to my other trimmers and found out that this thing has power and will cut more and not bog down like the others. So it is a tiny version of its big brother pro units used by barbers. I am happy with it now. Small super powerful. Wish it could be submersed though.</li>
            <li> This is very nice. It cuts smoothly. It charges fast and stays charged for a long time. Has various attachments for all your hair trimming needs.</li>
            <li> Shipment arrived promptly. Everything that was stated was included.  Trimmer has a very powerful motor, But there were only 3 depth attachments, which are only good for short buzz cuts. Also, like other reviews, the hair clippings stick to the body and are difficult to get off. I have used this three times so far without re-charging. All in all, I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> this is the best wahl shaver i&#x27;ve used for my face in the past ten years. it&#x27;s long-lasting battery and powerful motor deliver exceptional results. it&#x27;s also stylish and sleek, if that matters to you. the extra components it comes with make it a great buy.    one drawback - there should be a charging indicator light as in other models which lets you know when the unit is charging and when it has completed.    another excellent product from wahl - i&#x27;ve come to only trust wahl for my shaving needs.</li>
            <li> I bought the Wahl Lithium Ion All in One Trimmer to replace my corded Wahl hair clipper to keep my hair trim short. While the T-blade head is about a 1/4 inch narrower, it does a pretty good job. The cordless feature is very convenient and provides better control. Lithium ion battery is superior to other types commonly used in shavers and trimmers. Make sure you look for the lithium ion description when you order. I believe a non-lithium version is also sold, sometimes for the same price.&lt;br /&gt;There are a few things that could be improved on:&lt;br /&gt;- a better organizer for all the accessory pieces&lt;br /&gt;- a guide for eye-brow trimming to be used with the nose hair trimmer&lt;br /&gt;- pieces of hair stick to the black finish of the trimmer handle and is a hassle to remove. A different finish may be better&lt;br /&gt;- an indicator light to show battery is being charged would be nice&lt;br /&gt;- some of the guides are tricky to put on&lt;br /&gt;- better instruction manual&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> So I researched various grooming/shaving things, and Wahl seemed to get a lot of good reviews, and this product seemed to be good for an \\&quot;all in one\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;The trimming heads work as well as trimming heads should. So that&#x27;s good, right?&lt;br /&gt;The shaving head is bad. I mean, if you&#x27;ve gone a few days and need to clean yourself up without being all close-shaven, and you don&#x27;t have anything else handy, it can work. But with my piddly one day stubble, I didn&#x27;t notice a difference between shaven and unshaven. The crappy little instruction paper said to stretch your skin and shave against the grain. Pretty much the two things I have learned over the years to *not do*. So maybe I&#x27;m doing it wrong by not doing that. Still, I pulled out my Mach Whatever Vibraty razor and shaved myself much better and faster.&lt;br /&gt;The detail attachment is good because it&#x27;s not big. So that works as advertised. The extra attachments are numerous. Some of the heads have a plastic bottom which makes me nervous for long-term usage, but only time will tell how sturdy they tend to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s not a bad trimmer. I wouldn&#x27;t use it for shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, it&#x27;s comfy to hold, too; that&#x27;s something.</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I ever had. (I have had plenty.</li>
            <li> Great clippers for my dogs needs midway between grooming trips to the salon.  The have stood up perfectly.</li>
            <li> We ordered this trimmer to do touch-ups on my husband&#x27;s hair between haircuts.  It is great.  It is also very versatile.  The shaver is great for touch-ups also.  It has a good variety of attachments.  This will be put to good use around our household.</li>
            <li> Got this set as a gift for my Dad, he loves the set and uses it every day to trim his beard and even hair some times lol</li>
            <li> I have another beard trimmer that does a good job of trimming my beard but not above the lip. This one does an excellent clean close outline above the lip and is easy to handle. I just purchased it so don&#x27;t anything about how long it will last or hold up.</li>
            <li> The quality of this one is evident right away compared to ones that are similar in cost or cheaper.  Once you use this one you will be glad you paid a little bit more.  It is more powerful, cuts better, battery lasts longer, and is just plain better quality.</li>
            <li> The trimmer blade, especially with the 6-position trimming guide, does the job of trimming your beard evenly and neatly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver does nothing. Oh, it somehow manages to produce a fine dust from your skin, but the hair underneath will be almost untouched. I had to pull out my safety razor to finish the job. That is unforgiveable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The set includes attachment combs with guides in 3 sets of 2 parts. I think. Honestly, those six parts seem redundant with the 6-position trimming guide, or are for people as fussy as professional beard stylists... who would undoubtably use better equipment. They fit the trimmer head flimsily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A plastic stand is provided. A soft travel case is needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the name of the product, this device is almost useless on the rest of the body. Again, the trimmer works, but your shave won&#x27;t be close. Who wants back and shoulder stubble? As for the genital area, the curly hairs don&#x27;t go through the combs well and are not easily trimmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is easy but not easier than cleaning a regular razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, a poor choice for anything other than beard trimming, and completely and embarrassingly useless for shaving. I&#x27;ll stick to my regular razor.</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer new in December of 2010.  The trimmer worked well for 8 months before the battery began to fail holding a charge.  Now in March of 2012 I can&#x27;t trim my beard without stopping and recharging the battery.  Battery now runs about 8 minutes before completely losing its charge.  Too bad since this is a good trimmer otherwise.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband to replace his old one.  the razer works really well but there are too many attachments or not enough room for all of them, however you want to look at it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this trimmer for slightly over a year now, using it about twice a week. I had a nicad Wahl trimmer before this one and the difference in the length of time a charge is held is amazing and highly appreciated - I hardly ever have to charge this one. The trimmer is a great size, is really easy to change attachments for and is, overall, an extremely useful tool. Absolutely no complaints and I&#x27;d buy it again (but I doubt that will be necessary for a long, long time).</li>
            <li> Well I got this thing a few months ago after several people recommended it to me.  Now fast forward 5 months it worked today and no wont turn back on awesome right.  Seems like some sort of water issue possibly, but what good is a trimmer that cant get wet!  It seems no one makes a decent trimmer out there anymore.</li>
            <li> my husband used it  an in the second week it quit working , sending back and find something different don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for over a year and it is great, and still works!  we had a wahl before and it eventually died, but this rechargable one is great!</li>
            <li> We all have cameras on our phone and taking and providing an accurate picture is very simple. This item does not come with the nifty stand that the pictures shows. So if you have a drawer that you can stick all the accessories in your in luck otherwise you need to order a ziplock bag for the accessories.</li>
            <li> Bought this back in September 2014. And it&#x27;s now June 2015 and it&#x27;s dead. Didn&#x27;t make it to a year. This has to be the worst trimmer ever. It practically rips the hair apart instead of cutting it. Very painful. Dry, and wet. I thought it was the charger, but it&#x27;s been plugged in for 2 days and it&#x27;s still not working.</li>
            <li> attachements were a little hard to figure out, but I&#x27;ve had it for months and only charged it one time.  Very powerful.</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer.  It works great and the charge lasts a long time.  I normally use the adjustable comb at setting &amp;#34;3&amp;#34; to trim up my beard.  I also use it for overall body grooming, just take it into the shower, shave down, then shower.</li>
            <li> do not like the shape of the ear/nose trimmer, attachments do not switch out easily. Wish I could have replaced the Remington unit we had, but had to settle for this. Very disappointing; especially since we are very happy with our Wahl clippers.</li>
            <li> the trimmers wont trim close enough. yu have to keep changing out the blades to get a good close cut.</li>
            <li> First 6 months it worked fine and then it quit working after 7 months. No longer takes a charge or even works with it plugged in. I Don&#x27;t recommend it</li>
            <li> It was a good trimmer but I barely had it for 4 months and it messed up.. Im hoping Wahl has some sort of one year guarantee on this or something.</li>
            <li> wanted to groom our Yorkie .It would not cut his hair. Won&#x27;t trim husbands beard .</li>
            <li> Since my old one gave out I have been sampling trimmers.  Disappointed that I can&#x27;t find any truly great ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I liked about this one was the special \\&quot;detail\\&quot; trimming head that was less wide than normal and could help shape a goatee or get into hard to reach places.  It also has a ton of different blade heads and specialized guards and combs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like, and caused me to return it, was that it&#x27;s main function for me -- the beard (or in my case goatee trimming) -- was useless because there weren&#x27;t enough finite settings for the trim comb/guard.  At the second closet setting it did did a very messy, uneven trim.  At 1 it would make it so thin that it was barely above stubble.  It has only 6 settings where most of the dedicated trimmers have at least twice that.</li>
            <li> Lots of accessories to fill your drawer. Good product and compact design.</li>
            <li> Great head trimmer.  I use this trimmer weekly for shaving head/face.  I find it works better then the larger Wahl trimmers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s is a great trimmer for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Very powerful and I like the fact that it is cordless&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Too many attachments and not easy to switch between them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a very good and nice looking trimmer.</li>
            <li> GREAT CHRISTMAS GIFT.</li>
            <li> This razor has outlasted several that came before it.  Great bang for the buck.  I use this once or twice a week for routine trimming - nothing super heavy duty. No complaints at all. The lithium ion battery charges quickly and holds the charge for a long while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To help it last lubricate the blade every so often. You can pick up a spray can of blade lubricant for a couple bucks at most stores.</li>
            <li> This is smaller than you would expect, but seriously cuts hair, trims beards better than my old clunky NiMH cordless clippers. Has all the attachments you&#x27;d need for any job. Seriously great buy for the price. The tray is a bit pointless IMHO, I just keep it all in a ZipLoc in my bathroom draw.</li>
            <li> We got something just like this to take care of my dog and after seeing how well it worked, I decided to get one for myself. The different guards help with trimming hair while the different attachments like the wide blade and the shaver make it very handy  and allow you to do what you need to. I love using this to keep my body hair in check and it works great for personal grooming.</li>
            <li> Came quickly. The base that everything sits on is like all of these trimmers - CHEAP - looks like they could make bases that are truly meant to last, and be useful.</li>
            <li> I am an out of work drunk. When I want to look good though for womanizing this is a perfect product to trick the ladies into the sack!</li>
            <li> I use it occasionally for nose and ears only. Cuts OK, but the battery checked out after two years. It will only run for fifteen seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expected better.</li>
            <li> Worked well when I first tried it out. Then it stopped working for two days. I cleaned it up really nice, put it in a dry spot, and charged it. It appears to be working now.</li>
            <li> Read all the reviews, and purchased this because of the great ratings and reviews, and the fact that it has a lithium ion battery. Hubby is VERY pleased with the performance of this trimmer!!</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a quickly dying trimmer I&#x27;d owned for years. Loads of attachments for different lengths and multiple uses (face, head, noise, ear, etc). And the big kicker I almost bought this trimmer at walmart but they were selling it for $20 more at the time in store and $15 more on the website. To make it worse I mentioned that to the clerk in store and she said she couldn&#x27;t match it. When has walmart ever said that?!?! Bottom line: great product and buy it from amazon not walmart lol</li>
            <li> Perferct for my husband</li>
            <li> Nice lil clean up clippers</li>
            <li> Absolutely terrible trimmer.  Once it arrived, I charge the trimmer and it never kept a charge.  I was forced to keep it plugged in to use it until it finally quit working 2 months after I got it.</li>
            <li> Wow&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m honestly blown away with this trimmer. Batter lasts FOREVER, one sweet cut and it out performs my Norelco that I&#x27;ve owned for years. Very sturdy build as well.</li>
            <li> The Wahl comes with just about everything you could imagine. It works really well. You do have to constantly maintain it and it is not waterproof. It charges quick and the charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few months and it has held up well for me, I mostly just use the trimmers to keep facial hair under control, but the shaver is ok for every now and then. recommended</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t exactly sure what kind of trimmer to order my boyfriend, but he loves it! Good quality for a good price.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works just fine for trimming my beard and moustache, and also cutting my hair. It cuts very smoothly and is a good, easy size to handle.</li>
            <li> Works great on shorter beards, not as great on longer beards.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for at a great price. Well cared for this should last forever. I use this as a beard trimmer and it stays charged for weeks.</li>
            <li> The product itself works great, while it works! I bought this item for my husband and he used it for 1.5 months when it completely stopped working. Of course by then it was too late to send it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be buying this product again!</li>
            <li> Great trimmer. Have used for 3+ years with no major problems. Still works as good as the first day I bought it which includes weekly trimming of a full beard, using the T-Blade to shave/buzz my hair, and other body trimming as needed. I&#x27;ve tried other shavers to keep myself groomed and this one is a far step above in terms of quality, comfort, and versatility. It&#x27;s even been used it to design shapes in chest hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why not 5-stars then?&lt;br /&gt;As other reviews mention, the grip does get hairs stuck to it, but it&#x27;s worth it - just rinse your hands after using it. Probably good hygiene anyways. Only complaint - a single blade on the the trimmer blade broke about a year ago - the replacement is $18. A new one costs $40. Not worth it to replace as it still cuts fine with the guides placed over it. I do use professional hair clippers when the beard gets too long, then use the Wahl for clean-up. .</li>
            <li> I had the same model for about 5 years before it died and never had a problem with it and worked great.  I bought a replacement and after about 6 mo like the other reviewers it wont hold a charge or work when plugged into the wall.</li>
            <li> Given as a gift. Receipt of Wahl trimmer states easy to use and works well.</li>
            <li> This trimmer does trim... but it has serious battery issues that make it extremely frustrating to use. After using it for a couple months, it stopped holding a charge, so I can only use it when it&#x27;s plugged in. To make matters worse, even when it&#x27;s plugged in, it won&#x27;t work unless it&#x27;s been plugged in for at least 10 or 15 minutes. It&#x27;s very frustrating, and I&#x27;m very displeased with this trimmer. And so it earns my lowest rating for any product I&#x27;ve ever bought on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** UPDATE ***&lt;br /&gt;I was contacted by a Wahl rep (who read my review) and advised to contact Wahl&#x27;s customer support, and Wahl resolved the issue to my satisfaction. They will take the product back and send me a replacement model. I chose the Wahl Power Pro corded trimmer as my replacement model, because I didn&#x27;t have a good experience with the battery version. I notched my review up one star because of the good customer support. [I did have to wait on hold in order to talk with a rep, though, but that&#x27;s not a big deal for me.] The rep was friendly and helpful.</li>
            <li> Beards have grown in popularity and acceptance over the last decade. It is important to remember that having a beard is not a right, but a privilege. Not everyone can have a beard, but if you have been blessed with the genetics to grow one, it is your responsibility to respect and maintain it; thus ensuring many more decades of this glorious time period known as the Beard Renaissance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expected to give this trimmer 4 stars because I thought it had too many attachments and I appreciate simplicity. I have to say though, I&#x27;ve found many of these attachments very useful and of high quality. It also comes with a small zipper pouch, so I have had no problem keeping track of the accessories. Additionally, this trimmer feels as powerful as any corded/plug-in trimmer I have used. I am very impressed with this product and recommend it to any man who has a beard and/or other trimming needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now go forth and make your bearded forefathers proud!</li>
            <li> He loves it and so does his girl friend. He looks well trimmed now. He tells me it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Charges fairly quickly. Charge lasts a good long while. Still have plenty of charge left after 15+ minutes of heavy use. Fair price.</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing, I have been using it for many months and it does wonders. Love it love it love it.</li>
            <li> This trimmer offers up an excellent choice for those looking to get past the cheap trimmers with abysmal battery life.  I keep a closely trimmed beard and trim my head wit this thing.  I works like a champ, holds an amazingly long charge and offers great control.  They do offer an accessory that gives you multiple height setting which is not the best, but other wise I am very happy I splurged a bit.</li>
            <li> Pulled my beard hair out since the day I got it. Tried oiling all the different sized attachments and they all pulled. Purchasing a different beard trimmer. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I like all the attachments that come with it for the price. Then how good it works. I have been happy with the razor so far.  Fast delivery was a plus.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this unit for over a year. I use it to trim my moustache and goatee every 3 or 4 days. The multiple attachments makes for a clean job. Comes with a lube for the heads. Battery holds a charge for months at a time. I&#x27;ve only had to recharge mine twice.</li>
            <li> Seems fine, only used once, tried a few of the different fixtures all worked well. Product seems a little frail and I&#x27;m not convinced it will last, time will tell.  2/21/15 Battery dies, works fine for a while, now battery will not hold a charge. Bad idea to offer  a review without using product for a while!</li>
            <li> I am happy with my trimmer, it was fairly inexpensive compared to other options and has all the attachments I need.  The reviews about hair clippings gathering on the rubber grip are accurate, but the issue is of no real consequence imo.  I have only just begun to use these trimmers, so I can not speak to their durability, but I do believe that going with the lithium ion option was the right choice.  Battery life plays a large role in user experience with cordless trimmers (you never want to run out of juice halfway through a shave), I do not expect these to disappoint as many NiCad&#x27;s have in the past.</li>
            <li> I really like this Wahl shaver/trimmer. It has more gadget attachments to go with it than you you&#x27;ll ever use! From my usage of those that I might require, the attachments work well and are rather intuitive in their installation on the trimmer.  The trimmer works exceptionally well and holds its charge for quite a while. I didn&#x27;t measure the time from charge to charge, but it seemed to be quite a bit longer than other rechargeable devices similar to it.    The shaver attachment works well, though I prefer a wet razor.   The nose/ear hair trimmer also seems to work well.  The guides are easy to install and the device is an excellent trimmer between hair cuts and for eyebrows and cleaning up the neck.    Two gripes prevent me from giving it 5 stars:  1. The attachments don&#x27;t securely fit in the base. Heaven forbid that you accidentally bump it as it sits on your vanity - the light weight of it will send the attachments all over the place.    2. There is no indicator on the handset to let you know that it is charging or in need of charging.    I would definitely purchase one of these after giving it the trial run, but since I have it now, I can tell you I have already recommended it to friends.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best electronic razor/trimmer that I have used. It has a powerful motor, a battery that stores a decent about of charge and loads of accessories (16).     This trimmer is guaranteed to give you whatever cut you are looking for. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband.  He&#x27;s in the military and likes to keep his hair short.  He&#x27;s already gone through several different brands of clippers, which have all broken, and never worked well to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using these, he came up to me with a big smile on his face and said, \\&quot;look how short it gets my hair!  These are great!\\&quot;  For him, the best quality of these clippers is how close a trim they can give him.  Also, the fact that they&#x27;re cordless makes it much more convenient to use.  You simply plug it in and charge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does come with a lot of accessories that I can&#x27;t really evaluate because my husband doesn&#x27;t use them.  Things like, the electric shaver just seems kind of unnecessary to me.  The small &#x27;detailer&#x27; for shaving designs into your hair, can also be used as a nose hair trimmer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, when compared to the other brands we&#x27;ve tried, which are about the same cost, these seem superior.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a present for my husband - his old trimmer was on it&#x27;s last leg.  He was skeptical at first, but he tried it and he loves it.  Every time he uses it he says how great it is, how much power, and how after only a few minutes of charging, it is ready to use.  This is the best trimmer you&#x27;ll ever own.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I trusted the brand name Wahl.  However, I was really disappointed with what I got.  At times, it would completely fail to even turn on!  I admit, when it did turn on, it worked well.  I guess I will go buy the Remington Titanium, since I already know a few people who own it and it works very well.  The Remington is less than $20 too.</li>
            <li> Second one I have owned. Broke the beard trimmer attachment packing for a flight.</li>
            <li> Clipper are OK, however they do not come with all the attachments listed in the instructions/description.  Apparently Wahl packages this product with different options for different retailers.  This trimmer doesn&#x27;t not come with the 4-5-6 guards, meaning you can only maintain very short to no facial hair.  If you have a beard or goatee this is NOT the trimmer for you.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace a 20 dollar electric razor. While I appreciate the quality and simplicity, it doesn&#x27;t do as good of a job as cutting the hair on my head. It&#x27;s almost like the cutting head is too thick to accurately control it. It also likes to grab the hair on your face and has cut me to the point of bleeding several times.</li>
            <li> I got it for my dad&#x27;s birthday present and he loooooves it.  I purchased it in March - charged it and just recently had to re-charge it.  Its amazing.</li>
            <li> worked great for the short time it worked I used it about 5 times until it would not power on anymore hopefully I can get this replaced with a new item so I can actually use it long enough to give a proper review.... update got a new one and that one lasted about 2 weeks until it stopped working all together not sure if this is the first hair trimmer that cannot get wet or it is just poorly made</li>
            <li> An amazing product. Has met all my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;- Good battery life;&lt;br /&gt;- Comfort;&lt;br /&gt;- Variety of accessories;&lt;br /&gt;- Excellent cost-effectiveness.</li>
            <li> When i got this i charged it over night or so i thought. I have used it 3 times and then all of a sudden it just died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i tried using it while it was plugged in but it would only run for a few seconds then quit again. I am guessing the battery is faulty but i am not sure. gave it a 2 star because i did like it until it died, if it had lasted it would have been a 5 star review.</li>
            <li> Initially, I had gotten this Trimmer after reading a glowing review by an outlet(I don&#x27;t remember the name of the site) that stated that out of all the trimmers they had tried, this was the most consistent. That is unfortunately not the case. The Trimmer does indeed woke fine and and comes with a variety of ways to style your facial hair, it does occasionally chug when trimming. The motor doesn&#x27;t seem to be nearly as strong as the review had implied. Perhaps it&#x27;s due to my own thick facial hair, but if you&#x27;re looking for a Trimmer that won&#x27;t pull on your hair, you may want to look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my husband for Father&#x27;s Day and he is using it constantly.  It has great power and the battery has a very long life.  Figuring out the beard trimming features took a few minutes but wasn&#x27;t a big deal.  He is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> 3rd time i have bought this product, (1st teo from W-Mart.  I use it to trim my beard and baldie-locks head/scalp.  However, this one seems a little cheaply made and the on-off button has already popped off, but clicks back on.  My others never had this problem.  Overall I use it about 3-4 times a week and really like it.</li>
            <li> In the last 7 years I&#x27;ve owned 3 of these. I keep some facial hair all the time but I like to keep it trimmed. I&#x27;ve tried many different models but I keep coming back to this one. The one downside is the battery eventually dies and then it&#x27;s time for a new one. After about 18 months I notice it slowing down and after two years it&#x27;ll die. Other than that it&#x27;s a great little trimmer. Cuts close and even.</li>
            <li> Had to return one because of the battery. The new one is on the money, works great</li>
            <li> It pulls out the hair instead of cutting it. It is painful to use. I do not recommend buying it.</li>
            <li> My husband and son both love this. It makes trimming their beard easier.</li>
            <li> Excelente producto, tiene muchas posibilidades con los diversos cepillos para las distintas alturas de corte de barba, entre otros. Muy bien presentado. Excelente. Lastima que la garantia no sea Internacional.</li>
            <li> First, there is no storage tray as shown in the picture.  There is no charge indicator light on the shaver to indicate charging status.  The shaver itself cuts very well.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and deal</li>
            <li> Does not hold charge like I expected from Li-ion battery.</li>
            <li> Lasted maybe through one use. Never held a charge. Was not very powerful when charged the first time. Would not recommend or buy again</li>
            <li> Was a little skeptical about the compact size and the endless attachments, however, it&#x27;s become a part of my daily grooming. The charge lasts several days as well. If you are looking for a close shave or precision trimmer continue looking. If you need a simple machine that just works, you should be happy with this Wahl.</li>
            <li> It dropped and cracked but I put the pieces together and it is still going strong after lots of use.  I would buy this again without hesitation.  Lets my wife do haircuts at home in a half/hour and saves big money for us.</li>
            <li> I have used several different trimmers over the years, and this is by far the best.  A full charge lasts me for weeks of use.  I use it about an hour per week.  All of the attachments seem to work really well.  I have even used it to shave my head, and it worked well for that.  The case does not hold all of the attachments, although that really makes no difference to me personally.  This trimmer is really a cut above all the rest, and I&#x27;m so glad I found it 5 months ago.</li>
            <li> This turned out to work much better that expected. Very safe to use even without the guard. An added plus, this is excellent for trimming the fur between my dogs pads.</li>
            <li> ugh! hate this product! it has cheap plastic in the blades. i got it for my teen son to trim his beard. no matter what size blad we use, it keeps cleaning-up his beard instead of trimming it. i will be contacting the seller to return it.</li>
            <li> These clippers are awful.  It was decent for the first month.  The attachments were so-so.  The guard would slide back in mid trim to a shorter level with any pressure at all.  Started losing battery life fairly quickly.  Even leaving it plugged in 24/7 could not trim for more than 90 seconds before it would go dead.  Now dead all together.  DO NOT BUY.  Wahl has ruined their quality in the name of price.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer with ample power and quick long lasting charging system. The only thing missing is the ear and nose hair attachment. I don&#x27;t keep it the bathroom because I understand that humidity can be harmful to the units life-span. Three months into use and so far excellent!</li>
            <li> this product looses its charge after one day so must be plugged in each night.  the metal clipper attachments have begun to rust.  the rubberized handle holds static and so hair sticks to it.  it is not waterproof so you cannot rinse the hair off.  next time I will not buy Wahl.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this for me and after my last broke.&lt;br /&gt;I have owned about 1/2 dozen different trimmers that I used to maintain body hair and facial hair.  This trimmer works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Powerful, VERY long battery life - 4 months of 1-2 uses a week on one charge, light and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Tons of small parts that aren&#x27;t necessary for my use, not meant for travel, not very easy to change blades it you want to (The main blade is good for almost everything), the rubber handle gets hair clinging to it a little bit and I don&#x27;t know if it is water proof so I never soak the whole trimmer - just the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to a friend for my uses</li>
            <li> I own both this and PHILIPS Norelco G370. I can confidently tell you that this trimmer works WAY better:&lt;br /&gt;1. It cuts better and has a better blade.&lt;br /&gt;2. It has WAY more features.&lt;br /&gt;3. It can be used for heavy duty purposes.&lt;br /&gt;4. Seems more durable.</li>
            <li> Trimmer came with all the usual accessories however i also bought this item because it showed it came with the black base picture. That was not the case.....</li>
            <li> I have had this trimmer for over a year now, use it probably once a week on my go-tee and have probably put it on the charger 4 times. Its really amazing how long the charge lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly reccomend this item.</li>
            <li> I use this to shave my beard.  I use the guides to keep it at a specific length and bare (like it is pictured) to shave the neck and other parts of my face that I want as short as possible.  I hate shaving with a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s- Battery life is great.  I use this about 4 times a week for runs of about 3 -5 minutes and I think I have charged it twice in the 2 years that I have had it.  It&#x27;s lightweight and feels comfortable, easy to hold.  A lot of attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s and why I am looking elsewhere- the bare cutter (like pictured) does not cut close enough.  There is about a 1-2 mm overlap.  I am currently searching for a zero-overlap trimmer (with guides).  The guides that this thing uses pulls my beard hair!  It hurts! The rubber grip does attract hair that is hard to remove.  This will mess up your medicine closet/drawer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My current problem is trying to find a trimmer with zero overlap that comes with guides that extend past 3/16 mm.  I really don&#x27;t want to use 2 buzzers.</li>
            <li> This is remarkably the trimmer men can get. Its simply a miracle in its performance and always scores above my expectations. The reason I am writing this review is I want men to be aware of what they are missing on if they havent tried or used this before. You gotta use it to believe it. I wonder seeing most of the men vouching for Philips which is a piece of trash in terms of the sharpness of blades.&lt;br /&gt;Trimmers are simply judged by the smoothness of shave, and this has the finest blades which I havent seen in any of the other brands.&lt;br /&gt;Well if you want to test it for yourself, go to a store and check the sharpness of the blades, compare it with any Philips trimmer and you would find how Wahl is way too superior.&lt;br /&gt;I have read few reviews where people have been little disappointed, now that could be a fault with any of those particular pieces. So dont just build any false notions by reading those comments. Because beard grooming is the most desirable part of mens personality and this product simply makes your life easier.&lt;br /&gt;The usual challenge that every man faces is when our beard is grown for like 5 days grows little think and we have to shave it, 90% of the men simply go around straight to Raser without thinking its better to first remove it with a trimmer and then use raser.. because using raser straight on a dense shave will not leave your skin with any goodness.. being men doesnt mean you have to be harsh to your skin, be gentle rather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Points to note:&lt;br /&gt;Superior battery performance, lasts for like 5 to 6 times, quick charge, 3hours of total run time, and as per my experience one shave dosnt last for more than 15-20mints, so one can easily use 6 times in a single charge.&lt;br /&gt;Great grip and handling while trimming&lt;br /&gt;Gives closest shave ever than any trimmer, If you dont believe then use it. Even 2 days old beard can be taken care of.&lt;br /&gt;Precision Blades, Be cautious in handling it, because the blades are the finest so if you fall it may break. Blades are extremely gentle on skin.&lt;br /&gt;It lasts for years, I have personally used Wahl products for like 4-5 years and still they do best.&lt;br /&gt;Seek and attractive, easy to carry during travelling, light weight.&lt;br /&gt;Above all its MADE IN USA product not MADE IN CHINA which makes it more superior.&lt;br /&gt;Finally check the Pictures I have added to show you the sharpness of the Precision Blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just want men to be aware of this remarkable product&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;In short a man who doesn&#x27;t use Wahl for trimming, simply doesn&#x27;t value himself&amp;#34;it may break.

            <li> Love it! Been using it everyday for about a year and nor problems so far. Definitely worth it</li>
            <li> Decent little trimmer.  Only appropriate for light body hair &amp; facial sculpting.</li>
            <li> The best of the best all the sizes i  need to trip my beard thank you</li>
            <li> It works great for me. Battery has lasted a long time without a charge, I do keep a very close beard by using the closest shave attachment. It is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Bought this trimmer for my boyfriend, he charged it once in February and has used it fairly often. He hasn&#x27;t had to charge it since then.</li>
            <li> This is my second rechargable Wahl trimmer.  The first one was almost identical to this one.  Unfortunately after using the first one for 3 years, I accidentally dropped it in a sink of water.  I had done this 2 previous times and it still worked but this was strike 3 and it was done.  Clumsy me.  I liked the Wahl product so much, I purchased another one and I have been using it now for almost a year.  I use it most everyday.  I keep my sink empty now days while I use this one.  The number of accessories that come with this is amazing.  I have used most all of them at some point.  I only have to recharge my Wahl trimmer every month and a half.  The internal battery lasts longer on a single charge than anything else I have purchased in the past.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Whal, quality product and worth the money.</li>
            <li> Nice and compact, powerful with great battery life.  The spacer attachments for trimming beard/mustache length seem to grab hair quite a bit, I need some more time to mess with them, if I can&#x27;t fix that I&#x27;ll be using my old vacuum trimmer to occasionally trim length, but will still be keeping this for shaping as it works great.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer. It seems to be the most economical one to use.</li>
            <li> Not enough torque &amp; don&#x27;t cut close enough, if you want shiny bald look..these won&#x27;t do it. Pretty much stuck w/them now</li>
            <li> The shaver does everything that it advertised it would and I could not ask for more.  It arrived on time, in good shape with easy to understand instructions.</li>
            <li> Like the new ION battery</li>
            <li> Very nice product, would recommend to others , it&#x27;s very easy to use and has a lot of options. The interchangeable heads and guards are grest</li>
            <li> Have been using about twice weekly for only a little over a month, so I cannot speak to it&#x27;s length of life. But to date I have only given it the initial full charge and there has been no noticable drop in battery power yet. Love the full array of attachments. Just wish it came with a nice storage box, perhaps with slots and pockets for oranizing all the individual pieces. The cheap, plastic &amp;#34;organizer&amp;#34; tray that came with it went out to the recycling bin with the packaging. Not only did it not hold all of the attachments, but was made from such a thin plastic that it crumpled just by trying to put the pieces in their slots. Wahl should at least offer the option to purchase a nice, fitted organizer - either soft traveler or hard counter style (better yet, both).</li>
            <li> This is a really good trimmer comes with a lot of attachments. Has good battery life. The nose hair trimmer could be shaped a little better.</li>
            <li> Had hoped would be as well made as my previous trimmer. Difficult to remove attachments as the cutting unit wants to detach as well!</li>
            <li> all these reviews where people talk about how much it vibrates had me a little nervous about this trimmer but i went ahead and bought it b/c i liked the price and all the attachments.  The truth is, it vibrates just like the one i had before.  these all vibrate and shake in your hands.  I&#x27;ve used the nose trimmer, got it way up there and i&#x27;m just fine.  the attachments switch out easily and there are tons.  i really like that it has the shaver part.  i don&#x27;t know what you would call it, the thing that has the screens over the blades like a typical electric razor, its not really wide, but when i&#x27;m just doing my neck its great.  highly recommend this thing.  don&#x27;t be scared of the people that say it is loud and vibrates too much.  its an electric trimmer.  its supposed to do that.  oh, and the battery lasts an impressively long time.</li>
            <li> it makes too much noise, the battery charge is ok. I had to trim the adjustable small guide (with a utility knife) for it to trim the eyebrows at a predictable angle. This particular guide is badly designed. it should have a light, something, an indicator of how much charge is left. the nose trimer head is not too great either.</li>
            <li> Compared to this set of clippers all the other clippers that I&#x27;ve owned were like shaving with a dull knife. I love the battery life and charging time.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this kit!  Keeps its charge and easy to clean. Great value for the money.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love the battery life but it would be much easier to manage the many attachments if it came in a case with a lid for easy storage.</li>
            <li> Worst Wahl beard trimmer they ever made. I have purchased Wahl for at least 20 years and never was I disappointed...until this time. Stick to the basic versions this one the shaver head pops off and is difficult to put back on and then it broke.</li>
            <li> So far I have used it once to trim my thick goatee, using the adjustable guide and it did a great job. The only issue I have is that the guide is not smoothly adjustable. Other people that have bought this complained about the vibration, which I felt was not an issue at all. Switching heads was easy. However, switching guides was not easy. I wind up pulling the head off first before I get the guide off. I used the nose hair detailer once and was quite satisfied. This trimmer replaced my Remington beard trimmer which I&#x27;ve had for well over 20 years. The battery was not holding a charge but I could still use it with the cord. I felt it was time to replace it. I thought the Wahl all in 1 trimmer was a good choice for me since I have plenty of nose and ear hair. It also is powerful enough to handle my thick beard. I think it&#x27;s worth the money.  I would have giveb it 5 stars if I had no complaints.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through many sets of clippers in the past 20 years and these are actually the BEST I&#x27;ve ever owned, probably by a wide margin.  I do wish they came with a 1.5 guard, though.</li>
            <li> The best and most powerful I&#x27;ve used I can&#x27;t say enough about this set compared to others I&#x27;ve used in the past. The razor is always roaring with energy I am impressed with how rarely I have to charge this device. I use it probably once a week to trim my beard have had too charge only once since christmas.</li>
            <li> More crap made in some far off foreign land. Buy a cheap one, not worth the extra money. Good luck finding one made in the USA.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is amazing! Cuts great and battery life is excellent! Absolute best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned, this is my third. I Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Great product! Only thing I could say is the storage tray should be alittle bigger and the charger should be permantly attached to the base</li>
            <li> Good Razor, I am sure I will have to replace it in 3 years like the  last one</li>
            <li> Versatility is the key to this product. From basic facial hair trimming to actual hair grooming with the larger head and 3 guards!</li>
            <li> Used it twice....never worked again. Piece of junk.</li>
            <li> This is my first trimmer, and it does the job.  Could trim a little better at times, but works well.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is exactly what I wanted.  I&#x27;ve used it twice to trim my newly grown moustache and goatee.  I was very pleased.  I&#x27;ll give it four stars.  The last star could be earned if Wahl fixed the two criticisms below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, you should include the correct instruction booklet.  When I started to put it together, I looked for the button that made the trimmer head turn 360 degrees.  Whoops! That instruction applied to a different trimmer.  After a quick call to Wahl, a very helpful employee (I wish I got his name) explained the differences between the one I got and the one described in the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A second point--not all the parts fit in the stand as shown.  The double headed trimmer does not fit anywhere except in the first drawer next to my sink.</li>
            <li> this walh ion help my skin to be soft and nice :), but when i open the packcage, i notice some dirty in the handle, its look like used, but well cant do anything from venezuela, the warranty doesnt extent to my country, but its a pretty good trimmer</li>
            <li> VERY, VERY VERSITILE . MULTIPLE ATTACHMENTS FOR EVERY PURPOSE.  I LOVE IT. I CAN RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE LOOKING FOR THIS TYPE OF TRIMMER.</li>
            <li> its ok, not very close</li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer. Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband as a gift 2 years ago. He has had a beard for most of his adult life, and has declared this trimmer as the best performing trimmer he has ever owned - definitely 5 stars! The high quality of the plastic moldings for the guards over cheaper models adds to the rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer stopped working last year - it simply stopped while he was using it. So he mailed it in for warranty service/replacement. They honored the 5 year limited warranty (longest we&#x27;ve seen, to be sure), and a few weeks later, a working trimmer complete with brand new blades arrived. This earned Wahl, their warranty, and their customer service kudos and kept the 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> It works OK but two things get it knocked down. When charging the battery there is NO indicators anywhere showing that it&#x27;s actually charging or charged. No LED on the wall wart or the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;The other is sometimes it seems a little underpowered, I only use it once a week or so but who knows if its charged or not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I like- Lithium battery&lt;br /&gt;  - Many attachments</li>
            <li> First review: I purchased this product about a month ago, it worked fine for the few shaves I was able to get in but now it&#x27;s dead even when I have it plugged into the wall. Completely dissatisfied with this project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New review: After getting the other one replaced, my new trimmer has been working perfectly. Thanks for the great customer service!</li>
            <li> I use this for trimming and shaping my goatee and sideburns and these tasks are no trouble at all for this little shaver. It is very powerful and keeps its charge for a long time! All of the extra heads and attachments give you endless possibilities to shaving your facial hair. The only thing that I am bummed out about is that the stand shown in the picture does not com with the product. I got a travel bag, which, dont get me wrong, is good to have when I might need this when I travel; but I was hoping to have the base so I could have all of the attachments neatly organized on my sink counter.</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time &amp; it cut me to the point of bleeding!  It cuts your skin, do not buy!  I would want to return this!</li>
            <li> Dependability and the brand are excellent, gives me the close edge and professional look I need, outstanding product and a great value......</li>
            <li> All parts do not fit in storage base and some fit way to loose and fall out.  The razor itself works well. Direction were very poor.</li>
            <li> The rubber surrounding the handle sticks like glue with your hair.  All your trimming will stick to it and it is almost impossible to keep clean. Next time shaving, your hands are filled with hair trimmings and so is the place you store it. Such a bad material used, I can&#x27;t help but think that the rest of the materials inside were poorly conceived.  There&#x27;s a lot of one star ratings on this device, I would pass if not the fact that I got this as christmas gift.</li>
            <li> The trimmer and accessories are great for just about any beard style, I keep mine at a medium length, just past stubble and it is great for that look.  The parts are of good quality and easy to switch out razor heads.&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY down side to this is that the caddy it comes with to hold all of your accessories fails to hold them all and the ones that it does hold does not fit at all.&lt;br /&gt;If you dont mind keeping all accessories in the box until you need it, this is a great product</li>
            <li> IT has a lot of attachments for trimming that work great!  But  the shaving head just won&#x27;t cut no matter how short the stubble or how many times you pass over it! thinking of returning it</li>
            <li> My husband was very pleased with this product. It has a lot of extras. He thoroughly enjoyed using the accessories!</li>
            <li> Attachment  Storage is insane and is poorly designed.&lt;br /&gt;The Holder is totally impractical unsecure nothing stays in the Plastic Holder thing fall all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;Confusing storage compartment. What goes where???&lt;br /&gt;Give good shave to some with peach fuzz for hair.&lt;br /&gt;A real mans beard is another story all together.&lt;br /&gt;You Need to use ELECTRIC SHAVE&lt;br /&gt;or you will rip your face off trying to shave.&lt;br /&gt;end of story.</li>
            <li> This was ordered as a Christmas gift and getting it on time was important.  We got the gift in great shape and in time!</li>
            <li> This is a fine product that works very well and has many different options and attachments to multiply its versatility.  My only problem is the outside case has a rubber coating that is a magnet for any hair you may cut of and the tray that is suppose to hold it when not in use is a joke.  Mines all in a zip-lok bag.  But it charges fast and keeps doing its job.  Good buy in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This shaver has a long lasting, powerful battery. That was certainly refreshing after using some non lithium shavers previously. However, the attachments don&#x27;t seem as accurate and precise as others I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;ve had a few occasions where it&#x27;s given me some patchy uneven results. Also, as others have mentioned, everything sticks to the rubber grip. Odd choice of material for sure.</li>
            <li> So far so good!  Love the charging time and the use between charges.  Works good too!</li>
            <li> This is the second i buy , but because lost mine after 3 years</li>
            <li> It is very sharp and seems to do a good job, although a bit narrow for top head hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have used Wahl products for a long time and have had no complaints.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  Retains charge for a long time. Multiple attachments provide lots of flexibility to trim beards and hair.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really comment on the functionality of this product.  However I can tell you that it started rusting after about two weeks.  I didn&#x27;t even store it in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> I had to replace my old Wahl beard trimmer with a non-replaceable Ni-Cad battery that no longer holds a charge.  The new Li-Ion is basically the same trimmer I&#x27;ve enjoyed using for years, but with double the power.  Other reviewers commented on the beard clipper pulling hairs -- they are so right.  The heads are interchangeable with my old unit.  The old head on the new base doesn&#x27;t pull.  There is a slight difference in the shape of the clipper blades.  Wahl needs to go back to the old design.  I can pull each whisker out with tweezers on my own, if that&#x27;s what I want to do.  The noise is all in the clipper head, and is louder than the old one only because it&#x27;s moving twice as fast.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s what I expected.  Quality, performance, no frills.  I DO like the soft case that holds everything in one place -- no one mentioned that yet.</li>
            <li> I really liked this trimmer, but in a little less than one year it won&#x27;t hold a charge.  I am now contacting Wahl to learn how their warranty works.  I found that some of the trimmer heads were not real helpful for me.  I use it to trim my beard and mustache.  Changing heads from the regular one to the little trimmer can be a little problematic getting the head to seat properly.  Overall I like, but I did expect more than one year from the trimmer.</li>
            <li> I have had many trimmers in my day and this is the only one that I feel isn&#x27;t underpowered. I use it to trim my beard and shave my head. I had it for 6 months of steady use without having to charge it. Amazing! I would say that the weak point is the actual shaving head, but I don&#x27;t use it for that purpose. Overall it&#x27;s an excellent value.</li>
            <li> this is a very nice and functional trimmer with great attachments and it is made in the USA.</li>
            <li> Not feeling the highest quality - makes loud noises after a while, maybe it needs more lubrication. But it works reliably, battery life is very long.</li>
            <li> Solid trimmer for the money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Wahl rechargeable beard trimmer for 20 years It&#x27;s on its last legs. So time for a new one. Saw the ads for the Li Ion ordered &amp; received it. I absolutely in love with it. Some people complain about the noise but I found no problem. Also the beard hairs sticking to the rubberized handle. I tried using a hand brush &amp; got O.K. results. Tonight I got the brilliant idea of trying to blow them off, worked like a charm. Problem solved. Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> 3rd WAHL trimmer and the best one yet. I seem to get about 5 years out of each one.</li>
            <li> Works great, holds a charge for a full trim session, and on a high note, has a quick charge!!  Only &#x27;down fall&#x27;, my beard hair tends to stick to the black part of the handle, doesn&#x27;t clean off very easily.  Other than that, quick easy changes from trimmer head to trimmer head. Good product!</li>
            <li> It was great that I found these.  The blades actually fit the model that I&#x27;ve had for years and wore out the blades and had to purchase a new clipper set.  The battery lasts much longer on this one, I only have to charge every once in awhile.</li>
            <li> the battery is AMAZING, but after that you really can only use this for your beard or mustache.  doesn&#x27;t come with enough other sized filters</li>
            <li> This trimmer has served me well.  Wahl assembles these in the USA, as well, if that is any factor in your purchase decision.</li>
            <li> I have found the trimmer very useful and it has lived up to my expectations. I would recommend this trimmer, with its accessories, to anyone that has its needs.</li>
            <li> I shave around once a week, and I don&#x27;t have thick facial hair... this thing stopped working after about six months. Don&#x27;t waster your money.</li>
            <li> Bought my first one about 8 years ago and was shocked by how long it stayed charged. I literally would only have to plug it in once or twice a month and if I went on a trip I didn&#x27;t have to take the charger with me. It cuts amazingly and it isn&#x27;t loud at all. I used and abused that thing and it finally broke down not long ago. It seemed to stop holding a charge as well but still would cut. I could of kept it seeing as how even in its &amp;#34;broken&amp;#34; state it worked better than most other trimmers but decided to get a new one. I&#x27;m still using it today. Iv decided to go ahead and get the newer 9818 stainless steal one soon just because it thinner and cooler looking and I&#x27;ll let you know how it works out.</li>
            <li> It works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> My husband says this is comfortable to use.  He only uses a couple of the attachments at this point.  It would have been nice if it came with a bag to keep all the do dads together.  If it did it would have 5 stars.</li>
            <li> For the price it is hard to find anything wrong with this. Love the power the lithium ion battery provides.</li>
            <li> Love it lots of attachments nice little canvas case works great. I like that you can just keep it all in the case rather then on that stand.</li>
            <li> Broke after first shave. It would start for a few seconds and then stop.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really understand why this one got reviewed as the best shaver by wirecutter.&lt;br /&gt;I will be more skeptical of their reviews next time.</li>
            <li> Disappointed dull after few months thought that I would get the better brand, the more expensive one and it would last longer far from the truth lasted very short time worked great first few uses then went dull switched heads and that one went dull rite away I followed user instructions and oiled it before every use still went dull fast!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I have used Norelco and Remington beard trimmers, but this Wahl is the best by far.  The lithium ion battery really does last far longer between charges and, in addition, it maintains a consistently strong speed or &amp;#34;torque&amp;#34; as Wahl advertises.  This is simply a quality product at a good price.  I will never again waste money on a somewhat cheaper trimmer.  For just a little bit more the Wahl  lithium ion trimmer is far better.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t come with the guides like our old one</li>
            <li> Bought this to take out embroidery machine ooops.  Works very well for that function, at a lot less than the commercial stitch erasers.</li>
            <li> I use this at least three times a week to trim mustache and nose and sideburns. The charge lasts forever. I rarely charge it. When I have charged it, I leave it in overnight. I only use it for a few minutes at a time, but I expected the battery to die just sitting there. This is not the case. When it does get low, it pretty much just stops. The attachments are easy to change and fit great. The blades are sharp and still cut like new. I have had this for many months now.  Tip: use the bottle of oil for the blade. Makes all the difference in the world.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this again if this one ever broke.</li>
            <li> Everything you need for beard trimming and grooming. Provides excellent detailing tool for eye brows and nose trimming as well. I would make this purchase again.</li>
            <li> The heads are almost impossible to remove and replace.  My husband can&#x27;t do it and even I have difficulty.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer, love it.</li>
            <li> I have had this for 3 years and just bought another one as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine has worked flawlessly. It charges super fast and has a very long lasting battery. Within the first year a blade broke. I called Wahl and received the best customer service. I didn&#x27;t have a receipt and they just sent me a new blade and told me flat out those blades just should break and no questions asked the next blade showed up a few days later.</li>
            <li> The charge on this trimmer is impressive, seems to last at least a month. Accessories pop on and off easy and trimming heads are fast to swap with no tools. The trimmer is feather light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only issue is that for some reason the accessory base does not have slots for the wide trimmer attachments. You have to keep them in a little bag that comes with it. Seems like a design oversight. Don&#x27;t let this deter you from buying though, the trimmer is the important part and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: Apparently the one I ordered awhile ago is not the current model which does have an improved accessory base. Good for you the potential buyer, go for it! Just wish I could have gotten a new one.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend. Unfortunately, the grinder part doesn&#x27;t offer a shave even remotely close enough to be considered a clean shave.</li>
            <li> it has everything! love it I bought it for my husband for Christmas and he loves it so much its the best one I have ever seen</li>
            <li> This little shaver really amazed me. I&#x27;ve had it for 3 weeks already, haven&#x27;t even touched the charger. Its not that loud and easy to clean (comes with a very small cleaning brush but I reccomend a beauty supply alternative or something). The detachable blade heads all work well and are extremely easy to assemble when switching out. Its power is one thing you won&#x27;t have to worry about so I do reccomend this</li>
            <li> Good but works on electricity 110</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this little guy - it had all the makings of an awesome product at an amazing price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend this product to people, thus I&#x27;ve chosen 1 star as a rating - I don&#x27;t hate it, but it needs improvements in order to make it a useful product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had this trimmer for a month and it is an acceptable value for the money; however I&#x27;m going to return it because it causes more frustration that it is worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;1. The plastic guides to put over the wide beard trimming blade are cheaply made. I&#x27;ve bent a few of the &#x27;tines&#x27; and it is getting difficult to run through my fairly thick haired beard.&lt;br /&gt;2. The blades are rusty - and I haven&#x27;t used it on wet hair.&lt;br /&gt;3. Blade changes are sometimes quite difficult and frustrating. I have found that this is dependant upon the location of the rotating post that drives the blades.&lt;br /&gt;4. Hair sticks to the handle causing some minor annoyances while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Cosmetic Quality: The unit is not made well - the top chrome plastic piece does not mate with the black base, leaving an unsightly gap. This is undesirable; however, it has no impact on performance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives:&lt;br /&gt;1. The motor is STRONG! It cuts through my tough hairs like buttah!&lt;br /&gt;2. It includes 3 blades and a shaving attachment. The 3 blades are great! (I use a straight razor to cut my non-beard hairs so I have no input on the Dual Shaver Attachment)&lt;br /&gt;3. It is highly portable for travel.</li>
            <li> I have only had it about 2 months but so far it is exactly what I was looking for.  I use it about once every 4 days do it does not get a lot of use but it is still on its initial charge.  I am very pleased with so far.</li>
            <li> Works well, but it&#x27;s not an all-in-one as it lacks the ear/nose hair rotary trimmer attachment for some odd reason.</li>
            <li> Worked ok... Died after 6 months with usage maybe two times per week</li>
            <li> I used this about 3 times per week to trim my beard with the 4 cm flat blade. After six months, the little spring on the blade attachment broke. Wahl charges $9.75 plus shipping for a replacement blade, which I think is too much. The spring would be easy to replace, but they don&#x27;t sell the springs. I will just use the smaller blade until it also breaks and I will try to get some use out of the double shaving head. I noticed that the shaving head rusted quickly, which probably added to the friction load on the spring. The battery seemed fine. I found it hard to use the rack, so I have clutter on the shelf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with other reviewers that it seems too noisy. I will not purchase another Wahl product.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have ordered one of these.  The first one I bought at Wal-Mart 5 years ago.  Eventually the battery just wears out.  I&#x27;m bald (most of the time) and use this a lot when my hair gets to long and I need to prep for bicking!  I also use it when giving the kids hair cuts to trim things up.  It&#x27;s very strong, charges fast, and comes with more attachments than you&#x27;re likely to use.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what my wife says.  It does a great job on that.  Gets into tight facial spots with no problem.  For me, battery life is not an issue.</li>
            <li> This replaced an older trimmer. It works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad I bought it. Highly recommend it! Take a look at it.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had this trimmer for a little over a year, and the other day one of the little arms of the spring that holds the two blades of the trimmer head broke.  I called their support number (800-767-9245) and talked to Julie, who was extremely helpful.  I had not saved the receipt so I was concerned that might be a problem, but she never even asked for it.  I gave her the model number, a description of the failed part, and my address and she said the part will ship out and should arrive in a few days.  I can&#x27;t remember ever having a better customer service experience!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the trimmer itself, it works great.  The battery really does last a long time and charges quickly, the blades cut well, and the attachments all seem to perform as expected.  The rubber grip does seem to hold on to bits of hair, but a quick wipe with a slightly damp wash cloth removes them pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We love this trimmer!</li>
            <li> It worked great for a year, until it rusted just from being in the bathroom closet just from the shower steam. I tried to scrub the rust off, but the blades were snagging the hairs and ripping them out of my face. Worked great for a year though, and had long battery life. Haven&#x27;t found my replacement yet.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that the shaver has multiple &amp;#34;blades&amp;#34; and guards.  What I really love about this purchase is the battery life on the shaver.  I&#x27;ve had it for months and have only had to charge it ONCE!!!  Granted, I don&#x27;t use this every day.  I gather that anyone who did would find that it would last several days before having to recharge.</li>
            <li> Product arrived a day before due date.  Seems to work good, and have a number of components to use with it.  My issue with it is that the tray that come with it does not hold all of the devices, blades and combs.  There are slots but it is not obvious as to where to place them so that they are all kept in one place.  They have to be stacked on top of one another and look like they do not fit anywhere.  If these parts are provided it seems that the manufacturer would provide a better holding tray for their product.  So far that is the only real problem I have with it.  I have only had it a few days.</li>
            <li> just as described great experience</li>
            <li> Wow, This works great. Compared to some of the stuff I&#x27;ve tried from Wally World it is fantastic. The only issue I have is the noise but you&#x27;d have to steal this kit as I&#x27;d never give it up even if it is a little noisy.</li>
            <li> Ok this thing is great.  Trims, my hair, ears, nose, goatee and mustache.  It took me a little trial and error to get all the attachments figured out.  But now it is a must have.</li>
            <li> The product was as describe.  The picture is not true to what you get, unless the green flimsy thing that was used in the packaging is the item that holds all the accessories and trimmer, we did not receive anything else.  We have owned Wahl trimmers for a very long time, this product was a replacement for one that the battery did not hold its charge, but after 7 years, I wouldn&#x27;t expect anything else.  The product is excellent, my husband loves the beard trimmer accessory.</li>
            <li> I use this trimmer everyday ,I&#x27;ve had it for over three months , I charged it when I got it and its still working on that one charge.&lt;br /&gt;it is amazing .</li>
            <li> Worked well for first few uses.  Followed charging instructions, now won&#x27;t even turn on.  Amazon won&#x27;t even let me replace it.  Not very happy at all with purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve chosen it because of its price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the most is it has several heads you can change, its battery and in general it&#x27;s practical</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer a few months ago when my old Wahl died. I&#x27;ve been fairly impressed with its performance. I tend to avoid shaving until the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow gets pretty long, and like to use a trimmer before shaving with a blade. This little trimmer cuts through the scraggle smoothly and comfortably with the wider trimmer blade. The duel-foil attachment performs like most foil shavers- not that impressive. Haven&#x27;t really used the other accessories. Only complaint so far is that after cleaning, the wide trimmer attachment can be a pain to click into place on the trimmer.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son and he liked it.  13 months later it is completely dead.  Won&#x27;t take a charge and won&#x27;t even work plugged in.  I cannot recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Far more power, smoother, quieter, and lasts longer than my similar (but cheaper) Norelco trimmer.  I love everything about this trimmer... except, there are a few things to get used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little shaver attachment, which is a double head...  It is not as easy to get into tight places as the Norelco.  Such as trimming between your mustache and nose.  But, if you carefully tilt it, it works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attachments are a little harder to install.  Meaning, you must have &amp;#34;proper technique&amp;#34;.  If so, it&#x27;s easy.  The plus side, they aren&#x27;t prone to accidentally coming off as on the Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this trimmer.  My only complaint.  Make available a smaller shaver attachment, along with the one here.  And, an indicator light when charging.  One that changes color too...  When fully charged.  Else, this thing is perfect</li>
            <li> I previously used a cheapo Remington beard trimmer that game with five chintsy heads on it. It served me for more than five years, and did a hell of a job trimming back a beard. In fact, I was able to effectively shave with it. Its battery eventually died and I wanted to upgrade to something that would hold a charge and would power through a beard a little better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, that&#x27;s important information. I don&#x27;t use this to trim my beard or to use the shaving attachment. I use it without a guard to simulate the effect of shaving, and that is as far as I can review it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it can&#x27;t get quite as close to my face as the Remington did in its prime, it gets close enough to give me a &amp;#34;I shaved 12 hours ago&amp;#34; look, which I find is acceptable in most realities nowadays. I think I&#x27;ve recharged it once since I got it a couple months ago, and I didn&#x27;t even need to. It tears up a beard in a haste. It comes with oil. It&#x27;s compact and attractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this thing if you&#x27;re going to use it to &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; like the late-20s, dashing, busy, rugged, testosterone-addled man that you are.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is powerful and did a good job at trimming. However the blades rusted for no reason at all I only cleaned them with brush and oil. And then about 5 months later they quit working all together. No warning no weird sounds just turned the power button on and nothing. Plugged it in and nothing. let it charge for about 6 hours or so and nothing. and yes I checked my outlet and it works fine with wife&#x27;s blow dryer. this machine is garbage and poorly manufactured.</li>
            <li> This model is very cheaply made. The on/off switch is extremely flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main issue, however, is that (at least the unit I got) did not seem to hold the charge for very long. More incredibly, when it ran out of juice and tried to use it by plugging it, it would not run! I had to recharge it for a while first.</li>
            <li> I have a short full beard and mustache that I&#x27;ve trimmed with this device for about three months. Based on that experience, I agree with a number of points made in reviews I read here:    CONS    * The packaging is cheap, and there is no carrying or storage case. The plastic packaging materials can be used to hold the various accessories and parts in a primitive tray (which is what&#x27;s pictured), but the plastic molding doesn&#x27;t fit the items particularly well, doesn&#x27;t secure them at all, and is extremely flimsy.  For a product at this price that&#x27;s designed to be used over several years, perhaps while traveling, the absence of a well-designed case costs half a star from my rating.    * It&#x27;s not obvious at a glance -- or indeed, so far as I can tell, possible at all to tell -- when the trimmer is fully charged.  It hasn&#x27;t caught me yet, but some day I&#x27;ll guess wrong and run it out of juice.  (At which point I can see if the quick-charge feature works as billed; I haven&#x27;t tried that yet.)  Minus one quarter-star for lack of an LED charge indicator.    * The documentation is barely adequate. It&#x27;s not intuitively obvious how some of the accessories can be used, or even which of them correspond to the descriptions in tiny print, with bad diagrams, in the multi-lingual instructions. (What help is it for me if there are also Spanish instructions when the English ones are so poor?)  Minus another quarter-star for that.    PROS    * This sucker trims like a demon. It has ample power, and cuts my beard and mustache hairs without snags or pulls.  With very little practice and experimentation, I was achieving perfectly even trims at exactly the lengths I wanted (with different lengths for my beard along my chin and cheeks and for my mustache).    * The plastic beard-length guide looks and feels (as you&#x27;re trying to snap it on) cheesy and insubstantial, but it actually works pretty well.      * Trial and error, plus a bit of patience, will overcome the poor instructions.    * Battery life, while it must be guessed at, is nevertheless quite good.    * The unit is small and light enough that it would be easy and feasible to carry on extended trips (if one had a carrying case).    * I don&#x27;t know if this product would hold up under constant professional use, but it might.  And it seems more than adequately well-made to last for many years of normal consumer use.    CONCLUSION    I always wondered how Patrick Demsey -- Dr. Derek McDreamy on \\&quot;Gray&#x27;s Anatomy\\&quot; -- always manages to keep what looks like a three-day old shadow, without ever being completely clean-shaven or bearded.  One could easily duplicate that look with this tool.  Wahl may not be quite as slick in their marketing as other consumer product companies, but their basic product is a good value.</li>
            <li> Great Trimmer set. Loved the accessories that came with it. Made a great birthday present.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for the fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I have had this since march and i very rarely have to charge it! Once charged it lasts a long time. The heads are easily to change and very easy to clean</li>
            <li> Great trimmer with great attachments that are easy to change.  Does the whole body manscaping with trimmed chest and legs and closely trimmed &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; areas.  Never ran out of charge when using it.  It&#x27;s a good solution for that guy who wants to keep a trimmed look.</li>
            <li> Husband wanted a Wahl that trimmed his beard, nose and ears he got it all. It&#x27;s a great shaver. He still uses his other hand shaver but he uses this to shape and form his beard he is very happy with it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to replace my 20 yr old Wahl trimmer.  This thing is light years beyond and solid design and construction.  Cuts my super course facial hair like butta and love the barbershop chrome aesthetics.  Oh and btw lithium battery is light and lasts forever!  Only drawback is lack of a charging status light.</li>
            <li> The blades rusted within days, just from keeping it in the bathroom.  the battery died within a week, and was no longer able to hold a charge.  That one use I got out of it was pretty stellar though.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a great unit. I haven&#x27;t had to charge it yet (it&#x27;s been a few weeks), the attachments seem to be in good condition, and it works well. The foil shaver attachment could be better, but overall I can&#x27;t complain too much. For the price, this is a great product. If you&#x27;re only intending to use it as a trimmer, 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I like it better than my large Whal clipper. I get a much closer shave.</li>
            <li> Great product -- the extra wide trimmer helps keep those sideburns in check with one pass. I use it daily for quick touch up and it has remained charged for a month or so. The plastic trim guards are a bit flimsy, but does the job once in place. Other then that -- great product -- highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Dead after 1 year of use.</li>
            <li> So far so good, I bought it to trim my dogs face around her eyes and mouth. I have used several times and have yet to charge it.I haven&#x27;t tried any of the other blades yet.</li>
            <li> This works okay for a couple months but quickly wears out.  Barely usable after a year of using once per week to trim beard.  Battery loses charge quickly if not plugged in just before I use it.  Lacks power. Acts like blades not sharp and/or sticking. Another annoyance is when I try to remove a plastic attachment the whole blade part pops off.  Not a good value for $40.</li>
            <li> I have been through two of these, and learned my lesson. I like the attachments, especially the tiny detail trimmer which is really my favorite. Unfortunately, at about a year old, a full charge now runs for about 30 seconds. I could overlook this if it ran corded, but it does not. So now it is a paperweight.</li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer/edger.......Charge on the battery REALLY LASTS.....and this blade is a very fine cut........Cant believe you can get a nice trimmer like this for a cheap price........Wahl makes a great trimmer.......coming from a guy who always bought the norelco trimmers in the past......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought the Philips Norelco G370 All-in-1 Grooming System, which I think is also excellent with a GREAT battery life, but the blade on that one is NOT near as fine as the one on the Wahl trimmer........</li>
            <li> Compact and convenient for travel, since I cut my own hair, trim my beard, need a shaver to keep my beard in check, and the detail trimmer is good for eyebrows and beard edge.  The weakness is its use as a shaver: the head is small so it&#x27;s a slow task, and I find it needs to be done essentially daily because it cannot handle whiskers that have escaped cutting for a few days.  My standard razor has some longer apertures in the foil, and handles longer hairs well.</li>
            <li> I bought this solely for manscaping. The trimmer is well-built and solid-feeling. The attachments are cheaply made but they do the job, plus you get tons of attachments so there is one for whatever your need is. I didn&#x27;t like using it for nostril hair, so I bought the battery powered Wahl nose hair trimmer for that, and it also works well (even though I hate buying a household appliance that only has one use). I don&#x27;t know how good it is for facial shaving.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Wahl 9854-600 in February 2014 and I was very pleased with it until about 2 weeks ago. The Lithium Ion battery was failing to hold a charge anymore. I was still using the same outlet as before, so I attempted other outlets with same results NO CHARGE. I have contacted both Amazon and The Nerds with no replies of replacing it or even what my options are. I am at the point now of saying so long to both Amazon and The Nerds on any further orders. Thanks Nitro</li>
            <li> I bought this mainly as a beard trimmer for my husband.  After 6 weeks of use, he is wanting to replace it as it frequently pulls on his facial hair.  The guards are positioned in such a way that during trimming, hairs will get caught and be pulled.</li>
            <li> I took this product and used it only 2 times and this one isnt working now.it does not get switched even after full charge.faced this problem earlier also.guess some defect with this product.</li>
            <li> UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;  Today I found a package in front of my door! It was the trimmer!!!! Wahl fixed my broken trimmer and send it back to me!!! I was so thrilled because my poodle now looks like a fussy ball (I could not find any better trimmer than this one, some other trimers even cut and rubbed her skin! So we had to let her hair growing like weeds). In the box a note said I need to add oil on blades after each use, and I guess it was probably why my trimmer stopped running after using it only 4 times. Also before I came to fix my review, I realized actually someone from Wahl contacted me on Amazon and said he can help (but I was a way too busy to see it...sorry). Anyway, I am totally happy with it now! Go for it as long as you remember to put oil on the blades after each use! Thank you Wahl!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previous review:&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a trimmer which has tiny razor head so I can use it on my tiny teacup poodle. I saw someone referred this product on Amazon and bought it on Amazon. It was wonderful and easy to use, the smallest razor head is only about less than 1 cm wide, which is small enough to trim the hair between her tiny paws. Even though I loved this trimmer and tried my best to take care of it according to the manual. Unfortunately, after using it only 4 times after 4 month (I don&#x27;t need to trim my dog everyday, once a month is good enough), the motor in the main body stopped running for no reason.  I was very sad. On the user&#x27;s manual, it said I can mail it back so they will fix it and return it to the user soon. So I did mail it back 2 months ago. Nothing happened. I gave up my hope for waiting for them now. I hope no one will experience the disappoint as I did. It does not worth the money to use it only 4 times !</li>
            <li> This is my first trimmer and I bought it to trim my moustache. I checked several online reviews and made the purchase based on that online research. I don&#x27;t know how any of the other trimmers are because I lack experience with them, but I am very much pleased with this one. The unit comes with several attachments that - for me - are of doubtful value. Maybe someday I&#x27;ll use them all but for now I use only two and the trimmer with those two attachments does everything I need done ... effectively and efficiently.</li>
            <li> Works great. I love that it has several guards. The smaller detail blade requires you to unscrew the current blade and attach the smaller blade, making that feature a little less convenient. Otherwise, I&#x27;d give it a 5</li>
            <li> I tried this item several times and its cutting capacity was bad. It was also difficult to remove and insert the original razor head. I&lt;br /&gt;did try one other adapter but it to was not acceptable.</li>
            <li> I am a huge electric buzzer/trimmer kind of guy. I stay away from razors and they seem to cause me razor burn. I was looking for an all in one trimmer that would provide a close shave without any attachments. Although this does get somewhat close, my old buzzer (Remington I believe) seems to get closer. I can&#x27;t seem to find another one like my old one that gets as close. I now have a 2 step process, I use this one first to trim down to close and then my old one to get even closer. I wish I could save that extra step and just have 1 that is well built like this Wahl and get close on the first try.</li>
            <li> About two years ago, I started shaving my head and wearing a close cut beard.  In that time I have purchased 3 of these Wahl 9854-600 trimmers.  For the price, this is a great trimmer, but it has a pretty limited life-span of around 9 months in my experience if you are using it nearly everyday as I am.  Despite the fact that they are not super durable, I am still happy enough with the product and its price to keep buying a new one each time it wears out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about this trimmer is the compact size, the excellent battery life (and quick recharge time), as well as the large selection of trimmer blades and guards.  I like having the wider blade for trimming my head, and the narrower blade for use on my beard.  I find that if the blades are oiled regularly, this trimmer cuts very evenly and quickly.  If it was just a bit more durable, I would give it a 5-star rating, but for the price I guess you do get what you pay for in terms of longevity.</li>
            <li> I used this twice and it broke... very very very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Good and useful I have benefited a lot of them</li>
            <li> As a mostly bald man with occasional beards, I needed a trimmer that could keep my facial hair short and occasionally cut my hair. That&#x27;s exactly what I use this product for, and for the past two years it has worked flawlessly. It still holds a charge like the day it was new, and cuts the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before this trimmer, I used the NiCad trimmers and they always died within 6 months. As soon as I saw \\&quot;lithium\\&quot;, I bought it immediately. Lithium batteries are much better in this type of application and should outlast the rest of the trimmer. With occasional oiling of the head, this trimmer should give me many more years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last quick note on the battery- I often travel a week or two away from home, and I bring this to trim the hair around my ears as well as my beard sometimes. I don&#x27;t even bring the charger! The battery is just great!</li>
            <li> I read some good and some bad reviews on this trimmer. I trust the name and the price was reasonable so I tuned out the whiners and bought it anyway. I love it. It&#x27;s lightweight powerful and has lots of attachments. I only keep the ones out that I use, the rest are stashed in a drawer. The tray is handy and I&#x27;ve had it for over a month now, use it twice a week and it hasn&#x27;t needed a recharge. The outer part is grippy and everything about it is what I would expect from a trimmer. Highly recommend this tool.</li>
            <li> Look, I know that there are probably better trimmers out there, but they can&#x27;t come close to this price.  As a hairy dude, I have used quite a few trimming products over my adult lifetime.  This thing is awesome!!!  I waited for 8 months to write this review so that I could give it a fair assessment and it did not disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one main thing that I hate about most trimmers is that the battery dies after 15-30 minutes of use.  That&#x27;s why I asked for this one for Christmas.  I knew Wahl made good products, so combining them with Lithium batteries would be great.  I used the shaver per the instructions and let the battery run down until it was empty when I first got it.  I charged it for 4-6 hours I think, and then started using it whenever I needed to.  The next time I charged it was July!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually shave with a razor every 4 days, but my razor doesn&#x27;t get every nook and cranny.  So after my shower I will use this to trim my sideburns, nose, ears, and any spots I may have missed.  It&#x27;s great for getting the creases around my nose and everything.  The blades have always stayed sharp and don&#x27;t pull at all.  Sometimes I will even go a week without shaving, then use the wide blade to trim down my beard so I can shave.  It&#x27;s awesome and really makes shaving so much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product, I&#x27;ve recommended it to all my family and friends, and if it ever dies, I will buy another Wahl.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn a beard since 1981. I spent years using scissors to keep it under control before buying my first electric trimmer. I&#x27;ve used various Wahl&#x27;s over the years, including corded and cordless types. After the failure of my last one about a year ago I opted for this model. What a difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is easily the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used. It is light weight, the charge lasts incredibly long (unlike the nicad versions that could only make it through one trim before slooowwwwwiiiiiinnnnnnnggggg). I charge it about once a month and it works great each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One big difference between the li-on and the nicad version - no slowing down before expiring. It either works or it doesn&#x27;t. That can be good and bad, especially if it quits in the middle of a trim. The nicad&#x27;s slowing gave me warning that it was dying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the Wahl narrow head to the wider head of the other manufacturers. The narrow head, I think, allows better control and access to smaller areas. This particular model comes with attachments to meet just about any need I can think of, including a wider head if the need arises. I don&#x27;t use most of these attachments, but I do like the attachment approach instead of the adjustable head approach (I&#x27;ve noticed others prefer the latter).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Using this product for shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Better charge time compared to Remington or Phillips&lt;br /&gt;Stands up for what the product says&lt;br /&gt;Great product</li>
            <li> Husband loves it. Works awesome! Loves how changing the blades are so easy</li>
            <li> Has all the necessary accessories for a close shave but not too close.  I found that this shaver has a long battery life which was no doubt a plus.  I use it a few times then plug it in for like 2 hours and unplug--good to roll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The accessories are easy to maintain and clean.  The heads swap out with ease.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> works amazingly well for all shaving /trimming needs</li>
            <li> Works great; has way too many attachments....can&#x27;t figure out what you use each for.</li>
            <li> I bought this to trim my beard which it worked great for, but if you don&#x27;t keep the parts oiled it will pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I have had this shaver for over a year. It is very well-made. Performs extremely well with exceptional battery life. I&#x27;ve only had to charge it one time and then it wasn&#x27;t even completely dead. Do yourself a favor and get this one!</li>
            <li> Still using it 2 years later and works well. It feels sturdy in the hand and it comfortable to hold. It is relatively easy to clean but has spaces that are hard to get to. The attachments it came with all seem to work great with the exception of one: the close rolling razor attachment doesn&#x27;t really fit well into the trimmer, and doesn&#x27;t shave close anyway. My only other complaint is that the attachments don&#x27;t always deliver an even trim/shave unless you are aware and careful. I learned that in the first few times I used it. The battery life is insane: No joke, I&#x27;ve had to charge only approx. 10 times, and I use it every 2-3 days.</li>
            <li> Cuts very close and battery lasts long enough</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an ancient Wahl groomer that finally died.  I only use this to trim my beard but I can&#x27;t remember the last time I plugged it in.  Very nice unit and a great upgrade from my old Wahl.  I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Very well designed tool. Does just what it&#x27;s supposed to due....cut hair.</li>
            <li> A solid travel kit loaded with accessories!</li>
            <li> My Norelco finally died after three years so I thought I would try something else. Lasted about 3 months then stopped working completely. Guess I will be going back to what works.</li>
            <li> Very capable trimmer, unfortunately these used to last 4 or 5 years. Now they burn out after 1 or 1.5 years. No point in buying replacement blades/heads if when they are no longer sharp since the motor or battery will fail soon after. I have owned four of this model over the years. Most recent one lasted 15 months. I take good care of my things, used on average 1.5 times a week, never dropped and I don&#x27;t travel with it. (speaking of drops, my friend dropped his, be careful little drops will break of the blade tips which can result in cuts if you don&#x27;t notice.)    I&#x27;m not sure if this is intentional to keep sales up or if they just started using cheaper parts but they need to get back to quality as that is what the Wahl name used to mean.    I have also cut my own hair with their hair clippers since I was 7 years old. So far those are still built to last. I will give this product one last try and then I&#x27;m looking for recommendations.    P.S. I have had a little experience with one of their beard trimmers that runs on a regular battery. seems to cut well, the head is a little smaller and it didn&#x27;t have any attachments - so that won&#x27;t work for everyone.</li>
            <li> I love this thing. Powerful and diverse. Easily the best trimmer I&#x27;ve used ever. I go through beard trimmers like crazy too. I love this one. The different trimming heads are all incredibly useful. I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if it were wet/dry. But alas. Dry only.</li>
            <li> started to rust after only a month. Crap quality and it would pinch my facial hair. Works better as a tweezer than a trimmer.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer!! Runs fantastic and cuts great!! The different blades are a little tricky to interchange, but not too much of a problem!!</li>
            <li> I have only used the detail and trim heads for my beard.  The adjustable guide for the trim head works fine.  Plenty of power - cuts my beard with no trouble.  My only complaint is the poor instructions.  This is my first beard and thus my first beard trimmer and it really doesn&#x27;t tell you much about how to use it.  Almost gave myself a bald patch on the chin the first time I tried using it (I didn&#x27;t think through all the turning angles).</li>
            <li> The switch, I&#x27;m assuming, crapped out in the first three months.  I won&#x27;t make a mistake and purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this for about a year and the battery is already dead. It lasts about 30 seconds before it needs to be recharged again.  Its not fun trying to shave in 30 seconds.  I won&#x27;t be buying a Wahl product again.  My last trimmer was a Norelco and it lasted for at least 3 years.</li>
            <li> The following is quite long and not quite like a typical review. Skip to the last paragraph for the main points if you&#x27;re not easily entertained.    I bought this trimmer almost 2 years ago now. It worked fine for the first month and then suddenly would not hold a charge. I&#x27;m fairly knowledgeable when it comes to electronics and battery technology and assumed the battery&#x27;s safety mechanism got tripped so it would no longer charge. However, with the trimmer plugged in I could get about a minute of use out of it, which was all I needed for the occasional quick touch-up. I wasn&#x27;t happy, but I dealt with it.    Fast forward to a month ago and, out of nowhere, laziness was suddenly overcome by frustration and outrage. I intentionally bought a half-decent trimmer instead of some $10 piece of throw-away technology; why was I accepting this? Of course, this too was built to be disposable technology, as the battery is clearly not intended to be user-serviceable. But I had a purpose now, and (instead of dealing with some warranty procedure) I took a knife to the cheap rubber shrink-wrapped handle and opened the thing up.    I know I shouldn&#x27;t have expected much, but I was surprised at what I found. At the head of the device is a motor about the size of a quarter. In the handle is a PCB about the size of a stick of gum. It contains the switch mechanism and the electronics necessary to charge the battery. The battery, by the way, is a 3.7V 750mAh Li-ion (14500) and is soldered directly to the PCB. A lot of times when companies make disposable electronics like this, they will at least make the battery easy to remove (once you&#x27;ve destroyed the thing by opening it up) so it can be disposed of properly - not here. At this point I was just tempted to throw it away considering the components cost less the amount I was going to spend on a replacement battery (~$2.50). But I figured it could be a simple project that keeps me from having to spend more money on a replacement or dealing with the warranty (which was probably out now that I had taken it apart).    I picked up a replacement battery from one of those Chinese online retailers (you know, where you might go if you wanted to find a \\&quot;deal\\&quot; that was \\&quot;extreme\\&quot;) and bought a pair of 3.7v 900mAh Li-ions for less than $5 with free shipping. Two weeks later they arrived and I broke out the soldering iron and went to work. The contacts were connected much too securely to the battery, so I melted the solder at the board and just pulled them out. I then took the metal gate off an old 3.5\\&quot; floppy and cut out replacement contacts which I soldered to the new battery. I then punched them back through the trimmer&#x27;s board, touched them up with a little more solder and snapped the case back together. My only regret was cutting off the rubber sheath, which likely would have peeled off in one piece if I had tried that first. I wrapped it up with some electrical tape instead.    Despite the new battery getting pretty hot during some inefficient soldering on my part, it already works at least as good as new. I let the trimmer run for about 10 mins and was satisfied with its performance. The trimmer should have no trouble charging the new battery, as I made sure to splurge on a \\&quot;protected\\&quot; one which should prevent any over-charging or over-draining. Like with the original battery, I&#x27;m going to cycle it completely the first few times to condition the battery. During its first charge it&#x27;s going to sit somewhere fire-resistant just in case.    Tl;dr: What&#x27;s the point? Yeah, this is more of a narrative than a proper review, but there is some good information to be gleaned. Know that this is an extremely cheap piece of electronics. That will be painfully obvious as soon as you pick it up, though it really hits home with a peek inside. Also, realize that it wasn&#x27;t built to last. Sure it&#x27;s got a warranty, and at least someone seems enthusiastic to help based on responses to some of the negative reviews, but who reallywants to hassle with the process? The battery will die in probably 1-3 years, just like the one in your cell phone, you just can&#x27;t replace this one. And, if all you need this for is to trim your sideburns or neck every few weeks, know that you are severely overpaying. You&#x27;re buying this one for its accessories and maybe because it has a Li-ion battery (though that is my, and a few other commenters&#x27;, main complaint). And for those of you who read the whole thing, I don&#x27;t recommend doing what I did, I just shared the steps for entertainment purposes.</li>
            <li> The good: a powerful cutter, great battery.    The not-so-good: very loud, lots of vibration, throws hair all over the place as it cuts, very cheap plastic snap-on trimmers, limited options in terms of trim length, you need to keep the blades well oiled, not so easy to keep clean.    It works, but made me sorely miss my old Norelco Turbo Vacuum Trimmer, so I just gave the Wahl to Goodwill and bought another Norelco Turbo Vac.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of all the positive comments about the battery, and I thought the variety of clippers would make it easier to shave all the different hair I have (body hair, sideburns, etc).  What I found was that most of the clippers are very similar, so it&#x27;s not useful to have so many, and in any case it is a pain to always switch between the different clippers.  Worst of all, the standard razor doesn&#x27;t do a good job of getting a close shave.  So this has basically been kind of a bust for me, and I&#x27;m going back to my old standard Panasonic razor.</li>
            <li> I tried this a day after I got it and I love it! I trimmed my ear hairs, ugh! I trimmed my beard and I self-cut my hair. This did all as advertised and the charge held through the whole workout. I would recommend this others or any of the other Wahl products!</li>
            <li> If this was listed for 1.00 it would be too much. I bought these clippers one month ago and they have already broken. To be honest they didn&#x27;t even work well before they broke. Do yourself a favor and buy a different pair of clippers because in a month or so you will be looking again, I promise you that</li>
            <li> The functionality of this trimmer is good.  It has plenty of accessories.  I was able to trim my mustache and occasionally extend my haircut a few extra weeks.  I purchased this 12/2012.  It worked well until June 2013.  The battery didn&#x27;t seem to charge fully after that.  By September it was worthless.  Either this isn&#x27;t a lithium ion battery or it was part of a bad stock.  Basically I would suggest looking at a different model.  The other negative is all the attachments and the base unit...I didn&#x27;t like the way everything fit together.  There&#x27;s a nice Panasonic I bought to replace it that doesn&#x27;t need all the attachments because you can dial different trimmer heights.</li>
            <li> Good product/ good price</li>
            <li> Hair sticks to the handle material.  Not nice.  Otherwise good power. one two three four five six seven eight nine</li>
            <li> Super awesome for man grooming. The base holder thing can be thrown out and replaced with a plastic bag. Clipper, attachments and battery life are great.</li>
            <li> These trimmer work well &amp; fit in my hand perfectly (not too big and bulky).  They are used frequently and seldom need charged.  Great purchase!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but only last about a year or so, before the blades get worn. I used mine to keep a &amp;#34;shaved&amp;#34; head, and I used it about 2-3 times a week. It does not cut as short as I prefer, so I bought a new one a couple of months ago.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to pay the extra for the ANDIS clipper + bought a 0000 blade for that. It&#x27;s a much better clipper, but cost a lot more as well..</li>
            <li> Got his to keep my beard neat and clean and it is great.  Long battery life and a well thought ouot series of adapters make this a must have for anyone into personal grooming.</li>
            <li> When I received this product it was fully charged and ready to go.  I could not believe the power it has.  It works better than I&lt;br /&gt;expected.  I have tried several of these trimmers and none of them would hold a charge.  Every time you want to use it you had&lt;br /&gt;to charge it, which takes hours.  This one is small and lightweight and has all the attachments.  You will be amazed at the power&lt;br /&gt;it has.  I would highly recommend this to anyone, you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> husband likes it...great item for the price</li>
            <li> Like the others. Can&#x27;t seem to find one that works well</li>
            <li> This machine works great and it has an amazing battery life. I rarely have to charge it and when I do, it doesn&#x27;t have to be connected for long. It trims great and it comes with really great accessories.</li>
            <li> Once you get used to using this you&#x27;ll love the crazy long battery life.  I charge mine maybe every 3rd month.  I dont use the shaver attachment, not a fan of electric shavers.</li>
            <li> Part did not work properly first time I tried to use it--requested return --printed document--trimmer works fine now??????&lt;br /&gt;Seems to be working fine now--I guess it just needed a complete charge__ but it wld not work even when plugged in??&lt;br /&gt;So we will see.</li>
            <li> love it! nice quality!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried any other trimmers but this thing is worth it&#x27;s weight in gold. Finally had to give up on the first one I bought 4-5 years ago. Battery was starting to fade a bit and the clippers got a little rusty due to negligence. The cheap bum that I am purchased on Amazon vs Target to save $2... ya I know. If you&#x27;re in the market for a battery power trimmer to man scape, shave head, trim etc, this thing is BEAST MODE.</li>
            <li> I really like this trimmer.  It has an amazing battery life and it trims well.  I only have to pass over my face a few times, compared to my old crappy $15 trimmer that I had to pass like 10 times.  Plus it has the attachments that really send this over the top.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband after the old system died of old age! 😊 He absolutely loves it, it is convenient and well engineered. This means he will use it! This may or may not be a good thing. Nevertheless, it is a great system.</li>
            <li> This set is so durable and easy to use that I bought one for my brother for his birthday. The trimmer doesnt take long to charge, and all the accessories are great. This is the perfect set for any man or person who needs to groom regularly. I bought mine over a year ago and i havent had to replace any parts or anything of the like. My brother is super happy with his. Great for beards and hair of any kind. I thought it would be a little small for me but in fact it is incredibly powerful, long lasting battery, and its compact size is great for traveling. Doesnt even need to be oiled or cleaned that often. i drop mine frequently and so I know it can take alot of abuse.</li>
            <li> I cut my six year olds hair and as you can imagine he doesn&#x27;t sit very still for me. Cords get in the way and make it more difficult to maneuver. This trimmer allows me to save time and hassle and works great. Didn&#x27;t ship with the tray pictured on the website to hold all the tools conveniently for me, but that&#x27;s a minor set back.</li>
            <li> So far a normal trimmer. Expected a bit better for the price. One beard attachment snags hair a bit but there is an additional attachment for the same length that does not pull. Shaver works fine but is quite weak and requires more time to shave with.</li>
            <li> This clipper set is of good quality. It has a decent amount of accessories. The clipper feels solid.  A good buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the trimmer but the unit I received does not have an included tray as pictured and indicated in the text of the ad.  For this reason alone I give it 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is great for keeping your facial hair neatly trimmed and if you&#x27;re used to having a military style haircut then this unit will save you lots of money by not going to the barber as it works great for short hair too.  The heads switch out very easily and the attachments are simple to change as well.  My only complaint is the shaving head as it is mediocre at best.  They should just leave that attachment behind and replace it with something else.</li>
            <li> There are problems with recharging.  The cord doesn&#x27;t seem to work all of the time.</li>
            <li> Truly disappointed. I started growing a beard back around November 2014 and by January 2015, had a long, thick beard. I bought these Wahl based solely on my wife swearing by Wahl. She uses their hair cutting kit to trim our son&#x27;s hair and believe it or not, to groom our two little dogs. I&#x27;ve always known Wahl as a good company, but hadn&#x27;t used any of their products. I shave my head with a razor so the need for a trimmer really hadn&#x27;t came up with me before this beard of mine started getting out of control. My belief with these trimmers was I wouldn&#x27;t use the guards since I have a steady hand and could just slide them down my beard to pick off all the wild hairs. Didn&#x27;t work. It instead just brushed over them. This caused me to press harder which cost me nearly half of my beard. That&#x27;s no big deal. It grew back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What was a big deal to me was the build quality of these trimmers. First, the chrome parts on the body feel extremely cheap. The different trimmer heads vary in quality, some feel very sturdy and snap right into place. Others feel cheap and take multiple tries to get them in straight. If you like to feel a trimmer&#x27;s quality in your hand this isn&#x27;t the one to get. Maybe the Lithium Ion battery makes it feel so light? Second, the main head it comes with started to rust within the first 5 weeks of owning it. I used them once a week. No possible way for them to have gotten wet either. I ended up buying a pair of Panasonic trimmers that were cheaper and that cut much better.</li>
            <li> Nice &amp; light trimmer. The handle has a rubbery feel which is great when your trimming but the hair trimmings get stuck on it. Use a little warm water and easy scrubbing &amp; it&#x27;s gone. I have this trimmer sitting in my travel bag so I can trim more often than having to get out a case from under the sink, plug it in, wrap it back up in the case and stow it away. This cordless Wahl trimmer is the way to go.</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I have ever owned........rarely needs charging</li>
            <li> Seems powerful enough for what I want, but the squishy grip is a real pain -- it collects hair as you&#x27;re cutting off, so the trimmer ends up with a lot of cut pointy hair all over the place. I&#x27;ve had to return mine -- the stainless body one is better.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my son, so he&#x27;d stop stealing mine! Did the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very nice trimmer. My previous one was from Sharper Image - much more expensive and wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge. This unit hold a charge for an amazingly long time.</li>
            <li> Great little unit, more versatile than I was expecting.  Easy head change from one to the other, this will replace several shavers I own, once I&#x27;ve played with all the attachments. Ordering another one right now to leave at camp, for those long weekends away when I start looking a little shaggy!!! Nice job, Wahl!  Sorry Remington &amp; Norelco....this $40 unit kicks your butt!</li>
            <li> Got it for my boyfriend!  He loves it</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last as long as others I&#x27;ve used. Got the job done while it lasted and came at the right price.</li>
            <li> Product came charged and had everything I was looking for to keep my goatee trimmed.  Battery life is great still haven&#x27;t had to charge it</li>
            <li> I have been loyal to Wahl ever since I started cutting my own hair when I was ~15yo and then bought a beard trimmer when it became necessary shortly after. I owned their base level bear trimmer (Wahl 9918-6171 Groomsman Beard and Mustache Trimmer) and it lasted me almost 5 years. I purchased this Lithium Ion one and it did not even make it a year before it stopped holding a charge. Quite disappointed. Also the detachable heads fall off quite easily if you give it a smack on the side to try and clear out the hair between the blades while trimming. I&#x27;m going to repurchase the base level (non-lithium ion) version.</li>
            <li> Great item works awsome</li>
            <li> Straight up best mechine i ever came across no other words for it&lt;br /&gt;ITs compact and works quietly and does a great job</li>
            <li> this thing is awesome!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a year, and it would be great if it held a charge. It has never held a charge for very long once removed from the charger. It doesn&#x27;t even work when plugged in (maybe the adapter is the problem?). I&#x27;m lucky if I get 3 minutes of use after charging it all night. Not impressed.</li>
            <li> ★★★★★★★★★★thank you ★★★★★★★★★★</li>
            <li> Battery failed after 3 months use.  I called WAHL, who said I can mail it to them to have it serviced as long as it is under warranty.  The battery is irreplaceable by the consumer.  No thanks, for that shipping I can buy a new unit.  HINT: It won&#x27;t be a WAHL!</li>
            <li> Since my hair started receding, and had been getting it cut shorter, I decided to get a hair trimmer. It keeps a charge very well and easy to operate. I trim my hair about every 2-3 weeks and only have to charge it about every three months or so.</li>
            <li> I purchased a trimmer for each of guys (husband and son).  They are both very happy with the results they get from their trimmers.  I would say I would definitely purchase them again.</li>
            <li> I hate shaving.  My beard gets out of hand at times. This little trimmer deals with it just fine.  Have used the wide blade, the standard blade with the adjustable depth, and the razor.  All in all, I have zero complaints.</li>
            <li> Full Práctica porque es inalámbrica, liviana, corta muy bien, le cargo la batería una sola vez al mes (increíble). La he probado en la cabeza, naríz, pecho, piernas y corta excelente.</li>
            <li> So I thought this was gonna be a great option. It has all sorts of accessories and feels nice in your hand. The bummer though is when trimming my beard within a few seconds it bogs down and jams. I then have to clean it out before it works a little longer. It came with cleaner and I used it and oiled it but the hair still gets caught on the inside. This makes it very frustrating to use.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer, sharp blades, and 6 trimming levels.&lt;br /&gt;I have not had success using the 2 headed beard trimming attachment.</li>
            <li> I have owned 2 of these things and they each only lasted about a year. Not worth the money. Buy Norwich or Phillips</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for two months and use it two to three times a week to maintain my short goatee.  I&#x27;ve only charged it once and the motor still seems strong.  I previously owned a Remington and Conair. Both were very weak and did not hold a charge for very long. There are way too many attachments for my needs, but who really cares? I used the electric shaver attachment and it works okay. The attachments snap on and snap off a certain way that can be a little difficult at first, but gets easier as you do it more often. I think that the negative comments about things breaking off could be attributed to this. The other negative reviews talk about bogging down in heavy beards or trimming hair. I don&#x27;t use it that way so I can&#x27;t comment on it but for light use, it&#x27;s better than anything else I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> This beard trimmer lasted only  year and half.  Then, kaput! It wouldn&#x27;t take a charge and also wouldn&#x27;t operate on AC. I wasn&#x27;t too happy with it even when it was working.  Narrow blade head made it difficult to trim evenly because it required multiple passes.  Also, all the extra parts were useless to me: I don&#x27;t change my beard style so I just needed one of them but had to pay for the whole bunch. (And the price hadn&#x27;t come down when i purchased it.)&lt;br /&gt; I did very much like the attachment that did my mustache and edged my beard.&lt;br /&gt;This is the  third time I&#x27;ve been burned by thinking a German product was superior (Opel, the worst car I ever owned; Bosch dishwasher that doesn&#x27;t clean the dishes).</li>
            <li> Worth the money.. I like it very much!!Lot of clips  , taht come handy. Doesn&#x27;t look all that great  though.</li>
            <li> The product I received matched the description and was a good price. On the down side, the many attachments included are nice, but it&#x27;s difficult to change from shaving attachments to hair cutting attachments and the plastic molded base does not hold the attachments well.</li>
            <li> Was smaller than expected. I was looking for hair clippers and this was more for beard and face trimming. Maybe I didn&#x27;t read close enough.</li>
            <li> Purchased this trimmer from a box store and it worked well for about a year then quit. Took it apart and worked on the connections.  It started working again for about 2 months then stopped while using. Purchased another thinking that I got a bad one.  The new one was plugged in and it worked.  Left it charging overnight but it was dead the next day.  Returning it today and will begin looking at other brands.  When it works it cuts great and the battery life was decent.  Disappointed because Wahl products are usually good. Update - Wahl contacted me about my unit and is replacing it free of charge.  Excellent customer service.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after only 3 months. I also felt like this trimmer would &#x27;catch/nick&#x27; my skin significantly more often than 90% of the trimmers I&#x27;ve used over the years, including less expensive Wahl trimmers. I would not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Second one..they&#x27;re the best..me and hubby use it for everything..</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut close enough for me.</li>
            <li> This trimmer stopped charging in first week. So, I got a replacement adapter ( I paid for this ). It charged for few minutes and then it stopped charging. I used this trimmer for two times and paid around $40. So, I tried to replace it, but the refund/replacement policy said that it cannot be returned or exchanged. Trimmer and its accessorries still sit in my bathroom, they get rustic within couple of days. I lost $40</li>
            <li> This is decent for body hair. Mine lasted about 3+years... and did that well. What i wouldn&#x27;t recommend with this is using it for facial hair. The blades will wear out a lot faster. Also most of the extra crap is completely useless except for the extra blade and the guide combs. I tried the foil shaver attachment once and it was a joke. The extra blade is the main asset. You can pop off the blade without unscrewing it. It&#x27;s going to last twice as long just because of the extra blade. Keeping in mind that replacement blades etc usually aren&#x27;t properly aligned. I would not pay too much over 30$ for this.</li>
            <li> I felt it was a solid body trimer but I didn&#x27;t use it much on my face. You can&#x27;t probably shape a beard well with it but it would take hours to get a clean shave. It&#x27;s good if you are on a budget.</li>
            <li> I wont lie, its a good clipper for what I need it for.  But Wahl couldn&#x27;t have picked a worse material for the handle grip (the black part of the trimmer).  It is made out of this rubber-silicon material that hair clings to like grim death.  You can&#x27;t wipe it off either.  I&#x27;ve tried vigorously scrubbing it with a cotton towel which helps a little but then you have cotton particles stuck on there as well.  They might as well have just made it out of pure glue its that bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get around this, I literally just put masking tape around all of the &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; areas of the clipper which did the job, but certainly not a pretty sight.  Overall, i&#x27;d say look elsewhere for an easier to clean clipper.</li>
            <li> I like how it came with so many accesories and is durable. The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that hair would constantly get clogged up in the blades alot. Its a small flaw, though it is nice. Should buy it if your a do it yourself type of person.</li>
            <li> Was a good trimmer but the plug on the unit has broken away and will not charge now. It&#x27;s only 14 months old..</li>
            <li> This is my second time purchasing this product. The first one was over 3 years ago, and the little battery finally just won&#x27;t go anymore. That&#x27;s to be expected in any rechargeable product. Other than that, the old one was great and this new one is just as great. I just it for balding my head. It leaves just a slight bit of stubble, but has no problem with cutting or pulling hairs. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a good beard/head trimmer.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace another Wahl that was 14 years old.  It still works, but the charge is only good for one or two trimmings, so I decided to get a new one.  I was not disappointed with my choice, the battery seems to be better than the original, at least as far as I can remember! LOL  And you get the standard Wahl quality which is middle of the road, not the best but not even close to the worst.  It does the job it was designed to do, not much more you could ask for.</li>
            <li> Great quality product.  Better than what I expected. That&#x27;s always a good thing by me. Especially when buying online and also through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be the first to admit, I ask a lot from any trimmer I purchase.  I expect it to trim any/all facial hair with a minimum of pain or discomfort.  And to have a &amp;#34;reasonable&amp;#34; life span.  That&#x27;s in quotes because apparently my idea of reasonable life span of 1+ years is excessive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The positive first:  During the honeymoon phase (say 2-3 months) everything went great.  The charge was pretty good, no discomfort while trimming, and it cleaned up well.  There were some minor issues sure, the stand it comes with is largely useless as the moment you brush your hand against it, the whole thing collapses.  And the textured handle was difficult to keep clean.  But these were minor qualms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After this time, things went from bad to awful.  First the battery started dying quicker and quicker.  It got to the point where I had to charge the trimmer overnight to ensure that in the morning when I went to trim, it wouldn&#x27;t die during.  Next came the attachment death.  First the wide width trimmer broke, then the ear/nose hair trimmer broke.  Now I&#x27;m down to only the medium width trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of writing this, I dread having to trim my beard.  I have to charge the battery overnight and leave the trimmer plugged in during operation to prevent battery death.  No matter how cautious and slow I take it, the blade inevitable will catch and pull hair without cutting.  And I&#x27;m down to one functional attachment.  The &amp;#34;length adjustor.&amp;#34;  I mock this because the clip on it slides constantly while I trim, giving one part of my beard &amp;#34;3&amp;#34; length and another part &amp;#34;6&amp;#34; length.  As you can imagine, this is frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have burned through several of these $30-$50 type of trimmers in the last 5 years.  Always hoping one or the other will prove to be a winner.  No success yet.</li>
            <li> Had a small problem figuring out how to switch the head on the shaver, but it was straight forward. There is a nice youtube video that explains the whole device from Wahl</li>
            <li> I got this trimmer at a retail store just a couple months back. It worked good for while. My hair seems to a little tougher then some and it seemed to handle it just fine. I needed to clean the blades often and take it slow. Well the clippers no longer hold a charge. You can not bypass the batteries and just run off ac power. This basically makes them useless. I am now looking for a replacement on here. Will be getting the kind that just plug directly into ac power this time.     I will be writing an update soon.</li>
            <li> They are perfect. The shave very close,have plenty of power,and the battery stays charged. Now with the attachment if your not a kid it is simple just watch what you are doin &amp; you won&#x27;t have any problems. These are the best hands down.I have had different types but with these I felt like a real barber I was changing heads and everything. I love my set.</li>
            <li> The powerful motor in the trimmer easily cuts through hair. Also, it is very easy to shape your beard. I like a little scruff, so I do not use any of the attachments. I would definitely recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and when he used it it did a great job and gave him a close shave leaving him with a baby smooth face. We are both very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I just cracked this thing open and I&#x27;m immediately disappointed. I haven&#x27;t even used yet, but I might not even bother. Here&#x27;s why: 1) how hard would it be to provide a charging stand? That thing in the picture that looks like a recharging stand, is not a recharging stand. It is just a stand. You&#x27;ll have to carefully grab the plug and insert it into the bottom of the trimmer, after each time you use it, before setting it in the stand. Why? I don&#x27;t know. Perhaps they did the math and figured that it would cost them an extra 2.5 cents, and besides, the marketing folks could trick us into thinking that the pretty stand in the picture was a charging stand. Whatever, I&#x27;m bugged. 2) This product requires oil. Unlike 90% of the other trimmers out there, which do not require any oil at all, this one must be oiled on a regular basis. Don&#x27;t oil it and it will freeze up within a week. Which means that after a year, when I run out of oil, I will probably be throwing this thing away. Yet another inconvenience with this product. Most other trimmers can simply be used over and over again with no maintenance. Not this one. It is the Fiat of beard trimmers. 3) That stand is a mess. Who wants to have all that stuff sitting on their counter? Bathrooms get dusty and the dust in a bathroom gets moisture, which means that all those combs, brushes and everything else will need cleaning. All 20 of them. They could have provided a little housing for all this stuff, so as to protect them from the bathroom&#x27;s environment, but nope. Not Wahl. They obviously don&#x27;t use their own products. This product won&#x27;t last a year. In fact it might not last a day because I&#x27;m think of getting rid of it today.</li>
            <li> Product: Wahl L-ion All In One Trimmer&lt;br /&gt;Rating: 3 1/2 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s better than I expected, but not problem free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likes:&lt;br /&gt;------&lt;br /&gt;* POWER:  I&#x27;ve always leaned towards trimmers using rechargrable AAs, but when I went to replace my last trimmer only to discover it&#x27;d been discontinued, I picked the Wahl.  I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a month now, and it&#x27;s still on the original charge.  Speed and power are both excellent.  Recharge time is apparently very fast too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* SHARPNESS:  This is by far the sharpest electric trimmer I&#x27;ve ever tried.  I have a very tough beard, and the Wahl glides through it effortlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dislikes:&lt;br /&gt;--------&lt;br /&gt;* ATTACHMENT OVERLOAD:  This model comes with far more attachments than most people are ever likely to use.  I wish they&#x27;d unbundled most of them into an optional expanded attachments set, because the only attachment I want or need is the adjustable depth trimmer guide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* ADJUSTABLE TRIMMER HEAD:  Although it works fine, it has some quirks.  First is that it takes two hands to alter the setting, or to remove and reattach it ... and because it&#x27;s a clip-on-top, rather than a fully enclosed attachment, you have to be careful around folds and wrinkles, to avoid getting nicked, especially on a shallow setting.  That&#x27;s one feature I miss about my old trimmer ... the fully enclosed adjustable guide head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: although I dislike all the attachments, the trimmer itself is excellent.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> I am an old man so when I seen this trimmer with all the attachment I thought you just pulled off one head and put on the next. I did not know you had to take the trimmer head apart to insert the next head. I guess if I were younger with time on my hand I could take a screwdriver and take the trimmer apart put on the head I wanted than put it back the way it was. I hope this help.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Powerful&lt;br /&gt;Sleek&lt;br /&gt;Light Weight&lt;br /&gt;Trimmers attach easily&lt;br /&gt;Fast trimming&lt;br /&gt;Battery&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Storage / Charger Base&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer rocks!  Super powerful, light weight and fast shaves.  My only problem with this product is the storage base - It does a poor job of holding all the attachments.  The reason I still give it 5 Stars is because I end up putting a majority of the attachments in a drawer.  Paid $34.17 - Free Shipping.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive but works great. I use it, with different attachments, both to cut my hair and trim my beard as well as for other assorted grooming purposes, and it does it all without a hitch. I&#x27;ve had it for maybe a year now and it still works as good as new. For this price, it&#x27;s a real bargain.</li>
            <li> I bought for my husband. Worked fine until it broke less than 6 months later. Just stopped working one day.</li>
            <li> Ive had this trimmer for a few years. The trimmer itself is awesome! Truly the best trimmer ive ever owned as far as the cutting and trimming capability is concerned. The main problem with it is that after 5 to 7 months or so depending on use(About 2 times a week for me or less) it will not work. Its almost as if the battery is not charged however even after plugging it in to charge it, it still doesnt work. Ive been able to get another month out of it because it would work if i plugged it in and then turned it on. Really annoying since i want a cordless. Anyways that only works for another few weeks or so and then it becomes a paper weight as mine is now. This time i may just have to look for another brand.</li>
            <li> Good, light , multi use , many choices . but i face problem with charging this machine , while i am chivying it must be connected to electricity.</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer in January 13, and it was broken by December 13.  When it worked it worked well, but it should have lasted longer.</li>
            <li> Brought this trimmer home today excited to trim my beard and mustache. Couldn&#x27;t under stand the instructions. Couldn&#x27;t find the button to depress to swivel the trimmer head, couldn&#x27;t get the 6 position guide to fit correctly on the trimmer head. I&#x27;m 71 years of age, have worked successfully as a craftsman assembling all my days, but there are too few left to play with this thing.</li>
            <li> I use this where I work in a barber shop, I use it mainly for when I am cutting a small childs hair to go around the ears and neck line, well worth it!!!! Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this trimmer for about four years now. I lost the charger for it two years ago, and it still has a charge. TWO YEARS! I have a bigger trimmer now and only use this for trimming my nose hair. Overall a great trimmer and would buy again.</li>
            <li> My son loved this gift. Runs a long time before needing a recharge. Has many accessories for all your possible needs</li>
            <li> It has a very weak motor and bogs down when I am trimming my beard.  It does not maintain a charge for very long. Finally the heads for the different pieces are difficult to change. I had an older Wahl trimmer which worked great until it died recently.  Don&#x27;t understand why Wahl has produced such an inferior product.  I would have returned mine for a refund, but I already threw away all of the packing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had to charge it once since we&#x27;ve bought it and have gone through 6 haircuts between me and my son.  I did find that it&#x27;s slightly more difficult to get a closer trim than our old trimmer.</li>
            <li> I liked the product and would buy it again.  So far, it has worked like I thought it would.  ok.</li>
            <li> I have been using this trimmer for the last 6 months and works great! Battery last quite long and trims perfectly.</li>
            <li> I have had several earlier versions of this Wahl cordless trimmer.  It was the lithium ion battery that drew me to this one.  I agree that it is noisier than previous models.  For some reason, this one does not hold it&#x27;s charge as well as the old nicads.  It would also be good to have some sort of indicator lights to show if it is charging or needs charging.  Overall, it is not terribly impressive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried at least a half dozen of these rechargeable trimmers and this one is, by far, the best yet.  It&#x27;s powerful, recharges quickly, and the attachments are easy to change.  I highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I have been using this trimmer for almost a year and it&#x27;s been the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned (I have purchased at least 10 trimmers over the past 10 years, and this one is the best!) I hope they continue making this model in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the trimmer once a week to shave my head and the charge on lithium ion battery lasts for couple months on a single charge. The motor is powerful but the trimmer is very compact and comfortable in my hand. The black rubber on the handle is not slippery so you can hold it securely without worrying about it slipping off your hands. The blades are fine and precise but the cutting path is slightly narrower than my full size trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What else can I say? If this one breaks down, I will definitely buy this product again.&lt;br /&gt;In the future, I would like to see a larger (XL) option of this same product. But, for those who travel, this trimmer is outstanding; compact, powerful, and lightweight and it works right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One improvement suggestion for future model is the trimmer needs a charge level indicator light. I would pay $10 extra for that feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note; I see some people complain about noise and vibration, I have owned many trimmers and they all are noisy, and vibrate. That&#x27;s how trimmers function. I feel this trimmer is more comfortable than all other trimmers  I owned and I have owned multiple models from Phillips-Norelco, Braun, Remington, Wahl, Oster.</li>
            <li> The attachments were too cumbersome, sliding the guard on the unit was extremely difficult.. sent it back and exchanged it for a Braun</li>
            <li> I liked this trimmer when it worked, however after only a few months it refused to charge.  The 5 year warranty is great - in theory - but trying to actually ship it off for repair is a pain and with the cost of shipping it isn&#x27;t worth it.  Since I did like the product, I purchased another one.  I used it only twice before the charger connection broke when I plugged the charger in to the bottom of the trimmer.  How can two of these devices break in exactly the same way?  It is especially alarming that the second one failed so quickly.  Time to find another brand.  *** Update: They repaired my second trimmer free of charge.  The first one I must have thrown away as I could not find it.  Upgraded to 2 stars (they really shouldn&#x27;t have both broken so quickly).</li>
            <li> By far the most power from any trimmer I&#x27;ve owned! I can get many trims from one charge, which is really nice. Would recommend this to anyone looking for a beard trimmer!</li>
            <li> I really like this shaver.  Close cut and it feels like it is made to last.  The only improvement would be easier attachment clip ons.  Other then that I really enjoy this product and will choose Wahl again.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a body trimmer that could also function as a hair cutting tool. Luckily I found the right product. Not only did it come with a plethora of attachments for body trimming but also a different cutting tool for hair cuts. The hair cut blade also can be fit with Wahl attachments for more precise and longer hair cuts, and the 10 piece attachment kit only costs 6 dollars. The battery life on this trimmer is also excellent. I have used it once to trim, shave, cut and put it away only for it to still have good battery life a few weeks later. For those that complain about the nose attachment, I can&#x27;t use it anyways because the vibrations make it impossible, I recommend cutting those hairs the old fashion way, scissors. For the price, this trimmer really is all encompassing. And if you are interested in your manscaping as well as giving yourself a haircut then this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> Returning this.... Maybe it was just the one I got, but it pulls hairs out instead of cutting them making for a very uncomfortable and painful trim.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great shaver. I used one previously, but lost it. Ordered this one, and got it super quick. I love it and makes life easier.</li>
            <li> l have previously owned two Philips Norelco cordless groomers and had disappointing experiences with both.  One was the [[ASIN:B000U65ZPE Philips Norelco BG2022 Bodygroom, Limited Edition]] and the other a [[ASIN:B000FEF1V4 Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer]].  They both started off just fine, but in both cases the batteries failed shortly after their warranties expired.  Batteries in these little groomers cannot be replaced (at least not without a soldering iron and some technical know how) so when they go, you&#x27;re stuck buying a replacement.  I did some homework before selecting a replacement and there were several reasons why I selected this Wahl model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Wahl is the #1 choice of professional barbers.  I figure that if it&#x27;s good enough for a pro, it&#x27;s plenty good for me.&lt;br /&gt;2.  This Wahl product uses a lithium battery, not the older nickel-cadmium battery technology.&lt;br /&gt;3.  This Wahl is made in the USA (Illinois) and I want to support domestic manufacturing whenever it&#x27;s a competitive option.&lt;br /&gt;4.  It comes with all of the attachments I might ever need for my intended use.&lt;br /&gt;5.  It is competitively priced and has lots of positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviews talk about this coming in some sort of a plastic stand and how that stand isn&#x27;t sturdy enough.  I can imagine what they&#x27;re describing because I had those little plastic organizers with some of the other like-products I&#x27;ve owned.  I never liked them because they were always a bit flimsy/tippy and mainly because I don&#x27;t want my trimmer to be on display on my bathroom vanity anyway.  I guess if a guy sports facial hair and reaches for this product on a near daily basis the plastic organizer might be important.  But in my case, this gets used maybe once weekly at the most and I just toss it in a drawer after use.  But at any rate, it&#x27;s a moot point as mine didn&#x27;t ship with that plastic organizer anyway.  Mine came with a zippered bag that holds all of the trimmer pieces and the power cord.  I like this as it keeps all the parts together and is easy to store in a bathroom vanity drawer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery life on this trimmer has been phenomenal.  I charged it per the instructions when it first arrived and haven&#x27;t had to charge it again once since then (about a month as of this writing).  This trimmer does everything I need it to do and I am really glad I went with this Wahl model.eps all the parts together and is easy to store in a bathroom vanity drawer.

            <li> I&#x27;m sad to say that the motor stopped working after three months of very light usage.  I&#x27;ll order another just to make sure it wasn&#x27;t a bad piece. When it did work, it worked very well.</li>
            <li> Good overall trimmer. I travel a lot so this is compact enough to travel with and the battery life is pretty good.</li>
            <li> Good strength and power for it size and price! Only thing I wish was that there was a bar to show you how much power was left on the trimmer</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd one of these trimmers I&#x27;ve purchased.  I bought the first at a Wal-Mart while on a business trip that was extended into a 2nd week.  I charged the trimmer once and used it for well over a year.  At the time I had a goatee and a thin jaw-line beard.  That Lithium battery is something else!  I used the trimmer for 3 more years before I dropped it one night on a trip to Japan.  The trimmer head broke and I couldn&#x27;t repair it.  The base was fine though and worked fine with the few heads I hadn&#x27;t lost yet.  Replacement heads are available from WAHL for $7.50, $5.95 shipping and $4 handling.  At that point I&#x27;ve bought half of a new unit so I elected to just buy a 2nd.  I&#x27;ll have a full set of heads this way, 2 bases, and a bag to store it all in so I won&#x27;t lose anything else moving forward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit absolutely powers through hair.  I didn&#x27;t realize how well it did until I had to revert back to my old unit to get by until I could replace this one.  The old Conair chewed on my thick beard, barely cutting it.  The WAHL never had that problem.  My beard kept getting stuck between the Conair&#x27;s trimmer and the plastic guard.  That was never a problem with the WAHL.  I can&#x27;t wait until my replacement comes in later this week because No Shave November needs to get mowed down!  At least it gave me an excuse to stop ripping hair out with the Conair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only wishes for this unit is that they&#x27;d make it without the tacky (to the touch) rubber grip that hair sticks to.  And that they make an actual charging stand for it.  That would sure be nice.  But neither are essential.</li>
            <li> works great, better then my old one</li>
            <li> Just what the doctor ordered--works great!</li>
            <li> While its not the best of the best, for the price range its a good buy.  The t-Blade I can only use it for my mustache edges over the lips.  The adapters require a little giggle to attach it right and the plastic guides are sturdy enough to stay on place.  Overall, its a keeper and in reality it should be a 3.5 rating.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing product - the second time I used it, the device would stop every five seconds or so and had to be switched off and on again to get a little action. Very tough to trim a beard like that ;) After maybe 4 or 5 days, it stopped altogether. Took apart some of the easy bits but nothing stood out apart from very cheap parts and assembly. Overall I would not recommend this product at all. Only regret I have is that I did not use it earlier so I could have returned it. The return window expired.</li>
            <li> Does not arrive with all the attachments and the stand I see in the illustration sent to me here when it&#x27;s asking for a review. I don&#x27;t remember if that same photo was in the listing when purchased. It comes with two different types of length of trim combs, one with a swiveling comb, and a tiny brush.  Seems to work very well, but I&#x27;ve only used it once.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a Remington shaver I bought at Walmart. The Wahl is immediately much high quality: real metal pieces, heavy in my hand, the design allows for a much closer much more even shave. I was enjoying it so much I kept adjusting the size lower and lower and shaved off a bit more than I intended. Highly recommend: clean, even shave. Good price.</li>
            <li> I bought these clippers for my husband to replace an old one he had that broke. To my surprise he loves these clippers &amp; is very happy with them.</li>
            <li> Works great. I am using this over 6 month.</li>
            <li> The guard attachment is very flimsy and falls off easily. If you plan on using the guards, I would recommend not getting this.</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t shave with a razor it is necessary for me to have a beard trimmer.  I&#x27;ve used several types and this one seems to be the most solid I&#x27;ve used so far.  It feels as though it will last a while.  However, the grip is very grippy and some hair may stick to it.  I just hide it in the carry bag that comes with it.</li>
            <li> so far all Walh trimmer i got Works really good&lt;br /&gt;Strong and powerfull to complete the job</li>
            <li> My husband loves this trimmer. It has all the attachments needed, and is cordless ! Purchased a second on for the&lt;br /&gt;son !!</li>
            <li> I was trying to decide between this Trimmer and the 9818. Although I can&#x27;t really complain about this one, I wish I&#x27;d gone with the other. The main reason I went with this one was for the shave attachment as that is what I use my trimmer for (not as close as a razor, but good enough for my needs). Unfortunately, that attachment isn&#x27;t very good at all. I don&#x27;t use it. The main blade is also very uncomfortable on my face (I don&#x27;t use any of the attachments on my face, try to get as close a shave as possible). This is less of an issue, because the T Blade is comfortable enough to use, and since it&#x27;s larger, it&#x27;s actually a bit faster to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest problem with this trimmer is the rubberized handle. I have no idea how this thing got through any testing in the Wahl company, but I hope the people responsible for this ingenious idea have been removed from a position of power. Your facial hair WILL stick to this thing. Any &amp;#34;comfort&amp;#34; you get from having a rubber handle instead of a metal one is totally negated by all the hair that gets stuck to the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that being said, the blades are good, give a nice shave and overall I&#x27;m perfectly content with this trimmer. But if you&#x27;re trying to decide between this and the 9818, I&#x27;d go with that one instead. From what I&#x27;ve read, it&#x27;s a better trimmer and doesn&#x27;t have these small nuisances.</li>
            <li> The idea of Interchangeable heads is great but dont get the Idea just because it is Lithium Ion Battery that is has alot of power but inorder for trimmers to be effective it takes RPMs which move the cutting blades back and forth I am not sure if its because of the interchangeable head set up but the blade movements are not what they should be to be overall effective, it works but plan on a few hair pulls</li>
            <li> Like everything about this product, have had no problems with it since I purchased it about 6 months ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend getting this product for those who wish to maintain their beard, or to even shave.</li>
            <li> I have had a full beard and moustache since 1978. Over the years I have tried various scissors and clippers to keep it trimmed. This trimmer is by far the best I have ever used. It holds a charge for a long time and it trims without missing. I prefer having the small pouch to keep it in along with all of the attachments. I have had clippers that have a &amp;#34;base&amp;#34; to hold them with the attachments. That always ends up getting in the way on my bathroom counter. I have had clippers that were cheaper but they never trim as well and quickly wear out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read many reviews before buying this. I saw comments about it pulling hair. It will pull hair if used incorrectly. There are two ways to hold the trimmer when using. One way is (1) to put the flat side of the clipper head parallel to the skin and the other is (2) to put the flat side of the clipper head perpendicular to the skin. Using method (2) can pull hair and using method (1) has never pulled hair on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would clearly buy this item again and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love this product and also the name.</li>
            <li> Decent shaver. Power kinda fluctuates.  But battery lasts and a decent shave overall</li>
            <li> Stopped working after one use</li>
            <li> Awesome trimmer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;-Works great.&lt;br /&gt;-Multiple functions.&lt;br /&gt;-Quality product.&lt;br /&gt;-Long battery life.&lt;br /&gt;-Great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for about a year and I could not be happier.  Others trimmers I&#x27;ve purchased in the past do not even compare to this one.  I would recommend this to anyone and it makes a great gift.  If you are looking for a trimmer then look no further.</li>
            <li> Best Trimmer set out there, I have tried others and have been disappointed.</li>
            <li> Works great has lots of power and attachment, I just hope the battery holds up heard alot of stories about the battery not lasting very long satisfied for now.</li>
            <li> ok but not as wide as I thought it was , but I kept it for emergencies , only about 1 inch wide</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the previous version that came with the other kind  battery ( not li Ion) and this one definitely has a better battery life.&lt;br /&gt;Downside- Although the grip is comfortable, my hair sticks to it, after I am done with the job.</li>
            <li> The best clipper I&#x27;ve owned in a cordless..</li>
            <li> Broke after just a few uses.</li>
            <li> I am highly satisfied with this product. It meets my requirement fully</li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE REVISED MY REVIEW BECAUSE OF WAHL&#x27;S EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE......THEY&#x27;VE ADDRESSED THE ISSUE.  My original review is at the bottom of this entry. I received a message from a Wahl representative to told me to call them and they would help me. I called.  What I learned is that there are two &#x27;levels&#x27; of product; professional and home use. This product is more for home use (i.e. a guy trimming his beard). The professional product to which I was accustomed (The Peanut) is intended for the heavy/constant use in a salon setting.     They offered me a refund and informed me that, due to the Wahl warranty, I could mail my broken Peanut for repair at a cost of only $15. I&#x27;m thrilled.  Thank you, CT and Wahl.      -------------------------------------------------------------------------  ORIGINAL REVIEW: I usually use a PEANUT trimmer (corded) to clip my Yorkie&#x27;s face and ears. Mine broke and this looked like a great option for replacement because it&#x27;s cordless. Problem is, it doesn&#x27;t trim very well at all. I have to go over and over the same spot and the results are still ragged.</li>
            <li> Great gift given to college bound son.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is so awesome. I have used it to perform haircuts and facial trimming. It works excellent and it very simply to use and the battery lasts forever!</li>
            <li> Broke sometime after I used it the first time I guess, just went to shave and nothing happened. Plugged it in for a full day and still nothing.</li>
            <li> I have only used this trimmer three times now, but I absolutely love it.  It cuts perfectly without having any pulling or gouging.  It really isn&#x27;t that loud compared to some of the reviews I read I expected it to be an indoor chainsaw!  The variety of attachments is great and has so many different lengths to trim at!  The sticky plastic handle is a little bit of a draw back with its natural tendency to allow hair to stick to it, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  The battery seems great, I have only had to charge it once so far and has full power every use!</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I replaced the old one with this this new one.</li>
            <li> Amazing value. This is awesome and stays charged for a long time. Lots of pieces with it.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m LOVING this all in one trimmer! I&#x27;d previously purchased an all in one Remington from Target, and it was absolute junk. I refuse to buy a product from Remington ever again. (Another once great company that now makes crap in China?) After three months, you could literally leave it plugged into the wall charging 24/7 for weeks, and when you went to use the product (which would not work unless the battery was charged, no power from just plugging it into the wall) you MIGHT be able to do one quick trim over your entire beard before the charge died. Sometimes it died mid-trim. Ridiculous&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; say all of this because my new Wahl Lithium Ion All In One Trimmer is AMAZING. I&#x27;ve had it for over a month now, and haven&#x27;t even had to charge it ONCE. Trims great, stays charged, and I&#x27;ve honestly had no problems with the blade clips staying in place (and on the blade.) They&#x27;ve worked fine every time. So give this trimmer a try, I think you&#x27;ll be highly impressed!</li>
            <li> This is the same trimmer I&#x27;ve been using for about 8 years.  My blades were wearing out and the battery getting weak.  Was very happy to find it available new.</li>
            <li> Ordered this to replace one that I had for years that died. The attachments feel very stiff and it takes a while to get used to changing the heads.&lt;br /&gt;So far the charge seems to be holding very good. This the main resion for buying this model.</li>
            <li> I love these trimmers. I cut my hair twice a week with these, and have been doing so for ten years. I bought a pair of these about six years ago, replaced them with the same ones about three years later and just replaced them again with the same one three years after that. I&#x27;ve gotten three years out of the first two and expect to get three years or so out of the new ones. They&#x27;ve worked better than any other brand/set I&#x27;ve tried previously. They&#x27;re good quality and have held up very well. For 40 bucks or so every three years - it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
            <li> This is a must have for creative grooming. &#x3D;0)</li>
            <li> Another Wahl piece of crap!!! Waste of money.</li>
            <li> THIS IS BY FAR MY FAV BEARD TRIMMER. I HAVE VERY THICK BEARD. THIS IS THE ONLY CORDLESS TRIMMER THAT HAS ENOUGH POWER TO TAKE CARE OF THE JOB. ONLY CON IS THE LITIUM BATTERY IS TRASH. AFTER USING LIKE 5-6 TIMES IT DOESNT KEEP CHARGE. IF YOU KEEP IT PLUGGED IN ALL THE TIME NO ISSUE.</li>
            <li> Works great, holds charge for a long time without needing to be recharged. A great started kit for someone who is growing their beard for the first time.</li>
            <li> this shaver is good and had long time for battery and recharge very fast&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i recomended this shaver and give it try</li>
            <li> It worked reasonably well while it worked. The trimmer head is very narrow, which makes it harder to get an even trim on the beard, but the mini-shaver had works very well for trimming around the beard.  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s built to fail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine lasted 14 months, and then stopped dead in the middle of a trim. The battery was charged, and the unit didn&#x27;t slow down as if the battery were dying. One second it was working fine, the next it was dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took it apart to see if it was repairable, but it appears to be the motor that failed. Worse yet, the construction quality is pretty much junk. There&#x27;s no effort to seal the unit, so the electronics were covered with fine hair residue. And almost all of the plating had worn off the switch contacts. Even if the motor hadn&#x27;t failed, the switch probably wouldn&#x27;t last to the two year mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wahl used to be known for high-quality, rugged trimmers. But it appears they&#x27;ve embraced planned obsolescence. No more Wahl products for me..</li>
            <li> Only used it once, then it died. I then dropped it from about 4&amp;#34; above counter and the whole head broke off. Maybe you get what you pay for? Not an is to last long.</li>
            <li> Garbage product. I used mine once to trim my beard with - worked okay then. Second time I wanted to use it to trim my hair so changed to the replacement longer blade and doesn&#x27;t cut my hair at all despite making noise and vibrating.&lt;br /&gt;Product is cheap so if it stops working after one use don&#x27;t be surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now in the bin.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer at my local store and paid $45 for it, Amazon is offering a much better price ($32 as of this review), but it doesn&#x27;t change the fact that this trimmer is still not worth the price. I didn&#x27;t use all the attachments and I primarily bought this to keep hair neat in between trips to the barber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Price&lt;br /&gt;- Li-ion battery charges fast&lt;br /&gt;- Trimmer blade is great for detailing, goes around ears easily&lt;br /&gt;- Lots of attachments/accessories&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- Blades rust easily&lt;br /&gt;- Worthless eyebrow/nose/ear attachment&lt;br /&gt;- Handle attracts hair, dirt, dust, you name it&lt;br /&gt;- Accessory stand is cheap - stuff falls out of it frequently&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The basic trimmer function works great, and the build quality of the blade LOOKS nice, but it isn&#x27;t. I never got the blades wet, but as other reviewers noted, the blade RUSTED QUICKLY. How this happened, I have no idea, I&#x27;m assuming some sweat got on there. I oiled the blades and cared for them as instructed, and it still rusted - in a couple months! This has never happened to me with other trimmers from Wahl or any other brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pretty excited about the precision detailer attachment because I&#x27;m tired of having a bunch of grooming tools in my bathroom. As some other people said, the precision detailer attachment was completely worthless. I thought I would use it to get some straggling hairs around my eyebrows, and I had to make several passes before it would cut the hairs off - unevenly and not closely. It also did a horrible job trimming my nose hair - it pulled on the hairs and hardly cut anything. I ended up having to fall back on my old Philips Norelco groomer anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some other reviewers had a different experience, but for me, the dual foil shaver was NOT good for shaving facial hair. Even being very careful and following instructions, the dual foil shaver still irritated my skin and left a bunch of stubble behind - after that happened, I ONLY used it to pick up a couple stray hairs below my sideburns that the trimmer blade didn&#x27;t get the first time around. I have sensitive skin, but I&#x27;ve never had a foil shaver irritate my face like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lithium ion battery is not over-hyped. It charges quickly and holds a charge well. I only had to charge it once a week at the most. The accessory stand is worthless, it only held the main unit securely, everything else fell out and created clutter. Ended up having to put unused parts in a ziploc bag. Again, as others said, the handle attracts everything (namely hair, dust). I used a damp cloth to wipe it clean, but even the fibers from the cloth somehow got stuck on the handle. The material feels nice when you hold it, but looks messy and is a little annoying to keep clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, in terms of its basic function, the trimmer blade works great at trimming neck hair, sideburns, over-ear hair, etc. However, the blades are of questionable quality and mine rusted quickly. This is being marketed as an \\&quot;All-in-One Trimmer\\&quot; and it is not. Prior to this, I had big corded Wahl clippers that lasted 10+ years before they broke, so I had a good impression of their products. I really like that Wahl still manufactures most of their products in the USA and I really wanted to like this trimmer, but unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work out.</li>
            <li> its very smart and I like it...with lots of attachments and features</li>
            <li> The picture made these look larger than they really are. The clippers work well, but the shaver is crap. Just not big enough to be a daily shaver.</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer in Jan of 2011 and it no longer holds a charge for any amount of time.  Aside from this issue, I was really please with it - worked great for both beard trimming and head shaving.  That said, one year of utility is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Great value, excellent product. If you have fur on your face you need one.</li>
            <li> holds the charge extremely well. great power.</li>
            <li> my husband had one, and I bought this for my son.  Per my husband, battery stays charged a long time.  He trims his beard and also gives himself a weekly hair cut.  The one I just had purchased has a small bag to put the attachments in, which I like because it can be put in a drawer rather than a stand on the vanity.  Seems to have a lot of attachments that neither my son or husband uses. My husband has had his for over a year and is quite happy with it.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to like??  More power, battery life extra long, if there isn&#x27;t an attachment to complete the task...you&#x27;re too picky.  Great for this price!</li>
            <li> Great product from reliable source</li>
            <li> Junk.  It cuts okay, when it&#x27;s got power.  After six months, mine won&#x27;t hold a charge between uses.  So I have to decide when I&#x27;m going to trim my beard, and go plug it in a couple hours before to get enough charge to (hopefully) last the entire session.</li>
            <li> Razor works well my son says He shaves his head and has a long beard.</li>
            <li> the razor works amazing.the attachments work very well. I wish that there was a light that let me know when the charger was full.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Stubble&amp;#34; attachment does not cut stubble. Leaves hair about 3mm long. Folks, that aint stubble. Stubble is 1mm. Gobs of attachments if that is your thing but many of them just don&#x27;t deliver fully. For example, the foil shaver attachment didn&#x27;t provide a close shave at all.  Powerful battery as advertised and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a couple of months now and it has become unusable as the metal spring inside the head that puts pressure on the blades has broken in half, now all the device does is pull hair. Also, the rubber on the handle attracts hair and is difficult to clean. I had to dedicate an old toothbrush to it just to remove cut hair that would cling to it. I do not &amp;#34;hate it&amp;#34; because it broke and is now useless, as things brake from time to time and I do have a very thick beard. I hate it because it is very messy to use as a lot of hair will stick to the handle, too much IMO. I used this in the shower, before turning the water on, so that the clippings will be washed away when I do take a shower. However, so much hair will stick to the handle that I had to use the toothbrush to clean it in the sink and then clean the sink. Too much trouble, very bad design!   The only &amp;#34;pro&amp;#34; I have for this is that the battery would last a fairly long time, I only had to charge it once or twice in the couple of months that it worked properly. Also, the charger is the same for this as it is for the lithium head hair clippers I have (which also has good battery life).</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to, but once you do, this is a very versatile set. It works just as well for body hair grooming as it does for a close face shave. The little bag holds everything nicely, including the many attachments (not all of which you might use, but you can always throw them out) and the charger. I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with having one item for all kinds of hair grooming.</li>
            <li> The best trimmer I&#x27;ve owned.  Not quite professional quality, but as close as you can get in the home market</li>
            <li> This thing will brake in no time.  Terrible!</li>
            <li> fast service.....good product</li>
            <li> Great trimmer so far long battery life. Could use a few more trimmer guard sizes. Only contains up to size 3 on the wider blade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my trimmer for 3 years and used it 2-3 times a week to trim my beard. It works great. The battery life was great. I could go weeks without charging it...until the battery stopped holding a charge. I contacted Wahl and they said to send it back since it was still under warranty. Two weeks later I received a brand new trimmer in the mail. Can&#x27;t beat that. I researched a bit and found you shouldn&#x27;t let the LI battery completely discharge which I did. Won&#x27;t do that again and hopefully the battery will last longer.</li>
            <li> Long lasting battery. Quality.</li>
            <li> Bought this at a local store and couldn&#x27;t have been more disappointed.  The only positive thing I can say for this product is that the lithium battery does last for a long time.  It only sees use as a beard trimmer (every few days) and charging has been only very infrequently required.  Now on to the downsides.&lt;br /&gt;* As others have noted, the rubber attracts hairs and just doesn&#x27;t let them go, they&#x27;ll be there for eternity.&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s very easy to snap the hair-sizing attachments on and end up with them crooked.  They&#x27;ll go on but you have to look closely to be sure they&#x27;re properly seated.&lt;br /&gt;* Leaves a lot of stragglers.  It replaced a Philips Norelco that finally quit and where that one could reliably pass through cleanly, leaving properly trimmed hair behind.  The Wahl requires multiple passes and even then, lots of uneven and straggling hairs.&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s painful.  Multiple passes to try and get it to trim everything is problematic because the Wahl requires VERY slow movement and prayer to avoid painful pulling of hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of all these problems I would not recommend</li>
            <li> Works good for awhile. But then it will stop charging. And theres no charge light to indicate its getting a charge. But worst of all the blade heads rust if you don&#x27;t dry them off completely</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my clipper to trim and shave and got lazy of having to lug the whole kit out just to use it, so I bought this trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little hard to compare it because I&#x27;ve never used a trimmer before and so I&#x27;ll be comparing it to my clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously the clipper is more powerful, so the clipper gave a faster and cleaner trim vs the trimmer. The trimmer is smaller so it can get into places a clipper can&#x27;t. Overall the trimmer does it&#x27;s job, just don&#x27;t have have expectations like the trimmers you see at the barbershop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a lot of combs attachments but they&#x27;re pretty much within the same height range so it doesn&#x27;t really make a difference from using one or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, the battery is great and probably the best feature of this trimmer. I have yet to charge the thing and I use about twice a week to shave my beard/face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the wider blade attachment so it&#x27;ll be a quicker shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just like the previous commenter, the blades are already showing rust just from use.</li>
            <li> So far, it seems to be great for trimming the edges of my beard, top of my head and those extraneous nose and ear hairs. The foil shaver is small but effective. I was not disappointed with the shaver,however.The device is compact, fits well in my hand and the battery charge seems quite sufficient. I have not found a convenient way to protect it while traveling. I would recommend it for the above applications.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is well worth $30. It has a 5 year warranty and performs great. I gave the trimmer 4 out of 5 stars because the shaving head is way to slow.</li>
            <li> Update- I sent the trimmer in for repair, and in less than a week Wahl replaced the entire unit with a brand new trimmer.  Excellent customer service, and I will continue to be a loyal customer as a result....Thank you Wahl&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this based on my satisfaction with other Wahl products.  It cuts great, but I was surprised to find the rubber separated from the chrome part of the unit in less than a year.  Wouldn&#x27;t expect this to happen.  Hoping someone can make this right.</li>
            <li> This is my first beard/mustache trimmer and I have only had it for about a month, but so far it is excellent. I have had no major problems so far and it gets what I want done which is just a neat trim all around. The main problem I have is switching between the different settings is a bit tricky without practice. Also as I have read in other reviews the electric shaver attachment is pretty much useless.</li>
            <li> My husband is enjoying this trimmer. It is high quality and does a superb job of keeping his beard tamed.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair and this cuts right thru it with ease, I have yet to use all the attachments (it comes with a lot) but I&#x27;m sure they all work great. I thought it would be a little bigger but it does the job just fine.</li>
            <li> This product is not what I expected it does not hold a charge,stays on chager if not for  an hour or more it will be dead when needed&lt;br /&gt;The blades does not meet standards for shaving. I had water get into tray of one blade and it has rust all over blade&lt;br /&gt;I would not reccomend this product.&lt;br /&gt;I have begun to research for another product because this one does not work for me</li>
            <li> Provides a quick and precise mustache trim.  Use about twice per week.  Hasn&#x27;t needed recharge in 3 - 4 weeks - still running strong.  Haven&#x27;t used most of the attachments, but would prefer a better way to store - maybe a pouch?  No really good nose/ear hair trimmer.  Changing attachments is a little cumbersome.  Not as easy as other trimmers I have used.  I was mostly interested in a better and stronger battery life, and this product meets that need.</li>
            <li> I have had so many electric shavers that it&#x27;s become a joke with my wife. Once they start pulling hair or the battery won&#x27;t charge, I&#x27;ll say \\&quot;I guess it&#x27;s time for a new razor\\&quot;, to which she responds, \\&quot;Well, it&#x27;s been a couple of months.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that&#x27;s going to change with this razor. I absolutely love this razor and look forward to using it because of how good of a job it does. I like alternating between stubble beard to goatee. I also shave my head and groom from head to toe and everywhere in-between. This is the first razor I can honestly say does it all for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Largest Blade: Shaving my head and neck takes 1/2 the time with the larger head than it used to with my other razors. It has a very smooth back and slices the hair off with no tug and pull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smaller Blade: This is great for outlining my beard. The larger blade could do it, but I feel like I have more control. I also use this with the adjustable guards for various lengths. I love the fact that some of the attachments are one size. I get WAAAAAY better results this way instead of the generic 10 dial adjuster other razors come with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smallest Blade: A lot of reviews I read say this trimmer, mainly for ears/nose/eyebrows, doesn&#x27;t work well. They must have some course, thick hair because I&#x27;ve never had a trimmer that works this well. I didn&#x27;t expect much out of this trimmer based on the reviews, so I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foil Shaver: I&#x27;ve had several of these in the past, and they all break me out almost as if I used a real razor. I have used this on my face, my neck, my chest, and the cash-n-prizes... not one bit of irritation. You have to go over it several times to get a smooth feel and it can be a little noisy, but every one of these type of razors I&#x27;ve had were that way. So for this to work as well as it does as an attachment makes me happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The attachments (blades mentioned above) can be pretty tricky toput on and take off at first. I sometimes felt as if I could break one at any moment. Now, I&#x27;m used to them and pop them on and off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The stand is acceptable, but I didn&#x27;t really have room for everything. I spent about 15 minutes trying to figure out what went were because not all of the pieces fit. I&#x27;ve got it all worked out now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The blades can get pretty hot and the smallest blade and foil shaver can get a little noisy. They work great, so I overlook it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Some people&#x27;s reviews complain about the rubber grip holding hair that&#x27;s been shaven. This is absolutely true. However, all you have to do is take a wet cloth, wrap it around the rubber grip, and pull down. The hair will come off with no problem at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: I love this razor! It has a five year warranty, it&#x27;s pretty cheap, and feels like a sturdy razor that will last a long time. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Got trimmer promptly. Works great. Lots more attachments than the ad said. Couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. Nose hair trimmer works well also.</li>
            <li> The charging adapter is only 110 - 120V it doesn&#x27;t support 220V. So it can not be used if you travel to some other country that uses 220V. This is really annoying since I am a frequent traveller.</li>
            <li> This is the second one of these I&#x27;ve purchased.  My first one was several years ago.  It still works fine but my son broke some of the teeth  on the head I use the most.  I didn&#x27;t see anywhere I could by just the attachment so I bought the whole thing again.  Long story short,  It cuts evenly and smoothly, holds a charge forever and will last you at least 4 years (thats how old my original one is.)</li>
            <li> Excelent!!, good battery life</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace an old trimmer that I used to trim my beard and mustash, It works excellent.</li>
            <li> This was not what I paid for ! It does not cut clean ! Leaves stubble after making a pass over the skin ! Have a cheap one that is now from the dollar store 2 years old and it still cuts better&amp;#62; If I had not disposed of the packing I would have returned for a refund !</li>
            <li> I had this product for several years then it needed to be replaced and I was able to get the same product.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer to keep my beard in check and so far it has been fairly usefull. It holds a charge for quite a long time and I find myself forgetting that it even needs to be charged at all. The attachments all seem to work fairly well too, no problems with pulling/snagging of facial hair. My only problem with this trimmer is that the cutting heads seem to rust rather quickly. So I recomend keeping the set in a cabinet or drawer rather than sitting out on the bathroom counter. I have had mine sitting in its stand on the bathroom counter since I bought it and the heads started to rust only 3 months after I bought it due to steam from the shower. Otherwise this is a good buy for shorter beards/mustaches as there are no attachments for long facial hair.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a friend. He is very happy with it so all is well. Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> great trimmer,even better price and customer support,cant beat wahl!</li>
            <li> Best ever!  Battery lasts months without a charge!</li>
            <li> Bough it at Target for $37 thinking it was going to last a while, guess I was wrong. After the third use it starts to pluck hairs so you have to constantly stop and let the pain subside. After around the 10th use you have to pass over your face literally 4 or more times to get all the hairs, and I barely have anything to call a beard. So once it was obvious that it was complete junk as a facial trimmer I thought to re purpose it for the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; areas too bad it didn&#x27;t last. I go to turn it on and nothing. I let it charge for 2 hours and still nothing. Its completely dead. what a waste of money and time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a Wahl hair cutting clipper for 16 years and it still runs well. I bought their newest model for hair cutting and its complete junk and so it this trimmer. I don&#x27;t know what happened to this company but I definitely wont buy any more of their products.</li>
            <li> Awful, it worked well at first and then after 2 months just suddenly stopped working.  Couldn&#x27;t turn it on even after trying to recharge it for 24 hours.</li>
            <li> Its OK... but it doesn&#x27;t hold ANY charge and often bogs down so much that it pulls my hairs out.</li>
            <li> This is a great little trimmer.  I already owned a similar trimmer made by Remmington, but this new WAHL trimmer completely trumps the Remington in performance.  When I got it out of the box I was thrilled to see it already had a pretty substantial charge and was ready to go. Immediately I noticed that this trimmer has a ton of torque which I attribute to the Lithium Ion battery. This is very important because if you&#x27;ve ever used a battery powered nose trimmer when the battery is going, you KNOW that when the battery starts to go, hair gets pulled instead of cut. I tried the foil shaver attachment... it actually did a surprisingly decent job and I typically hate foil shavers.  I&#x27;m still not convinced that it will replace my old school manual razor for shaving, but it&#x27;s a good quick option.      Pros:  - Powerful!  - Charges fast and runs long.  - Easy to switch attachments.  - Made in USA. (a rare find these days)  - Built like a tank.    Cons:  - Alot of pieces to keep track of.    - Flimsy organizer tray (but I don&#x27;t use it anyways)  - My old Remington had an adjustable blade guard so you didn&#x27;t have a half dozen pieces laying around.  - Rubber grip attracts hair stubble.          Update:  After using this trimmer for a few months I would have to knock it down a star.  This trimmer is NOT in any way water resistant.  On a couple occasions I would rinse the hair out of the blades and then leave it out to dry.  The trimmer blades will get rust very quickly.  I then went to use the trimmer the other night and it would not turn on.  I proceeded to take it apart and found that the internal circuit board had corrosion across some of the leads to the various chips.  I took an old toothbrush and removed all the corrosion and it began working again.  To ensure this never happened again I coated all the metal contacts with hot glue to keep out the water.  WAHL, what were you thinking?  This thing will set by the sink for it&#x27;s entire life, and you put absolutely no thought into resisting corrosion?  You could have coated the PCB in epoxy, or sealed the internals.  I was able to fix mine, but the average person probably would have just thrown it away.</li>
            <li> All in one solutions help simply our life. Why get more than one item when one does the trick. However sometimes there is a trade off. Such is unfortunately the case with the Wahl Lithium Ion All in one Trimmer, while having a large assortment of attachments, each on only half completes its task. For example the trimmer and the shaver barley succeed at doing the same job other razors do that are dedicated to the task. If you need something quick for travel I would recommend getting this trimmer. However if you are looking for daily use I would get one dedicated to the task you are trying to do.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty decent trimmer kit that is capable of all basic facial hair managment.  The trimmer was already charged and ready to go out of the box.  The different head types (standard for trimming down facial hair, wide for haircuts, narrow for nose and precision requirements, and twin foil for a smooth shave) are great and can be interchanged fairly easily.  The downsides are the difficulty of physically adjusting the adjustable guard attachment and a big one for me is the material of the handle.  Though the handle is comfortable to hold, hair and skin flakes stick to it and is almost near impossible to clean off.    All in all, a very handy trimmer in a small package.</li>
            <li> This trimmer worked well for the first 6 months then it died and would no longer turn on. Disappointing that it only lasted 6 months of light use a few time a week.</li>
            <li> This is about the fourth trimmer I&#x27;ve had in my life and I&#x27;d rate this Wahl Lithium Ion Trimmer about AVERAGE (see update below).  The main unit gets the job done and has a decent motor, but the comb attachments, foil shaver and organizer are very cheap and don&#x27;t function well.  Another reviewer mentioned how impressed they were with the foil shaver attachment.  I very much disagree.  I&#x27;ve attempted to use it twice (once wet/once dry) and it doesn&#x27;t even cut through my beard.  I&#x27;m not sure if my beard hairs are too coarse or what the problem is, but I ended up just throwing the foil shaver away.  I also threw the cheap plastic stand/organizer away.  Pathetic a company like Wahl would include something like that with their product.  I have no need for the included plastic comb attachments, but I tried to put them on and turn on the unit to see how they performed.  I agree with some of the reviewers below.  They don&#x27;t fit snug against the blades and seem like they could easily break.  Finally, getting the various attachments on/off the main unit isn&#x27;t easy (especially with wet hands/fingers).  You won&#x27;t spend 10 mins. trying to attach them, but it will take 20 or 30 seconds of repeatedly trying to line up the internal parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sum, I would not purchase this trimmer if you have need of the various plastic attachments/organizer/foil shaver.  But if all you are looking for is an average trimmer this will suffice.  I don&#x27;t believe it is worth $30-$40, however.  Other companies have trimmers in the $14-$21 range that will work just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE (1 month later)- This thing is a piece of garbage!  The battery does not stay charged for more than an hour (of non-use) and in the last three days the unit has stopped responding to the On/Off button.  It doesn&#x27;t work anymore.  I&#x27;m calling Wahl customer service tomorrow to see what can be done.  Worst trimmer I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  Sorry, but that&#x27;s the truth.</li>
            <li> Rock solid. Don&#x27;t mess with the others. You will know the second you turn it on its quality.</li>
            <li> love it use it all the time</li>
            <li> Works fine. It would be even more helpful with round nose attachment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a trimmer for a long time.  This item has certainly met my expectations.  I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I ordered it and liked it. It is not super fancy but works well. The base does not take up to much space. Charge is good. I would order this product again. And the price was fair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not exaggerating when I say that I use this product a lot and probably charge it once a month. Very precise blade and easy to use and change out for the other extensions. MUST BUY if in the market for a all in one trimmer.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the it takes a little bit of &amp;#34;fiddling&amp;#34; to change the heads but otherwise no complaints. Comes with a useful set of attachments and the lithium battery has been great-the unit never bogs down.  I would have given it 4 stars if it came with a travel bag.</li>
            <li> We owned an older version of a Wahl trimmer.  After some abuse, one had damaged blades and the other one was &amp;#34;adopted&amp;#34; by another family member.  This lead to the purchase of this new Wahl, which outperforms it&#x27;s older counterparts.  While it is a lighter weight than the older one, it provides superior performance so far.  Longetivity and durability are yet to be determined.</li>
            <li> Had one of these for 5 years. It finally died after my kids dropped it over 50 times. It worked so well I replaced it with the same thing!</li>
            <li> I only use this to trim my beard so I can&#x27;t speak to the function of the shaver. I was pleased with how quickly this shipped and the price that I paid for the quality of the product. It holds a charge for what seems like forever and is easy to clean. I am pleased and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> We are very happy withis purchase, excellent quality and a great shaver for the price. My husband said this is one of the best he has ever had for a shaver. all the attachments are great too.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what he needed, and he seemed to like it.  Nice to give something other than video game related things !!!!!</li>
            <li> This foil razor gave a surprisingly close shave.  The attachments are a nice addition.  Good value for the money.  The only drawback is the not so ergonomic shape of the shaver, otherwise, 5 stars.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is very nice and works perfectly and is powerful. The battery lasts quite long between charges (I used it about 10 times and did not need to charge it so far). I love the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However:&lt;br /&gt;Most of the accessories are useless (the only one I use is one of the combs to protect the blade when not in use...), and I would have traded all of them against a better charging function.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no charging indicator (no indication that it is charging and no indication that the battery is full), the charging is totally open loop (plug, leave for a few hours and hope it is charged).&lt;br /&gt;Also the wall brick is not a standard power brick, but is actually the charger itself (4.2V output &#x3D; Full voltage of a Lithium battery). It seems they saved the cost of a charging regulator in the trimmer. So in case you lose the wall-brick, don&#x27;t try to replace it with a 5V USB brick, I suppose that you can destroy the battery.&lt;br /&gt;The charger is also 110V only (while most of the countries are using 220V now and a battery powered shaver is likely to be used for travelers...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary: a very nice trimmer showing that Wahl&#x27;s engineering is good and they know how to make good products. But I think that Wahl&#x27;s Marketing is not, and did some wrong choices about cost saving of the charger. I think it would have made more sense to decrease the amount of accessories and use the saved money for a better charging function and standard auto-ranging wall-brick.</li>
            <li> All attachments work great.  Holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> I used this trimmer two times before it broke. Just stopped working all together. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I like this product due to its many attachments for different hair lengths. When I was first shopping around for a new beard trimmer, I had no idea what to look for, so the top rated product on Amazon was a Philips-norelco brand beard trimmer at the time. I had remembered that I had previously had a terrible experience with my Philips-norelco rechargeable razor, and also remembered that my Wahl Chrome Pro Clipper set has far exceeded my expectations, so I went with Wahl just from my previous experiences, and could not be happier. This unit is rechargeable, and comes with a handy-dandy little station to hold all the attachments and the razor itself. This one product is really all you need to remain a well-groomed and distinguished man. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: Awesome trimmer, only downside that SOME people may see is that it does not have a vacuum system. I however, do not care.</li>
            <li> They fail to mention that this is a &#x27;disposable&#x27; device. I have had two of them. After about 18-24 months the battery dies and that is to be expected. The problem is that the battery is soldered to the circuit board via two clips and is NOT replaceable. Because it is a Lithium battery it needs to disposed of in an environmentally responsible manner. I am now looking for a replacement --- a WIRED replacement.</li>
            <li> CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- Purchased at Walmart for 39.99&lt;br /&gt;- Has 40 million attachments.&lt;br /&gt;- Attachments are awkward and painful to switch.&lt;br /&gt;- Motor unreliable and alternates speeds when it feels like it, conveniently catching and chomping on your facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;- After charging for 3 days, battery lasts for 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;- Made a full grown man cry just wanting a simple shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Good aerodynamics when thrown against wall.&lt;br /&gt;- Looks good in a medium sized or lg. trash can&lt;br /&gt;- Chrome has a plastic-y look to it.</li>
            <li> My second ,does a great job until the blades get dull,parts more expensive than buying a whole new razor.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a nice unit. it works pretty well. my only complaint is the small tip which I wanted to trim between my dogs paws.&lt;br /&gt;It seem the teeth are too close together and it won&#x27;t cut the hair. PS.. My dog has very fine Hair...</li>
            <li> This thing has some torque. My 20 year old son has heavy facial hair and hates to shave every day. This seems to help keep him somewhat presentable on a daily basis without ripping up his face. He really likes it.</li>
            <li> Something would occasionally come lose and prevent the trimmer from turning on despite being fully charged. It would then randomly start working again. When it worked, it worked well. There were more attachments than I knew what to do with, but I found a subset I could reliably use to trim to a style I enjoyed. I dealt with the problems periodically for a few months until I replaced it with a trimmer from another company.</li>
            <li> This is really good.  The shaver doesn&#x27;t do that great of a job, but I like having all of the attachments and the fact that the set is so compact, which is important for my travel needs.</li>
            <li> This set is great my mother brought me this set 6 years ago it work&#x27;s so nice that I had to buy me another set.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible product. We ordered it in March and by May it was already starting to act up. It wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge and the blades would stick even after cleaning and using the oil. It is now September and we&#x27;ve noticed that the power socket is totally corroded. This thing cost $36.99 and died in less than a year. I&#x27;m going back to the Panasonic item we bought before for $19.99 and which lasted over three years before finally dying. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> This device stopped working just past the 30 day return window.</li>
            <li> Made in USA. Replacing the one I have had for years that still works fine but wanted this same one only new.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor. It holds a charge for a long time, and is so easy to use. I really like the weight of this razor. It fits good in my hand, and feels like it is well made.</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned! Nuff said, except I have to type 10 more word for review to be accepted :s</li>
            <li> I have been a Wahl customer for years, and this is their best trimmer yet.  The lithium battery lasts a lot longer between charges than previous models.  Even though the razor heads seem to be of cheaper construction they are better at cutting.  There are far more attachments for varied types of trimming.  The one drawback for me is that you have to remove the trimmer from the base and plug the charger cord into the trimmer.  Although this would be a plus for travel, as you don&#x27;t need to bring the base with you. This is a great product for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> in all seriousness that is exactly what I use this for, slide on the 1/8 guard and you are good to go down there. when you want to keep your body hair in check take the guards off and it will do what you want it to, or interchange the heads to line the back of your hair up on your neck. Had this product for over a year and half and always enjoyed its convenience and reliability. It finally died out on me when I left it plugged in charging for 4 days straight. Now I am in the market on buying a new one, possibly this one again.       Bottom line I would recommend.</li>
            <li> failed to even work - made in the USA is why I purchased this trimmer - why I bother I do not know, lucky Amazon stands behind the products they sell because this one was BAD !</li>
            <li> This thing works and holds a charge for EVER. The cut is very close and has quiet and powerful trimmers. I used this in Afghanistan for everything from trimming my beard and all my body hair to full-on haircuts. I could do this probably three times (whole body and hair) before needing to recharge. It&#x27;s three years old now and it still works great, but I left the charger at home, and I&#x27;ve misplaced most of the attachments now after so many moves. So, instead of having my wife search all over creation for the parts and charger back home, I&#x27;ll just pay $40 to have a new set shipped. Great product Wahl!</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer because of the numerous attachments available along with it&#x27;s affordability.  Unfortunately it does not have enough torque to mow any sort of &#x27;thick&#x27; hair.  I recommend purchasing a Wahl professional versus this unit.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is great at first,  but they have a battery problem!  The trimmer will not hold a charge in about 6 months,  It will not even get threw a trimming at full charge.  And you cannot just plug it up,  you have to wait for about 10 minutes of charging to finish trimming</li>
            <li> I tried 4 different models of cordless, all-in-one trimmers before settling on this unit, so I do have plenty of first-hand experience with this product and its competitors. If you can find it for under $30, don&#x27;t think twice and buy it (I found this unit advertised at a large electronics superstore for just under $20 after buying my 4th all-in-one cordless trimmer from a large deparment store that has a 110% price guaranty, so I really found a bargain).   The powerplant in this model (Lithium vs. the older NiCad or NiMH rechargables) makes this the one to beat against all others in the sub-$60 price-range. The Lithium battery, and related power output is its best feature. I used it daily as my shaver for 10 days straight, plus gave myself and my thick-furred dog a buzz-cut before I noticed any change in the power output... straight out of the box!   My dog&#x27;s hair is the thickest of any hair, located anywhere on any mammal on the Earth, so when this unit made easy work of his steel-wool mayne, I bragged it up to my three brothers and each one bought this model (when it was on sale for one weekend in November).  Our wives/girlfriends of course requested a man-scapeing session right away, and it passed that test with flying colors (and no nicks, scrapes or scratches... whew!) So ladies and gents, don&#x27;t waste your time with the older-technology rechargeables no matter how amazing the blades are or how many toys it comes with. Go cordless, go lithium and go home to a well-groomed human, rather than an unruly sasquatch (unless that \\&quot;Bear\\&quot; look is your thing). Great product!</li>
            <li> My experience is pretty good in this trimmer. The batery least long time without have to charge again. I shave once a week and it least like 3 months. Me machine is loud, but works good. I recomend it. The accesories are interesting.</li>
            <li> Its good buy but smaller than I anticipated.very functional.&lt;br /&gt;I like the most diferent attachement very convinient.&lt;br /&gt;A stand charger would have been better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve waited a long while to write this--two years--because electronic items often don&#x27;t last a long time and/or they work well at first and then crap out.  This item is well worth the money; indeed, for my money, it&#x27;s the best of its kind on the market (and now I see that Amazon is selling it for even less than I paid for it!).  It charges quickly, and it holds a full charge a looooong time.  In sum, it does what it&#x27;s suppose to do and does it well.  If there&#x27;s one \\&quot;negative\\&quot; aspect to this model, it&#x27;s the rubber handle that seems to attract cut hair (due to static build-up), but it cleans off easily with a light brush. This product was worth every penny I paid for it.</li>
            <li> Initially, I had a had good things to say about this product and now find myself editing this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 35 days, I am returning it. The plastic attachments are horrible and made out of a very poor plastic. They stretch and will not stay on any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual trimmer was fine, although I had a small complaint about it as well. The base is ridiculous as you have to gently place the trimmer in there with the cord, hoping that it doesn&#x27;t interfere with anything else or cause a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have ordered a replacement trimmmer as Amazon was kind enough to refund my purchase and issue a shipping label for its prompt return, even after their 30 day refund policy had expired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep everyone updated with my new findings.</li>
            <li> We have received this gift. I can&#x27;t speak for Dale on liking it yet, but I will let you know on Christmas. thanks so much!!!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have extensive experience with other trimmers, but this seems pretty solid to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only complaints are that the little stand that comes with it doesn&#x27;t seem very well thought out.  The thing comes with tons of little add-on bits and bob, and they don&#x27;t really seems to fit into the stand in any coherent way.  The picture shown here on has some of the add-ons in the stand.  And even trying to do exactly what they have in the picture, I found that many of the pieces don&#x27;t really fit in their places as shown snugly.  It&#x27;s like the cavities in the stand weren&#x27;t really designed for the accessories that were included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But other than that I&#x27;ve got no problems.  I use mostly the 6-way adjustable guard to trim my beard.  And it&#x27;s not a terrible thing when the worst complaint is &amp;#34;it has too many accessories&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have continued to purchase trimmers over the past few years, only to have to continue to buy new ones because of the poor quality of them. This is high quality, well built equipment.</li>
            <li> My last Wahl shaver lasted about 10 years, so I opted to stick with the brand.  I purchased this &amp;#34;all-in-one&amp;#34; because it came with the &amp;#34;dual shaver&amp;#34;, but the dual shaver doesn&#x27;t do anything.  It works fine for it&#x27;s original design of being just a shaver.  In hindsight, I would have purchased the cheaper model that doesn&#x27;t come with all of the accessories and a separate duel shaver because I ended up having to get a dual shaver anyway.</li>
            <li> After my last Wahl shaver decided to give it up after a very very long time, it was time and it was more cost effective to buy a new Wahl vs getting the elderly model fixed. Has a good selection of various attachments and has worked well since its purchase.  If you are looking for a cost effective trimmer, get a Wahl like this one. It&#x27;s light weight and cordless.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Good performance for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Every attachment you&#x27;d ever want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The battery in my first trimmer would not hold a charge, but Amazon replaced it promptly.&lt;br /&gt;The black handle is a soft, rubbery material which is good to hold onto. However, it also grabs clippings and does not easily let them go. This is an appearance issue only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All things considered, I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I had to leave a review for this awful trimmer. If you enjoy having your hair forcibly ripped from your face, you will love this thing. Worst electric trimmer I have ever owned, and I have owned some cheap pieces of junk before.</li>
            <li> aA larger set than I thought but is deff. a great one I got is as a gift for Christmas and my hubby loved it..</li>
            <li> works great! It has so many ways to it make your own. You can style and groom to how ever you like. I would reccomend this product!</li>
            <li> I am happy so far with the trimmer.  The only issue I have is there are to many attachments.  The tray provided can hold all attachments.  The trimmer it&#x27;s self works great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for over a month and I&#x27;ve had no problems except what to do with all the attachments. I was warned by the reviews and not only that, some of my old attachments fit this one.  I bought this as a beard trimmer and nothing else.  They could keep the price down if they would give us only what we need it for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wahl is a great product and I had my last one for approximately seven years.</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;+Cuts/trims effectively&lt;br /&gt;+Various accessories&lt;br /&gt;+Lasting battery&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-Rubber handle attracts hair/shavings&lt;br /&gt;-Too many accessories with no practical storage&lt;br /&gt;-Stand does NOT hold accessories effectively (tip and fall)&lt;br /&gt;-Do NOT get wet. At all! I mean, no water. Period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL:&lt;br /&gt;Due to hair sticking to the rubber-grip, I was forced to carefully rinse the handle.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve successfully rinsed the handle before, but after rinsing it recently, the trimmer quit working. Instantly. Kaput!&lt;br /&gt;A few drops must&#x27;ve worked their way into the mechanism and fried the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, this was a gift and I wasn&#x27;t out any money. I shall be buying myself and Wet &amp; Dry trimmer.</li>
            <li> I use this sort of trimmer for everyday shaving. I have been doing this for many years and I have burned through more trimmers than I would care to recall. I have always bought wireless trimmers, and have always ended up having to keep them plugged in. This is the first trimmer I have ever bought where this is not the case. The lithium Ion allows me to use this trimmer for 5-10 minutes every morning for more than a week in between charges, AND the motor does not become noticeably less powerful as the charge goes down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The accessories are so-so. I don&#x27;t think I would use this for anything other than shaving, beard trimming, or doing light maintenance on my hair. This is not a full sized Wahl trimmer so do not expect to open up a salon with this thing. However, if you use it for what it was designed for or what I use it for you shouldn&#x27;t have any issues. With that in mind, pretty much all of the accessories are useless for my purposes. The plastic guards seem to be good quality but I wont be cutting my own hair so I can&#x27;t verify that. The two metal trimmer attachment (one small one a little larger) work well and are sharp and smooth. The included shaving attachment look ok, but I will never use it. The precision trimming attachment works well. It also comes with a junky miniature comb, a good cleaning brush and a small amount of oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a solid piece of equipment for what it does and what it costs, this thing is probably the best at what it does, hands down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS-&lt;br /&gt;Solidly built&lt;br /&gt;great motor&lt;br /&gt;Li-ion batteries are your friend&lt;br /&gt;1-2 weeks of usage per charge&lt;br /&gt;Some good attachment&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS-&lt;br /&gt;the stand is kinda junky&lt;br /&gt;some of the attachments are useless</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a less expensive Wahl trimmer, and I&#x27;m not thrilled. Some of the guards and blades cause the razor to pull and rip at whiskers instead of shaving them off. This may be the razor that convinces me -- after twelve years -- to return to a blade and shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I purchased this since shaving was irritating, and i dont like the way i look with a fresh shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like using this product without any attachments, just the trimmer. I use this every other day before work, it lets me keep a light beard (sporadic since my facial hair hasn&#x27;t decided to fully grow out at the age of 27). It comes with my many attachments, but like other reviewers, i find them cheap and almost pointless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THINGS TO KNOW:&lt;br /&gt;this does come with small bottle of blade lube, and i recommend using it. about once a month or 6 weeks i put 1 drop of the lube on the blade and turn on the trimmer so it spreads across all \\&quot;teeth\\&quot;. If you use a drop or 2  every 6 months there is enough to last a few years. i also noticed that the trimmer seemed to get louder as i used it, BUT after lubing it 1 time it brought the noise down and keeps it smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use the little comb/brush to brush my hairs out of the trimmer after every use, i think the oils from the hair can wear out the trimmer quicker, which means having it to lube it more frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the battery last me around 2 weeks, with 3 trims per week. i probably have it on for a bout 3-4 minutes per trim. from sideburns to neck to mustache. i have owned it for at least 6 months with no issues. i only charge it when i can tell it start to slow down, usually over night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the bad:&lt;br /&gt;the tray sucks, its way too light and cheap, i couldn&#x27;t even figure out how all the pieces were suppose to fit in it. i like the super rubber grip of the trimmer, but if you pull it from the tray to quick it will just pull the tray with it and all the pieces will go flying everywhere. so i just put all the extra in a zip lock bag and stuck them under the sink. i keep the trimmer and brush/comb in the nearest drawer and your good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this all the time, it seems to last a while and i haven&#x27;t had any problems. i wouldnt use it for eyebrows or nose(Norelco NT9110/60 is the bomb for that). If you want something to keep your beard short (not shaven) then this will work, and well. just take care of it, lube and charge accordingly (only when needed). you will be happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I have a 4 yr. old Samoyed dog who&#x27;s hair is like couch stuffing. I have an Andis pet groomer electric shaver about the same price as this Whal beard trimmer. I use the Wahl on my dog much more than the Andis because the Whal beard trimmer does a better and quicker job than the Andis Pet shaver and is portable. This is my secong Wahl trimmer, because my first trimmer went out because I shaved feces off my dog&#x27;s butt and I cleaned the Wahl beard trimmer with a little too much water and it never worked again. I don&#x27;t blame that on Wahl I blame that on me. And I went out and bought another Whal beard trimmer (same model) to use on my Samoyed and it works as the first one, I am pleased and will continue to buy this trimmer when I need to.</li>
            <li> Another reviewer here had the same feedback, the unit just completely died after a few uses, in my case I think i used it about 6 times over the space of 8 weeks and now it&#x27;s completely dead. The charger will charge another clipper i have from another manufacturer but this clipper seems to be completely dead now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it *did* work i was very happy with it, but it seems like there are quality control issues, possibly with the waterproofing - this thing is supposed to be used in an moist room most of the time, so i&#x27;d be very disappointed if this is what happened to mine</li>
            <li> this is my second buy on this item. the first one lasted approx 5 years or more. very good trimmer and now has even more options. the only thing with lithium batteries is when they are dying they just quit, not much warning, but a full charge lasts a few trims, good life.</li>
            <li> I love the clipper. They could have gotten 5 stars if the quality of clipper-combs/guides and the stand were any better. I bought this to replace the Philips Norelco. The quality of clipper wins hand down. The clipper had a good grip, very good torque (it feels heavy and very stable) and the blade is far superior. Only if they had the combs/guides to match.</li>
            <li> Great product, easy to use, but did not come with attachments that was pictured, I was looking for a product that would cover my grooming needs, thought this was it, but now I&#x27;ll need to order more attachments.</li>
            <li> The trimmer comes with good reviews but I found it to be underpowered. It cannot line up hair and it cannot give you a clean cut. It will always leave stubble no matter how much I tried. Even when I changed the heads. I would not recommend this item</li>
            <li> Great product. Powerful.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I have been using it for the last three weeks now and its working very well. I recommended it to my farther in-law and I bought one for him and he really likes it.</li>
            <li> Love it. Use it to trim the whole body and it&#x27;s easy as could be. Battery lasts a long time. Seems very durable after 3 months of use every few weeks.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband as a Christmas gift a year ago. My dad used it to nce and loved it so now he owns one too.</li>
            <li> perfect for me. fits all of my needs.</li>
            <li> For the money I paid for this item I was hoping I would get me than 6 months of use out of it befor the rechargablr batteries quit taking charge. I bet the people at Walmart thought I look funny coming in with a half trimmed beard so I could get a new one</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the quality of the product. Hubby doesnt use it all that much. Went back to his old one.</li>
            <li> The base is just terrible.  You really can&#x27;t use the base to hold the razor while plugged in.  The connector does not mount to the base and none of the accessories fit in the base as advertised.  This will be my last Wahl product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;wooville</li>
            <li> Excellent. If I had to complain about anything it would be that some hair will stick to the handle</li>
            <li> To first put things in context I don&#x27;t use this trimmer as an \\&quot;all-in-one\\&quot;. I use it for one purpose and one purpose alone and that is to trim my goatee. So I don&#x27;t use all the attachments and I use it about 3 times/week. I did try the shaver attachment just out of curiosity and although I wouldn&#x27;t want to use it on a daily basis(then again I haven&#x27;t had an electric any different), it does work as a back up if I happen to run out of blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I bought this October 31, 2011, charged it up, AND NEVER RECHARGED IT UNTIL FEBRUARY 2013!!! That&#x27;s 15 months on it&#x27;s initial charge! I was actually really worried as at times I was wondering whether or not I was going to be able to find the charger for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I really like the unit for my application and obviously battery life is exceptional. I know I did read another review similar where the initial charge lasted forever but subsequent charges didn&#x27;t last long at all so I&#x27;ll have to see how long this charge now lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 03/30/2014&lt;br /&gt;Finally had to recharge this for the SECOND time! That&#x27;s 13 months after the last charge. Nuff said!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now had this trimmer for about a month. It performs well but takes some getting used to. The accessory tray is too small and attachments fall out easily. The handle is coated with black rubber which must be for better grip but hair and beard particles stick to it. The only way you can get them off is with a damp rag. The various trimming attachments also attach loosely to the trimmer head and sometimes fall off while in use. In summary, it is not a bad trimmer and is offered at good price.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product, I am really pleased with it. Now finally I do not have to spend lot of time and money.</li>
            <li> Nice trimmer setup, easy to use and change over from one setup to another.  The battery last a long time with a single charge so no need to plug it in every day.  my only complaint, and why at 4 stars, is that the grip is made of a material designed to give you a better grip, but it also tends to have small bits of hair stuck to it when you use it and it is somewhat hard to clean off.</li>
            <li> The arrival was before expected. The product is exactly as discribed. My son, is extremely happy with this Trimmer. He has used and own much more expensive trimmers, and He says this is as good or better than the most expensive He has ever own.</li>
            <li> After reading a few reviews I was a little iffy on what to expect. I&#x27;ve had the trimmer now for about two months and its great. It&#x27;s everything that I wanted in a trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;The pluses on the trimmer is it cuts hair pretty close to the skin. The teeth on the cutter head do not get caught in my pores/hair falical like other trimmers I&#x27;ve had. I don&#x27;t know how long the battery lasts but I only charge it once a week and there is still stronge battery life before I put it in a charge. The trimmer hair guides work very well&lt;br /&gt;Although they&#x27;re some downsides. If you wanted to use the trimmer for your nose it will be a little difficult. The head attachment for nose trimming is flat and not really designed for that use. Also the rubber grip attracts hair very well and sticks. I found that a cheap 30 cent toothbrush removed it fairly easy.&lt;br /&gt;All in all the trimmer is great and I would recommend it to anybody who was looking for a bang for your buck trimmer</li>
            <li> used it the very night i got it came precharged and it shaped me just right lol now I don&#x27;t have to go pay someone else to do it</li>
            <li> Had high expectations for this trimmer...it did not meet them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Lithium power. I have no idea why lithium trimmers are not more common; the battery keeps a charge for a very long time, recharges fast, and has plenty of power. Blades do cut well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: first off, this thing HURTS! From day one it was very difficult to trim without nicking myself with the blades. I got used to holding them a certain way to minimize injuries, but after using other trimmers and not having to be so careful during normal use, this one can only be described as mildly dangerous at best...especially if used in sensitive areas (get my drift?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the blades began to rust almost right away. Even when following the oiling &amp; cleaning instructions, rust began to appear after only a couple of uses. This did not really impede the item&#x27;s functioning, but with the constant nicking this thing causes, having the risk of cutting myself with a rusty blade every time I trimmed was not fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m the type to use a product until it dies, so I will say that this trimmer lasted me over a year before the main blade finally cracked &amp; broke. I replaced it with a Philips Norelco QG3360/42 Multigroom Plus and was VERY pleased. The Phillips model shaves so smooth &amp; easy that a baby could use it. I should have returned this Wahl and replaced it earlier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the lithium battery is all this model has going for it, and that ain&#x27;t enough. try the Phillips instead...you&#x27;ll thank me.</li>
            <li> Dull blades rip out more hair than it cuts. Have to go over the same area over and over to get a clean cut. Don&#x27;t buy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for about 2.5 years, and the battery is only holding a charge for about 10 minutes, and the plastic case is separating where the attachments go in, so they don&#x27;t have as tight of fit as they should have. It has been great up until now, but am going back to a Phillips Norelco in the next month or so...</li>
            <li> I have purchased 5-6 electric trimmers over the years and have found this to be one of the best. highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Good product, well built and runs well.  Very powerful and a charge lasts a good long time.  I have had it last several months on one charge.  The attachments are not its strong point but I don&#x27;t need them as much as others so for me it rates 5 stars.  If you were dependent on the attachments for your needs it would rate significantly lower as the attachments are not as well made as the trimmer itself.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace one of the large corded Wahl units. I love the portability and ease of use. It holds a charge and is much less messier on the bathroom counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have mentioned, the attachments leave a bit to be desired though. Very plastic-y and kinda cheap. You also may not find the proper length you&#x27;re looking for. Overall I&#x27;m pleased though.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer, just what I expect from Wahl. The LI batteries last a long time and the various attachments make it flexible. I recommend you find a bottle of Wahl or some other brand trimmer oil and use it regularly. That will keep the blades sharper and make your battery last longer. Great project I love mine.</li>
            <li> I am using this to shave because I am not very fond of a clean cut and the troubles of conventional razors. Great for Manscaping as well!!!  I would say that I use this about once a week and literally plug it in to charge once every 2-3 months.  It seems to run forever.  Great replacement for my old trimmer that had to stay plugged in as the batter was kaput!</li>
            <li> not bad for this price, easier to handle and use, it&#x27;s hard to clean up, but with water, it&#x27;s easier to clean</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it a lot yet, but so far it works great. The battery seams to last long time, again so far.</li>
            <li> EARNED IT&#x27;S RATING BY IT&#x27;S PERFORMANCE.  WOULD RECOMEND IT TO OTHER&#x27;S IT CUT WELL AND IS VERSITILE AS WELL THANKS</li>
            <li> so far this is the best trimmer I have ever owned.  the parts seem to go togather well, and stay in place.</li>
            <li> I have owned 4 different trimmers over the last 10 years. This trimmer is hands down the best. Sharp blades and good power, with a ton of adapters gets a very even trim every time. Fast charging that lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> lots of attachments, shaver does a really good job, havent charged it in awhile and is still running strong. so far im happy.</li>
            <li> This is the second trimmer I have owned. The first one was a Wahl that looked just like this. It lasted at least 10 years. This new one has an upgraded lithium ion battery that will last much longer. I shopped hard for the best price, and Amazon was lowest, including Walmart online. The free shipping can&#x27;t be beaten. This is a great trimmer, Made in the USA, and at a super-low price. It works great. Has professionally ground trimmer head, that is way better than the forged trimmer head (blades) on the cheaper units. This is the cheapest and best of the machined, professional-quality trimmer head. I love the fact that it is Made in the USA, the best, and so competitively priced!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly, and comes with many times the accessories that most users will need. Put the rest of them away and just have access to the ones you use.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this trimmer when I first got it, but now it won&#x27;t hold a charge to even fully trim my goatee.  I now have to purchase something new and I doubt that it will be a Wahl product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give this trimmer 4-5 stars if the rechargeable battery was good!</li>
            <li> La Bateria dura muchisimo, los cortes son excelentes.. la he utilizado en mi barba y realmente hace lo que describe el fabricante.. recomiendo este producto..</li>
            <li> Charges quickly and really holds its charge. So many attachment that I actually read the instructor manual....Twice !  A real bargain.</li>
            <li> I bought my trimmer back in October and use 2-3 times a week and love it. I just had to charge it for the first time.  It does everything I need in a beard trimmer.  The stand for all the assessories could use a little work but over all very impressed with the trimmer</li>
            <li> Very cheap - I was only able to use it a handful of times before needing to get something else.  The blades will get clogged very easily.  Not the best product out there for sure.</li>
            <li> very good beard trimmers trim very closely. They also come with the small guards up to the large guards and definitely edges well would definitely buy it again but mine has lasted a long time and I believe it will last for years longer.</li>
            <li> great service great item to have</li>
            <li> I have owned this trimmer for about 5 years now and am only replacing it because I have dropped it 4-5 times but it held up was very durable.  Very easy to switch out the attachments that it comes with.  Also holds a very long charge, I hardly ever had to charge it.  Great product I am happy to buy another one.</li>
            <li> Bought this trimmer in december used it 30 times more or less on stubble now its sits not operating at all call Amazon given a 815 number to call good luck adios  beware</li>
            <li> Excellent product.. love the attachments  low noice -  i wish it came with a bag  and a option to replace the battery</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. I had the previous model with its poor quality battery and this model has a great battery with several attachments. I&#x27;ve had it for about a month and have not had to charge it&#x27;s battery yet...</li>
            <li> This shaver has been one of the worst I have owned.  It started off ok and worked well.  But several months down the road the blades were loud and pulling my beard hairs.  I always oiled this twice a week every week.  The larger cutter actually broke a tooth and the other is rusting and dull.  I have had alot better luck with cheaper shavers.  This is one product I cannot recommend to anyone.  Also the battery has died and will not keep a charge. I have to keep it plugged in and turn it off and on to get through a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Works well when it did work.&lt;br /&gt;2. Battery life was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Blades are garbage and go dull very quickly even when regularly oiled.&lt;br /&gt;2. Battery does not last.  Stops taking a charge after about 1 year.&lt;br /&gt;3. Unit is loud!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I think alot of these better reviews are people reviewing after they use a month and not returning to update after it takes a turn.  I had high hopes for this shaver.</li>
            <li> I expected to be impressed, but sadly, I&#x27;m not. The trimmer I have is an older version 9854-L (Li-Ion version). It held a charge and had decent run time for the first year or so of intermittent use, but since then it&#x27; has gotten much worse. It now only runs for maybe 1-2 minutes, and even noticeably slows down even during that time. The run time is barely enough to clip half a leg now. To be fair, my trimmer is pretty old, maybe 5 years, and I&#x27;ve just sucked it up and lived with it even though it&#x27;s been getting worse and worse since there does not appear to be any way for the user to change batteries on this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the battery is not the worst part - the little cheap plastic &amp;#34;depth guides&amp;#34; have prongs that are too far apart and this thing does not control the hair length worth doo-doo. I constantly get &amp;#34;bare spots&amp;#34; where the hair is essentially clipped right at the skin, or just barely above. It looks terrible. A clipper has ONE job to do, and that is to cut the hair at length you want. This fails miserably at that. No matter how slow or carefully I control the pressure and the angle, I always get a &amp;#34;surprise&amp;#34; during every session where I get &amp;#34;balded&amp;#34;. This effect happens particularly badly with the short guide (3mm) though I have gotten &amp;#34;balded&amp;#34; by the 6mm one as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hand unit seems well made, but...&lt;br /&gt;The battery sucks terribly.&lt;br /&gt;The hair length guides cannot be trusted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short. I&#x27;m going to FINALLY throw this POS in the trash and find one that actually works the way it should. I&#x27;m tired of getting my half-leg butchered by this thing. And yes, I know, I should have tossed it out years sooner. But I&#x27;m like that.</li>
            <li> hard to get hair off of the handle, too many plastic parts that dont look very durable. blade cuts smoothly</li>
            <li> Trimmer shipped quickly and works terrific! Now my husband doesn&#x27;t look like a yeti, lol. Will be a repeat buyer :)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this not a bad product, but the quality could really have been improved. The adjustable facial hair head has a really weak slide mechanism, so it sometimes slipped down a few millimetres while I was using it and caused me to have to shave at an undesirable length. I now just use the constant-length heads, though those don&#x27;t reach the lengths possible with the adjustable head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also rusted. I don&#x27;t understand why this happened, really. I left it in the shower room a single time, and then the next day there were just rust spots all over the metal shaver. It was literally one time for 30 minutes and now this thing is covered in rust? That&#x27;s some pretty terrible quality. I can&#x27;t count the number of times I&#x27;ve left my other electronic razor in the shower room and its head is still a shiny, tetanus-shot-free shimmer. And I&#x27;ve had it for 4 years. The rust in this situation is really inexcusable.</li>
            <li> Bought for my father.  He loves it.  Uses it mainly for trimming nose and ears.  Li ion battery is a plus.</li>
            <li> Should be the first thing a man buys himself. And the last one you will ever need. It is the tops and I have owned a few.</li>
            <li> Came on time, and the blade cuts very evenly.  Lots of options like nose hair removal and rotating heads.  I shave my head and its working great.  Good groomer.</li>
            <li> Anattachment for everything and long battery life.  Excellent value. Works great.  I have used it daily for over a month and no recharging needed.</li>
            <li> This things a beast. 10x better then my old conair istubble. Battery lasts a long time per charge. Well worth it</li>
            <li> The Wall Trimmer All-In-One Lithium Ion changed my life.  I&#x27;ve had a beard for over 35 years, but only one beard trimmer.  Prior to the trimmer, I used a pair of hair scissors.  My first beard trimmer was at least ten years old.  The NiCD battery was shot.  The power cord was frayed and cut in two places.  The head was starting to rust and needed to be sharpened.  Why didn&#x27;t I buy the Wall Trimmer All-In-One Lithium Ion sooner?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure, but it&#x27;s wonderful.  The trimmer comes with several heads, so you can use it to trim your ears/nose, cut your hair, or trim your beard.  The battery lasts for weeks.  There are several guides, and it was easy to find one that was ideal to trim my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife uses the trimmer for my hair - I&#x27;m bald, but it works well trimming over my ears, neckline, and we could do my entire head.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my boyfriend for christmas. It is fantastic! The clippers do not snag on the hairs and they do a really great job! Overall very good product!</li>
            <li> The other reviewers are correct about hair sticking to the handle. It wipes off easily after you are finished, but I don&#x27;t like it. Also, the attachments I received look like they were randomly selected. I can&#x27;t find anything like a 6-position guide, and the only reasonable attachment suitable for a beard doesn&#x27;t really fit the trimmer. It looks like it was made for a full size clipper and it slides sideways when trimming because it is wider than the trimmer. Otherwise I don&#x27;t have any issues. It appears to run as advertised. I only gave it two stars because 1) the hairy handle is irritating and 2) I bought it for my beard because of the advertised attachments but it only has one reasonable attachment for that and the attachment doesn&#x27;t fit the clipper. It works, but it should fit properly.</li>
            <li> This is total junk. The motor ceased to work after literally 4 or 5 uses. Really, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas, and it works great! I don&#x27;t think he will ever use a regular razor again.</li>
            <li> I chose this item because I thought Wahl was a good product but it really doesn&#x27;t trim my husbands head very well and he is quite bald.  I would not recomment this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for one of my friends. He loves it. Says that it cuts nicely and loves that it has many different guard options.</li>
            <li> worst product ever its painful when i use it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;very bad quality .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t buy it</li>
            <li> I have tried a ton of trimmers, this one is one of the best! The only bad thing is the base, it&#x27;s small and very easy to break.</li>
            <li> Boyfriend likes it. Although I&#x27;m pretty sure I saw this at Wal-Mart cheaper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll add my voice to the chorus of 1 stars.  I purchased it one year ago.  It worked fine at first.  After 6 months of once a week use, I had problems with it holding a charge.  After one year, using it maybe 60 times total, it only vibrates for a few seconds and dies.    The cheap Philips it replaced lasted 4 years, and was dull, but still running when I \\&quot;retired\\&quot; it.    Avoid this one.</li>
            <li> This is the second one I&#x27;ve bought for him.  He says they work great.</li>
            <li> This thing maybe works well 20% of the time, the other 80% leaves me cursing as it tugs and pulls the hairs out when i try to trim my beard. The sole purpose for my purchase was to have a little more customization when trimming my beard and although this product does supply that I cant believe the amount of hairs it just pulls out of my face.</li>
            <li> As with other one star reviews the same power failure happened with mine after a few weeks.  I sent it to the manufacturer for repairs and the same thing happened.  Not worth the money even with the warranty.  I expect products to work properly as intended and this one greatly falls short.  Product will work for less than two minutes even if plugged in.  Update:  for the second time it has been repaired and so far it is working great.  Wahl has amazing customer service.  This is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve owned but I hope they work on that power supply issue</li>
            <li> Husband loves it.  Bought to replace one that bit the dust.  It has so many attachments,  you can trim pretty much anything with this puppy.  Strong motor,  fairly quiet operation.  It has some heft in the hand, and feels good.  He has had no issues with tugging or pulling.  I trimmed his neck with it and the sharp blades did great on those wiry neck hairs.</li>
            <li> These are great. Low cost, but last a long time. They battery last plenty long to shave your entire body or head without slowing down. I never tried the little attachments like the nose trimmer or shaver. I can&#x27;t stand electric razors on my face so I can&#x27;t speak to their quality. These have been the best clippers so far out of 6 different ones.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this for his beard.  Works great, sleek design.</li>
            <li> got it at 20 bucks, great value for price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this model shaver for 3 years now. The first model last 3 years and I just bought a new razor with the lithium ion battery and YES the battery is better. Coming from someone who literally ran the razor to death I can say the battery charges faster and lasts longer. I hope Wahl never stops making this model.</li>
            <li> Good variety of trim attachments, easy to use, and battery life is great.</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned when I opened the box that this would be underpowered given its size and weight.&lt;br /&gt;It works great. It has a whole myriad of attachments, I can&#x27;t imagine needing something it didn&#x27;t already come with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To charge the trimmer you plug in a small plug in its base. With the charger attached, you are still able to set it in the stand. It does not have a charging cradle.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer at Walmart a couple years ago and only had to recharge it a couple of times. I was disappointed when the motor burned out, and looking to replace it. The problem is that Walmart no longer carried this particular model.  I&#x27;ve been through numerous trimmers of different brands and this one lasted the longest and worked the best. I was so excited to get this on Amazon at a great price. Facial hair, body hair, nose hair, this thing manscapes them all like a pro.</li>
            <li> Worked well when it did.  Stopped working completely after a charge, was not heavily used.  Only lasted a year, not worth the purchase if it fails so quickly.</li>
            <li> My husband said It&#x27;s just ok. Not real easy changing heads. Not sure if we would buy a Wahl again.</li>
            <li> Bought this to use as a body trimmer. It works great. The motor seems well constructed and this little trimmer has some power. The cordless lithium ion is a nice feature. The trimmer fits nicely in your hand and it is easy to manipulate. The one area where this falls short is the height attachments. I haven&#x27;t tried all of them yet but the height adjusters are cheap and they don&#x27;t mount that well. They don&#x27;t fall off but they do slide side to side. This is the one area keeping this from a 5-star review. I did not have any issues using the trimmer because of this but I do anticipate the height adjusters not holding up over time. If they could fix this one thing, it would be perfect.  Overall solid though and worth the price.</li>
            <li> Saved a bunch of money on this and it was delivered very quickly!  Lasts forever on 1 charge and helps me achieve my &#x27;Don Johnson&#x27; look quickly and easily every day.</li>
            <li> After going through two Norelco beard trimmers over a period of 12 to 15 years, I decided to try a Wahl. The rechargeable battery wore out eventually on both Norelcos, and it was really more difficult to replace than I would have liked. I mean, soldering iron? I&#x27;ve got one, but I&#x27;m not going that route. Reviews said that the Wahl battery was easily replaceable and the motor was strong, so I went for it. I&#x27;ve been using it for several months, and here are my thoughts. There are way too many parts. They are difficult to put on and take off. Intuitiveness does not come into play here. The device is difficult to clean. Very difficult. Hovering around impossible. And how does it work? You have to hold it very carefully at a precise angle for it to cut properly. But the motor is strong and the battery has given me no problems. For a beard and extraneous hair cutter, it works adequately. However, I dread having to use it, and I think that I won&#x27;t wait for the replaceable battery to wear out before I get another Norelco.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times since I received this trimmer and it has meet all my expectations. I love the Lithium Ion battery, more power longer life. I can actually travel away from home for a few weeks and not need to bring the charger. Now mind you I don&#x27;t trim my goatee every day maybe twice a week but the power and charge is always there, never disappointed. Unlike my old Ni-Cd charged trimmer which would be dead within a few days if not left in the charger. I have yet to use all the attachments that came with my trimmer but at this point I have high exceptions and I&#x27;m sure they will be meet. The blades in this unit are sharp, sharp, sharp and give a smooth trim without irritation.</li>
            <li> This is the trimmer set for men who have broken their flimsy plastic man-groomers.  The set is fully equipped with solid accessories for all your trimming needs in a solid-feeling chassis and well-crafted blades.  Charges quickly and the charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This razor shipped in no time, and I got it for my boyfriend for his birthday. He&#x27;s always wanted one but didn&#x27;t feel like buying it. So me, sick and tired of his non shaven face, got him a razor that won&#x27;t give him razor burn. He absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> The unit worked great for the first couple weeks. Now the thing won&#x27;t hold a charge and due to Amazon&#x27;s 30 day return policy it is no longer able to sent back for a replacement.</li>
            <li> Like the clippers, easier to hold than an old Wahl clippers I had.&lt;br /&gt;The attachments, on the new clippers, were&lt;br /&gt; much cheaper than the ones on the old Wahl&lt;br /&gt;clippers. I don&#x27;t think the new large attachment&lt;br /&gt;was as big as the M/S attachment on old clippers.</li>
            <li> It works for An affordable price.</li>
            <li> Used for ma friend in the hospital. Excellent and affordable</li>
            <li> Purchased this trimmer in June of 2009...5 years and it&#x27;s still going strong. I charge it once every month or so using it twice a week to trim my face before a shave. Quality must have suffered recently because all of these reviews for new models seem very bad. It&#x27;s shame because I would have purchased another if this one were ever to die. I&#x27;ll be making the switch to a Phillips Norelco once that day comes.</li>
            <li> Husband is very pleased with this purchase. He&#x27;d had a Wahl that he used for many years and that&#x27;s why we purchased this item.</li>
            <li> This is great product, quality, very good price. What I like the most is the fact that charge takes a long time and if for some reason you need to use and no charge, a 5 min plugged to the electricity is enough. Wahl is still doing great products!</li>
            <li> Very nice trimmer for the money and would highly recommend. It was ready for use right out of the box and works much better than any I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several trimmers and this one by far is the best. Its got the power and all the attachments you will ever need. Big plus + It&#x27;s quality American made product.</li>
            <li> have used it quite a bit and love it so far,was surprised with the foil shaver it does a great job, thanks Wahl.</li>
            <li> I bought this expensive set and it arrived without a charger. Now i have to pay for an accessory it should have had in the first place.</li>
            <li> I bought this in April 2013.  It stopped functioning in December 2013, and it is now too late to return it.  So go ahead and buy this if you want something that will break and stop functioning in less than a year.</li>
            <li> I am a man who began going bald at the age of 19. Since I am no fan of the comb-over, I have been shaving my head for the last 20 years. I have used various trimmers and hair clippers over the years and have always ended up with wahl trimmers for close cuts and long lasting clippers. That being said, these trimmers set a new standard for power and trim level. This morning I just set a new record for speed and height, trimming my hair. And for those reading the reviews of noise and vibration...I don&#x27;t know what other trimmers you have tried but these trimmers are less loud and have less vibration than the last set of wahls that i owned and by far outperform any, even my corded clippers for closeness of cut. If you trim tough mustaches and beards or even use them on your head, buy these.</li>
            <li> Product stopped working after 3 months of moderate to little use. The switch on the product broke, now it doesn&#x27;t turn on.</li>
            <li> Trimmer works as advertised. Comes with many attachments and all work as advertised.  A good value for the money. Would recomend.</li>
            <li> I took care of it pretty well, and it took care of my facial hair pretty well, until 6 months in it just doesn&#x27;t work anymore.</li>
            <li> Trimmer made of quality materials to be durable. The attachments are really useful because it can be used in various ways. The battery lasts a long time. It hasn&#x27;t needed a charge since the first. The only downside is that hair will get stuck to the rubber handle, and will need a wet cloth to remove the hairs.</li>
            <li> This unit was a bit weird to use at first but now I have the hang of it. Would rather use a razor than the beard trimmer due to face rash potential.</li>
            <li> This product has all the accessories needed to be a great trimmer. Shipped quick and looks like a good quality product even though my husband hasn&#x27;t used it just yet.</li>
            <li> I bought this specifically for the lithium ion battery. Another product with ni-cad had a short charge life. Well, this one wasn&#x27;t any better. Used it twice a month on my back and it has died after about two years. I charge it over night and it literally dies after less than 30 seconds. It worked well the first year, but I won&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> My husband got one first.  Then we got one for my 15 year old son.  Both of them really like this shaver.  I also use it to trim their neckline.  Works great.</li>
            <li> Amazing battery life and the attachments are of wonderful quality. Best quality trimmer I&#x27;ve owned to date. One small issue is that the main razor attachment tends to pop out a tad easily, so that when I&#x27;m removing a plastic attachment I tend to remove both at the same time, but that might just be me.</li>
            <li> I shave my head and trim my facial hair every other day. I have been through 8 clipper/trimmers in the last 3 years. Nothing is this close or this fast. Well built and strong for thick hair. I like it. i only wish it was all made in the U.S.A</li>
            <li> One negative is that the hair is hard to clean off the trimmer. Everything else is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Now this is a good product, you can beat the trim job that this trimmer does. I am very happy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many trimmers and this have the best power and battery life by far.  I use it to trim my hair very short and to maintain a goatee, so it&#x27;s quite versatile.  I don&#x27;t use all the attachments, but the ones that I do are sharp and trim well.  I really like this trimmer and hope that it stands the test of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two improvements that I&#x27;d recommend is a charge status indicator and an improved base for all the attachments.  I&#x27;ve had other trimmers with a small LED to indicate when a charge is completed or needed.  The trimmer just stopped working when it needed a charge.  I liked that it stopped, rather than draining slowly down to non-operation, but I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was broken or needed a charge.  Same when charging it, I wasn&#x27;t sure when it was complete.  Regarding the stand, it&#x27;s not intuitive where all the attachments go.  The picture on the box doesn&#x27;t match the provided attachments, because a couple difference models appear to share the same stand.  Since the cord is not tethered to the bottom of the stand, I find that it knocks over all the attachments when I lift the razor out of the stand with the cord attached.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;he only My only grip is that the battery chargim</li>
            <li> Extremely rapid charge.  Holds charge for what seems like forever (mild usage for me).  More than enough attachments for every need.  Was worried to use the small detail trimmer in my nose.  Its loud and powerful, was afraid to cut myself.  Its all good. No worries now.  Made in USA.  Buy with confidence.</li>
            <li> Typically last a year or two, my last one Wahul 9854-600 lasted about 6 months.  Not to happy!</li>
            <li> I bought this model about 3 mos ago and am back on Amazon buying something else.  I had previously used a Wahl for several years before I &amp;#34;upgraded&amp;#34; to this model.  Compared to the old Wahl, the quality of this one is horrible.  The connectors come off in the middle of shaving, the entire head comes off for no reason sometimes. It&#x27;s really difficult to get the heads seated properly.  Most importantly, it just does not work as well as my old Wahl.  (Too bad the battery on my old shaver is dead).  I just ordered a different brand shaver today.  Hopefully it will be better than this one.  I am not sure what happened to this company.  Seems like they have lost their way.  So long wahl, you won&#x27;t see me again.</li>
            <li> Battery is very long lasting</li>
            <li> Excellent trimmer and the Li Ion batteries hold a charge well during use and storage.</li>
            <li> Most useless trimmer ever</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good trimmer with lots of attachments. The battery charges quickly and lasts for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I would give this item 5 stars if it were a lit more powerful.</li>
            <li> Blade teeth chipped but I returned for replacement no problem</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work like my old pair.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift. A little noisy but works well.</li>
            <li> Wahl has typically been a trustyworthy name, that&#x27;s one reason I went with this line.  This particular trimmer is Lithium-Ion (Li-Ion), and that means a long time between charges.  The motor is plenty powerful, the trimer selections are quite inclusive for most anyone&#x27;s beard, moustache, complex goattee.  I currently sport a Van Dyke, which needs careful grooming since my beard comes in heavy, with no thin spots.  That&#x27;s where the smallest of the trimmer heads is supreme.  This trimmer is approximately 3/8\\&quot; wide, so it&#x27;ll let you cut a distinct edging to your fur.  Granted, you&#x27;ll have to use a safety razor to get the stubble, but this outfit will groom the \\&quot;man hedge\\&quot; just fine.  So far, I&#x27;m pleased.  The beard \\&quot;combs\\&quot; allow you to keep the length nice and even in depth, and the actual shaver head isn&#x27;t too bad either, although I use a safety razor for that, since one has to come right up to the Van Dyke to keep a clean edge, and most electric razors won&#x27;t get that task done easily.  The only other thing I&#x27;d mention, is that one has to be very careful when putting on the trimmer heads, as it is a bit tricky, and the parts could break if you&#x27;re a troglodyte about it.  Caveat brutus.</li>
            <li> This has been a great product. Stays charged for months on end!</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer to replace another Wahl trimmer that I purchased 6-7 years ago. I have to say that this trimmer cuts much closer than the older one. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product. My other Wahl trimmer has lated many years, and it&#x27;s still working. And I&#x27;m confident this one will last just as long.</li>
            <li> As other people have mentioned, there is a major problem with the battery on this thing.  We bought this trimmer in April and it&#x27;s now October and the battery won&#x27;t hold a charge anymore.  This won&#x27;t be a big deal since we have a very convenient outlet in our bathroom.  However, the power connection is so crappy that it won&#x27;t even charge at all.  Additional the blades rusted quickly.</li>
            <li> Well made, had many options for lengths. The charge lasts a long time.  Better than any other of the cordless trimmers I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> No brainier. Little details matter less when compared to the quality and functions of this trimmer &amp; all around shaver and hair cutter. Very practical.</li>
            <li> I bought it two times..&lt;br /&gt;Accidentally I broke the first one during a trip and I didn´t hesitate to have it again ASAP.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for christmas.  It looks really nice and there are so many attachments!  I think he&#x27;s really going to like it :D</li>
            <li> Needs a better tray to hold the attachments. The battery doesn&#x27;t stay charged very long.  Very small, I assumed it was a bigger hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> Very poor work after a few cuts. Don&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift and he loved it.  Everything he needs in one package and the price is great.</li>
            <li> This is my second. I use it all the time and travel a lot. It is not the most durable and if you want the cleanest of shaves look elsewhere. If you are ok with the best alrrounder including a travel size model then this will cover you.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver head is not the best but gets there in the end. I highly recommend oiling often. Buy a good size oil bottle and keep it going.  For the price you can keep replacing the whole unit.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cool. Keeps your scratchdash trimmed.</li>
            <li> This is my second one. The first lasted about 5 years and I guess for something like this that is reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;Does what it is supossed to do 2 times a week.</li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer I have used it 5 or 6 times already and I haven&#x27;t had to charge it up as of let. So many attachments comes with the trimmer. Very sharp and has no problem cutting or triming your beard or mustache. It goes through thick or thin beard or mustache.</li>
            <li> Dont buy this product.  After one month the battery failed. I took it to the factory repair center to have it repaired. They kept it for over 3 months only to tell me the battery was bad and they would not fix it. Told me to come and get the trimmer and I would have to send it to the factory myself to get repaired.  Then they had the nerve to want to charge me $10 diagnostic fee. I am now looking for a other brand trimmer to buy. The 5  year warranty on this thing is worthless if they just keep it and never fix it when you send it in. Don&#x27;t waste your time buying this brand.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, this has already broken. It was purchased as a Fathers Day gift for my husband and it has already broken. He uses it about once a week to keep his beard neat and trim, it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s used to shave a goat. After having a Wahl for many years, I decided that we would go with another one when his first finally quit working. I&#x27;m so upset that this one apparently had no durability at all.</li>
            <li> Product is really very good</li>
            <li> Trimmer is just what I hoped it would be , lite weight , good assortment&lt;br /&gt;of accessors . Good for beards.</li>
            <li> Damn thing after running it under the water a few times to get the beard trimmings out. Now its useless.</li>
            <li> First off I don&#x27;t have anything against Wahl. I&#x27;ve used their products before and was happy, these clippers just suck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I only use them for my beard, of which I like to keep very trim and short...light a moderate stubble. These clippers are not precise or accurate in their clipping. You have to go over the same area multiple times and at different angles to get a level cut. It&#x27;s really frustrating to move the clippers so slow across the same spot on your chin, or your jaw, or your lip just to see that its still not even, spots where still missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also these clippers pull my hair ALL THE TIME. I don&#x27;t get it either, I don&#x27;t grow my facial hair out that long (like a 3 on the trimmer, but I trim down to a 2). And it is also snagging and pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are bad clippers. Pick a different one.</li>
            <li> Not much more to say.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it for a year. The battery holds a charge for months, I use it a couple of times a week.</li>
            <li> Nothing beats Wahl when it comes to hair.  This beard trimmer is awesome and comes with so many hair cutting features and they are all great.  Highly recommend</li>
            <li> This trimmer has many attaachments, some of which I don&#x27;t use, but they are there if needed.  Love the battery life, I only have charged it once.</li>
            <li> It seems like a great trimmer. perfect the first time I used teh product and then 2 days later the trimmer wouldn&#x27;t trun on. I called but the offices were closed. The troubleshooting said the blades might have stuck together but I oiled and they will move but I can&#x27;t get the trimmer to trun on. I will return this product.</li>
            <li> Good product from Wahl, but the image shows a very compact and organized stand. The accessories do NOT go in the stand as easily as the picture on here would imply. The stand is very flimsy plastic, and its like playing Jenga trying to get all the pieces in there. Don&#x27;t be fooled into thinking this is a very durable and efficient way of organizing everything.</li>
            <li> Bought to replace current one which I dropped and broke blade head. Parts w sh almost as expensive as new unit. Now I have a backup, doubt that I&#x27;ll ever need, tho. Orig 3 yrs old but still works even with drop. New one works great, too.</li>
            <li> Great trimming kit with lots of extras: multiple heads and attachments! The little organizing rack makes it easy to keep track of all the parts on your bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> Strong motor, good attachments, easy to use, everything you want in a simple trimmer. I am planning on buying another one.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and keeps a charge. This was a replacement for an older trimmer and we were very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need it for much, only trimming, so I don&#x27;t use the majority of the possibility it affords, but for my purposes it works great. Battery is long lasting, invaluable for trips. Size is good and its performance also seems good to my eyes</li>
            <li> Great product. I have full thick beard and keep it fairly short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likes: is very powerful &amp;#34;) , no hair pulling, great grip, easy and quick charging, good build quality for price, great for shaping and fine tuning esp. with smaller attachments, MultiComb selector for different lenghs, long battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dislikes: Attachment changes take little getting used to but once you do its a snap.&lt;br /&gt;This is a good buy for someone who has shape and trim GoaTee&#x27;s or Full Beards. I had a Remington (gave it away too weak) and used Phillips norelco but combs kept breaking.&lt;br /&gt;Rate this an A+&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to a friend and would buy again.</li>
            <li> I had another Wahl trimmer for many years. The battery had finally conked out, so I ordered another one. This thing is great. I use the trimmer only for trimming sideburns and hairline on my neck, so I really don&#x27;t need the other accessories it comes with, and the base is just inconvenient, though it looks good in the picture. I just toss my trimmer into the bathroom drawer when I&#x27;m done with it. Anyway, out of curiosity I tried shaving my face with the foil shaver. It was amazing. Considering that a Braun shaver is quite costly, I was surprised that such a good shaver came with a small, inexpensive trimmer. But I would not use it to shave my face daily--for that, I&#x27;d get a Braun.</li>
            <li> Good razor (My husband hasn&#x27;t had any complaints). The only issue i would say is that the holder for all of the pieces is a little small and it is hard to keep them all in place.</li>
            <li> Just used it and it worked perfectly.  It was light and nice not having a cord plugged in.  Designed with changeable heads and spacing comb s.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this trimmer.  It was a replacement for an older model that lasted several years.  Works great and hold a charge well.</li>
            <li> I like everything about this trimmer except the grip.  It is the kind of grip you would want on a golf club or something that has a greater likelihood of slipping out of your hands.  Lets be honest, it is not very likely you are going to lose control and this thing will slip out of your hands onto the floor.  What does happen is any hair you trim gets stuck to the handle and it is annoying.  That is my only problem.</li>
            <li> Comes charged. great for trimming my beard, and shaving my cheeks.</li>
            <li> It meets my expectations, I recommend</li>
            <li> i use this for my ball sack</li>
            <li> I see lots of reviews for this junky trimmer, and it won&#x27;t matter much to its overall rating, but I must add my two cents.  Steer clear of this god-awful product.  Oh, the instruction booklet was intricately detailed on its trimming uses, but not on how to utilize the convoluted combs relative to the attachments, which no longer fit adequately nor stay in place for any of the combinations I attempt.  Argh!!  The booklet might as well have been written in hieroglyphics.  Useless, in the end.  Now the blades have also dulled to uselessness, despite the \\&quot;self-sharpening\\&quot; claim, and it painfully pulls hairs and generally drives me nuts.  The warranty is pointless, too, as you would either receive the returned trimmer repaired, or get a replacement....another crummy Wahl trimmer, in both cases.  Oh, boy!  The museum reference pertains to my reverence for junk products, everywhere.  It&#x27;s a museum piece, to be put away in a &#x27;Chamber of Horrors of Consumer Goods&#x27; exhibit, where it can never inflict its pain again!</li>
            <li> Works great, I only use a few of the attachments but it&#x27;s a very nice shaver.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery.  Good value for the price!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for the same model I had after the battery no longer held a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think Wahl is a trusted name in the hair cutting/trimming market. My father used a Wahl to cut my hair as a kid more years ago than I care to admit and I&#x27;ve been using this to trim my beard for the last few years and I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a quality product and other than the battery which will eventually die, I would buy it again and again.</li>
            <li> really does a nice job comes with many adapters charges quick everything about this piece is really good . I am very pleased with this!</li>
            <li> [Update on battery life: I wrote this review in May after using the shaver about 15 times without a recharge. Amazingly, I have not recharged the unit since my review and it&#x27;s still going strong! I estimate that I have now enjoyed 30+ shaves without a recharge, with each shave lasting about 3 minutes. The buzzing sound is now a bit erratic, which I interpret as the charge finally wearing off, so I&#x27;m going to plug it in for a recharge.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review is for the Model 9854L, given to me as a gift. (There are at least 4 different models that look quite similar and may, in fact, be variations of the same basic design. I make no claims about the other similar 3 models.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line Up Front: This is a very capable beard trimmer with a very long battery life. It&#x27;s comfortable to hold and has many attachments. Recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My usage pattern is to trim my beard about every 4 days. I keep it at a 2-week length, well above \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; length but still quite short (less than ¼ inch). (People have called it a \\&quot;banker&#x27;s beard\\&quot;.) I don&#x27;t style it or do anything special - just zoom the trimmer along the grain of my beard using the #2 length guide, then work the trimmer against the grain to cut my mustache. I always use the full-size cutting head rather than bothering to swap it out for the ½ inch trimmer head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is comfortably light, with just enough heft to feel solid but not enough to tire my hand. The rubberized handle is exceedingly sticky, making for a secure grip. There are 3 snap-on short-hair trimming guides - 5 lengths would have been better to cover all possibilities, but I make do with the #2 guide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several trimming heads that easily swap out. I always use the basic \\&quot;full\\&quot; trimming head, but there&#x27;s a ½ inch fine trimmer (without any trimming guides, just the bare razor head) and another head for deburring neck hair. The different heads snap off and on easily as long as you remember to remove the trimming guides first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The retail package has the usual number of cheap combs and brushes. Nothing to write home about, but they do the job. And there&#x27;s a stand on which you can mount all the components. Since I only use the trimmer, I just put everything in a drawer and forget about the stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lithium-ion battery life is astounding for a unit like this. I&#x27;m used to getting only 4 to 5 trims per charge from a typical battery operated beard trimmer. With this Wahl 9854L, I&#x27;m getting over 15 trims per charge and I&#x27;ve not yet let the battery run all the way down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s not to like? As some others have mentioned, the rubberized handle is so sticky that facial hair clings tenaciously to it when you brush it or wipe it with a cloth. At first this bothered me a lot, even though I appreciated the safety value of the sticky handle. However, I discovered that the hairs come off quickly when I blow on them, so this is no longer an issue for me. [Update after 6 months of use: The stickyness wears off, leaving a very comfortable, non-slip grip. Still need to blow on the unit to get rid of the hairs, but it&#x27;s not nearly as much of an issue as when it was new.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor makes quite a buzzing sound. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, you don&#x27;t need to wear ear protection when you use it, but the sound can be heard (albeit faintly) through a closed bathroom door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The power supply is small and light, but it&#x27;s only 120V - a problem for me because I live in a dual-voltage house. If you decide to take this puppy on an overseas trip lasting less than a couple of months, just charge the trimmer and leave the power supply at home to prevent blowing it up when plugging it into a 220V outlet... or am I the only one who&#x27;s ever done that?</li>
            <li> This works great. I have a thick beard, and this helps out a lot with a very smooth trim/shave. The package contents are very useful. I am just unsure if I can wash this or not. I could not find information about that.</li>
            <li> Worked great -- for about 6 months, then it stopped working completely. The circuit boards, battery, and motor all show fairly heavy corrosion.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver kit for my husband.  Our old ones took batteries or had to be plugged in and the blades were dull.  This one is rechargeable.  We have had it about two weeks and we just love it.  The charge cord saves us the cost of purchasing batteries all the time. I would highly recommend it for that special dad  for father&#x27;s day.</li>
            <li> Even though he hasn&#x27;t tried all the various attachments yet, my husband  loved his new trimmer, which was a birthday gift. It was so sharp and everything that comes with it is amazing. I also know that Wahl is a very reliable brand.</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as described. Works great.</li>
            <li> Hubby loves this unit. He says the cut is clean and smooth. His noticed a difference from his old one immediately. No more &amp;#34;sharp&amp;#34; jagged hairs when trimming the goatee. Good power and nice feel in the hand.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT.....GREAT PRICE !!!!!!</li>
            <li> Trimmer is awesome. Needed another portable trimmer as the last one I had was AA battery operated and I was tired of replacing the batteries every month. Charge this bad boy up and it works great. Nice product.</li>
            <li> The shaver does a good job but dosent stay charged long enough for me to finish. Even plugged in it goes dead. I&#x27;ve tried a different cord also. I contacted Wahl and they weren&#x27;t interested. Said if I really wanted I could mail it in and they could look at it.</li>
            <li> I play Santa and have a long beard. I was never able to find a barber that could shape it the way I wanted it. This did a GREAT job. All I need now is a little more experience.</li>
            <li> This is the first trimmer I have owned, and still my favorite.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t do the job - I&#x27;ve gone back to my razor and scissors.</li>
            <li> I like how handy this product is! The grip is perfect! It&#x27;s very practical, easy to use and most importantly it serves its purpose.</li>
            <li> Works great with thick facial hair.  I have had it for a couple weeks now and is still on its first charge.  Best trimmer i have ever owned.</li>
            <li> This is a great affordable trimmer. Affordability does come with its caveats though:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. About 2 weeks after I received this trimmer it mysteriously stopped turning on. Even plugging it in directly to the charger did not help in just getting it on. After some messing around and shaking it out of frustration I was able to get it working again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The blade gets quite rusty very quickly. I know you&#x27;re not supposed to wash it in water but occasionally you have to and the blade was rusty literally within the first 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that the trimmer is very good.  Can&#x27;t really ask for much more at this price.</li>
            <li> My previous one lasted for several years. The only real major flaw with this is the non-replaceable battery - you basically have to destroy the device to access the battery and that it does not power directly from the wall. If the battery dies you cannot power this straight from AC - It must be able to put some charge into the battery for it to operate.</li>
            <li> I love these clippers. I suffer from razor bumps when I use a razor so I have to use clippers. While this isn&#x27;t a completely skin smooth shave it gets close enough without causing irritation and razor bumps.</li>
            <li> Hand done the best beard, chest and back I have ever used and I have tried a ton. Just Buy it.</li>
            <li> Got this for my hubby for a present and he loves it! It&#x27;s easy to use and the caddy is handy and keeps all the accessories organized!</li>
            <li> Its been a few months since I recharged it.Still using once a week.The trimmer is good.Others are just okay ( shaver )</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for about 6 weeks.  At first, it worked really well and I was very pleased with the purchase.  Though it took some getting used to (having to change the guards) over my older one which had a single adjustable guard, I grew accustomed to having the security of knowing that it wasn&#x27;t going to slip from a number 6 to a 2 and leave me looking like high school sophomore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My satisfaction, though, has been short lived.  A mere six weeks later the product does not turn on.  It&#x27;s really rather unfortunate that, given the price and infrequency of my use of it, it has already stopped functioning.  As it is, I would not recommend this product; if, however, this issue (the death of the product) were addressed in future models, it would be a great trimmer.</li>
            <li> This is an easy-to-use small but powerful trimmer. It trims very close.&lt;br /&gt;Only downside is that clipper to shaver head exchange requires disassembly.</li>
            <li> I am using this trimmer for the last 1 month and feels really good. I Brought the same for my brother and father. Really goo done</li>
            <li> It blows away any competitors with which I have been familiar.  The Lithium Ion battery system charges remarkably quickly, without the &amp;#34;memory&amp;#34; issues inherent with other battery powered trimmers.  Charge is held for a long time without the necessity to recharge, and battery life in use has always been sufficient for my uses.  Attachments are sufficient for most any user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best.  Highly recommended.  Don&#x27;t waste your time with inferior units.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a month and am ready to write a review.  I love the battery life and the accessories.  A nice carrying case instead of a cheap plastic tray would be nice!  All of the options provide a highly functional tool with the ability to trim any beard out there.  For the price, it&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> Li-Ion devices generally boast great power capacities and this trimmer is no exception.  I&#x27;ve used it three or four times a week for about eight months and it ran at full-power every time, right up to when the battery drain protection circuitry kicked in and shut it down, indicating that it was time for a recharge.  60 minutes on the charger and its ready to go for another eight months.  My only gripe about the device is that the handle is wrapped in some rubber-like material that collects hairs like a magnet.  It&#x27;s not a big deal to wipe it down with a damp cloth, but I would prefer to be able to just brush it off without a fight.</li>
            <li> Everything it was claimed to be!!</li>
            <li> I bought this to use about once a week to shave my head and keep my goatee trimmed. It&#x27;s underpowered (requires many, many passes), required disassembly to clean and oil the blades EVERY use, and the rubberized exterior is a hair magnet making it a serous pain to keep clean. I hated it and am looking forward to finding something better, even if that means paying substantially more.</li>
            <li> This trimmer lasted 1 month and 3 uses. Trimmed fine while it ran but now completely dead. Battery, charger or motor went bad. Because there is no light on unit or charger you can&#x27;t easily determine which part is malfunctioning.</li>
            <li> Read a bunch of good reviews for this items. So i purchased it as I shave my own head, have a beard i trim and have nose hair. The head trimmer lasted all of 1 trimming before it decided to stop cutting. Then I started using the smaller attachment for my head and beard and that too stopped cutting my hair AND it rusted somehow. I stored it in a dry enviroment not in the bathroom. If this item had kept trimming the way it did the first time I used it then I would be giving it rave reviews. Instead it fell completly flat in my book. It is now in the trash and I have a new hair trimmer on the way to me.... I will no longer purchase this type of trimmer nor will i waste my money on cordless.</li>
            <li> The battery in this thing is awesome, everything else pretty much sucks. Unless you have that plastic tray hot glued to something, it&#x27;s going to go scattering the moment you try to place something in it and the amount of attachments are stupefying.  The guides are much harder to use than the single adjustable guide I had on my last trimmer that I only needed to keep track of two total attachments on.</li>
            <li> Got this in plenty of time for Father&#x27;s Day and my husband is very pleased with how the way it works!!!</li>
            <li> Came in a very timely manner, works great I use it every other day. The different attachments make it a breeze to use and save me money on barber costs.</li>
            <li> I have owned several wahl trimmers and I am always satisfied with the performance and durability of their products. Unfortunately this one seems to been either defective, designed with a serious flaw, or built poorly. Either way, it only lasted 2 months before dying. And of course it broke after the return period, so now I can either pay money to return a defective product or just buy a different trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;I did like the performance of the trimmer while it worked. Very powerful, long lasting charge, the multitude of interchangeable heads is quite nice and the whole trimmer feels sturdy and well built. Well it seems that way, but after about 7 weeks of normal use, light trimming and the occasional shave, never in the shower or exposed to water, it stopped working. Just wont come on at all. Hopefully this is an isolated event and other customers have a better built trimmer.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he only used it 5 times before it stopped working. I am going to try again with another and see how it goes. Before it stopped working, he said this was the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever bought him. Had it not been for that I would just scrap the idea of getting another. Once we get the replacement I will update my rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Second trimmer has been much better. We will see how long this one lasts. My husband does love it. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Replacing my 2 star rating with a 4.</li>
            <li> Lightweight, easy to use, battery strong enough to allow periodic use when traveling without constant charging.  The stand is nice lots of adapters</li>
            <li> I bought this unit for my husband for mostly beard and neck trimming. He has coarse beard hair and wears a beard or a goatee most of the time. This trimmer does a great job of getting all the hair. Previous clippers we have purchased when they got more dull would bend the hair, this does not do this. It doesn&#x27;t pull the hair even after it gets hot. Requires fewer passes to finish the trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Best part is the battery. We used this trimmer for six months before we ever even charged it. Charging it only takes a few hours and you are good to go for several weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attachments are great too. I like the way the tip are installed. Have had problems wit othe trimmers due to the attachment piece breaking making attachments wobbly and unusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an aside I have a cocker spaniel I groom and was having difficulty trimming around his feet and used this, worked so well I kept it for detail dog grooming and bought my husband a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> As with many lithium ion batteries, the one in this shaver works for about two years and then will no longer hold a charge.  When you open it up the battery is a 3.7v 750mah AA size, but it is soldered directly to the circuit board. It has a 5 year warranty so I would suggest returning it once the battery is dead.</li>
            <li> I only had this product for 3 weeks and it completely stopped. I have charged it and cleaned it regularly but it won&#x27;t turn on at all. I will be returning it for a refund.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect little trimmer. It is cordless and has many attachments. It is very easy to use. The price is right for what you get.</li>
            <li> We liked our purchase and would recommend this to the next guy. The little tray to hold everything is a joke. You just pick a drawer a chuck everything in there and pitch the tray in the trash.</li>
            <li> they give you a tiny tray that doesn&#x27;t actually hold all the attachments, everytime you move it , it all falls off</li>
            <li> I meant to write this review ages ago. My husband uses these trimmers all the time,and is very happy with them! We find them to be pretty quiet,and do the job with ease. Came on time too,in fact sooner I think</li>
            <li> Excellent battery life, with a very quick charge time. My only complaint is the clip-on guards are a little flimsy. All in all, I love mine.</li>
            <li> This Wahl trimmer is small, lightweight, charges quickly, and does it&#x27;s job well. It has lots of different attachments, more than most people would ever need or use but if you like choices, then this one is most certainly the winner! We are also given a stand with the trimmer, which honestly is too small to be useful but it is a thoughtful addition. My husband loved the ear trimmer and the shaver attachment which gave him a good close shave. He also uses this for those in-between haircut trimmings at the back of his neck and says he loves it! I took away one star for not having a charging indicator which isn&#x27;t really needed, but the lack of it is very annoying since it is expected in such gadgets. Overall, we loved this little trimmer and would certainly recommend it at this price.</li>
            <li> The Wahl Lithium Ion All In One Grooming Kit is a great product with adequate instructions. As a result, once I called the company and figured out how to use everything that came with the product I was very happy.    I like this product because it comes with four easily changeable \\&quot;blades\\&quot; that can be attached to the base. The blades include a trim blade to use on beards and mustaches, a precision detailer to use on nose and ear hair as well as eyebrows, a dual shaver to use on faces if they do not have a beard and finally a clipper blade to use on the hair on one&#x27;s head. All of the the blades work well. I also read in the instructions any of these blades can be used on other parts of one&#x27;s body that are shaved or need to be shaved.        This product also comes with seven guide combs that easily attach to the trimmer and can be used to help with grooming. Also included is a brush for cleaning the blades, a small comb, and some blade oil. All of these fit nicely into a stand.    Finally, this product comes with a lithium ion rechargeable battery that charges in a shorter amount of time in comparison to regular batteries and keeps a charge longer as well. It also comes with a 5 year limited warranty.     I am impressed with the number of uses for the grooming kit and like the idea of a lithium ion battery. Once charged up it does hold its charge well and is easy to recharge.     All of the blades work well but I am still trying to figure out how the guide combs work. The reason I am still figuring out about the guide combs is because of the instructions.     The instructions are on one piece of paper. The paper is folded in half and then has seven folds. In effect you have 14 squares that are 2 inches by 4 inches. The top half of the instructions tell about the warranty, things to do to keep safe, how to charge the battery and how to care for the trimmer. Since the instructions are the same for three different models one panel lists the other two models.    The lastseven panels talk about the product. The type is smaller that that used on the safety instructions on the top panel and I found it a chore to read.    One problem is since these instructions are for three models I could not figure out why my trimmer did not have a rotating head like it said in the instructions until I realized that the instructions were referencing a different model.       There are some drawings that are somewhat helpful but they are small. I used the back of the box to figure out how some things work. I also called the company to figure out a couple of things.  Had the instructions used larger type and diagrams like the back of the box I would have had an easier time understanding how everything worked.      While the instructions are a bit of a problem they can&#x27;t take away from how well this product works. The grooming kit is truly all in one and has many uses. I like the lithium ion battery. Ultimately, I am extremely pleased with the grooming kit and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Sleek, compact, sturdy trimmer.  I really like how it handles, great percision.  Great accessories, works well.  light weight.  Great quality.</li>
            <li> I like that it is very durable, easy to clean, and has many different trimmers to choose from. Also, the battery lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> Well, I only used it once.  It worked well and I like it. It has lots of attachments. Best of all -  it was made in the USA.</li>
            <li> worked great the first time. Second time to use it, spring came out of clipper head and will not work now. Very dissapointed in product. For the price this costs, you expect it to last a while.</li>
            <li> Had another trimmer (different brand completely) that crapped out on me. A friend recommended this to me, and I&#x27;ve been very impressed after a few weeks. Lots of adjustable features, and well built. Hoping it will last a few years or more :)</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband. He loves it. He uses this at least 3-4 times a day. The trimming action is great and he seems very please with the gift.</li>
            <li> First of all, I did not get to even use the product itself because I did not receive the black base as pictured with the item.&lt;br /&gt;I usually do not give bad reviews, as you are more than welcome to see through the thousands I have spent thought Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I, however, both listed a return and called the help line to see what I could do to simply receive my base. After a 45 minute phone call and specifically telling the operator I was going to both cancel not only my service but my future prime membership (and even mentioned I was going to write a bad review along with other other in adequate product I received) she simply responded with, &amp;#34;Okay, sir. Have a good night.&amp;#34; and told me I could send it back. And hung up on me. Unless I get proper feedback, goodbye Amazon.</li>
            <li> Everything I hoped it would be.  It has a very long life battery.  I use it to keep my beard close shaven.</li>
            <li> Good time arrive, its a litter dificult to know how to change the heads but when u know its easy, looks like the baterry its the better!, but i dont know a bout the shaver, doesnt matter that has 3 shavers in one head, couse i dont see diferences if is one, i think you can find a shaver that  feel like its take that little hair at all!, and put it to that beuty ;)</li>
            <li> My son had, repeat, had a somewhat overgrown and mildly unkempt beard/mustache. The Wahl was a birthday present and he took to it with an enthusiasm. He received compliments from several of his students and he finds a peace in the process of trimming. He looks very presentable and professional and he enjoys that. I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> Where do I begin.  The heads are almost impossible to interchange because the manufacturer did not bother to produce any instructions.  One of the heads fell apart while trying to attach.  Spent all day trying to put it back together again (again, thanks to not documentation).  Since I had already thrown away the packaging and packing slip, there was no chance of returning.  I threw the entire thing in the trash.  I&#x27;m done with Wahl.  Find another trimmer.  Something the manufacture can document.</li>
            <li> Worth the buy for a variety of things, and still going strong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this for about a month but have used it several times and it works flawlessly.  Very happy with my purchase and would purchase it again if I had to do it over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do agree with some of the other reviewers that mention the plastic holder that everything sits in does not do a great job of keeping everything in place and the handle on the shaver does collect hair but neither of these issues are a big problem for me because I do not keep my unit out on the bathroom sink.  I keep it stowed away and just get it out when I need to use it.</li>
            <li> My husband got it and the battery will not hold a charge at all. It heats up fast and it lasts my husband a second and battery dies  My husband wanted to send it back a week later but we don&#x27;t have the box  I would not recommend this product at all  we wasted our money</li>
            <li> Never again.  Does not hold a charge.  Some of the heads are difficult to replace and the adjustable head slips to a closer setting  while you are trimming your beard.  Oh well.</li>
            <li> Almost every shaver out there is waterproof, except this one. Despite this huge shortcoming, WAHL never mentions it in the instructions or elsewhere that it&#x27;s not waterproof. They just give you a cheap $0.05 brush that fell apart after 5 uses -- to clean the blades. A tiny bottle of baby oil (it seems) is also included to oil the blades after every use (but instructions said not to over oil, because the oil will seep into the motor and cause damage).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I did as instructed... I never washed it. I was inconvenienced and couldn&#x27;t use it in the shower, but this was my first WAHL and I went with it, to give it chance. I oiled the blades every night. I cleaned them off after every use. Less than a month of use later, the main blade started rusting (despite never being washed). It got dull very quickly after the first week. You have to keep in mind that I do not have a thick beard at all. I maintain a very short goatee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The build quality of this is extremely cheap. It felt like a $5.00 shaver with chrome on it. The seam where the metal and rubber are joined had a fairly large &amp; uneven gap and some glue was dried, seemingly having oozed out of the gap onto the rubber grip and dried on it&#x27;s way here from China. The charger plug would wiggle back and forth when inserted into the shaver. There is no light or indicator anywhere letting the user know whether the shaver is charging or not, you just have to guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades have large gaps in the sides so all your hair &amp;#34;conveniently&amp;#34; gathers inside the motor cavity and the intricate parts that move the blades, and the provided brush is too poorly designed to clean that out, so be prepared to vacuum it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver would lose charge after being left out for 5 days or so.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, a whopping 60 days after I purchased this shaver, it stopped working. Dead. Zero. Charging it all night did not yield even 2 seconds of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first and last WAHL and Ihighly recommend that you DO NOT purchase this.&lt;br /&gt;It says &amp;#34;Made in USA&amp;#34; on the box but the shaver itself was made in China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just hope I can still get my money back, otherwise I don&#x27;t mind throwing $35 in the trash.</li>
            <li> I have used this same model of shaver for over 8 years.  it lasts upwards of 3 years a piece! that&#x27;s great for a cordless shaver.</li>
            <li> As a male with a penchant for facial hair configurations that require constant upkeep, I have experienced my fair share of trimmers in this variety. I bought this with the intention of having a great quality trimmer for years to come. So far I have had this a month and have used all the attachments and blade guards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the Lithium Ion battery life to be spectacular thus far. The trimmer has only been charged one time but I have used it every other day since getting it. The attachments which were provided are all swapped out by removing the entire blade and snapping the other attachment firmly into place. The swap seems well-controlled, the pieces fit tight without anything feeling cheap or flimsy. The attachments themselves are all effective and high quality. They provide a great change for each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this based on features, not on price, and still cannot believe the quality for the price! Came with so many pieces and has such a great, ergonomic style and battery life that I rate this a solid 5 from Wahl.</li>
            <li> I have had many beard trimmers and this is the first one that easily gets through an entire trimming without slowing down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like most of the attachments but there just aren&#x27;t enough of them for guys who want a fuller beard. The attachments are all just too small for me and force me to trim way too close for my taste. I do like the fact that it comes with 2 different widths of trimming heads as well as a shaving head (which is pretty much worthless).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the cons of the attachments, this is a very good trimmer and worthy of all 4 stars I give it.</li>
            <li> The battery life on this is amazing. I bought this 6 full months ago, fully charged it once, and only just recharged it for the first time last week. Granted, I only use it once or twice a week for 10 minutes, but none of the rechargeable clippers I&#x27;ve owned in the past even would have held a charge that long WITHOUT being used. As far as clipping goes, it does great and works very well for my needs. Has more accessories than you need (better than too few) and feels really nice and solid in the hand--not cheap--and the rubber grip is great. I assume this will die at some point down the road (they all do) but I&#x27;m going to order a second one in preparation for that day just in case they stop making this model. I&#x27;ve finally found the perfect beard trimmer (for me). There&#x27;s really nothing I would change about it.</li>
            <li> Used weekly for beard and other nuisance hair trimming. I&#x27;ve tried the electric shaver attachment and would use it for a trip instead of packing a razor and cream. The battery is so long lasting that I&#x27;ve yet to have to recharge it!</li>
            <li> I recently bought this as I felt I should have something of quality to start trimming my beard with rather than a $20 Norelco. Turns out, this doesn&#x27;t compare at all. The combs/guides for trimming my beard do a horrible job at directing my facial hair to the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I will say I am highly disappointed with this product, and will be returning it from where I bought it. The only good thing I have to say about it is the blades are sharp, and as long as you don&#x27;t want to use the adjustable trimmer, you should be able to suffer through it.</li>
            <li> The price for the kit was very reasonable and the delivery was fast.  The compnents show high quality and work quite well, especially for trimming beards and sideburns.</li>
            <li> I shave my head about every two days and also use this guy on general facial maintenance every day. I charge the battery every third or fourth day of use. The accessories are easy to change out and provide all the options I need. The product works great! What else do you need to know?</li>
            <li> great product at good price</li>
            <li> Works great and good price.</li>
            <li> The battery does not hold a charge even over night. I think I got a defective one and will return. When it does work it is a good device...</li>
            <li> Its ok but power seems to wear down fast. Will probably replace soon.</li>
            <li> My husband will love it for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Pieces rust easy. Cuts a bit easy. Had nice selection of pieces, charged quickly.</li>
            <li> works good yet had it for over a year with no problems</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;new\\&quot; trimmer is so much better than the Wahl it replaced! The blades move faster, are smaller and cut much better. The look of my beard after a brief cut so impressed my wife that she said I should have bought it a long time ago!</li>
            <li> Good cut, good power, easy to operate and so far battery power has been very good. I&#x27;ve owned it for about a month and shave with it every three days</li>
            <li> This really has a long lasting battery between charging and does a very good job in the power capacity to trim my beard.I sorta wish I would of opted for the extra trimming parts (ears and nose) but I don&#x27;t think it was available at the time.</li>
            <li> Purchased as gift for my son who reported that it is NICE.  Easy to use, fine trimming, power to do the job.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> My only intention for getting this product was to go for the stubble look. The 6-Position guide on the 1st position gives a good result. But the guide does not have rounded edges and therefore by the time you complete the shave, you are left with very irritated skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result from the beard guide comb:stubble was a bit too long for me. It gives like a day 4 stubble, where as i prefer it to be a bit more short. However, for those who want a slightly longer and prominent stubble this maybe the product for you. I recommend moving the shaver in the opposite direction of the hair growth for a better stubble look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest issue with this product is that there is no charging indicator. When the product is plugged in there is no way to figure out of it&#x27;s being charged or not. I kept it plugged into a faulty socket without realizing, and found out that the product had completely drained itself. How difficult is it to put in some LED bulb to indicate when charging?</li>
            <li> I have had a beard for about 32 years and have used many types of trimmers and the Wahl Lithium Ion All In One is the best trimmer I have ever used.  I purchased this trimmer in Feburary 2012 and thought I would wait until I used this trimmer for awhile before writing a review.  The trimmer is easy to use, has a powerful motor, does a good job, and the heads are easy to change. So far I have had no problem with the battery, it holds a charge for a long time, I only charged it once a month and I use it 2-3 times a week. Some reviews complain about hair sticking to the rubber grips but using a damp washcloth on them solves this problem. The only complaint I have is the cheap looking accessory holder.  It does not hold all of the accessories very well.</li>
            <li> I wanted a shaver to keep the back of my neck trimmed.  The shaver blade was very uncomfortable on the back of my neck.</li>
            <li> I bought the same set about 4 years ago and it is still working fine, I ordered this one in case my old one gives up, but I think I will never need it!</li>
            <li> Not that great, they say all USA but almost all of the stuff made in China. Not worth for $ 39. Its good if cost $ 20 bcoz @39 you will find better one .</li>
            <li> I like it.  I only use 2 of the attachments and both work fine.  I really like the long battery life.</li>
            <li> I got one last night and tried it out. However,like the previous reviewer said, the cut hairs stick to the rubber on the outside the shaver like glue, and spent about 15 minutes trying to clean them off.  Too much work!  Also I agree that there is too many accessories as well.  I will take this back for a different model.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer and accessories. I do my side burns, mustache and goatee. I &amp;#34;almost&amp;#34; dont need my electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;The charge lasts me more than 1 week. The accessories snap on sollidly and each one works well.</li>
            <li> Great price that met the needs.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before I bought this &amp; still had a little skepticism about it but I was completely wrong. It&#x27;s very easy to use and I love the convenience of being able to shave in less than 5 minutes instead of having to plug in my bulky old clippers. I haven&#x27;t had a chance to try out the attachments yet but then again I don&#x27;t have much of a need for them anyway. Overall 5/5 for sure!</li>
            <li> Very solid value, but certainly more for light/medium tasks. If you need to buzz clip heads regularly then get something more heavy duty. But for trimming hair it works great.</li>
            <li> I got this shaver after dealing with the frustration of a cheaper, Norelco shaver. The difference in price is more than made up for in convenience and quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main complaint about every other electric beard trimmer I&#x27;ve owned is battery life. The last one I had needed to charge for TEN HOURS to be used for 30 minutes! Inevitably, those shavers would sputter and die mid-shave at the worst possible times. I decided to upgrade to this highly-recommended shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a difference the lithium-ion battery makes! Not only is the shaver visibly more powerful than the others I&#x27;ve used, but this charges in a fraction of the time it took for the others, and the charge lasts absurdly long. To make matters even BETTER, if you DO hit the end of your battery, charging this thing for ONE MINUTE gives you five minutes of trim time (enough to do a quick shave in a pinch).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels good in your hand -- not too heavy and not too light -- and comes with a huge assortment of attachments. I would avoid using the blades they have for getting a close shave, as well as the nose-hair trimmer if you have other tools for that, but even those are really not bad. The classic and T-blades are just great, though. They also give you blade guards so you can cut at different lengths. Their 1/8 guard leaves just the right amount of stubble. This tool is also great at cleaning up my neck area as I grow a beard, easily defining lines and trimming well, without upsetting my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only real downsides to this shaver are that it isn&#x27;t waterproof (so no rinsing it off in the sink) and that the process to change blades is a little bit awkward. Still, these small concerns pale in comparison to the unit&#x27;s virtues. It is certainly worth the money for this great tool.</li>
            <li> This works perfectly well to trim anything that needs trimming, but you can&#x27;t plug it in and use it cold. If you don&#x27;t plan on keeping it plugged in an charging all the time, plan to plug it in at least a few minutes before you need it to give the battery a head start.</li>
            <li> Garbage...don&#x27;t waste your money....worked for 2 months</li>
            <li> Exactly what my hairy husband wanted!</li>
            <li> It just stopped working after 6 mos.  I kept it lubricated and clean.  I just picked it up and no power.  I tried another outlet thinking maybe a faulty out let but that didn&#x27;t work either.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair cutting trimmer we have ever had.  My husband says I give him the best haircuts he has ever gotten when I use this.  It has several widths of trimmers and the smallest is great for over the ears.</li>
            <li> Started having difficulty with the switch within the first month or so.. it now will not work at all..  have had it less than 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;will never own another wahl product.&lt;br /&gt;michael a.</li>
            <li> It has a more powerful motor than the old trimmers and the Li - On batteries stay charged a lot longer.</li>
            <li> Works great but will have to deal with the loud noise&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Long lasting battery. Charges quickly&lt;br /&gt;Does the job well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Loud sound and vibration&lt;br /&gt;Blades are hard to install</li>
            <li> Purchased two of the Wahl Lithium Ion All In One Trimmers (9854-600) as gifts…Recipients were pleased with the trimmers, overall quality, all of the attachments, and the battery life. If you are looking for a quality trimmer from a quality company…The Wahl Lithium Ion All In One Trimmer is your best bet.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this in December 2013, but it cannot hold a charge more than about 10-15 seconds by September 2014. Researching in the web turned up ine era Le complaints of this exact problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other. It&#x27;d is that he bought this and it came with a plastic stand, not the carrying/storage bag, but otherwise, it appears to be identical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whilst Wahl does offer a five year warrantee, they do not issue RMAs, so if you send it to them, and they lose it, tough, and also, when we  called, we were told that the turn around time is about two to three weeks. Finally, and this is the nail in the coffin, though they have a long warrantee, they put the cost of return shipping on you, and the fact is, the quality of this product is so bad that it is just not worth the trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product quality itself, there are several problems with this trimmer. Firstly, switch is sticky and difficult to turn on an off, the rubberised coating attracts any and all dirt and trimmed whiskers. The plastic blade guards are VERY flimsy, and the method for attaching the blades is really weird, so EVERYTIME he  tries to hange them, he seems to have to fiddle with them for a minute to get them on. Other shavers and trimmers from other brands are simple pop-on, pop-off design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We used to think Wahl made the best quality clippers and trimmers, and maybe with their professional line products that may be the case, but for the consumer products, we feel they are just junk, and will try a different brand, and stick to a corded model. It just shouldn&#x27;t be this much trouble for something so ridiculously simple as a trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Incidentally, my husband only uses this for beard trimming. He uses the trimmer on his 6 year old Braun rechargeable electric shaver for his sideburns, and it still runs perfectly after all these years, though some of the paint did flake off near the head.</li>
            <li> I wanted to use this in order to clean up about 10-12 days of beard growth. The awkward stage between stubble and true beardiness. It did a mediocre job with the stubble guard that snaps over the head. The trimmer itself works well, but be warned that it will RUST if you leave it wet. I&#x27;m used to wet/dry shaving accouterments, so kind of a head slap moment. Just wanted to give you guys a heads up.</li>
            <li> Battery died within about 2 months.</li>
            <li> Purchased these in 2011 for $30. Since then, I cut my hair every 2 weeks and have taken on 3 deployments and still works perfect. would highly recommend these clippers</li>
            <li> Very good and reliable product.  I have used this brand for a long time.</li>
            <li> This is the best male grooming set that I have ever owned. It exceeds  by far my expectations!</li>
            <li> I bought this since my old buzzer kicked the bucket.  I liked that it had a ton of attachments which is always good.  I use it primarily as a beard trimmer and body hair trimmer.  But since it came with the bigger cutting head, i tried it out on buzzing my head and it worked amazingly.  This is now my full body hair removal tool.  Also I love how it has the shaving head too.  I use it on my neck and it gets nice a smooth.  Overall great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for 4 stars and not 5 is that the body of the buzzer has a rubber coating on it which is great for the hand to keep a hold of it, but all the hair that you cut gets stuck all over the body of the trimmer.  Not a huge turn-off, but you do need to use a wet paper towel or something to get the hair off.</li>
            <li> I had a norelco trimmer before this.  I was hesitant to try the Wahl, but now I love it.  It is much lighter than the norelco and is very powerful.  But the big reason I got it was the litium ion battery.  Only time will tell if this lasts longer than my old norelco.  But so far I am much happier than expected.</li>
            <li> This is by far the worst trimmer I have ever used. When I try to trim off stubble it cuts my skin and pulls the hairs no matter how slowly and deliberately I use it.&lt;br /&gt;Its attachments are on the cheaper side for sure but I cant stand the abuse lone enough to review this product in anymore depth.&lt;br /&gt;I will probably never buy Wahl products again at this point.</li>
            <li> Junk .. get a AC Powered unit instead</li>
            <li> After purchasing 3 electric personal groomers made specifically for women and then having them all fail miserably, I decided to purchase something advertised specifically for men. In reference to the woman&#x27;s personal groomers, the batteries never lasted long, the clippers would always dull out and there were never enough accessories. This personal groomer, however, has everything and plus some! I&#x27;ve only had to charge it once and the battery has lasted for a few months, and that&#x27;s while using it every other day. Nice size for your hand and it comes with a convenient carrying case to carry everything with it, even the charging plug.</li>
            <li> Not much to really say about a utility piece like this. It charges very quickly, holds a charge well, and it pretty powerful. At least I think so. The shaving attachment though really chewed me up. I use regular blades and this was my first time using electric so it probably was me being dumb. As for trimming, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. It has different attachments for lengths which is nice. I would recommend this for basic trimming.</li>
            <li> Well not bad. Just don&#x27;t get it wet as they don&#x27;t like water.</li>
            <li> I first bought this last 2010 and now it has died on me, but it lasted 5 years! You don&#x27;t have to charge it as much and it does the job quite well.</li>
            <li> I owned an earlier Wahl for years with excellent results, so therefore bought this Wahl replacement.  A big disappointment compared to my earlier model.  Feels cheaply made in comparison, and my older model even now does a better trimming job.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband and he said it&#x27;s great does has all the attachments to do any grooming you need! Great price and Great quality!!!</li>
            <li> its great! dont get any other one. ive used this about 3 or 4 times (which doesnt seem like alot) and the battery is still going strong. the last one i had, i had to charge everytime i wanted to use it. this stays charged while not in use and charges real fast.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this razor. Bought our son in law one too. He really likes his too. Great deal, thanks</li>
            <li> This product work great  battery last for week on single charge  time saver</li>
            <li> Makes awful noises after the first use. Requires frequent cleaning which means you need a screwdriver to take it apart. Both blades rusted within 2 months. Oh and everything falls out of the cheap plastic stand anytime you bump it let alone trying to feed the power cable underneath it.</li>
            <li> Product is great,  Wish it came with charging base to store all the pieces,</li>
            <li> This trimmer is the best I have owned. More than enough power to manscape. Not the prettiest thing in the world, and the stand is useless, but the item is a real powerhouse.</li>
            <li> Pretty god trimmer very useful . Works better then my old one. I like it very much. And it runs longer on a charge.</li>
            <li> My husband seems to love his trimmer and says the quality is great</li>
            <li> I purchased the Wahl Lithium Ion trimmer because my old trimmer I had used for years was a Wahl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the box I discovered that the primary Trimmer head did not have a spring loaded vibrating mechanism like the other heads that would make that trimmer work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, that was a problem, but there was a larger T-Blade head that had all its parts and worked. The T-Blade head did not have an attachment with the 6 position trimming guide (like the primary Trimmer head) which would allow a variety of beard lengths. But, I only wanted a short stubble so the single short guide for the T-Blade was enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the trimmer once and it worked pretty well. It provided a good result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next time I tried to use it, it was dead, though I had it plugged in for several days and was, hopefully, charging it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I misplaced my receipt and am now needing to purchase another trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you purchase this product make sure you keep your receipt so you can replace it.</li>
            <li> This all in one trimmer comes as advertised and is the one-stop shaver i use to keep all my facial hair trimmed. I have had no issues with this trimmer and it it is easy to maintain and attach the various heads to the main device. The only complaint i do have is that i like a very close shave and the shave attachment does not give as great a shave compared to an old fashioned razor. However if you simply like your beard short and neatly trimmed this shaver does it for you with ease and let&#x27;s you mark up your facial hair.</li>
            <li> The hair trimmer kit from Wahl is an excellent choice in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;The main unit is light weight and designed to be very flexible, although it does not feel cheaply made. Also, I feel that it is nice to see that there is still something made in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;The Lithium battery has an option for charging it just a few minutes, which forces just enough energy into it, to be able to do a quick trim.&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed with all the optional items that can be attached.&lt;br /&gt;The storage case is cheesy and cheap, I am glad it is only the storage tray.&lt;br /&gt;At first I was scratching my head a few times before I was brave enough to remove the default cutting attachment.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t want to break it and the pictorial instructions didn&#x27;t make me too confident. But after a few times, it is actually quite easy.&lt;br /&gt;I suppose, I am tending to make things more complicated as they really are.&lt;br /&gt;Within the several attachments, one can choose one that is appropriate for the length of hair that needs to be cut. In my case I find it as easy as combing my hair, whats left of it.&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with the purchase and already amortized the cost of the device that I would have otherwise spent at the barber shop.</li>
            <li> Powerful, lots of trimming options, holds a charge forever. One minor downside...beard trimmings seem to stick to handle. Buy it anyway!</li>
            <li> Got this trimmer about 2 weeks ago, been using it about every other day so far. I needed a new trimmer after my old Wahl crapped out on me, and so far, I really like this trimmer. This definitely seems more powerful than my previous Wahl, allowing me to get an even trim on one pass over any given area. Despite the extra power, I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s any louder, nor does it create any more uncomfortable vibration while shaving. It&#x27;s also quite a bit lighter than my previous trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it comes with attachments for cutting the hair on top of your head, I can&#x27;t imagine this would really be strong enough for that job. I&#x27;m sure it could work...but I wouldn&#x27;t want to let someone use it on my head. This is a beard trimmer. Those attachments are just there to boost the \\&quot;usability value\\&quot; of this product, not for actual use in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite what I read from another reviewer, I think the deatailer / nose hair attachment works quite well. It&#x27;s narrow enough to get in your nose and snip those pesky hairs, so what more do you want from it? Switching between attachments is a breeze, so I&#x27;m not sure why some people find issue with that either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foil shaver is great. I&#x27;ve always preferred a rotating head style for electric shavers, as foil shavers tend to pull hair out of your face rather than cut it. Maybe it&#x27;s the power from the motor, but this foil shaver does a great job. I don&#x27;t feel the tugging I&#x27;m used to from other foil shavers and I think it actually gives me a closer shave than my dedicated Norelco electric shaver (not trimmer like this). Still quicker to use the Norelco, but I really do think this foil shaver gets a little closer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;ve ran this out of power once, but it was intentional. I wanted to check the quick charge function. Sure enough, after only a minute of charging (after it was dead), I was able to run it for between 3-4 minutes. That is a great feature for those days where the battery dies onyou before work and you don&#x27;t have the time to wait around for it to recharge so you can finish the job. After running it down from the quick charge, I charged it for an hour, since that&#x27;s supposedly a full charge. Well, I&#x27;ve been using it every other day for a week and a half since and it hasn&#x27;t died yet. So, I&#x27;m pretty pleased with the overall battery life. But, this brings me to my first issue. It has no light or anything to tell you when it&#x27;s fully charged. All I ask for is a little LED or something that lights up or blinks when charged. But, no such luck with this trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My other relatively minor issue is the tray for the attachments. I have no idea how they fit everything in the tray. I don&#x27;t even have the haircut attachments in there, since I&#x27;m not ever using those, and I still can&#x27;t fit everything in it nicely. It&#x27;s just a small, cheap, plastic tray that doesn&#x27;t serve much purchase. I appreciate the small size considering I keep this in the medicine cabinet, but still...if I can&#x27;t really fit the pieces in it, what good is it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: If you want a lightweight, powerful beard trimmer that won&#x27;t leave you hanging with half a beard in the morning, this product from Wahl is an awesome buy. If you&#x27;re looking to use this north of your ears and eyebrows, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Hands down, this trimmer is super sharp.  It does not seem to fail at all in the quality department.  I did a few tests on both the \\&quot;T-Trimmer\\&quot; included, and the regular one, and both did superbly.  I will, however, remind people that you have to use the included oil before using these blades.  If you do not, you will not get much accomplished in terms of cutting your hair.  It will still be sharp, but the blades will cut ten times better when you oil them up (While it&#x27;s actually on).  I am very impressed with this trimmer.  I actually was not expecting to be so satisfied.  I had looked all throughout the Amazon.com store, and was not satisfied with reviews of other products.  If it wasn&#x27;t overpriced, it was too cheap, and many of the reviews reflected that, but this appears to be the exception so far.  I am satisfied.  It has my mark.  I am a very critical person when it comes to buying products.  I am an avid Amazon.com customer (They have made a lot of money due to my loyalty to the site), so I like to investigate before buying.  I ask you all that you do the same.  Thanks, and enjoy your product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, it works right out of the box.  I didn&#x27;t have to charge it before testing it.</li>
            <li> This set is nice for the price and what you get, but the blade does not cut down close enough to your skin and does not leave your skin smooth (i.e., you get stubbles). It seems to &#x27;look&#x27; okay, but it feels stubbly. Other than that, it&#x27;s fine (but the point is to be smooth, too, right?)  :)</li>
            <li> I really loved this trimmer at first. I mainly just used it when my beard would come in thick or for the random body trimmings once in a while. I rarely used any of the other accessories that came with it but for the price it definitely did what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally don&#x27;t review products but I really felt that I should, especially as someone who has owned this product for over 6 months. It dies. After 3 months I started to notice that it needed a lot more time to charge up and that it could only hold a full charge for one shave. After 6 months it worked for seconds at a time. Also, you can&#x27;t just leave it plugged in and get away with it for two reasons. First and foremost, it still just doesn&#x27;t charge the battery long enough and the electricity isn&#x27;t a bypass. Two, the plug sucks and falls out if you try to leave it plugged in during use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So all-in-all. This thing is garbage... literally, as I just threw it out.</li>
            <li> May 2016: Bought the second one a few weeks ago!  The old one&#x27;s main trimming head was getting loud, something wearing out in only that medium trimmer head (plastic bushings?).  But 4.5 years is fair for the low price, used this trimmer head almost every day, the rest of the unit and attachments still work perfectly fine and the battery still works almost like new.  Even the screen shaver attachment is still working good, and I used that about half of every day for the past 4.5 years too.  The new package doesn&#x27;t include the molded upright stand, instead it just has a fabric zipper pouch (don&#x27;t care much).  NOTE: The battery charges in 1 hour!  Nov. 2011: I bought this bc my previous trimmers batteries went bad too quickly, and otherwise wore out. This new lithium-ion battery (the same type as in notebooks/netbooks/tablets, etc.) is MUCH better, lasts 3-10 times longer. I love how the accessories just snap on/off quickly. However it is not perfect:  CONS: Comb (plain mustache comb) is VERY scratchy - almost dangerously so! I had trouble with the adjustable length trimmer &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34; (not the comb above). It did not want to move, &amp;#34;adjust,&amp;#34; at all. So finally with much force it did suddenly with an alarming crack sound, and now it moves too easily. I inspected it but cannot find any broken area. It must be held in place carefully while I trim to prevent making my beard too short. Screen shaver is very tricky to open to empty the trimmings, and there is no instructions on how to do so. Hair trimmings stick to &#x27;sticky&#x27; rubber black handle area, under your grip. Switch is just a tad difficult to move at times. When changing accessories it is necessary to occasionally clean the hair shavings off of the driving areas, and they have grease on them - that&#x27;s what the little brush is for. For those who complain about too many accessories: Really? Just throw them away then! The price is right. The big base makes it very stable and unlikely to be knocked over.  Otherthan that, I love it, compared to multiple previous trimmers, mostly Wahl:  PROS: It is excellent at trimming beards and mustaches. Can use it corded if the battery runs down. Very nice screen-shaver (screen shavers only work with short stubble). Accessories change quickly and easily. New batteries are great and long-lasting, last for at least a dozen trims (&amp;#60;1yr old). New battery charger is very small and less of an eyesore.  EDIT 12/4/13: After 1.5 years of use, I still love this shaver. Everything (except the adjustable-length trimmer comb) still works great, and the battery charge still works over multiple beard trims W/quick-trims in-between, and I am now using the screen shaver for my fully-shaven areas too on these quick-trims. I have used the oil several times. So great long-life too.</li>
            <li> This shaver is the best thing I bought I replaces all of trimming equipment . With the changing heads I only need this shaver I would recommend this shaver</li>
            <li> It just stopped working.It doesn&#x27;t get much work so i am really confused why such a short life.</li>
            <li> I purchased a Wahl 9854-600 Lithium Ion All In One Trimmer a couple months ago based on recommendations, and the company&#x27;s reputation. I couldn&#x27;t believe it when every use included pulled hair; sometimes only slight tugs and other times outright hurtful pulls. I have been using the trimmer head with the adjustable guide set on 4, sometimes 3. The fixed guides are too short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept looking at it and using it trying to determine why I was having trouble with it. Initially, I thought the problem may be with the adjustable guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I now believe the cutters do not accommodate thick hair. It is more of a shaver than a trimmer. If there was a way to include a photo it would tell the story. I placed the cutter head along side the one off my aging MB200 on a scanner and it&#x27;s very apparent  there is a big difference in how wide the teeth are. I think this is a nice quality machine and will be appreciated by anyone with thinner beard hair than I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been meaning to get back to this for a while. I upped the rating to 4 because of the customer service. I did express my thoughts on the blade and did receive plenty of correspondence and a replacement blade to try. The new blade really did not help. I do stick to my initial observation; it is a quality machine and one of the few capable of trimming the mustache without folding your nose over or stretching your skin so the corner of your mouth touches your ear. But, I think  the blade teeth are too fine to accommodate thick hair. You won&#x27;t get better service, so you can&#x27;t go wrong trying this one.ference in how wide the teeth are. I think this is a nice quality machine and will be appreciated by anyone with thinner beard hair than I have.</li>
            <li> Great company to do business with I would us them again if prices remain low. This was after a long surcharge for best price. Great quality.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Battery last long time. Great value.</li>
            <li> Always loved this machine. My brother has one as well, and loves it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money- spend a little more and get something that will last.  It didn&#x27;t even last 6 months.</li>
            <li> I had a similar model for years and was very happy with it.  Unfortunately after so many years it slowlyfell apart as I would expect.  So, I will stick with the Wahl products.</li>
            <li> This machine is just a waste of money. I had a philips trimmer that worked much more better than this one. It doesn&#x27;t even trim your hair. You have to press the blades against your skin which is very frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;Buy it if you want to waste your money</li>
            <li> The trimmer works great and was exactly what it was advertised as. The charge lasts a long time and it is easy to clean. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the tray that holds it and all the attachments isn&#x27;t nearly big enough and looks cheap.</li>
            <li> Purchased this item for my husband to replace his Phillips shaver. My husband loves it. He has issues with razor burn on his neck and this seems to cause fewer issues than a razor or any other electric shaver he has used.</li>
            <li> I have used several types of trimmers over the past several years, and while most were adequate for a while, they come nowhere close to this product. The ease of use is excellent for me to trim beard, mustache and neck. The rubber coating helps in holding and handling the trimmer. Since I am in my seventies, it is important that I can grasp the handle without fear of it slipping in my hand. It also is easy to clean if you follow the instructions. The lithium-ion battery is also a plus feature. I have used it for almost a month and there is no significant change in the power. I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use all of the attachments, but feel they will perform as well as the adjustable trimmer head I use for trimming my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would certainly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Used it several times and haven&#x27;t even charged it but the first time when I got it.  It cuts very well, is very light weight.  I haven&#x27;t used all the attachments but if they work as well as the main one, I&#x27;m that much happier.</li>
            <li> This trimmer has enought attachments and depths guides to allow easy trimming exactly the way you need it. I have been using it for a month and have not had to charge it yet. It&#x27;s sharp/ powerful enough to trim the most stubborn facial hair. I primarily use on a mustache and goatee to keep it at perfect length.</li>
            <li> Wahl 9854-600 Lithium Ion All In One Trimmer arrived as advertised with some confusion with what attachments go with what promotion.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work properly, blades don&#x27;t cut hair, attachments don&#x27;t work half the time, worthless, don&#x27;t bother buying this. This is not worth the money I paid for it.</li>
            <li> I bought this item specifically because it claims to hold its charge in storage.  In the beginning I was quite satisfied.  However I find that after one year of very light usage, a fully charged battery loses it charge in about a week.  Thankfully the credit card I used doubles the warranty period.</li>
            <li> The battery life of this trimmer is amazing. Quick charge is a great option.&lt;br /&gt;However, the trimmer doesn&#x27;t always trim so well on the first go over.&lt;br /&gt;Often, it takes several laps to trim the hair. And, without a guard on the trimmer, it will pull your hair like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s super painful.&lt;br /&gt;But, if you can get past that, for the money, it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been impressed with how rarely I have to charge this device. I use it probably once a week to trim my beard, and I think I charged it just a couple of times last year. The one disappointment I had with this trimmer is the tool that is used to give you a clean shave. After I had shaved my beard, I brought this trimmer with me on a trip to use instead of my DE razor. I couldn&#x27;t get over at how poorly it was a maintaining a clean shaven appearance. It just kept missing hairs left and right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation would be to use this for trimming your beard/goatee/what-have-you, but look some place else if you want to use it as a replacement for a standard razor.</li>
            <li> Like the title states, I think this trimmer is awesome. However, the base in which you store everything is incredibly cheaply made, compared to the components it houses. There isn&#x27;t even really a way to get the trimmer to charge in the dock unless you lift up the base, pull the cord through the dock, plug it in, then put the trimmer back into the dock. This seems a bit silly to bitch about, but it&#x27;s incredibly annoying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had about a half dozen trimmers over the past 20 years and this one was by far the best yet. I used it for everything from trimming the beard, shaving the beard, to shaving my head. It holds a charge for quite a while when it&#x27;s new. The smaller trimmer head works excellent for anything you want to do to your face. The nose clipper head works perfect for your nose and the larger clipper head works pretty good for your head....The shaver head works ok...not great. It&#x27;s not good enough to shave with as a final shaver. It&#x27;ll knock down what you have there but you&#x27;ll have to hit the razor &amp; shaving cream to finish.&lt;br /&gt;My advice to a new owner is to keep it very clean and lubricated. The cleaner &amp; lubricated you keep it, the better &amp; longer it will last. (BTW you cant shave your head with wet hair...water or sweat. The sheer heads jam up.)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had mine for over 4  years now and although it&#x27;s starting to lose it&#x27;s charge fast and sometimes i have to give it a little tap to get it to start, it still does it&#x27;s job. (I&#x27;m not going to buy another but that&#x27;s only because I wanna try something on more of a professional level) I would buy another if I were in the market for this size trimmer.</li>
            <li> When this arrived and I saw the size (was expecting a full-sized Wahl, this was a little smaller than that) I thought it was going to be a cheaply made, weak rip off. My first impression was way wrong! It is hefty and runs with moxie through my coarse beard! It also comes with a variety of heads which work well - including a small shave head that works nicely below my beard line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only minor complaint is the head changing: To me part of the most important portion of the printed directions the pictures are too small to see. Shame on you Wahl!! It is a little awkward and there is a learning curve. I&#x27;ve got it down pat now but it took a few changes to get it right. For those using this unit for the first time pull the head off following the curve of the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the learning curve I would recommend the Wahl all in one.</li>
            <li> I do not understand why, but the one i got will no long turn on.  i can think of nothing that happened to cause this, but after 8-10 uses, i cannot get it to turn on no matter what i do.  very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This razor has been used many times since it was ordered, and hasn&#x27;t failed me at all! It is still in good condition after over a year of use, and is now being used by my family members as well! I would definitely recommend this razor to anybody in need of one.</li>
            <li> Great shaver..........but would not keep a charge.......sent back in one week....I have used this product all my life with no problem....just bad batteries..........</li>
            <li> bought as a gift and performed as expected.  Was reasonably priced and the description was good.  Would purchase the product again.</li>
            <li> I really like the product. I have had another batter powered trimmer for about a year, which was cheaper, and much less effective. The main difference is in the quality of the blades that came with this clipper. The blades on this clipper is much better than others that I have used. I like to keep a short beard, and this groomer is perfect for this. I also have used it for some \\&quot;body grooming\\&quot; and it worked very well. I would not expect this to be used as a close shaver, but it works great as a trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is the tray that holds all the accessories. There is not enough room in the tray to hold all of the attachments. I really only use 2-3 so it is not  a big deal for me.&lt;br /&gt;I have only had this product for a short period of time (2 weeks), but so far I have been very impressed. I also use Wahl products for hair clippers for haircuts and have never had any problems.</li>
            <li> This thing can really cut. I had to used it to shave when my main clippers broke and it has done the job pretty well with zero skin irritation. I will say that the accessories that come with it do not work at all. So much so that I&#x27;ve stopped using them all together and I just stick with the main blade. Also that charge on mine lasts a really long time and I think I&#x27;ve charged it once since owning it and I use it at least once a week.</li>
            <li> Great portable trimmer, still working after two and a half years.&lt;br /&gt;Never had any issues with it. Wahl is a great brand.</li>
            <li> I have been extremely satisfied with this product; it does what it needs to do, but the battery holds its charge sooooo well! The attachments are vast and very helpful in hair removal and makes trimming fun.</li>
            <li> This is a great little unit. No pulling of hair loads of attachments including a shaver. I use this for every day touchups.</li>
            <li> I use this about once a week to trim my beard and to buzz my hair.  It lasts about 6 or 7 trimmings before it has to be plugged in again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets hair on the &amp;#34;grip,&amp;#34; but it lets you control the haircut a lot more.  I LOVE this thing.</li>
            <li> Are you looking for an affordable, nearly perfect men&#x27;s grooming kit and trimmer?? This has it all. A man can do everything with this: beard trimming, hair trimming, styling, grooming, you name it! A great value for the price!!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent trimmer. It works very well for my use and it does hold a charge for very long. However, the metal parts of the trimming attachment rust easily and remain corroded. As regards the attachment with the two cutting hedges, one of the two cutters inside of the housing just disintegrated like a piece of charcoal. I communicated with Wahl and requested a replacement which they provided without any hassle whatsoever, However the representative to whom I spoke pointed out that the part is considered &amp;#34;disposable&amp;#34;, thus it needs to be replaced just the same one would replace a razor blade. The replacement costs $7+ at this time. I have resigned myself to replacing it when necessary. Otherwise I love the gadget and would recommend it. Just do not allow water to get into the handle part. It will be ruined.</li>
            <li> Great razor... 4 stars out of 5 because it tends to damage the nut bag if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> I bought this and two other hair clippers, and this is the best one. It keeps a good charge. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I like the heads and this is easy to use.  I bought this product as well because it&#x27;s made in America and it was labeled as such when it arrived.  I like it.</li>
            <li> These are a little on the loud side.  Blades are a tad thicker than I like, but trims nice, and is very handy with the rechargeable battery.  Charge lasts a long time.  I&#x27;ve had mine for 6 months, trim once a week, haven&#x27;t recharged yet.</li>
            <li> Bought this product after I used my son&#x27;s. Knew prior to purchasing how it performed. Great product if you are looking for a good trimmer for your beard this is the one.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband after his other brand&#x27;s attatchments broke and there were no replacements and tried to replace it with the same brand (but different style) thinking that it would be the same...wrong!! I started searching for a new one and it didn&#x27;t take long to find this one! He really likes this one. Has a powerful motor and he says he doesn&#x27;t have a problem with the &#x27;noise&#x27; (it is a trimmer not sure why that would be a problem...it doesn&#x27;t sound like a vaccuum cleaner at 6 am) and he has no &#x27;gripping&#x27; problems. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the storage..wish it was more contained (with a lid over the attatchments.) I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it has a lithium ion battery. My old ones died so quickly, this one lasts a long time. Good clippers.</li>
            <li> Trimmer is great, some good attachments.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is sorta useless.&lt;br /&gt;The tray is also no better than a small bowl.&lt;br /&gt;charged it once and still holding after weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Stop working in a month.&lt;br /&gt;I used the product twice a week for trimming my beard, thats a total of 8 times use in a month.&lt;br /&gt;The product  is not charging properly anymore,  doesn&#x27;t  have enough power to move the blades.</li>
            <li> You can charge this all you want but the next time you go to use it, it will be dead. So you have to plan ahead your trimming needs.&lt;br /&gt;Holder for accessories is useless.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for an all in one trimmer that actually excels in performance using all the attachments and I found it with the Wahl.&lt;br /&gt;Even the foil shaver gives a close and smooth shave.  I especially like the t-blade for trimming my beard and lining up my side burns.  This is the 1 product to buy for ALL ur shaving needs.</li>
            <li> Pros: Compact, light, easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Loud, cheap material, broke after 5 or 6 uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The system for changing the heads on the handle is poorly designed, I felt like I might break the head every time I changed it. I was using it for about the sixth time and I started to hear a rattle. Part of the workings in the main head broke off completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend paying 20 or 30 dollars more for a better quality trimmer.</li>
            <li> I had the older model, basically the same trimmer. Used it two to three times per week for at least five years. Kept it plugged in all the time, but otherwise took excellent care with provided oil and cleaning brush. It had to have been over five years it lasted and it finally started to loose power and charge despite constantly being plugged-in. I started searching around for the advanced products I was sure might exist, but found nothing that compared in quality and design. Despite shopping around for some time and continuing to use my old model for facial and body grooming, I ended up purchasing the newer model with the Lithium battery. After several weeks of use I am so pleased with this trimmer. It&#x27;s strong, powerful, and reliable. The only draw-back is the rubber handle, which is a magnet for small hairs and is difficult to clean. The older model had a similar rubber handle that seemed slightly easier to clean. Anyway, this trimmer is worth it&#x27;s weight in gold and I would recommend it to anybody for beard and body hair. It has the utilities for trimming head hair, and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s powerful enough for that. I prefer the barber or larger clippers for that.</li>
            <li> The trimmer was a good value with many attachments, but it is not ideal for edging/shaping. After using a couple of times I wasn&#x27;t satisfied, so I took it to my barber and to get his opinion, or some pointers (maybe I wasn&#x27;t using it properly).  I showed and discussed with him the issues I was having with the device and he digs in his drawer and pulls out the exact same model.  He stated that the blade isn&#x27;t close enough to give that clean edging/shaping I was looking for because you cannot adjust the blade.  The razor works well and you can save money because you do not have to by replacement/disposable razors, but if you have sensitive skin using it everyday will irritate your face.</li>
            <li> it stopped working after a 2 months.. At first it worked fine, 3-4 weeks later it only worked if it was plugged in, then 3-4 more weeks it completely stopped working</li>
            <li> I have been using wireless trimmers for years.  I have used a ConAir before until it got too old and started to make a noise that I could not fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Wahl is a good trimmer to buy at this price. $30. It would be better priced at $25 though. They would make the decision much easier that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Light and efficient.  Nice grip and feels good in the hand.  It trims very well.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  The blades are not easy to put on.  The shaver attachment is a joke.  Don&#x27;t expect to be shaving anything with it because it does not work...at all.&lt;br /&gt;The wider metal blade attachment is too sharp like other reviewers have pointed out.</li>
            <li> OK, I&#x27;ve used lots of hair cutters and have learned that there are somethings to be careful to look for:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Short cords - This doesn&#x27;t have a cord at all, and the battery life is long, so it&#x27;s a winner.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Stamped steel blades - Stamped steel blades don&#x27;t last and they pull hair.  These are machined; &#x27;nother winner.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Noisy clippers don&#x27;t last.  Think about it; that noise, that hammering sound that you hear is something... hammering. The little clipper is beating itself to death somehow, and eventually, probably pretty soon, it will quit.  This one is quiet for the win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;organizer\\&quot; that this set comes with is pretty useless, but only because it doesn&#x27;t weigh anything.  I turned mine over, filled it with BB shot (fishing aisle, Wal-Mart, $1.29) and topped it all off with Shoe Goo (also at Wal-Mart).  Now the stand has a nice weight, and stays where I put it.  I also got rid of the shaver attachment and the guards that I won&#x27;t use (there really isn&#x27;t room for EVERYTHING, so you have to choose what you will use).  Now everything fits nice and neat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this for about four months now, and it&#x27;s the best all-rounder that I have come across.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I&#x27;ve been using this clipper once a week for a year, and it still looks and performs as new.  It&#x27;s also worth noting that this trimmer is easy to clean compared to other clippers that I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another update:  Two years and going strong.</li>
            <li> I used this Wahl trimmer for two years, on an average once a week for 5 minutes. After the first year, I started observing that the charge will not hold for more than a few minutes, steadily decreasing. For the last three months, the trimmer charge lasts under a minute after a full day of charging. Other review have described rusting and poor quality rubber grip, I agree.  This is light trim, no heavy duty stuff here..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course batteries degrade and die, some earlier than others. I took the trimmer to the repair shop indicated on the Walh website. Guess what, I found that this $45 trimmer is a throwaway item. I was quoted $40 llabor + cost of a new battery. The tech said the battery is not swappable, it is \\&quot;hard wired\\&quot;/soldered on.</li>
            <li> An excellent trimmer, as far as how it cuts. BUT - this is a throw away piece, one in which Wahl did not intend the user to ever be able to change the battery! They seem to expect one to simply throw it away when the battery goes bad and buy another  trimmer from them!! But, if you&#x27;re a technically oriented person, the battery is available from Amazon:     http://www.amazon.com/Cylindrical-Rechargeable-Batteries-Philips-Electric/dp/B00ML5K2OG/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?s&#x3D;electronics&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1422152997&amp;sr&#x3D;1-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;3.7+volt+aa+battery+with+solder+tabs%27    Or, search the web for, 3.7 Volt Li-Ion battery, size 14500 (or AA) with solder tabs. It&#x27;s available from most all battery dealers. The rubber skin covering the plastic case can be pealed back from the head to the tail, to remove it. Doing so will turn it inside out. When the work is done, it can be turned back right side out and pulled back over the body into place with a bit of effort. But, if you don&#x27;t care about having a rubber grip, you might as well simply slice it off with a razor blade &amp; forget about reusing it - your choice. Then, the case is easily pried open, using a small screwdriver. One will need circuit board repair &amp; soldering skills to un-solder the old battery from the circuit board &amp; to install the replacement battery, and minimal mechanical skills in order to reassemble the unit. If you&#x27;re willing to do all of this, then it&#x27;s a great trimmer! The only other issue I&#x27;ve had with it is the small trimming head began to work a bit intermittently, so I ordered a replacement from Wahl with no difficulties and at a reasonable price. However, Wahl has revealed itself to be a very consumer &amp; environmentally unfriendly company with this design, as most folks will simply send a good piece of machinery, &amp; a used up Li-Ion battery along with it, to their local landfill, simply because it needs a new battery!! I openly gave it 5 stars in hopes that more folks will see the review, but it really only deserves 2 or 3!</li>
            <li> great razor .. love it</li>
            <li> The trimmer is great but the shaver in the kit was less than usless it dosent really shave or anything it took about 10 min to \\&quot;Shave\\&quot; about a inch of facial hair,but lucky for me i never fully shave besides my neck and i use a razor for that, for cutting/trimming hair its really great ive used it a few times alredy and im satisfied with it, and all the other attachments are a great plus to. If your like me and never shave just trim ur facial hair then this is a great product if you dont count the shaver.</li>
            <li> Nice trimmer with a long batter life. However, using the supplied oil on the blades caused them to rust, which I thought was weird.</li>
            <li> Good feel and a nice product.&lt;br /&gt;If you do a search you will find the Business development manager giving a demo that is very good.&lt;br /&gt;I like mine and recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I use the Wahl for beard/face trimming and shaving my head, and I really love this trimmer so far. The lithium battery is great and holds a charge as good or better than advertised. I&#x27;ve had mine for 2 or 3 weeks now, and still running off of the first charge. Changing the attachments is a snap, and the trim blades cut close but are not sharp and don&#x27;t snag your skin. The rubberized handle is comfortable and easy to grip, and though hair clippings tend to stick to it, they easily wipe off with a damp rag. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent, up to this point</li>
            <li> Great,but&lt;br /&gt;battery died in4 yrs</li>
            <li> I totally agree with \\&quot;D. R. Jeanclerc\\&quot; comment in every single word, This is by far and for sure the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever had, the charge is amazing I really forgot when was the last time I&#x27;ve charged it. It&#x27;s really powerful and will perfectly do the job.&lt;br /&gt;It would have been better if:&lt;br /&gt;1- it came with zipper bag to hold all the accessories together instead of this cheap and acword plastic base.&lt;br /&gt;2- all the plastic accessories are really cheap and flimsy would be better to enhance this a little bit&lt;br /&gt;3- a battery life indicator would be a nice add on</li>
            <li> You wouldn&#x27;t think one could buy a quality, US-made product like this for such a reasonable price, but here it is.  Well worth the small premium over imported junk from other makers.</li>
            <li> I had to return the first one after a week, because it died. I wish I would have exchanged it for the [[ASIN:B0058SY1XQ Wahl 9818 Lithium Ion Stainless Steel All-in-one Groomer]] ($50.99 Nov-2012). My second one lasted a few weeks (still on the first charge) and the on/off switch jammed. The internal sub-assembly seems to have come loose, so when I move the switch I am moving the internals instead. I waited too long to return it to Amazon, so I replaced it with the 9818. I wish that I would not have tried to save $20, because now I have paid $82 total.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers have mentioned the rubber cover and the hair that sticks to it. I wanted to return it for that reason before the switch stopped working. You cannot use water to rinse this off, and dry towels won&#x27;t remove the hair. The thing that works the best is a damp rag, but what a pain. It picks up stuff on surfaces that appear to be perfectly clean. It&#x27;s a magnet. If you don&#x27;t mind the hair, or don&#x27;t mind using a damp cloth, then this would not be an issue. But I would rather spend the extra $20 for the stainless version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use this to trim my sideburns, so all of the other attachments are a waste for me. I bought this because it was the least expensive Wahl I found with a lithium ion battery. The battery is amazing and neither trimmer worked long enough to need a recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update Nov-2012: It was very nice to see the comment from Wahl (below). I have never had that happen before. I returned the defect and purchased the 9818. The 9818 was also apparently defective. The Wahl website says that both clippers have the same torque, but my new stainless 9818 runs slow and seems wimpy. After a full charge I could grab the blades while running and stop them using very moderate force. I was unable to stop the lesser expensive 9854 now matter how much force I used. I sent the 9818 to Wahl repair at the same time. They just received them today. I am sticking with Wahl in spite of thisexperience because they have the strongest motors, the best blades, and they are made in the USA. And now I know that their customer service is good too.</li>
            <li> Feels cheap. Vibrates too much and very noisy. Hair sticks to the handle.</li>
            <li> The trimmers&#x27; slim design was very comfortable in my hand and gave me the control to produce an even trim. The multiple attachments gave me the necessary tools to reach those hard to get spots on my face. Although I have only used this trimmer a couple times, its performance has earned my buy recommendation.</li>
            <li> Head is extremely hard to remove to put new head on. Found the trimmer pulls hair also.  Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> This just what I was looking for-plenty of attachments for various hair removals. I gave it 4 stars because the comb that comes with it is very flimsy. The rest of it looks great.</li>
            <li> Bought this trimmer a little over two years ago. I was a light user with it, maybe twice a month to trim.  Last night it wouldn&#x27;t turn on; so i let it charge over night in hopes that it was a battery issue.  Tried again this morning, and no dice.  I left it in the on position and I could tell that the battery was discharging due to the heat coming out of the battery compartment, but it seemed like the internal motor had seized up causing it not to operate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it worked, it worked well, unfortunately the longevity needs to be questioned.</li>
            <li> Pros: powerful motor; efficient blades; quick switch on attachments; excellent charging time and usage&lt;br /&gt;Cons: hair sticks to handle; flimsy tray to store attachments&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: this is a 120/60hz trimmer, but it does work fine on a transformer</li>
            <li> like i do with a razor. also it has great power and i get a good trim in those hard to get areas</li>
            <li> The battery lasts forever but the parts dont fit in the box that came with it. It isn&#x27;t entirely clear what all the attachments are for though...</li>
            <li> Battery charge life and short time for chargning are good.  Foil razor, beard trimmer and detail trimmer all work very good.</li>
            <li> I liked the earlier version and was happy to see that basic design and weight were the same in this version with the better battery.  Nice job of not changing a winner!</li>
            <li> This cutter is awesome!!! Haven&#x27;t charged it since it arrived and it doesn&#x27;t pull any hairs while cutting. Comes with all the trimming attachments I need to trim hair...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful enough to buzz through the thickest hair.  There are an amazing variety of attachments.  Best trimmer I ever had.</li>
            <li> Have had other Wahl trimmers before and wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else. They really last and do well in many ways.</li>
            <li> love it but hate new packaging. i loved the old stand, hate the new carrying case, i want the stand not a case! BOOO</li>
            <li> Does what you would expect.  I have 2 main gripes.  1) As I suppose is a problem with quick change tip items, shaved hair gets into the mechanism and since the little shaft that does the work is in there and greased, it kind of gets messy.  2) You  have to keep it on charge or it will discharge and the power supplied by the cable isn&#x27;t enough to run the shaver with an empty battery.  I use it once a week and if I unplug it, shave with it and forget to plug it back in, it will be dead on Monday when I need it again.  Glad my remote control batteries on my TV don&#x27;t do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with cordless circular saws, cordless weed eaters, cordless vacuum&#x27;s, its probably better to just get the corded version unless you &#x27;really&#x27; need that feature.  This is no exception.  Your likely using this in front of a mirror in a bathroom, there is likely an outlet right there.  Why do you really need cordless?  Of course, that is up to you.  This product is ok.  Not great, still kind of works, but I can tell its working harder than it should need to.</li>
            <li> Trims the beard adequately. Although it has an attachment for shaving, it is inefficient in that mode. Since that is not why I bought it, I would rate it good at its primary purpose.</li>
            <li> Well constructed item. Durability to be assessed in future.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old Wahl trimmer.  This one is much quieter than my old one.  I have only used the regular trimmer and the t-trimmer so far, but everything is working great.  It&#x27;s quiet and plenty powerful.  I&#x27;m bald and cut what little hair I do have about 3x/week.  It cuts pretty short, but not the shortest cut I&#x27;ve had.  I&#x27;ve had it about 3 weeks and have only charged it once when I initially received it.  I don&#x27;t have any reservations about recommending it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m delighted with this trimmer.  It has everything I could want and more.  Its a neat package of accessories and quick and easy snap-on cutters.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer in febuary, and its the best ive ever used!!! I charged my trimmer like instructed, i trim my facial hair about twice a week, and i have not had to recharge it yet (mid july)!!  cuts great with no tugging that you get with other trimmers in this price range.  great product!!</li>
            <li> I was very surprised to see all the negatives. I have it for  over a year and I used for body trim and never wet. This is no dry/wet. I have no problem with rust at all. Made of nice solid plastic, not flimsy at all.Blades are solid steel. It works incredibly well. It is smooth, powerful, and works very well for beard and body and battery last so long, and if ever stopped working, I will reorder immediately. I have tried so many for body and beard, and this is my very favorite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a variety of Wahl trimmers over the years. And they just keep getting better and better! Always good quality at a good price. I&#x27;m very pleased with the \\&quot;All In One Trimmer\\&quot;. The Lithium Ion battery is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. I have found the different attachment heads to be very useful in maintaining a neatly groomed appearance. That&#x27;s my story and I&#x27;m sticking with it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two of these. The batteries on both of them crapped out after about six months. You can&#x27;t even plug it into the wall and use it.&lt;br /&gt;Into the trash it goes, again.</li>
            <li> I got this to replace an old trimmer and it is a great deal.  There are three different sizes for the trimmer itself depending on the size of the area you want trimmed. One can be used for ears and noses and the middle one is perfect for my beard.  I haven&#x27;t found a use for the larger one yet but if the dog keeps shedding, I may fine a use for it.&lt;br /&gt;There are a bunch of attachments, but the middle sized trimmer has an adjustable comb that has 5 different positions.  That&#x27;a about all I use.  I like the size and heft of the device, it feels sturdy in my hand and is easy to maneuver.&lt;br /&gt;The pouch is a bonus if you want to take this on the road.  I was able to put the charger, trimmer and the attachments I use into the pouch and still have room.&lt;br /&gt;It also seems to hold a charge very well.  I used to keep the old one plugged in all the time, but with this one I just charge it once every couple of weeks.  My only slight issue is the lack of a charging indicator.  Normally there is a light that goes from red (charging) to green (charged), but for this trimmer you just plug it in and let it charge overnight.  I&#x27;m not sure it is necessary or even very helpful since leaving it charge overnight seems to do the trick.</li>
            <li> I hate required reviews but for this I will tell you it is the best on the market you should get one as soon as you can.</li>
            <li> Pulls beard hair with plastic guard attachments but overall gets the job done and battery last long time between charges</li>
            <li> This is a good trimmer....however the \\&quot;stainless steel\\&quot; teeth broke after only 3 months of use by my husband (who doesn&#x27;t have thick or coarse hair) when I contacted the company about this issue they had a quick prompt response and sent out a free replacement. This trimmer does do a good job however.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a great product. I use it for trimming around the neck hairline and it seems to stay relatively clean. I gave one to my bf for christmas and it seems to have done a good job so far.</li>
            <li> I use a trimmer at least once a week.  I have never tried a wahl till I bought this one.  It works good and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this Trimmer for the past 4 years and the fact that is charges so quickly ans lasts so long makes it an excellent choice. It&#x27;s also great for travelling as it&#x27;s a very compact size. I &#x27;d recommend this trimmer for the body, face, and head.</li>
            <li> the charge last thru several trims and is easy on the skin trims close and the attachment work really well, easy to use and easy to change attaments</li>
            <li> I have used Wahl clippers for years and will use nothing else.  Recently my trimmer died out and I decided to purchase another, doing so I upgraded and purchased the Model 79600-2101 and to replace my trimmer I purchased the Lithium Ion all in one trimmer.  The best of all worlds. The Clipper allows me to keep my hair the way I like it, The All in one trimmer takes care of my facial hairs. Leaving the battery operated trimmer for my business case. Thank Wahl they never pinch, pull, or cut.</li>
            <li> Just with the trimmer it is an amazing deal. But with all the other attachments for 25$ it is a steal</li>
            <li> I bought this for my partner as a Christmas gift and he uses it daily.  He has had no issues at all with it.  It comes with lots of different size attachments too.  Almost too many but the stand that it comes with helps keep all the little attachments together.  Very light in weight too.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m 65 so I&#x27;ve had quite a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It charges  fast, and holds the charge very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some others have &amp;#34;complained&amp;#34; that there are too many accessories.That&#x27;s like complaining that they paid too little for a new car.There&#x27;s a simple solution. DON&amp;#34;T USE THEM/THROW THEM AWAY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the complaints about too much vibration? Totally ridiculous. Sure it vibrates a little, but it&#x27;s lightweight and doesn&#x27;t have enough mass to absorb it all. But nowhere near enough to complain about unless it takes you 6~7 hours to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll make it simple. It charges fast, shaves/trims well, has every thing you&#x27;re likely to need, and a good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, buy it.</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift for my husband.  He uses it once to twice a week, and he loves it.  He had one and all he did was complain everytime he used it, and avoided trimming his beard as long as possible.  Now he keeps his beard trimmed on a regular basis with no complaining!!!  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> The trimmer itself works great however the rubberized grip attracts my hair so the handle is covered in my shavings.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried rinsing them off but it doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;If you are OK with having a hairy trimmer then this will suit your needs just fine.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this trimmer. I needed this as a replacement for another Wahl trimmer I had that stopped holding a charge.  I&#x27;ve charged this thing 2 times in over a month, and it&#x27;s had a charge every single time I needed to use it.  All the attachments fit perfectly and it does everything I need it to do, including trimming mustache, beard, neckline, eyebrows and even has the attachment to help trim nose hairs (not that I need it of course....).  ;)</li>
            <li> Love all of the attachments... they ensure perfect grooming all over the body. Hold a charge great too!! Glad I bought it!!</li>
            <li> This trimmer, although it cuts well, loses battery capacity in less than a year.  Now my trimmer essentially needs constant charging when used regularly.  I imagine most people looking to buy this would be looking to use it regularly.  I would not buy again and don&#x27;t recommend it.  I will probably get a more reliable corded version.</li>
            <li> It was delivered quickly.  It worked immediately.  I was unsure about the price but Wahl is a great brand.  Once it arrived I was even more impressed.  This is a great tool and a very reasonable price for what you are buying.  If you trim your tree you want this.</li>
            <li> Great battery life and power</li>
            <li> Bought this back in December to replace one that I lost on a trip.  Worked fine as a beard trimmer, two or three times a week until a few weeks ago.  I went to use it and noticed that the handle was really warm, almost hot.  Unplugged it and let it sit overnight after using it.  When I checked it the following morning it was dead; wouldn&#x27;t run unplugged or plugged, wouldn&#x27;t charge on several different outlets.  An eight-month life span was not what I expected.  Tossed it and giving the 79600-2101 model a try.</li>
            <li> Nope, nothin&#x27; close about this shave plus it breaks easily.</li>
            <li> good but difficult to charge</li>
            <li> Batteries die and you have to throw it away after 1 year or less.</li>
            <li> Putting on the various guards is not easy or seamless. The beard one kept falling off. Then when I went to remove the guard, the entire metal head popped off and I couldn&#x27;t get it to go back on. The device feels cheap and I&#x27;m extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great product, replaced an old corded Wahl I had for over 8 years. Had this for over a year now and works perfect.  the only issue is that the one of the blades is getting a bit of rust on it and I have never used it in a humid bathroom or after a shower. Other than that, offers plenty of attachments, easy to use, and easy to change those attachements. You can always watch the video on Wahl&#x27;s website on how to operate.  Holds the charge really well, no battery issues so far</li>
            <li> Great item, love the interchangeable heads. Price was not that good of a deal</li>
            <li> The parts are not the easiest to change.  It would have been better to come with a docking charging station instead of a cord.  It did come with a lot of different depth combs and three width razors which make it very versatile.</li>
            <li> Great product, works great, easy change heads</li>
            <li> This trimmer is much more powerful than any I&#x27;ve used before and comes with many more (too many?) attachments. The trimmer&#x27;s build quality is excellent, though the settings on the plastic adjustable trimmer head can slip if not set and used carefully.</li>
            <li> I received this the other day and was disappointed that what I got and what the picture showed is close but not the same. There is no such stand in the package. So I have a jumble of parts I would have to keep in a ziploc bag on the counter. Does missing the stand detract from the main product? Probably not but enough that I&#x27;ll return it.</li>
            <li> This product is a complete piece of junk. How can a company (especially Wahl) create a trimmer that completely stops working after only one month.  Nothing more to say.  Do not buy this thing.</li>
            <li> Note: We did have to send the unit into Wahl after 3 weeks because it suddenly stopped working completely, but they replaced it free of charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is great. I use it to trim my beard and cut my hair as well. I just use a 1/8&amp;#34; on my head so it is super easy.&lt;br /&gt;The charge has never failed while using it. I have probably used it for 35 minutes at a time and it has never died on me while using it.&lt;br /&gt;Hair does stick to the hand of the unit but I just use a brush and it comes off easy enough. I wish it had some larger attachments so I could cut my sons hair with it. It only has 1/8&amp;#34;, 1/4&amp;#34;, &amp; 3/8&amp;#34;.  If they would add a 1/2&amp;#34; and a 3/4&amp;#34; that would be phenomenal. Overall this has been a good product. I am happy with the purchase. I use it every 2 weeks and I&#x27;ve had it about a year now.</li>
            <li> These are noisy but perform as expected.&lt;br /&gt;Have to get used to switching the heads(blades).&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t like them as much as discontinued Wahl that that the head rotated from wide to narrow blade.</li>
            <li> A great battery life. Any complain so far...</li>
            <li> Excellent.  Sharp and cuts very well. Very quiet compared to my old razor and the blades are well designed and hard.</li>
            <li> The product was broken when I recieved it. I could see it was broken through the package. But I returned it with no problems. Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> It does a very capable job of trimming. I have a little quarrel with the nose hair trimmer. It could trim a little closer.</li>
            <li> Just wanted to capture my initial setup notes... If you&#x27;re going to supply a plethora of attachments, provide a base that can actually organize them.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what the picture is showing, but I received the 17 piece set and maybe 1/2 of the pieces fit in the provided base, and of those many not as if they were intended to actually fit... just random slots to toss where some may fall, but many don&#x27;t fit at all.&lt;br /&gt;Alas the majority will probably get tossed into a drawer making a mess and never to be seen again.</li>
            <li> The preset cutting length attachments avoid slippage of the head cutting too short by accident. It is a bit loud for am shaving while everyone else is sleeping. Very powerful blades, hasn&#x27;t pulled my hair yet! Long life battery!</li>
            <li> SEE MY REVIEW FOR THE NOSE/ EAR TRIMMER.  THE WAHL QUALITY HAS DECLINED.  IT DOES NOT COLLECT HAIR LIKE THE ONE THAT I BOUGHT TEN YEARS AGO..  TEN YEARS.  GOOD PRODUCT.  THIS ONE MIGHT MAKE IT 2 YEARS.  I DON&#x27;T KNOW.</li>
            <li> Smooth cutting trimmer with attachment for ears/nostril &amp; comb attachments for different heights. This trimmer replaced one purchased earlier that had poor battery life. The lithium Ion battery in this trimmer is superb. I&#x27;ve had the device for 7 months, used it once a week &amp; haven&#x27;t had to recharge it to date. It&#x27;s a compact device with a rubberized handle that makes it easy to hold. The handle tends to collect particles of cut hair, but is easy enough to clean that this is not an issue for me. There are two comb attachments for trimming hair to a certain height. I use the lowest height attachment comb and it&#x27;s satisfactory, but I would have preferred a comb or other height adjustment for a &amp;#34;stubble&amp;#34; height.</li>
            <li> To be short the battery life on this product was fabulous. Changing accessories was very difficult and the shaver head routinely fell off during use.  I returned it.  It was also pretty loud as other reviewers noted.  Very disappointing from WAHL...  I&#x27;m still searching for a decent electric - should have gone back to Norelco I guess.</li>
            <li> The beard trimmer broke after 5 weeks of use.  I was using it once a week.  The spring that holds the blade to the guide is what broke.  I would return it but the return window ended a week ago.  I guess I&#x27;ll see if I can get a warranty replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the black silicone type material that the trimmer is encased in is very difficult to clean; the clippings from my beard stick to it.</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a gift for the hubby. He has a full beard and was pleased with the item and it&#x27;s performance. Great value!</li>
            <li> My husband has used this several times and loves it.</li>
            <li> I hoped that the shaver attachment would work well enough for my face. I don&#x27;t grow a ton of facial hair, and this thing struggled to shave what I had.</li>
            <li> Received one of these for Christmas a few years ago and the battery only lasted about 5 months.  I&#x27;m trying it again because I like how close this shaves, and all of the attachments that come with it.  Will try to remember to update this post if the battery fails again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of wahl products, they stay cool, have tight powerful motors, and have the sharpest ground blades.... Plus they are located right down the road in Sterling IL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said I only rate this trimmer @ 3 1/2 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: powerful quality feeling motor, sharp close cutting blades, and easy interchangeable heads&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: the foil shaving head sucks on any area other than the mid to upper cheeks. It pulls the hair, irritates my skin a bit, and leaves a spotty shave (some spots baby smooth and others with a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow). I have a beard so I only use it for upper cheeks and my neck area so I don&#x27;t need a full size shaver, but this foil head just doesn&#x27;t cut the mustard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rubber handle is just too tacky. It&#x27;s nice to have a rubber grip but just change the type of rubber so it can be brushed of instead of needing to be wiped down with a wet rag. It also attracts any dirt or dust it comes in contact with, which causes it to look dirty and dingy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only other issue with it is the T-blade... It has a rough edge to it so it snags and nicks the skin vs gliding across it smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The standard blade and small detail blade are excellent though with a close cut (as close as a trimmer like this can get anyway) and no snagging or nicks to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy again but if you&#x27;re looking for a all in one trimmer with a good foil shaver I&#x27;d shop around</li>
            <li> I love this thing.  Except the attachments for trimming your hair to a certain length, aren&#x27;t so great.  I have a five month beard going on, wanted to trim down to the longest setting on the trimmer and BAM!  Right down to the skin.  It&#x27;s a good thing I am not a barber.  The battery lasts long and I like the other attachments.  The small one is great for trimming nose hairs.</li>
            <li> bought this item as a xmas gift, not sure how it works out but the item looks as described and was packaged very well</li>
            <li> looks great.  works great.  arrived on time. have to have 13 more words to be able to get this posted.</li>
            <li> Boyfriend loved this 1 too. He loved how nicely it cut and he&#x27;s happy with it :)</li>
            <li> I see a lot of rave reviews about the power of the battery on this, and yes that is true when the unit is new.  I was given this shaver as a Christmas gift back in 2010.  It certainly was powerful and took a charge extremely quickly.  Unfortunately 2 years later it will not hold a charge at all and im on the search for a new trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must leave it plugged into the wall constantly to get 2-5 minutes of run time.  If I unplug it, the battery drains itself completely in less than 12 hours.  Completely useless.</li>
            <li> My husband loves his Wahl 9818 Stainless Steel Lithium Grooming Trimmer.  I bought it for him for Christmas.  I check out tons of groom kit trimmers.  I read tons of reviews.  There were pro&#x27;s and con&#x27;s.  Sometimes it can be a bit overwhelming, deciding which one to choose.  One trimmer would have one item, and not the other item, needed.  I was trying to find a trimmer to meet all the needs.  I had narrowed it down to 2 trimmers.  I choose this one.  We are not sorry.  Nice for traveling, and home use.  My husband has no coomplaints about it at all.  I picked it up today,  it had a good feeling when holding it in my hands.  The stainless Steel looks classy.  I wasn&#x27;t going for looks.  I was going for proformance, and for it to meet the needs I needed.  I would highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> This is a great item.  I am very happy with the purchase; it is everything that I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> Gadgets galore, works as advertised.  Instructions are sufficient. Shaver head doesn&#x27;t work as well as I would have expected it to.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair clipper. The battery lasts for weeks or months. My only problem is that neither the charger nor the clipper has an indicator light to confirm that the clipper is charging, or to confirm that it is fully charged. As I use it day after day, I have no idea when the battery will run out. I could charge it, and the battery could run out the next day because the wall or clipper plug was not making contact.</li>
            <li> I use this to shave my head and trim my beard. I like how you can easily change from one head to the next. One thing that I noticed though is that it&#x27;s sometimes difficult to clean up. Some of the hair gets into the nook and crannies of the heads or even down inside the main unit. Hasn&#x27;t seem to cause a problem yet and I&#x27;ve used this for about a year now.</li>
            <li> A piece broke off the first week of having the product. I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend. The shave you get with it also isn&#x27;t very good he still ends up having to use a disposable razor after trimming his facial hair. I should have done more research into before buying the product.</li>
            <li> This item arrived quickly and was exactly as described. My husband&#x27;s only complaint... figuring out how to change the heads without breaking it. (No were instructions included.)</li>
            <li> Works great.  The long operating time between charges is great and all accesories work as advertised.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last. Cheaply made. Crap. Won&#x27;t buy Wahl products again. The battery is good for just a few minutes that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> This was my third attempt at finding a decent trimmer. All others I&#x27;ve tried were weak, had bad attachments, short battery life or could barely cut hair. This trimmer has worked amazingly since day one. I love it! All the attachments are good quality. The battery life is amazing as well. I have had this trimmer at least six months now and haven&#x27;t had to charge it since the first charge! I would suggest this trimmer to anyone looking, don&#x27;t waste money on the others out there!</li>
            <li> The trimmer itself is okay, but the rack that is supposed to hold the accessories, etc. is not the correct item and the attachments do not fit in the holder.  It is obviously the incorrect item. We have had to store the attachments in a separate container.  In addition, the box says very clearly made in USA, and the various items are clearly marked &amp;#34;China&amp;#34;.  Maybe the box was made in USA, but it is very misleading.</li>
            <li> This product is a terrible disappointment.  From the moment I took it out of the box, the cheap workmanship was evident.  the plastic tray to store the various attachments is so light that it seems almost throwaway quality.  The tray itself is not the one pictured, and is quite obviously not made specifically for this product.  The various attachments do not fit into it. At best they lie on top of the tray, but not with any degree of security; one jostle and they&#x27;re scattered across your counter. I worked a long time at trying to figure out how to make them fit in as the picture shows until I finally realized that the tray in my package is not the one in the picture.  Not that I use the attachments much, since they&#x27;re of the same flimsy plastic as the tray, and really don&#x27;t do the job they&#x27;re designed to do.  A little while longer and the whole bunch will be in the trash, and I will learn once again the truth of the old saying that \\&quot;poor people can&#x27;t afford cheap things.\\&quot;  You&#x27;d think I&#x27;d learn!</li>
            <li> Keeping this short. Bought this item 14 months ago. Battery life was only two or three SHORT sideburn trims. Now it dies overnight. Wahl even wants to charge you if it IS in warranty. Wonderful! I rarely leave negative reviews, but this item and the company leave a GREAT DEAL to be disappointed in. You decide. Ticked in Timbuktu.</li>
            <li> Excellet trimmer. Cuts super close. Wahl products are excellent and this trimmer is no exception; best I&#x27;ve owned yet.</li>
            <li> Though its performance is very good, the reason we chose this model was for the stand that is pictured. It does not come with the stand, just a bag, which though is nice for travelling, it&#x27;s not good if you want to keep it out on your bathroom shelf or vanity. All in all though it&#x27;s a great trimmer (though we had to return one for stopping working after just a month...but I am hoping that was just a fluke), especially the length of time it remains charged.</li>
            <li> Broke within minutes of use. Complete piece of s***</li>
            <li> THIS ITEM IS GREAT.. AND WAS JUST WHAT SOMEONE HERE WAS LOOKING FOR..&lt;br /&gt;IT MAKES A GREAT GIFT, ETC. IS DOES A PRETTY CLOSE SHAVE FOR BEARD SHEARING,&lt;br /&gt;THE RECHARGER WORKS FABULOUS ON IT. AND LASTS AND LASTS FOR A LONG TIME.&lt;br /&gt;ETC. A HIGH RECOMMEND..</li>
            <li> A great edition to my necessary grooming... Easy to use, and yeah, my wife is right, I now look civilized.</li>
            <li> I have this thing for 6 months it&#x27;s already broken very cheap made it even feels cheap and  look cheap</li>
            <li> Works very well&lt;br /&gt;Comes with plenty of attachments&lt;br /&gt;Good value</li>
            <li> The only accessory included to hold the parts is a cheap &amp;#34;bag&amp;#34;.  Seriously?  Advertised/Shown as having a base stand to put parts in.  Sending back.  Again, more false/misleading advertising.</li>
            <li> I have had 3 or 4 of these Wahl trimmers in the last 2 years, they use to be better, work well but don&#x27;t last long (this one doesn&#x27;t even work well). I just bought another this week, they have made some changes: it now has a soft rubber handle, it&#x27;s a sticky rubber and all the whiskers stick to it so badly you cant brush them off, I had to use a damp towel, what do I need with a rubber handle? it also has the same comb attachment as the last one I had of this same model but the blade is different, it seems to sit lower and will not trim as close, 1/4 inch at best and that&#x27;s just not going to work for me. the most aggravating thing was it kept pulling the hairs from my chin (OUCH!) I think the issue is the blade. I was wanting something better and last week bought a Norelco (that was a stupid choice, now in the trash), then started reading reviews and was going to get an Andis pro model, great reviews but there is confusion about the combs (sold separately) and compatibility between model and blade types plus little documentation from amazon or the manufacturers web site. thought I finally figured out what to order but reading all the reviews found one guy saying the combs did not fit quite right and another saying the comb was causing it to pull hairs. Quality just isn&#x27;t where it&#x27;s at these days, if it&#x27;s built well and last a long time, they go out of business. so I still need a new trimmer, if I cant find a good one think I&#x27;m just going to shave. I&#x27;d be willing to pay a lot more if I knew I was getting a decent product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;just bought the Oster fast feed, it cost a little more but wow, its well made! definitely a much higher quality and worth an extra $25. a pro model and came with the combs, it gave my beard a nice trim, I can tell its going to last a long time, Made in USA!</li>
            <li> Excelent product!  Lives up to the other reviews I&#x27;ve read.  Some say a lot of vibration, but I don&#x27;t notice any excessive vibration.&lt;br /&gt;Very powerful unit, just like a professional trimmer set.  Very sharp, does not pull your hair. The plastic stand for the trimmer and accessories is worthless.  You might as well have thrown melted plastic into the box with the trimmer. But the trimmer itself, YOU CAN&#x27;T BEAT IT!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this purchase. Item was inexpensive, and not junk, works great,&lt;br /&gt;much better than expected for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Coupled with the fact it is an American Made Product... I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
            <li> Overall a very good product.  It is very versatile and smooth. The only gripe:  changing the shaving heads requires some practice and care.  It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> A bit underpowered and doesn&#x27;t cut as fine as I would prefer (like a corded trimmer), but understandable. Convenience makes up for this shortcoming.&lt;br /&gt;Holds a charge for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Attachments are very useful.</li>
            <li> Had the first one for about 5 yrs and it was great. Just got a new one because one of the attachments locked up. Again after 5 yrs. This is a great product.</li>
            <li> Too many little pieces!!!!  You don&#x27;t even know what to do with them!!!  It is not practical. The good part of the story is that the item is wireless. It helps a lot!</li>
            <li> This thing is the BIGGEST PIECE of JUNK I have ever bought!!!! It ended up in the garbage, were JUNK belongs !!! Walgreens has a much better trimmer for half the price. DO NOT BUY or you will be SORRY !!!</li>
            <li> SO FAR SO GOOD.... HOPE IT WORKS.  I&#x27;VE HEARD GREAT THINGS ABOUT THE BRAND.  I BOUGHT IT AS A GIFT SO WE WILL SEE</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting the job done. I hope it holds out....</li>
            <li> Ordered this as a Christmas present, so I have not plugged it in to use it. But it was packaged well, arrived ahead of schedule. Appears to be good quality (does not seem to be cheaply made) Comes with a 5 year manufactures warranty.  Will update after the razor is actually used if there are any issues.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had quite a few trimmers over the years.  I have a sensitive face, and don&#x27;t like to shave every day, so between shaves I trim the stubble.  All my past trimmers had several problems.  They would occasionally pull hair instead of cutting it, the batteries wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge very long, the charge they would hold would diminish over time, and the motors seemed to lose some power.  Also, recommended charge time was typically 12 - 15 hours.  Of course that&#x27;s because all my old trimmers had NiMH batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I got the Wahl in December of 2011.  It&#x27;s lightweight, but you can really feel the power the first time you shave.  No pulling hair, just a nice, clean cut.  The first time you charge, they recommend charging for 1 hour.  This thing holds a charge great, too.  The Lithium Ion batteries are so much better!  I see more trimmers offer the Lithium batteries than they did a year ago, but not many in this price range.  I can&#x27;t say just how long the batteries last, but they seem to go on forever.  I keep thinking it must be ready to die soon, but it just keeps going.  So it&#x27;s easy to charge before it dies.  Forget about &#x27;battery memory&#x27; with Lithium, there isn&#x27;t any.  Any charge will do.  You don&#x27;t want to charge or discharge them too much, but Lithium batteries generally have built in safeguards against that happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few cons, but nothing worth taking off a star.  Other trimmers offer &amp;#34;lube for life&amp;#34;, meaning you never have to oil the blades.  You do need to oil the blades on this Wahl.  However, it&#x27;s pretty easy to put a drop or 2 of oil on the blades once a week, and it helps give a smooth shave.  I have a feeling the the oil free trimmers might be more for planned obsolescence.  Lubed for life, just a short life.  The storage &#x27;rack&#x27; is pretty cheap, and the pieces don&#x27;t fit all that great.  If you use it, don&#x27;t bump it.  I just keep my trimmer and accessories in a drawer cubby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this trimmer.  If you need different features, at least try to find a lithium or a trimmer that also works off AC while plugged in.</li>
            <li> It stopped working within a year.  it did not hold the charge even when it was working.  It is almost impossible to brush off the hairs from the body of the trimmer.  I don&#x27;t like paying for all of the combs and features that are not used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does worked &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; when it works. But the head needs to be wider for more coverage.</li>
            <li> Quick charge, good power, nice attachments.  It is working well...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this thing 2-3 times a week since I bought it, and it still works great!</li>
            <li> After my faithful Wahl beard trimmer finally died after 20 years of good service, I decided I&#x27;d look for something that did more than just trim beards - I wanted a combination trimmer that would also double as an electric razor.  This fails miserably at that task.  At best, it&#x27;ll make you look like you shaved 3 days ago.  As a beard trimmer, it&#x27;s great; but if I had it to do all over again, I&#x27;d have saved the money and just bought a trimmer.  Again - if you&#x27;re looking for an electric razor, look somewhere else.  After years of trusting the Wahl name, I&#x27;m disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Great price and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I have a thick beard and it cuts through it without issues.  The battery charge is quick and will last through two or three shaving sessions.  I haven&#x27;t used any of the accessories, but the trimmer itself works like it should.</li>
            <li> Rusted within a month. Stopped working completely after two.</li>
            <li> Good trimmer, does what it&#x27;s suppose to do. Holds a charge well but could use a charge indicator of some sort so you know when it&#x27;s ready to quit. I&#x27;d purchase it again if the need arose.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m sincerely surprised to see so many well received reviews here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;first of all, my razor came brand &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; from the store.  i used it as soon as i got home, and found a mass of tiny hairs inside the original clip.  i should have taken it back then, because this thing was clearly used in store or brought back because it didn&#x27;t work and just put back on the shelf by the target employees, or used at some point in shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s not the grossest thing in the world for sure, so i used it.  thankfully i was able to shave to my satisfaction before the charge died, which wasn&#x27;t long at all.  i chalked it up to it obviously being used.  the razor is also extremely loud and vibrates accordingly in the hand, not pleasant or comfortable at all.&lt;br /&gt;i tried plugging it into the wall and turning it back on, but it does not bypass the battery charge.  you have to use it charged only, and it takes much longer than a minute to charge a few seconds of use.  why this was designed this way is beyond me.  everyone has an outlet close to their bathroom mirror, you should be able to use the product plugged in or not, not solely on it&#x27;s poor battery power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;second time i used it, it wasn&#x27;t cutting nearly as well, and i knew i didn&#x27;t have much time before it died, so i had to apply more pressure to the skin and (which is of course my fault) cut myself.  thankfully it was nothing visible and stopped bleeding after a minute, but i was right to hurry because it did die very quickly.  very dissapointed.  this isn&#x27;t an item you want only sometimes working, especially if you need it for work, which was exactly the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;third time was the last straw.  it was plugged into a working outlet over night, and never turned back on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this product is manufactured garbage, and came used when bought new in store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this guy for a few years now and am very happy with it. Very reliable and an extremely quick charge. I use it to shave down to the stubble look as well as trim nose hairs and sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ou reason it doesn&#x27;t get a 5 is because the body hair foil is virtually useless. Tried it a few times and it did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li> Love it  Great grooming tool. cut my own Hair</li>
            <li> If you would like a trimmer that will leave you hanging half way through your morning shave, you have found the right one!  Mine held its first charge decently well, through probably 5 or 6 shaves I&#x27;d say?  But since that first charge ran out, I can&#x27;t seem to get a single shave out of this thing without it dying.  The blades on mine rusted just by being in the bathroom and getting steamy I think?  I did put one blade under the sink once when I got it, and that rusted in just a few days, but that was my fault.  The &amp;#34;3 minute quick charge&amp;#34; is nonexistent.  This fine morning I could get it to turn in for a few seconds at a time, so my shave was painful and eventually gave up to use my silly little &amp;#34;Gilette Pro Fusion Styler&amp;#34; thing that I got for 20$.  Seriously disappointing this thing.</li>
            <li> Small and compact.  Great little shaver for women and men.</li>
            <li> Works very well, easy to maintain, complete, reliable. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> Great shaver! Close &amp; precise!</li>
            <li> Great for \\&quot;whole\\&quot; body grooming. Wanted something that would be &#x27;safe&#x27; for using around the jewels. This is it!!! Cut fairly close without pulling or nicking and not too close that you have to worry about in-grown hairs. It is small and light weight. I would NOT use this in the shower or &#x27;with&#x27; water though. Battery life seems amazing to me. Like others stated about the grips... they are rubbery and attract hair. NOT cool... not a deal breaker though but will cause me to take a star off because of it. This still seems to be the best trimmer I have found yet. Came in less than 36 hours from order time via Amazon Prime too. All-in-all I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Works well but I&#x27;m not gonna unscrew and re-screw the clippers head just to shave my nose hairs. Make it easier to switch the clippers.</li>
            <li> Have used this razor now for several months.  It has stayed sharp and so long as I clean it properly, works as well as the day it was new.  It does a good job and has a number of useful attachments.</li>
            <li> After using it once or twice a month, it&#x27;s completely stopped working in under two years. That&#x27;s less than a few hours of total usage before failure. I expected this to last quite a bit longer.</li>
            <li> Seemed to work OK the first couple of weeks although it would pull hairs when using the attachments to trim my beard. The trimmer blade wasn&#x27;t as sharp as I thought after reading reviews here and various sites. Now the only things I will use is the Dual Shaver and Precision head because the trimmer and clipper painfully pulls hairs. I thoroughly read the instructions, watched the Wahl videos, cleaned and oiled the blades but the pulling is getting worse. Now I&#x27;m back to using my 5 year old cheap Norelco to trim because it doesn&#x27;t pull (go figure). Maybe this trimmer wasn&#x27;t meant for my beard so I&#x27;m going try other brands or just purchase another cheap Norelco. Gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because it might not be a good fit for my beard.</li>
            <li> good service, good price</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really add much more than what everyone else has already said in previous reviews. I owned the model before this one which is not a lot cheaper than this one, but still available. I had it anywhere from 6-10 years and still have it. It&#x27;s beat up and the battery won&#x27;t work unless I have it plugged in, but i can&#x27;t believe it still works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This purchase was an awesome upgrade from the latter. The blades and engine are smooth. It works just as I expected to do. I&#x27;m very happy and will purchase again if need be. However, i don&#x27;t expect this one to go out anytime soon considering I put the other whal through about 10 years and still use it for body shaving. It&#x27;s not perfect but it&#x27;s damn close for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why some people seem to not like it. Awfully picky if you ask me.</li>
            <li> Four and three quarter stars, actually.  The trimmer feels a little flimsy, thus the quarter star knock.  Usage proves the opposite.  This is a well built, durable, and comfortable trimmer.  It&#x27;s easy to control, the blade doesn&#x27;t pull on the whiskers, and the battery holds a charge almost forever ( not quite, but close).  Yes, whiskers do stick to the grip.  It&#x27;s not a big deal.  If it is - stay clean shaven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer was recommended by my business partner, who thought it was the best he&#x27;d ever owned.  He&#x27;s right - again.  This little trimmer has impressed me so much, that when I replace my dog grooming clippers this summer, I&#x27;m buying Wahl.</li>
            <li> I am a very happy camper with this excellent quality product. I would buy from here again . I use this trimmer every week.</li>
            <li> Great Item, very consistent, baterry never finishes</li>
            <li> This product is really mind blowing with the price I paid for.. I will recommend it to anyone who wanted to buy a trimmer for themselves or as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does what it is intended to do and comes with some extra add ons which you can use it depending on what Facial Hair style or hair style you want it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: 1) Good Trimmer from reputed company.&lt;br /&gt;2) Comes with additional Trim heads&lt;br /&gt;3) inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;4) Easiness&lt;br /&gt;5) Nice design&lt;br /&gt;6) Flexible and Durable&lt;br /&gt;7) Looks expensive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: 1) Have to use screw driver to remove default trim head and to put on other trim heads for Close shave&lt;br /&gt;2) Default Trim head needed an expertise to Shave close without leaving any itch or dents behind</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Wahl trimmer for about 3 weeks now, and it works just fine for what I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past I have always &amp;#34;clean-shaven&amp;#34; my whole face, but recently I grew tired of shaving and decided to grow a simple &amp;#34;Van Dyke&amp;#34; just to see if I liked it.  Turns out, as most people (besides me) could figure out, a Van Dyke or most any beard requires maintenance / regular trimming, or you end up looking like a homeless grizzly adams rather quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After doing lots of online shopping, I decided to take the plunge on this guy (Wahl Trimmer All-In-One Lithium Ion) as the price was right - I paid $24.95 at the time from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trimming with this thing is easy for me, and I know nothing about beards or beard &amp;#34;hygiene&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;The Wahl is perfect for cleaning up, trimming, and the little touch-ups I have to do every few days or so to keep from looking like a bum.  I&#x27;ve tried (but rarely use) most of the accessories and additional trimming / clipping / shaving heads, etc - but the ones I have experimented with work just as well as the &amp;#34;default&amp;#34; trimmer head that comes attached.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great not only for beards but for trimming just about anywhere, though I&#x27;m still too chicken to try the clipper blade for a self-clipped #2 haircut - I think I&#x27;ll stick with a cost-cutters type vendor for those.  But this kit works great for trimming just about everywhere else if you&#x27;re not into gorilla-type body hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One amazing thing - this trimmer arrived FULLY CHARGED - and I still haven&#x27;t had to plug in the charger.  The trimmer has been running just fine on a &amp;#34;factory charge&amp;#34; for 2-3 weeks now - (I am not making this up)&lt;br /&gt;a testament to:&lt;br /&gt;a) how little trimming I do with it&lt;br /&gt;b) how incredibly well it holds a charge.&lt;br /&gt; - I would expect any battery-powered device to trickle / lose it&#x27;s charge in a few days if not plugged in,&lt;br /&gt;but this little guy just keeps crankin&#x27; like the Energizer bunny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The default trimmer blade that comes attached can sometimes be a little bit of work to re-attach after cleaning, but if I&#x27;m careful to line it up correctly and most importantly, NOT FORCE it back on, it&#x27;s a minor issue.  All the other heads and attachments seem to snap on and off just fine, as long as, again, they&#x27;re not manhandled or forced on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary:  All in all this was a great purchase - $24.95 for what imo is a decent trimmer that doesn&#x27;t look or feel like cheap junk, and does exactly what I want it to do.  I am completely satisfied with the product and price.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This unit works great. Use it for shaving a few other applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couple of complaints:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The rubber grip attracts hair and dust and is a real pain to get off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) No battery indicator for charging or fully charged. Luckily it&#x27;s Li-ion so don&#x27;t have the problem with overcharging/having to fully charge every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) The tray is useless lol. Seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, really happy. I&#x27;ve realized with these trimmers that there is no one shaver to rule them, but this one has been my favorite so far. Have recommended to a friend or two and they love it as well.</li>
            <li> I have tried a Remington and Philips norelco trimmers in the past for beard and mustache maintainence. You will get the best lines with this product period!! The blades are really sharp on every attachment. The battery life also is very impressive about 3 hours and the charging time is about an hour. Don&#x27;t waste your money on other trimmers when this one has it all !</li>
            <li> the stand that is designed to be for this model and attachments, was not the stand sent. i cant put all the attachments in an orderly fashion as pictured. disappointed but not worth the bother to return. i. handicapped and too much 4 me to getto p[ost office, but i have learned to buy local, since my recent purchases have been disapointing</li>
            <li> This item does what it is supposed to do, I do not use it very long each time I need it so it just sits there forever in a charged state ready to be used without needing to be charged again.</li>
            <li> the versatility is excellent. the quality is also very good. I recommend the product to anyone. I use it on a weekly basis</li>
            <li> This is really the best all-in-one beard trimmer out there for this price and even better than some more expensive products out there. I&#x27;ve charge it once and used it at least 10 times or so on my thick beard, trimming my head hair, and on some body hair and it still doesn&#x27;t need to be charged. The fine-toothed blades are also nice to keep you skin from getting as irritated if at all. The trimmer has plenty of accessories to cover multiple uses, and the shaving attachment actually works surprisingly well. It catches hair decently well and doesn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive skin on my neck. Even the expensive razors and shaving cream don&#x27;t prevent the irritation on my neck, but this little attachment works. I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the problems. First, the stand that this comes with is a joke. It&#x27;s not even the one pictured on the box or in stock photos of the trimmer. It&#x27;s terrible. It won&#x27;t even hold all the accessories. The stand is super cheap quality. It&#x27;s almost like they outsourced the stand production to another company that didn&#x27;t even know what they were making it for. The rubber handle has so much &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; to it that hair sometimes clings to it. It can be dusted off, but still, it&#x27;s kind of annoying for a trimmer that isn&#x27;t waterproof. And finally there&#x27;s that. This would be the perfect trimmer if it was waterproof, but it&#x27;s not. I would gladly pay more for this if it just had some type of water resistance...and a decent stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that said, it&#x27;s a great trimmer and I recommend it despite its shortcomings, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> i wanted a trimmer with a long lasting battery and professional results ,and this fit the bill perfectly! i am completely satisfied with this product!</li>
            <li> My brother had one and I loved it so I bought myself one. It is so powerful it always gets the job done with out any hang ups or clogs or bogging down. It stays charged forever just about. There really is no comparision and Ive tried them all.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works really well. Just make sure to oil the blade every now and then. The charge lasts awhile too.</li>
            <li> I thought my last trimmer was bad,  I used this trimmer one time and it stopped working.  Do not buy this trimmer!!!!</li>
            <li> This will be my first review ever on Amazon. First off, I was looking to replace my Remington Trimmer which was a piece of trash and for the strangest reason I stuck with it for like 2yrs. I came to amazon to look for something decent that can give me a close stubble trim. I was very hesitant because of various reviews on different products talking about how it&#x27;s hard to get a close stubble trim. One day I&#x27;ve finally gather the nerve to purchase this product cause of the Lithium recharge and the other attachments that comes with it. The order came very fast(I.E. I order it wednesday and got it friday).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first time having it in my hands, it felt very firm like and sturdy like they took the time out to make this product. The default attachment worked very good on giving me a clean stubble look! The motor is very strong, the battery has a very long charge on it and it don&#x27;t take little to no time to charge. The Shaver attachment is useless for the most part, the detail attachment works pretty good also. I&#x27;ve found the key to getting a very close trim that doesn&#x27;t even look like a stubble look. Use the \\&quot;T\\&quot; attachment! I&#x27;ve use a buddy T blade clippers before on my face and It came out so nice like I just shaved. If you&#x27;re like me who have this super sensitive skin and can&#x27;t shave with no type of razor then I would suggest this Wahl with the T blade and I can promise you will not be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also trim my mustache and half gotee really good also!&lt;br /&gt;I Recommend this product if someone wants to replace their 2-5yr old Beard &amp; mustache trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;Very Strong, Very Versatile.</li>
            <li> Have done my own head-shaving for years now. Hardly use any of the accessories. Charges quickly and maintains its charge very well. Excellent results. Enjoy not having to deal with the cord-tangle issues.</li>
            <li> Worked great ...the first 4 times. It took a charge twice then quit working. Worst is it doesnt even work as a corded charger. It will come on for about 15 seconds. I thought with Wahl I was getting something of quality. Definitely not the case here. Bummed.</li>
            <li> This thing is very powerful, and loud when the battery is fully charged.  My trick is to not keep it fully charged.  When fully charged, it sounds like a low flying plane against your face, then as the battery drains switches to like a broken coffee grinder, further drain it continues to get quieter until it stops working, which is bad for the battery.  So the trick is to charge it somewhere between the coffee grinder and stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with more attachments than I&#x27;ll ever need.  It&#x27;s a shame my old wahl attachments don&#x27;t work with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks like price has dropped by 5 bucks since I bought it in aug 12.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son and he says he loves it.</li>
            <li> Trimmer blades on the ones I got would actually cut you or grab the skin. Used my old blades from my dead one.</li>
            <li> Lightweight, easy to handle. Perfect for a variety of shaving needs. My husband is very pleased with quality and results</li>
            <li> I really like the trimmer and accessories. My only disappointment is that both the photo and product description indicated that it would come with a base to hold the trimmer and accessories, mine came with a travel bag not the base. If I had known this I may have picked a different trimmer as I very rarely travel and prefer for home use to have a base rather then a travel bag. This is the only reason my review was four stars and not five. Maybe someone could update the web site information to reflect what is currently included by the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dennis Necker.</li>
            <li> He really likes this, I had to replace his old one and they didnt make it anymore so I got this one.  It has plenty of power which he likes.  but he doesnt like all the different heads and how flimsy the base is.  They are always falling all over the place because they are not secured in the base at all.  He doesnt use them all and would rather have a sturdier base with fewer accessories that snap in and stay put.  Otherwise he is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I have had 3 trimmers over the past 30 years, 2 Wahls and 1 Panasonic.  This is the best of the bunch.  It has more power, trims better and holds a charge longer than any of the others.  The only slight downside is the rubber gripping area is &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; and hair sticks to it.  You can wipe most of the hair off with a towel, so I still gave it a 5.  Mark E</li>
            <li> Great trimmer.  Excellent power and battery life, nice selection of heads.  The rubber grip is very sticky and consequently collects ALL clippings.  Beware, it makes a mess!</li>
            <li> quick ship.  unit works as described.x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x</li>
            <li> I love the razor, very smooth, very quality and battery is SOOO great!  I charged the razor and went away for 3 weeks and forgot the charger and it stayed alive the whole time!</li>
            <li> Does everything I want it to effortlessly and is high quality.</li>
            <li> Good trimmer, long lasting with no problems. Nice attachments.</li>
            <li> The lithium ion battery I think is the advantage of this product over comparable product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with some of the reviewers. The accessories are one too many for the same application. I think that it would make this product stand out if for example a dedicated nose and ear hair trimmer was included instead of 3 plastic guides for the same application. The detail trimmer that is suggested to use as a nose and ear hair trimmer is not only awkward to use but may also cut not just hair. The installation and removal of the accessory trimer&#x27;s to the base, especially the 2 metal ones needs some improvement or modification, in my opinion. Overall 3 stars mostly for the lithium battery.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my son who wanted to keep his hairline clean in between haircuts.  This little tool does the trick and is sometimes stolen by my husband to do some beard and facial hair trimming as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this in January, I use it only to trim my goatee like every 2 or 3 weeks. So after basically a half dozen uses the motor will no longer move any of the blades. I checked the charger output and its putting out the 4.2 volts so the failure is in the motor. Not very happy with this, my wahl hair trimmers have been working for over ten  years trimming my boys and my hair. I really expected better from Wahl.</li>
            <li> this Wahi Lithium Lon in one Trimmer w as a gift and it works for me really good and all the other combs are just the job for cutting and trimming</li>
            <li> The man who this was purchased for has an incredibly strong beard and it grows like a weed.  This little trimmer has more than made up for its compact size.  I am really happy to have made this purchase.</li>
            <li> This Trimmer works GREAT! The Lithium battery in it holds a charge for hours. All the different head attachments let you do just about anything you need to do to trim; whether it be you Mustache, Beard, Sideburns, Neck or any hair that needs trimming. It shaves Real Close, even has a Shaver Attachment, though it&#x27;s small it does a Great Job TOO. You&#x27;d be happy to own one of these, I am. I&#x27;ve had mine for 3 years with NO PROBLEMS...</li>
            <li> Stopped working completely after a few charges.</li>
            <li> Going for the record for longest owner review! I&#x27;ve had this wahl lithium trimmer for 4 years, and have been very pleased. I&#x27;m pretty picky and use it alot, about once a week, and i&#x27;ve been through many other types. this is the best i&#x27;ve found for me.&lt;br /&gt; First off, I&#x27;ll tell you what I use it for: I shave my head often, I&#x27;ve used both heads with no guard and both short guards, all work well and cut at different lengths. and I trim my beard, usually short, the beard cutting head/guards work well, but i prefer to use the larger (wider) head, just because it goes faster. I also use the foil shaving head on my neck occasionally, and it seems great too. I haven&#x27;t used this to cut any other types of hair so i can&#x27;t comment on how it works for that.&lt;br /&gt; i&#x27;ve taken this trimmer to many different places i&#x27;ve lived, other countries, and even on a cross country bicycle trip (to keep me from looking like a total bum).  the lithium power is really what makes it worth it, cuts quickly, and i don&#x27;t have to always keep charging it.&lt;br /&gt; I eventually had a problem with it holding a charge after about 3 years. i was discouraged and thought it had finally bit the dust.  i thought it was the battery so i sent it to wahl with the charger, and a few weeks later they returned it, I think with a new charger, under warranty, and it&#x27;s been great ever since. Their customer service is very good. I recently called to order a new head that had been lost. I was on hold for 10-15 minutes, but the rep that answered was very helpful, knowledgeable and clearly communicated everything. I bought the head for 10 dollars and she sent me two guards for free.&lt;br /&gt; Biggest drawback for me has been keeping track of all the heads and guards. I&#x27;ve never been able to put them back in a back or container after i use them, and with a lot of traveling, I often misplace them in bags and eventually lost two guards. I wish there was a way to not need them, but i tried a new trimmer with fully adjustable one-piece head, and it worked terribly for very short haircuts (uneven). I did discover i can take a wire or paperclip and run it through holes in all the guards, that helps keep them together some.&lt;br /&gt; So, it&#x27;s been a great item for me, serves its function well, and i don&#x27;t have to worry about it. hopefully i can write another review after four more years.</li>
            <li> I am a female and i bought this to use on my bikini area. It works great! I had a battery operated handheld one but, this one is so much better and such a closer shave. I think my dad would try to steal it from me if he knew how good it works and all the different things it does.</li>
            <li> The product met my expectations. It has many attachments and meets any of your grooming needs. Happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I hardly ever write negative reviews -- I rarely need to -- but this product is so disappointing I want to let other shoppers know about it.  I purchased this item because I remembered Wahl as one of the premier names in hair grooming products and I was replacing a much less elaborate Wahl trimmer that had given me more that ten years of good service.  I initially noticed (as several other reviews have mentioned) that the accessories were EXTREMELY difficult to put on and off.  Once I managed to attach a beard guide (not my first choice but the first one I was able to attach after three or four tries) and began shaving I noticed that the trimmed hairs stuck to the body of the unit.  Not just attached but STUCK with the strength of velcro.  Then I picked it up a few days ago and the blades ran rough and jerked my beard hairs instead of cutting them.  I noticed a rattling sound so I removed the beard guide to clean the blades -- and some sort of clip fell out of the unit.  But the rattling sound continues so I have no idea what else is floating around inside waiting to fall out.  My bottom line: I purchased this unit 10/29/2014 and today is 3/6/2015 (just four months ago allowing for delivery time) and have used it lightly no more than once a week.  There are some pros I could talk about and some more cons I could add but when a product stops working after four months the rest really doesn&#x27;t matter.  I have read the offers from Wahl to call and follow up on the warranty but honestly I have so little faith in this product and this company I don&#x27;t think I would take a replacement at any price.</li>
            <li> I have had this for 3 years, battery is still great, no issues.  Love made in america quality.  No issues with rust, use oil on it every week or so.</li>
            <li> I promptly charged its battery, as directed, and it is still going strong two weeks later!  I don&#x27;t use it every day, but it is nice not having to plug it in, like my last one once the battery no longer held a charge.</li>
            <li> It works great when it&#x27;s new! It has attachments of all varieties - any hair length from stubble to mighty-beardy. Also has smaller trimmer attachment for the nose and ear holes that works great! The electric-razor attachment seems to work pretty s***tily or maybe I&#x27;m just not good at using it? I had one for a about 5 years and the rechargeable battery died; I could no longer recharge it. Why can&#x27;t they be made with replaceable batteries? Pretty sure this is planned obsolescence. When this one dies, I think I will try to DIY a replacement battery into the thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this a couple of months and keep giving it a chance to prove me wrong. It hasn&#x27;t. It pulls on my hair, especially where it is shorter near the neck. I&#x27;ve gotten to the point that I&#x27;m afraid to use it. It also needs to be charged after almost every use to work effectively. It doesn&#x27;t seem to hold enough for much more than one cutting. It does an OK job at evening out the beard but it&#x27;s nothing to write home about. Try something else.</li>
            <li> I use the Wahl Trimmer on my full beard.  It keeps its edge, and is fast and easy to use.  My beard looks better since I made the switch to Wahl, with a clean even look that I like.  Judging from the sound, the motor is powerful and the battery holds its charge.  When I do need to recharge it takes very little time to be up to full.  Its small enough to take on trips and I don&#x27;t have to think about it much which is a good thing.</li>
            <li> pulls from time to time, but the reviews were largely correct</li>
            <li> Surprised that the blades aren&#x27;t sharper, haven&#x27;t tried other attachable blades to see if they are better yet. Hopefully they work better</li>
            <li> Worked out of the box.  So many attachments I don&#x27;t know what to do with them all.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> This is a great personal trimmer that covers all hair and beard trimming needs at a great price and a quality close to commercial trimmers. Best of all it is made in the US with GTEAT MATERIALS. dO not waste your money on any other product like I did in the past.</li>
            <li> Makes a clean cut for the 19 yr old son. He likes the different options.&lt;br /&gt;If you have a lot of thick beard it may not be your choice as a primary tool but would be great for styling.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how long this little guy has been plugging away at the thankless task of managing my facial hair, but thanks to Amazon keeping track, I see that I&#x27;ve owned my Wahl Trimmer for just over three years. It&#x27;s a pretty sweet little workhorse - always reliable and holds a good charge for a long time even after a long time on the shelf. I honestly can&#x27;t remember the last time I charged it. I once let my beard grow, completely untamed for over six months. When it came time to prune it back, my Wahl was ready with a charge even though it sat, neglected, in my medicine cabinet for half a year. That&#x27;s reliable.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, this past week I dropped my Wahl onto my bathroom sink from a height of just a few feet and the head popped off. I&#x27;ve been trying for days, but I&#x27;ve been unable to reassemble the spring and whatnot, and I&#x27;m usually pretty good at fixing such things. The user manual doesn&#x27;t go into any detail about reassembling a dropped trimmer. I can&#x27;t even find a YouTube video about putting this particular model back together. So it looks like I&#x27;m out of luck on this one, but it had a pretty good run until my own clumsiness did it in. Goodbye, faithful friend.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice trimmer and it trims quite nicely. The charge lasts a long time and my hair dresser girlfreind thinks it is a good quality product.</li>
            <li> Shaver stopped working after 3 months. Turn the switch on and nothing happens.</li>
            <li> I bought this product 5 months ago and now it will not hold a charge, even if it&#x27;s used while attached to the charger. It&#x27;s junk.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Wahl Lithium All in One Trimmer for my husband, it is wonderful.  The charge holds forever and that is a big deal around here because the more expensive ones we have purchased die way too soon and take forever to charge again.  This one cuts so smoothly and is excellent for the price.  I am a hairstylist and I am going to order one to use for my customers neck trims, etc., it’s perfect and light to hold, not heavy like other brands and very quite.</li>
            <li> It stop working after 1 day</li>
            <li> This trimmer is very easy to use.  It holds a charge for an amazing amount of time - long enough to take it on a short trip without even bringing the charger.  The attachments are easy to change and all work as advertised.</li>
            <li> This is the best I ever had. Replaced 20 year old unit.&lt;br /&gt;This is very light and maneuverable.</li>
            <li> Very slick and comes with own stand. However, very noisy which is a price to pay for the lightweight design of the trimmer.</li>
            <li> I bought this set while I was serving overseas and it worked wonders. I was able to do virtually anything that I needed to do with clippers. Great buy!!</li>
            <li> After only a few uses, the battery in the trimmer would no longer retain a charge. Even when plugged in, the trimmer would run two seconds and quit operating until the on/off switch was turned off and on again ... then repeat every two seconds.</li>
            <li> Works great but price was a little high. Same product at Costco, with a slightly lower price.  I should of shopped around a little more.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waist your money. stopped working after 1 week. would not take charge. invest few more bucks and get something better.</li>
            <li> I just got this for my beard and it does everything so far.</li>
            <li> Trimmer works fine. Handle gathers hair and it sticks like glue. Too many attachments. Otherwise it is ok. The heads are easy to change,</li>
            <li> I bought mine 14 months ago (my first Wahl product and my first trimmer ever), and have used it about once a month since then, sometimes twice. I get my hair cut short monthly, and use this 2 weeks later to trim my neck hair, and once in a while for some manscaping. Before that I&#x27;d always used the trimmer on my electric razors.&lt;br /&gt;I only use it for about 2-6 minutes at a time. Last week when I tried to trim my neck, the battery died before I could finish. I thought maybe it needed charging, so i plugged it in overnight. Next day as I finished my neck, the battery was running down again. I fully charged it, turned it on and timed it. I got 3 minutes 6 seconds until it was completely dead, and the last 45 seconds or so it was running so slow it would have been virtually unusable.&lt;br /&gt;I have always fully charged it before each use since it had likely been sitting for weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So even if you figure 15 minutes a month over 14 months (worst possible scenario), that&#x27;s only 4.5 hours of use and it&#x27;s worn out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did seem to work well while it lasted, rarely snagging hair, which is VERY important when manscaping! I tried using a depth attachment a couple times to trim my leg and chest hair (not thick at all), but found them fairly ineffective. I didn&#x27;t find it to be excessively loud as others have complained about. My Braun razor [[ASIN:B003YJAZZE Braun Series 7-760cc Pulsonic Shaver System, Black and Silver]] is louder, my Norelco [[ASIN:B000PKNPES Philips Norelco arcitec 1050 Men&#x27;s Shaver]] quieter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this response from Wahl on another review, so I&#x27;ll call Wahl and see what they&#x27;ll do about this defective item:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;We stand behind our product - we have a 5 Year Warranty and a \\&quot;no hassle\\&quot; customer service department ready to help fix whatever problem you may have. Wahl stands behind their product.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recall that it had a 5 year warranty - that&#x27;s a long time. Unfortunately, there seem to be a huge number that don&#x27;t make it past 1½ years. Meanwhile, my clock-radio that had a 1-year warranty has been going strong for more than 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Called Wahl today and the lady offered to email a prepaid return label. When I asked if I could have a replacement sent immediately if I paid with a credit card, she said I could do that too, and return the old one after the new one arrived. This should have been offered as an option by the lady so I could receive a replacement faster, but it wasn&#x27;t. I only knew to ask about that because of the response from a Wahl employee to another reviewer&#x27;s issue. However I&#x27;m going to print the label and return the old one first anyway.&lt;br /&gt;At least there was no quibbling about purchase date or proof of purchase. I asked if the battery had been upgraded, because there&#x27;s a LOT of complaints about it, and she just said that improvements are made as the engineers feel is necessary, and she was unaware if the battery had been improved (Obviously not-see below).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 12/3/14:&lt;br /&gt;For the past few months the battery would only hold a charge for about 2 days. So that&#x27;s 2 dead razors now due to battery problems in less than 3 years, and these are supposed to have a 5-year warranty. What a horrible joke! There should be a mandatory recall because owners of this model got screwed!&lt;br /&gt;HEY WAHL, SEND ME A REPLACEMENT THAT WON&#x27;T DIE IN LESS THAN A YEAR! I DO NOT want another one of this model, or any other that uses the same or similar battery. Better change you warranty to 1 year, because your product often fails to even meet that!io that had a 1-year warranty has been going strong for more than 10 years.

            <li> Look elsewhere; this is low quality junk diminishing the strong Wahl brand.  Flimsy trim heads that fall off, cheap construction, noisy motor, and then it died halfway through a trim.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome trimmer kit.  I don&#x27;t use all the attachments, but I like having them available to use.  It&#x27;s great for sideburn and eyebrow cleanup in between haircuts at the barber.</li>
            <li> I replaced a plug in trimmer that died with this and like it.  There are only two cons. First is that the cut hair seems to stick to the surface of the trimmer.  Wiping it off is difficult but I found that blowing away the hair works best.  Second concern is that taking off the trimmer guards (one in particular) is a little difficult.  The plastic tab that you have to lift up to pop it off is not as rigid as needed and instead of popping off easily, it bends.  Minor inconvenience only when changing guards.  Otherwise, glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this, but had to return it, it&#x27;s very sturdy and my skin is very sensitive, I liked the built quality but its not for me ! thanks Amazon for your amazing return policy!</li>
            <li> Ive had 3 of these over the years, and theyre still the best value trimmer. Occasionally Ill see professional stylists using the same model.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second one of these. After about 5 years, the battery finally died on my old one and I use this 2-3 times per week. I was so happy with my previous one, it was very easy to buy another one. I actually was happy to see they still have the same model.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for the price and perfect for travel. I do wish it came with a case though.</li>
            <li> Pro&#x27;s:  Great Quality.  Trims great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  The handle acts like a magnet to the hairs you trim and sticks to it.  I do not like having to use a screw driver to change the head attachments.</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer in January 2013. I only used it for trimmer my sideburns and touching up the sides of my hair. I barely got around 20 uses from the trimmer before it completely stopped working. I can&#x27;t tell if it won&#x27;t charge or if the trimmer itself won&#x27;t work regardless of a charge. Not pleased at all by the quality of this trimmer.</li>
            <li> A real disappointment. usually Wahl products are fine.&lt;br /&gt;the trimmer worked fine for a while, though it is not really powerful.&lt;br /&gt;after a year of use (about 6 uses - every other month) the battery started to show sign of problems and the trimmer worked for less than 10 minutes after 10 hours charge.&lt;br /&gt;18 months after purchase, with 10 times that the trimmer was used, it stopped working. After full charge (12 hours) the trimmer starts and shut down after less than 20 sec...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;switching back to a trimmer with an electric cord.</li>
            <li> This is just ... quite simply .... the best trimmer in the world ... period. It charges completely in an hour .... and holds a charge for weeks. I shave my head and spend more time doing that than just trimming my mustache and beard and it still holds a charge for weeks ... plus it is self sharpening ... I have used the electric razor attachment but I prefer the shave I get with a blade. Buy this trimmer you will love it.</li>
            <li> Great shaving kit. Works really well.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is that I&#x27;ve had it for a short time, and the blades are already rusting!&lt;br /&gt;But that might be my fault for poor maintenance.</li>
            <li> Purchased this as a replacement for the body groom which served me for over 5 years. Everything about this product is below average to blatantly lacking ability to perform the task which it was designed for. Charging sucks, blade changes suck, battery life sucks, and to to things off it wont hold a charge anymore. The Wahl clippers I use to shave my head have persevered without a hiccup for several years. Wish this product would have performed half as well....[[ASIN:B001GQ3GEY Wahl Lithium Ion All In One Trimmer]]</li>
            <li> I could not find the refund, replacement and return systems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it 2month ago. I don&#x27;t why is not working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like to replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where can I contact?</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give an accurate description or account of this product because I have not used it yet. I&#x27;m sure it will be outstanding.</li>
            <li> Almost. 1 item I&#x27;d like to see to get the 5th star. Needs an indication on either the trimmer or the charger that shows if it is actually charging and if charging is complete. Otherwise great, torque and battery life especially, and better than the several Norelco units I&#x27;ve had previously.</li>
            <li> I USE THIS AS A PERSONAL TRIMMER IT DOSE A GREAT JOB FOR ME . I HAVE A BARBER FRIEND THAT CUTS MY HAIR FOR ME HE LOVES MINE SO MUCH I HAVE TO ORDER ONE FOR HIM ! !</li>
            <li> The battery life on this trimmer is so far outstanding, and the quality of the trimmer itself seems very good. As someone else noted, the grip handle is incredibly good at hanging onto hair clippings, but it&#x27;s not a huge problem. The stand, however, has got to be the most annoying stand I&#x27;ve seen with one of these trimmers. I realize pretty much every relatively inexpensive all-in-one trimmer has an annoying stand, but this stand seems to eject every attachment if you even look at it wrong.</li>
            <li> I use this on my head, face cheeks, eye brows, arms, legs, chest and goatee.&lt;br /&gt;Works great, love the run time, I had the previous version with NiCad battery, this one is much better.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t run stronger, just much much longer.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product, been in use for a few weeks now...</li>
            <li> Excellent beard trimmer for the money...  Don&#x27;t have much use for the haircut pieces included, but &amp;#34;all&amp;#34; of the pieces included for trimming a beard are excellent, including the actual trimming razor...  Very pleased!</li>
            <li> WOW, works like a charm. Worth every penny. Trim hair, ears, nose. etc, work great, long time between charges,feels great in your hand.</li>
            <li> Lots of power. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Much improved over my old trimmer.  Took this one to England for two weeks and it held its charge.</li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for.  received in perfect condition</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s up there with my other Wahl clippers. Packs quite the punch. I used to have to charge my old clipper for hours just before needing to use it. This one doesn&#x27;t seem to run out of juice after the 3rd trim. The package is complete and has all you&#x27;d need to groom yourself</li>
            <li> These clippers are pretty much better than sliced bread</li>
            <li> Great product! Works great for all the necessary trimming on the face and head.</li>
            <li> I am VERY happy with this product. I&#x27;ve had it for a year or two. Battery life is excellent. It is a bit loud, particularly when you&#x27;re near (or in) your ears, but it&#x27;s not terrible. The beard guides are #1, #2, and #3; that&#x27;s 1/8\\&quot;, 1/4\\&quot;, and 3/8\\&quot;, respectively. I just had my beard trimmed professionally today for the first time (I&#x27;ve had a beard for almost 40 years), and she recommended a #4; I asked for #5, which worked out well. #3 is just too short, but of course that&#x27;s just my opinion. I checked Wahl on-line, and I didn&#x27;t see more attachments for the 9560. If you&#x27;re okay with #3 or less, then I can&#x27;t recommend this trimmer highly enough.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised - only problem was had to eliminate some of the accessory items to get them to fit on the stand. Not a biggie since would not use some of them anyway.</li>
            <li> I like this little trimmer,shaver,groomer,I&#x27;m a hairy guy and it keeps me cleaned up,Anywhere you have hair this Wahl trimmer has an attachment to take care of it.</li>
            <li> I already had this trimmer,,but the battery stopped holding a decent charge. Not an expensive item so I decided just to order another one.&lt;br /&gt;Received it as a gift after I place my order so I had to return the item.&lt;br /&gt;While it worked it was very good.&lt;br /&gt;The warranty is for 5 years from the manufacturer. If I had sent it in for a replacement or repair I would have been without a trimmer for who knows how long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a neanderthal. I just needed it to remove nose and eyebrow hair and maybe keep my wife&#x27;s play ground clean but when it arrived the instructions basically said be careful not to shave your eyebrows off cause theres no guide. Also in the manual it describes the handy rotary nose hair trimmer that,OOOPS! isn&#x27;t included. PFFT! Sent it back. Maybe it will be good for someones back hair.</li>
            <li> trim around my ears until I gt haircut.....trim all the hair on my neck and looks clean and neat all the time--thanks</li>
            <li> This is a great quality, light weight, powerful trimmer for personal use.  The lithium battery is awesome!  The blade detachment design is different, but very easy once you learn how it works...don&#x27;t fear that.  It&#x27;s hard to find functional, reasonably priced trimmers, so this one was a nice surprise to recieve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s true there are lots of attachments, but my only &#x27;dink&#x27; here is that this lacks a charging light.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> this is a piece of garbage.  first off, clearly amazon doesn&#x27;t check their returns before they resend it out to a new customer because mine had fingerprints all over the chrome (which i sterilized before using).  secondly, I got a little water splash on the blade and a week later i saw rust! like other reviewers said, the clips are fragile, and even while gently trying to remove it, the whole head came off with the attachment.  I threw it out immediately since it was past return and needed a trim up before an event.  Switched to the norelco vacuum trimmer and absolutely love it. i&#x27;m glad some people found use for this, but i agree with the negative reviews, DO NOT BUY PLEASE.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to use this when I bought it, but I do have a couple of complaints. To be clear, it works well and all, but the rubber grip is a horrible choice for a beard trimmer. Hair gets stuck to it constantly, and you have to wipe it down with a wet cloth in order to get all the hair off. Furthermore, the shortest guard keeps pulling my hair. I usually have to go one size bigger for that not to happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the way it cuts and even a newer Norelco trimmer that I got doesn&#x27;t cut as good as this Wahl does, but the rubber grip drives crazy.</li>
            <li> I used to own a Panasonic beard and moustache trimmer.  I loved it.  Eventually the battery died and it is too old to replace.  I searched and searched for replacement trimmer.  I settled on this one.  It is GOOD.  It is not great, it is good.  It works and is fairly easy to use.  I&#x27;m not in love with the snapping on and off of the trimmer guards and combs.  Kind of low rent, of you know what I mean.  A bunch of attachment and even a wider trimmer than the body of the unit.  All in all... a good product and I recommend it, but not a great product the I would give as a gift.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend spending the extra money and getting a nicer one.  That being said, this trimmer works alright for the money you spend.  If you have thick hair it takes really long to cut all of it.  My husband takes twice as long using this to shave than he does with a razor which was very disappointing.  With the trimmer (and thick hair) you have to move/cut your hair slowly or it pulls hair instead of cutting it.  I wish I&#x27;d bought a more expensive/better trimmer but I tried to go cheap. :/</li>
            <li> Works better than others I had and lasts a&lt;br /&gt;Long time between charges. Excellent product</li>
            <li> This product has two busts to it.&lt;br /&gt;1) This trimmer hurts whenever I do trim with the open trimmer piece. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m using it wrong, which I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m not, but it pulls the hairs out when I&#x27;m trimming. It&#x27;s annoying as hell and I&#x27;ve stopped using the trimmers after the second use. I&#x27;m definitely going to look for another pair of trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The clipper oil is only sufficient enough for about two months of use. The other part to that is there is no replacing the oil unless it&#x27;s wahl&#x27;s oil. So I can&#x27;t go out and buy clipper oil because it&#x27;ll damage the blades. Then I&#x27;ll have to spend money and purchase Wahl&#x27;s oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all I was not satisfied with this product at all!! Stay away spend a bit more money on real quality.</li>
            <li> Works great. I the Lithium Ion battery, it lasts a very long time on a charge. Trimmer keeps my beard at a even length. Has many attachments.</li>
            <li> Not very powerful.  It can hardly cut properly, so it pulls on the hair before it cuts.  Do not purchase.</li>
            <li> I love it I used it to trim and shave my beard and to clip my head, the battery is amazing.</li>
            <li> Basic and easy. I´m happy with it.</li>
            <li> real nice trimmer, great machine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned Wahl clippers before and when I say clippers I mean clipper because when you buy Wahl it&#x27;s for life. First of all let me start by saying that the price is unbeatable, how did I pay under $50 for this? I had about 3 months worth of beard growth and after using 2 attachments I was back to a nice smooth facade (the lady definitely appreciated that). The only issue that I had initially was the removal of the heads which after finding this very informative video by Wahl I was able to figure it out:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;bbqR2xSbUQM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other set of clippers that I have is over 10 years old and is still giving premium cuts. I love this company and the quality can&#x27;t be beat, God Bless the USA and American manufacturers like Wahl!</li>
            <li> I love this! Had an older Wahl product quit on me and bought this to use in the interim, while I sent the broken one in for repair to Wahl Corp. Love it! The battery system is great - long lasting but they always seem to quit when you are in the middle of something. This one charges in just 5 minutes to a charge that has MORE than allowed me to finish my beard/goatee/moustache trimming I was in the middle of when the battery ran out. Wahl replaced my broken one (well done Wahl!) and although I am using the replacement, I really like this new all-in-one trimmer and will use it repeatedly for many years.</li>
            <li> I purchased my trimmer on Tuesday, October 28, 2014 and received it on Thursday, October 30, 2014. I have used it every few days since then to trim my mustache. It was smooth, quiet and did the job well. I have used it once to trim my beard. It works just fine. However tonight, Tuesday, December 9, 2014 it started making a noise like, as one reviewer put it, a mini chain saw. I tightened the two screws on the blade but that did not fix the problem. I do not intend using it again. I had already purchased another trimmer for Christmas for my son. I&#x27;m dreading giving him that as a present since another reviewer has had a similar problem.  I have used Wahl for years and was pleased with my last trimmer. It lasted 10 years. I like the lithium battery but am highly disappointed in having the trimmmer go on the fritz so soon after I purchased it. How can something with a 5 year warranty last only one month and a half? Had it not been for it suddenly becoming unusable I would have given this product 5 stars. One star is too high for a product only lasting one and a half months.    Update on Jan 8, 2015. I finally figured what went wrong. The clipper insert broke. There is a metal piece (spring) on the back side of the clipper attachment which broke. I didn&#x27;t have to unscrew the phillips head screws, I just needed to pull off the whole head. I noticed a metal piece on the bathroom counter, and it was from the attachment. I ordered the part from www.wahl-store.com and inserted it into the handle (the battery operated thing) and the clippers work great now. The part I ordered is WAH 59300-800. It&#x27;s listed in the written material as part # 59300. I&#x27;m still upset that this clipper head broke after only 6 weeks, however the fix was relatively inexpensive. The part I ordered cost $7.50 plus $5.95 postage and handling. I ordered two and my total bill was $20.95. I&#x27;m not changing my rating since I have purchased a different brand clipper in the mean time. I just thought it appropriate to update my review. So, If the clipper ever sounds like a mini chain saw and doesn&#x27;t clip well at all, it just might be the blade portion and a fix is relatively easy.</li>
            <li> Barely acceptable for occasional use.  Pinches skin drawing blood -- rare but not pleasant!  Very loud making it uncomfortable to trim close to the ears.  Does not hold charge very long.</li>
            <li> Totally Satisfied! . . . Great Bang for the Buck!! . .  Highly Recommended !!!</li>
            <li> Both blade attachments would snag/pull at my beard during trimming. After using it just once I returned it.</li>
            <li> best trimmer I got !!!</li>
            <li> Love it. Has a lot more power than the standard Ni-cad on. Only downside is hair sticks to the rubber like a magnet. It has to be blown off, can&#x27;t brush it off.</li>
            <li> Good trimming initially, lots of attachments. Blades rusted even with oiling. Blade replacement cost almost $10 each plus S&amp;H from Wahl, making this a 6 month then throw away item.    Updated 01/24/2015    Customer service from Wahl was excellent in replacing the rusted blades. However, it was stressed that these blades are not water or moisture friendly, so even if you oil them, keep the blades outside of the areas you wash, bathe, shower.  Upgrading the review to 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Read great reviews on this trimmer but have had nothing but problems. The cut is poor and it skips more hairs than would be expected... even little peach fuzz on the neck. Its almost like it does not cut at all. Disappointed in this wahl product.</li>
            <li> This worked alright while it lasted. Nice grip and cut like it was supposed to. It went a year and a half with perhaps weekly use before the motor went out. I perhaps would have hoped for better, but it&#x27;s not too bad.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase of these trimmers.</li>
            <li> Hubby loves it! He uses it every few days and has to charge about once every couple of weeks. It works great!</li>
            <li> Great Clipper!  Very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> Good tool but not very powerful.</li>
            <li> Bought it in March of 2014. The &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; trimmer stopped being strong enough to shave the back of my head in summer. By late October of 2014, the battery no longer holds a charge. When it worked as new, it was very powerful but extremely loud. The &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; shaped trimmers and attachments worked really well, but now it is useless. However, all of the other trimmers in the market seam cheap too. I guess I will just have to assume I buy a new one very 6 months. I used it once a week. My wife uses it every once in a while (not enough!!!). I&#x27;ll probably buy another because it is under 40 bucks but it just seems odd that Wahl can&#x27;t make something with better quality - I would pay more for better quality and durability.</li>
            <li> It functioned with such unanticipated volume and pitch it hurt my ears.  Did not get to appreciate it actual functions.</li>
            <li> Bought it when I first heard about the lithium-ion batteries.  Lasts about a year like all previous trimmers i&#x27;ve used.  It worked well while it worked and has good accessories, did everything I needed it to but the battery died and will no longer charge.  Lasted about 1 year; disappointed in durability.</li>
            <li> great trimmer&lt;br /&gt;I love it</li>
            <li> A great replacement for my old battery operated Wahl trimmer which has work well for the past 8 years, the rechargeable battery is a vast improvement.</li>
            <li> I use this product for anything hair, except the hair on top of my head, which is extremely thick and curly. Works great. I use the accessories to help get hard to reach places safely, as well as perfect the trimming process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: I bought this in early May of 2012. It is now late August of 2012. Since my first charge, I have not charged it once, nor have I noticed the need to charge it. Now that I&#x27;ve said this, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll have to charge it sometime this week, but the point is the charge is ridiculously long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I know this is a simple review, but this thing is wonderful. Also great for pre trimming before shaving with a razor. Makes the razor process so much smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the price is just right. Not out of reach and for the price, it accomplishes plenty. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll have this thing for years.</li>
            <li> Loved this trimmer and decided upon it despite some cautionary reviews.  I was particularly drawn to this product because of the lithium ion battery.  It worked nicely, and this unit was EXTREMELY well cared-for, but: today, while I was using it, there was a distinct slowing of the motor and the thing died.  Totally, completely.  And it won&#x27;t accept a charge.  I&#x27;ve tried over several hours and made sure all connections are correct but: NO charge.  Won&#x27;t recharge.  Dead.  And I&#x27;m infuriated that a product like this is built to last what?  Barely 20 months - with fairly limited use?  With impeccable care?  Garbage.  Absolute garbage.  I&#x27;m looking for anything BUT a Wahl to replace this trimmer and I&#x27;d suggest the same to you.</li>
            <li> The product was receive in new condition and functions as advertised, the only negitive is I could not figure out how to store all the attachments in the holder provided. Not a problem because I do not use the holder.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for less than a year and the battery is about dead. It only runs about 60 seconds now on a full charge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shaver for about three weeks now.  All in all it is a good product.  The only drawback on this shaver was the \\&quot;Close Shaving Grille Attachment\\&quot; for the stubble areas outside the beard lines...it doesn&#x27;t work for squat!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have to use a disposable double bladed razor to clean up the forementioned neck and cheek areas outside the beard lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend this product to others ???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Y E S  !!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy this product again ???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Y E S  !!!!</li>
            <li> The worst shaver I have ever owned.  To begin, the charge on the shaver only lasted 15 minutes at a time.  I thought this was annoying but I was able to deal with it. Now it does not charge and does not  and never did operate while plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also featured the worst power I have ever experienced for a shaver. The times when it did have a charge, it struggled to cut through my beard, which was not even that thick.  In short, this device is a piece of junk and you should not buy it.  I recently bought a new shaver (made by phillips) and it is 10x better than this electric paper weight.</li>
            <li> Replaced a Wahl trimmer that I had for several years when it was damamged in my luggage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good: The Litium Ion All in One is a fine product. It is easy to change height settings and cuts clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad: Directions are poor and the heads could be easier to change. The base is completely useless so I just let it lay on the counter connected to the charger cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: An OK product.</li>
            <li> I had several criteria for this: it had to hold a charge for a long time, cut hair well, and had to be fun to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m impressed with how long it has held a single charge...several weeks and counting.  The motor is powerful and the blades are sharp. It is an excellent and precision trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  It has a well-built feel, with a solid switch that turns it on and off.  Just for fun, although I have a razor, I put the razor attachment on, shaved half my face, and used my Remington triple-head electric razor, which I also like a lot, on the other half of my face.  The shaves were equally as close.  So, the electric razor attachment shaves as close as a dedicated razor.  The razor is more fun, though, and it is important that rituals such as shaving, hair trimming and the like should be fun.  So, for ordinary use, the Wahl is just a trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only cons are that it does not have a light to indicated when it is fully charged.  You just have to leave it plugged in an hour or two.  Also, the instructions could stand to be a little clearer.  But, in general, it&#x27;s a fun and excellent trimmer to have around.</li>
            <li> This Wahl product is definitely a lower construction standard than past Wahl products I have owned.  The clipper has a cheap look, the base is light weight plastic of low quality.  Recharging is inconvenient compared to past rechargeable Wahl trimmers.  Instead of a recharging base unit that you set the trimmer into, you have to plug a small connector into the base of the unit and then set it on the stand while trying to ensure that the power cable doesn&#x27;t knock out your accessory pieces.  Looking at the materials and construction of the various attachments to the trimmer motor, it is easy to tell that they won&#x27;t last long if used regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it to trim my beard, it pulled on my whiskers several times.  No other Wahl product I have owned has ever done that.  I&#x27;m going to give it a chance to prove itself before going back to my other clipper and trimmer.  For the money you should be able to find something better.</li>
            <li> started out as a quality little trimmer, but failed after one year with very little usage.  don&#x27;t be fooled by all the accessories, not even Chewbacca would appreciate them as most are worthless.  unreliable and too many pieces for me.</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to buy an all-in-one product, but it is actually good. I&#x27;d had about three trimmers before. This one is a good basic trimmer as long as you take care of it (ground comb needs oil...) and it also is suitable for trimming a more creative cuts. (Anything from goatees to moustaches). Battery is strong and lithium. Get it with confidence.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned!  I use it for full body once every 2 weeks and after 3 uses of about 15 minutes each still haven&#x27;t had to recharge it!</li>
            <li> fairly ok while its still new, after a month or two it just drops to the ground on its quality, \\&quot;who says no pull?\\&quot; that&#x27;s a lie, that&#x27;s very irritating even on full charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have tried many grooming products from whal, this one however just doesn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li> Used it once, put it away. Took it out of the drawer a month later and it was RUSTED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely atrocious product.</li>
            <li> Wahl products are very dependable.  I bought this one for my brother in law for Christmas.  What do u get someone who has everything?  Great price for a great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this thing for over a year and it still works great!  I would (and have) reccomend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Nice trimmer with good accompliment of attachments. The poach/bag that comes with it actually holds everything including the charging cable with a little extra room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though,  I have three complaints. First being the bottom is not completely flat, slightly domed. If you want to stand it up, you have to sit it on the charging port or or will top over. Second is no red / green light telling you if its done charging. Not liking for a bar to waste space, just simple light. And,  lastly it would be nice if all metal headed attachments had protective guards. To protect the blades.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver. Charged two months ago, still running.</li>
            <li> I have purchased Wahl products in the past from hair trimmers to dog trimmers. The trimmer I have just purchased does a fantastic job trimming my beard. Heads are removeable and easy to clean by brushing the blade out. I sometimes blow the unit out with a bit of compressed air in a can. I use a blade lube with the product and to date it has done a fantastic job. It has a variety of different blades for styling your beard plus hair combs for further styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am buying each of my bearded sons a unit for Christmas. They will love it.</li>
            <li> You get the trimmer, with all the attachments.... and you get a base, with no clear idea what goes where.  Takes a bit of fiddling to find homes for everything.  Insult to injury, the cord to charge the trimmer apparently just sits there.  So, rather than being able to drop the trimmer directly onto the charger, you have to plug it in, and then set it on the base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a deal-breaker, but annoying nonetheless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this trimmer for about 2 years and I&#x27;ve had no issues. The unit maintains its battery charge for a very long time. I use it exclusively for beard trimming and it works well. It is easy to clean with the included brush. The three heads simply snap on/off. Yes, you must keep the blades oiled. I like the caddy that is included - it holds all of the accessories and the razor - you can even &#x27;dock&#x27; the razor while it is plugged in. For the price - really a 4.5+. More expensive razors are washable - that would be nice but those are typically 2 - 3 times more expensive. I have no regrets purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> Stopped working a week after I got it.</li>
            <li> First off the tray sucks.  You can get all the pieces on the tray but it is horrible.  The clippers are sharp,  charge fast,  and the charge seems to last a while.  The heads are a little tricky to change,  you must be at the correct angle or it is not going on or risk breaking the plastic tabs .</li>
            <li> Carry case would be nice, considering this was not the cheapest trimmer. Using it mostly on the road. Otherwise a good product.</li>
            <li> Short life span it lasted about one year after that could not charge the unit. Got a new ac adapter and it still did not work. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li> Would not charge, would not run plugged in.  This was mentioned in a review I read before buying.  Wish I had heeded that review</li>
            <li> The trimmer is great, the attachments and stand are not.  Attachments are very flimsy and do not fit and stay in the stand.</li>
            <li> I really like these clippers, especially for the price. I use them to shave my head about once a week and to trim my beard. However when I am overseas I have to bring a heavy voltage adapter because they only operate on US voltage. If you travel this is really inconvenient.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great I have no issues and the batteries last a long time. About the only thing I don&#x27;t like is the guards are a little cheap If you press down to hard the guards will be pushed down as well and you&#x27;ll trim your hair uneven.</li>
            <li> Extremely well built.  Long long lasting battery.  Full compliment of trim heads and I am very pleased with it&#x27;s performance.  Quiet too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I certainly recommend this trimmer.  It&#x27;s heads and shoulders above the rest of the products.</li>
            <li> I will first say that, performance-wise, this is a 5-star trimmer. But considering the product as a whole, I couldn&#x27;t give more than 4 stars, and would have given 3 1/2 if it was allowed. Read on to find out why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this since early January. I got it to replace my Norelco [[ASIN:B0016BN4YQ Philips Norelco G480 All-in-One Premium Grooming Kit]] trimmer that refused to charge after about 3 years. The Wahl is has noticeably more power and is quieter. The extra power translates into quicker and cleaner cuts for beard trimming. It has both a small and large blade set, but I don&#x27;t see that I&#x27;ll ever use the large blade. This is good because there is no place on the stand for it. I&#x27;ve managed to place all the attachments except this one on the poorly designed stand; instead it resides in a Ziploc bag in one of the bathroom drawers. Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but if you&#x27;re providing accessories, you should provide proper storage for them as well. That&#x27;s a 1/4-star deduction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a man in his later mid-life who wants to maintain a well-groomed appearance, I find regular trimming of nose and ear hair (I know - gross) is very important to me. So I was disappointed to find that a circular trimmer was not included. Not only does this product not have this cutting attachment, it doesn&#x27;t even accommodate this particular accessory. (The attachment of this type offered by Wahl does not fit this model trimmer.) So much for the \\&quot;All-in-One\\&quot; billing. That&#x27;s a 1/2-star deduction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that I have to spend more money on a separate \\&quot;nose/ear\\&quot; trimmer is another 1/4-star deduction. A company like Wahl should have paid attention to small details such as these (it&#x27;s what once made them great); instead they seem to be relying solely on their reputation and good name. (Maybe they should provide \\&quot;complete\\&quot; products as advertised and not rest on their laurels.)</li>
            <li> Like the tools it has, especially the smaller head to clean up under lower lip. Has worked well the month I&#x27;ve had it.  No idea on longevity yet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holding tray doesn&#x27;t hold everything as nicely as the picture.  Snapping the different heads on took a bit to get use to, some go on easier than others.</li>
            <li> I ordered one and used for 2 days went to charge and would not charge. Amazon replaced it and the Same thing happened except it lasted 5 uses.</li>
            <li> I charge my shaver 1 night a week and use it every day with the foil shaver for my cheeks and upper lip, and once a week to trim my beard.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t use this item even a month. It&#x27;s not working. It is also another wastage of money. I hate it.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product, it works amazingly well and you don&#x27;t have to step over the cord all the time. It cuts and trims just like its big brother, if you trim your own hair or keep it bare, this is the item for you. My wife cuts my hair and she thinks this Trimmer is IT! And so do I, it trims my mustache and it&#x27;s so darned neat.</li>
            <li> The reason I say to make sure that you have the right lenghth, I literally shaved my eyebrows off trying to trim them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 1 setting is not a traditional one....you have been warned.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice trimmer. I&#x27;ve been shopping on and off for one of these for some time, and the Wahl is quite nice. To be honest, I had looked at a number of devices, and the two that stood out to me were this one and the Remington. I saw a Remington at our local Sam&#x27;s Club, and after doing some research, selected the Wahl. It seems to be built better with better quality materials, and is manufactured in the United States. It comes with a plethora of attachments and accessories, and everything stores nicely in a sturdy plastic base.</li>
            <li> product of very good quality in relation to price. It is very useful for people with a busy schedule. It was a great investment</li>
            <li> No Issues and works for its needs.  Would have given 5 stars if the stubble guide was a little shorter.  I don&#x27;t like shaving.</li>
            <li> My husband has had a mustache for about 10 years, and declared this the best and most efficient trimmer&lt;br /&gt;he has tried. He trims it  in about half the time now.</li>
            <li> I really like the trimmer but haven&#x27;t used many of the attachments.  I put the larger trimmer attachement along with the accompaning guards to trim body hair and even give a few hair cuts with great results.  The battery seems to hold a charge for a long time as well which is great!&lt;br /&gt;I wonder if I can get longer guards for this trimmer?</li>
            <li> My husband did not like this trimmer at all, it pulled out his hairs instead of trimming them which proved to be painful. We sent it back.</li>
            <li> Got it as a replacement.  Good choice of tips/options and battery lasts as long as you keep it charged vs forgetting about it(standard batt maint).</li>
            <li> After researching i decide to buy this trimmer. Started out great! Gave me a nice shave and was quiet. But that didn&#x27;t last long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hard to keep clean , hairs stick to handle.&lt;br /&gt;The motor got loud.&lt;br /&gt;The battery died very fast!&lt;br /&gt;The blades rusted even with oil and no water.&lt;br /&gt;In less than a year it was too loud &amp; too rusty and wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the warranty and got a 2nd trimmer. Thought it might have just been a fluke.&lt;br /&gt;I have had The exact same issues with the 2nd trimmer and its been less than a year!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never buy this or any wahl products again!</li>
            <li> I had a Remington trimmer which was nothing but junk.  This unit seems to be well made and comes with useful attachments. What is amazing is how long a battery charge lasts: days and days!</li>
            <li> Excellent Christmas present works great!</li>
            <li> After one day of use it completely stopped working. You would think a Wahl product would last for for years.&lt;br /&gt;I am very very disappointed is this product. Of course I will be returning it.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Powerful motor&lt;br /&gt;- easy to change blades&lt;br /&gt;- blades feel smooth on the skin&lt;br /&gt;- quick charge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- horrible sink top stand. I mean seriously, was the industrial designer drunk?  Maybe I&#x27;m an idiot, but more than half the attachments do not fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to this trimmer set I had the [[ASIN:B000FED5DU Philips Norelco G370 All-in-1 Grooming System]] for 7 years.  I used that razor until the battery could no longer hold a charge.  I was satisfied with it, but after using this Wahl I gotta give the nod to the Wahl.</li>
            <li> This product is of great worth for its price...I took it few months ago and it works great with even occasional charging. It holds charge for days and days...If you are looking for a daily use trimmer, this would be your best choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Wahl for such a wonderful product in this price range!</li>
            <li> Its a great trimmer, and all attachments work great with the exception of the shaver. Dont buy it if you expect to replace your shaver. The base will not store all the attachments well at all. But a very nice trimmer and charges fast and lasts awhile.</li>
            <li> Works great!  The only thing I would complain about is the adjustable attachment does not hold its setting firmly.  Other than that it is a great trimmer!  Light, easy to maneuver and battery lasts a VERY long time before recharge!</li>
            <li> It broke and did a bad job of trimming my hair.  I can&#x27;t even use it now.  Plus it didn&#x27;t do everything it said it could.</li>
            <li> I purchased my trimmer in July of 2012, and use it primarily for stubble-length trimming of my beard and mustache.  It has worked well and initially the charge lasted for several trims, so I had confidently carried it with me on business trips without the charger.  About 10 months after I purchased it, the trimmer started dying before I was able to finish a single trim.  I thought that it would carry me through a single trimming if I just started with it plugged into the charger - wrong...  Here at the 11th month, it won&#x27;t even make it through a single beard trim (~7 minutes) even when starting with it plugged into the charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a 5 year warranty, so be sure to save your manual/guarantee &amp; receipts!</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend as an anniversary present. I read the reviews and they stated that it does a decent job with thick hair, so I figured it&#x27;d work well with my boyfriend&#x27;s beard. The boyfriend tried it out as soon as I got it for him and he seemed pleased with the results. He tried to use the dual shaver to no avail, but he never really had success with them in the past anyway. His only complaint was that the handle of the trimmer was a bit sticky and all the shaved hair would stick to it, but all in all he was pleased.</li>
            <li> The Wahl trimmer works just as advertised. The trimmer comes with a large selection of adapters. The best part is the lithium ion battery. It keeps a charge for a long time and recharges fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer.  Zero complaints.</li>
    </ol>
