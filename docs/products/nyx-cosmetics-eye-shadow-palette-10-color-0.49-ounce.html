            <li>&lt;br /&gt;i love it</li>
            <li>I dont recommend and I do not use this any more.</li>
            <li>Drug Store brands are much better.</li>
            <li>and I use it as eyeliner on top of my liquid liner and it keeps it in place all day with no hassles.</li>
            <li>Hope this helps :)</li>
            <li>, this one has the most glitter&lt;br /&gt;-light champagne/</li>
            <li>I would get a lot more.</li>
            <li>Nice eye shadow, beautiful colors, there are ten in all.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s really that nice!</li>
            <li>The are very neutral and light, so if you don&#x27;t want a \\&quot;made up\\&quot; look these are great.</li>
            <li>Anyway,it&#x27;s worth the price,even better!</li>
            <li>Very nice palette for a very natural look</li>
            <li>The good news is that the average person will look great in them.</li>
            <li>The pigmentation and quality of these is super, way better than most drugstore eyeshadows and some of the department store ones.  </li>
            <li>, I feel like their pigments aren&#x27;t as strong, but I was onyl looking for a matte palate anyway.</li>
            <li>Love it, but if you just get this palette you should still be happy, and the big mirror is also very helpful!!!</li>
            <li>I needed to replace my neutral color palette and had been using ELF (which is \\&quot;get what you pay for\\&quot; cheap makeup.)  </li>
            <li>br /&gt;-matte champagne/light cream, this is a great browbone or inner corner highlight color</li>
            <li>/&gt;-shimmery rose-gold, very nice lid color and is similar to l&#x27;oreal</li>
            <li>My new favorite eyeshadow!</li>
            <li>:) the second top one goes on more like shimmer</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this palette</li>
            <li>but I also like to experiment with different color combinations and this offers the best of both worlds</li>
            <li>, all the colors are specially matched but you can pick which ones to use together.</li>
            <li>The item came with the right colors like in the picture,is very warm and basic: you can use it to the prom,to work or just for every day look.</li>
            <li>, colors are so true.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-matte taupe grey, good for smokey eyes&lt;</li>
            <li>I have kind of deep set eyes</li>
            <li>, I often use these pallets with other NYX pallets to make the color combinations I want but you can also use these all alone its more natural than other color collections good for a professional look or going out or situations where you go for a more natural/traditional look over something that&#x27;s really bright and noticeable.</li>
            <li>I have a pretty good amount of eyeshadows and I will definitely repurchase this particular palette!</li>
            <li>If you are looking for shimmer, you wont find much here, but if you like a subtle eye shadow this palette is perfect for you.</li>
            <li>Not that the look that you definitely have makeup on can&#x27;t be fun, its not always appropriate for the situation.</li>
            <li>but besides that very nice everyday colors!</li>
            <li>The only one I do not like is the leftmost pot, top row, the light blue color is fine, but it&#x27;s pretty much all glitter.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really think that&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>not as glittery as the blue and the fifth top is another shimmer</li>
            <li>This was my first time using this brand, so..</li>
            <li>Exactly what I had hoped.  </li>
            <li>I give this a 5 star because its travel friendly and the colors are great you could wear an everyday look or glam it up with the sparkly baby blue by the way its not shimmer</li>
            <li>I hit bottom too fast on the first color.</li>
            <li>The other colors are great for lining your crease, I&#x27;ve made multiple combinations for doing that</li>
            <li>Not sure it is worth $10.00 though, but a nice product.</li>
            <li>This is because they have large chunks of glitter in them instead of micro glitter or shimmer.</li>
            <li>The colors stay much better than all of the cheap drugstore brands I&#x27;ve used in the past (not one for spending much on makeup).  </li>
            <li>NYX works really well</li>
            <li>I think that is why I haven&#x27;t used it much.</li>
            <li>but you won&#x27;t really notice that part anyway.</li>
            <li>The colors are very week.</li>
            <li>All of the colors are very pigmented and glide on like a dream.</li>
            <li>I got it for the mattes on the bottom row, and they are even better than expected.</li>
            <li>, this is very close to my skin color, can be used all over the lid&lt;</li>
            <li>/&gt;-very compact, you could just throw this in your bag and be ready to go!&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Third, the shimmery shades apply a little more smoothly, but you still need to build up to get any kind of serious color.</li>
            <li>I have a few of these pallets in different colors, I think there a good value for the money (about $1 a color) go to like a pharmacy and even the cheap quality drug store stuff can cost close to the same price.</li>
            <li>extremely super small microshimmer black, great for lining the eyes/ smokey looks&lt;br /&gt;________________________________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>LOVE how dark and pigmented</li>
            <li>I bought this mainly for the matte shades on the bottom.</li>
            <li>I recommend the elf high definition powder.</li>
            <li>and this also doesn&#x27;t crease when used with the Nyx high def primer.</li>
            <li>It goes on easy and isn&#x27;t chalky like other brands.</li>
            <li>The black is a nice true matte black</li>
            <li>thing SUCKS, but you would probably use your fingers or your own brushes anyway&lt;br</li>
            <li>but just the right amount of glitter the blue one that is, it takes you from normal</li>
            <li>I also like the size of these shadows not to small and they  also glide on very smoothly even without using a primer.</li>
            <li>I use this nearly every day!  </li>
            <li>: very dark, no smudging throughout the day, and can easily blend for a smokey eye.</li>
            <li>The matte black is okay, the matte grey is alright, the matte dark brown barely shows up, and most of the matte colors apply unevenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All but the blue, it&#x27;s a little more silvery than pictured.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I had to completely redo the foundation around my eyes and cheeks.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find the colors I wanted in ELF, but this didn&#x27;t seem too far off in the price</li>
            <li>wow am I happy to report I was wrong!  </li>
            <li>expected this palette to be bigger, but I&#x27;m not disappointed because there is still a lot of product.  </li>
            <li>I rarely wear makeup anymore, so using the cheap stuff isn&#x27;t a big deal to me as long as it works for the few times</li>
            <li>The only one that goes on strong is the black.</li>
            <li>very light gold shimmer, this could be used as an inner corner highlight, it&#x27;s much less shimmery than the blue</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not totally unhappy with these - they do come in useful to tame some of my other eyeshadows that are REALLY highly pigmented and a bit tricky to work with.</li>
            <li>the top third and fourth are a little glittery</li>
            <li>It is a little more rough when applying too</li>
            <li>I will no longer ever use traditional eyeliner (gel, liquid, pencil, etc); a slant tip brush and this black shadow is my dream come true for eyeliner</li>
            <li>They barely show up on my eyes and don&#x27;t adhere well to the eyelid.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second, as other reviewers pointed out, some of the shadows aren&#x27;t very pigmented.</li>
            <li>a few of the colors seem a little dull..maybe I just need to use a better primer</li>
            <li>But the palette by itself is a little disappointing as far as NYX goes (some of their single color eyeshadows are very pigmented and bright).</li>
            <li>Seriously, I only handled this thing for 5 minutes and the whole black surface was smudged</li>

            <li> All but the blue, it&#x27;s a little more silvery than pictured.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I had to completely redo the foundation around my eyes and cheeks.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find the colors I wanted in ELF, but this didn&#x27;t seem too far off in the price</li>
            <li> wow am I happy to report I was wrong!  </li>
            <li> expected this palette to be bigger, but I&#x27;m not disappointed because there is still a lot of product.  </li>
            <li> I rarely wear makeup anymore, so using the cheap stuff isn&#x27;t a big deal to me as long as it works for the few times</li>
            <li> The only one that goes on strong is the black.</li>
            <li> very light gold shimmer, this could be used as an inner corner highlight, it&#x27;s much less shimmery than the blue</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not totally unhappy with these - they do come in useful to tame some of my other eyeshadows that are REALLY highly pigmented and a bit tricky to work with.</li>
            <li> the top third and fourth are a little glittery</li>
            <li> It is a little more rough when applying too</li>
            <li> I will no longer ever use traditional eyeliner (gel, liquid, pencil, etc); a slant tip brush and this black shadow is my dream come true for eyeliner</li>
            <li> They barely show up on my eyes and don&#x27;t adhere well to the eyelid.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, as other reviewers pointed out, some of the shadows aren&#x27;t very pigmented.</li>
            <li> a few of the colors seem a little dull..maybe I just need to use a better primer</li>
            <li> But the palette by itself is a little disappointing as far as NYX goes (some of their single color eyeshadows are very pigmented and bright).</li>
            <li> Seriously, I only handled this thing for 5 minutes and the whole black surface was smudged</li>
            <li> The box is easy to hold,the little mirror is big enough to see all you need to see in your face and that box is small enough to keep in bag.</li>
            <li> So the darkest ones still apply very lightly compared to the expensive mall brands and it won&#x27;t wear as long throughout the day as the more expensive brands either.</li>
            <li> When I got this eyeshadow some of the colors were broken and more than half gone.</li>
            <li> The problem is it not last so long in my eyes,I don&#x27;t know it because of my eyes skin</li>
            <li> And at this price, I would not have expected this palette to even come close to something like Urban Decay&#x27;s $50 Naked palettes.</li>
            <li> The blue is pretty much useless, but the other shades can be patted over the matte shades (or layered multiple times on each other) to make some pretty looks.</li>
            <li> I actually use the dark brown color (middle pot, bottom row) for my eyebrows, and the dark charcoal gray (rightmost pot, bottom row) also doubles as an eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> I really liked the neutral colors in this palette, but I was disappointed when I applied them.</li>
            <li> I have worn these eye shadows only a few times.</li>
            <li> I have only used it a few times</li>
            <li> One side are matted colors the other are shine colors.</li>
            <li> so I recommend if you us jojoba or any other of these types of moisturizers you set it with a translucent powder.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the top glittery shades have poor pigmentation and a lot of fallout.</li>
            <li> I love NYX products and I pair this with their nude eye shadow base to make the colors pop, and add their lose powder shimmer.</li>
            <li> These would also work well for younger girls just learning how to apply makeup cause they would be hard to mess up and get too dark for a Mom&#x27;s liking.</li>
            <li> but a little less shimmery&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a tendency to go right in the eyes and get everywhere, and as everyone knows with glitter, nigh impossible to get off.  </li>
            <li> They are not very pigmented and hardly show up.  </li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t show up hardly at all and will look like you are running around without any make-up other than lipstick and mascara.</li>
            <li> On top of that, the fall out is horrible.  </li>
            <li> My skin usually hold the make-up with a moisturizer cream before but here, it doesn&#x27;t seem so</li>
            <li> Not a great product.</li>
            <li> Very shallow sections.</li>

            <li> I really liked the neutral colors in this palette, but I was disappointed when I applied them. They are not very pigmented and hardly show up.  On top of that, the fall out is horrible.  I had to completely redo the foundation around my eyes and cheeks. I have worn these eye shadows only a few times.</li>
            <li> It goes on easy and isn&#x27;t chalky like other brands. I love the array of colors and the way they pop on my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have a few of these pallets in different colors, I think there a good value for the money (about $1 a color) go to like a pharmacy and even the cheap quality drug store stuff can cost close to the same price. Or you can buy Mary Kay or department store brands and spend big bucks and I don&#x27;t really think that&#x27;s worth it. NYX works really well, I often use these pallets with other NYX pallets to make the color combinations I want but you can also use these all alone its more natural than other color collections good for a professional look or going out or situations where you go for a more natural/traditional look over something that&#x27;s really bright and noticeable. Not that the look that you definitely have makeup on can&#x27;t be fun, its not always appropriate for the situation. I think its great when colors come all matched up specifically to be used together (like the sets of 3 colors) but I also like to experiment with different color combinations and this offers the best of both worlds, all the colors are specially matched but you can pick which ones to use together.</li>
            <li> The bottom matte row is very nice and pigmented. Unfortunately, the top glittery shades have poor pigmentation and a lot of fallout. This is because they have large chunks of glitter in them instead of micro glitter or shimmer. The blue is pretty much useless, but the other shades can be patted over the matte shades (or layered multiple times on each other) to make some pretty looks.</li>
            <li> I needed to replace my neutral color palette and had been using ELF (which is \\&quot;get what you pay for\\&quot; cheap makeup.)  I rarely wear makeup anymore, so using the cheap stuff isn&#x27;t a big deal to me as long as it works for the few times I use it.  I couldn&#x27;t find the colors I wanted in ELF, but this didn&#x27;t seem too far off in the price and so I ordered it, expecting the same quality as ELF just based on price- wow am I happy to report I was wrong!  An inexpensive makeup that has good quality???  Who&#x27;d have thought?      Very nice, the colors are wonderful and the quality is great- none of that crumbling the minute your brush touches the powder.  This stuff makes me want to wear makeup regularly again, it&#x27;s really that nice!</li>
            <li> I had a lot of expectations after reading the ratings. I have only used it a few times but when I have, the color does not show (especially the shimmery color). I think that is why I haven&#x27;t used it much. I wished I liked it more. We&#x27;ll see how I feel about it after using it for awhile.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this palette numerous times since I purchased it this summer.  The colors stay much better than all of the cheap drugstore brands I&#x27;ve used in the past (not one for spending much on makeup).  I actually use the dark brown color (middle pot, bottom row) for my eyebrows, and the dark charcoal gray (rightmost pot, bottom row) also doubles as an eyeliner.  The only one I do not like is the leftmost pot, top row, the light blue color is fine, but it&#x27;s pretty much all glitter.  It has a tendency to go right in the eyes and get everywhere, and as everyone knows with glitter, nigh impossible to get off.  Nevertheless, I still have 9 great colors I use often!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for shimmer, you wont find much here, but if you like a subtle eye shadow this palette is perfect for you. I love NYX products and I pair this with their nude eye shadow base to make the colors pop, and add their lose powder shimmer. Love it, but if you just get this palette you should still be happy, and the big mirror is also very helpful!!! Love it</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and I use this every day, colors are so true. I use this nearly every day!  Definitely would reccomend, especially for the price</li>
            <li> Very nice palette for a very natural look a few of the colors seem a little dull..maybe I just need to use a better primer but besides that very nice everyday colors!</li>
            <li> Nice eye shadow, beautiful colors, there are ten in all. One side are matted colors the other are shine colors. Not sure it is worth $10.00 though, but a nice product.</li>
            <li> This is a nice palette of colors. The are very neutral and light, so if you don&#x27;t want a \\&quot;made up\\&quot; look these are great. These would also work well for younger girls just learning how to apply makeup cause they would be hard to mess up and get too dark for a Mom&#x27;s liking. There isn&#x27;t a lot of pigment in them though. So the darkest ones still apply very lightly compared to the expensive mall brands and it won&#x27;t wear as long throughout the day as the more expensive brands either. It is a little more rough when applying too but you won&#x27;t really notice that part anyway. If you are a more \\&quot;Natural\\&quot; looking sort of girl that doesn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money these are wonderful colors and a great value. If you are like me and look like you have no make-up on no matter how much is actually on.. It won&#x27;t show up hardly at all and will look like you are running around without any make-up other than lipstick and mascara. The good news is that the average person will look great in them.</li>
            <li> Nice colors but the shades aren&#x27;t as pigmented as I thought they would be. The only one that goes on strong is the black. It has a nice sleek packaging though.</li>
            <li> My skin usually hold the make-up with a moisturizer cream before but here, it doesn&#x27;t seem so, I don&#x27;t know why. The texture is great and the color are very beautiful and could be put together for different moment of the day (night, work, etc). I don&#x27;t use the brush which is with the kit because it&#x27;s scratchy but otherwise it&#x27;s practical to have a mirror inside and your have mat color and shinny color, which is great !</li>
            <li> When I got this eyeshadow some of the colors were broken and more than half gone. I decided to try the remaining ones anyway. They barely show up on my eyes and don&#x27;t adhere well to the eyelid. Not a great product. Don&#x27;t buy!</li>
            <li> i love it veeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrryyyyyyyy muchoooo demasiado ultra uff de veras&lt;br /&gt;i love it veeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrryyyyyyyy muchoooo demasiado ultra uff de veras</li>
            <li> Very shallow sections. I hit bottom too fast on the first color. The colors are very week. Does not last at all. I dont recommend and I do not use this any more. Very cheap. Drug Store brands are much better.</li>
            <li> I love this palette! All of the colors are very pigmented and glide on like a dream. The black is a nice true matte black and I use it as eyeliner on top of my liquid liner and it keeps it in place all day with no hassles. The other colors are great for lining your crease, I&#x27;ve made multiple combinations for doing that and they all turned out well. My new favorite eyeshadow!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even tried all the colors yet, but I love this palette! I got it for the mattes on the bottom row, and they are even better than expected. The 2 metallics I have tried are really beautiful as well! I would definitely buy this again, and I want to try a NYX 10 Color in a different scheme as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this palette and used it once. The item came with the right colors like in the picture,is very warm and basic: you can use it to the prom,to work or just for every day look. The box is easy to hold,the little mirror is big enough to see all you need to see in your face and that box is small enough to keep in bag. The problem is it not last so long in my eyes,I don&#x27;t know it because of my eyes skin or I don&#x27;t know how to make up or because of the palette itself. Anyway,it&#x27;s worth the price,even better!</li>
            <li> Colors appear just as they do in the picture. All but the blue, it&#x27;s a little more silvery than pictured.&lt;br /&gt;I thought this was pretty good for the most part, price was great. Only downside is one of the color pallets came unglued and fell out.</li>
            <li> I give this a 5 star because its travel friendly and the colors are great you could wear an everyday look or glam it up with the sparkly baby blue by the way its not shimmer but just the right amount of glitter the blue one that is, it takes you from normal ta damn :) the second top one goes on more like shimmer the top third and fourth are a little glittery not as glittery as the blue and the fifth top is another shimmer all the bottom ones are matte. I also like the size of these shadows not to small and they  also glide on very smoothly even without using a primer. I&#x27;m currently using argan oil on my face and did notice the shadows moved a bit so I recommend if you us jojoba or any other of these types of moisturizers you set it with a translucent powder. I recommend the elf high definition powder. I have a pretty good amount of eyeshadows and I will definitely repurchase this particular palette! Hope this helps :)</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this palette today!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors are great and just WOW&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expected this palette to be bigger, but I&#x27;m not disappointed because there is still a lot of product.  The palette is about the size of an iPhone, and it&#x27;s very solidly built.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;___________________________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;Color descriptions:&lt;br /&gt;Top row, L to R&lt;br /&gt;-light blue/silvery sparkle, this one has the most glitter&lt;br /&gt;-light champagne/very light gold shimmer, this could be used as an inner corner highlight, it&#x27;s much less shimmery than the blue&lt;br /&gt;-light burgundy/rose shimmer, this is a beautiful lid color&lt;br /&gt;-shimmery taupe with purple undertones, this is my FAVORITE color, beautiful lid color also&lt;br /&gt;-shimmery rose-gold, very nice lid color and is similar to l&#x27;oreal infallible&#x27;s Amber Rush but a little less shimmery&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Botton row, L to R&lt;br /&gt;-matte peach-nude, this is very close to my skin color, can be used all over the lid&lt;br /&gt;-matte champagne/light cream, this is a great browbone or inner corner highlight color&lt;br /&gt;-matte medium-dark brown, nice for lining the eyes&lt;br /&gt;-matte taupe grey, good for smokey eyes&lt;br /&gt;-matte/extremely super small microshimmer black, great for lining the eyes/ smokey looks&lt;br /&gt;________________________________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now for the pros and cons-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-cute sleek packaging, feels very solid and well built&lt;br /&gt;-10 great colors&lt;br /&gt;-pigmentation is awesome, even better than some department store brands like estee lauder&lt;br /&gt;-5 shimmer/glitter and 5 matte colors&lt;br /&gt;-buttery texture&lt;br /&gt;-easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;-a dream to blend&lt;br /&gt;-very compact, you could just throw this in your bag and be ready to go!&lt;br /&gt;-nice mirror!&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s tons of great things about this palette!  A++++&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-applicator thing SUCKS, but you would probably use your fingers or your own brushes anyway&lt;br /&gt;-whoa this thing is a FINGERPRINT MAGNET!  Seriously, I only handled this thing for 5 minutes and the whole black surface was smudged&lt;br /&gt;-discontinued, according to the NYX website, but that is what amazon is for&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These cons have nothing to do with the actual eyeshadows, so I will not take a star off for those problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;______________________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;SOOOO&lt;br /&gt;Final verdict- These colors are very versatile, a blend of everyday neutrals and shimmer colors.  The pigmentation and quality of these is super, way better than most drugstore eyeshadows and some of the department store ones.  GO BUY!</li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;m not sure if I received what I was supposed to get, since I ended up getting 3 palettes...?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, as other reviewers pointed out, some of the shadows aren&#x27;t very pigmented. The matte black is okay, the matte grey is alright, the matte dark brown barely shows up, and most of the matte colors apply unevenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, the shimmery shades apply a little more smoothly, but you still need to build up to get any kind of serious color. After a bit, these shimmery shadows seem to disappear - I don&#x27;t know if it falls off or gets wiped away. But by the end of the day, they&#x27;re just gone regardless of if I wear primer or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not totally unhappy with these - they do come in useful to tame some of my other eyeshadows that are REALLY highly pigmented and a bit tricky to work with. But the palette by itself is a little disappointing as far as NYX goes (some of their single color eyeshadows are very pigmented and bright). And at this price, I would not have expected this palette to even come close to something like Urban Decay&#x27;s $50 Naked palettes.</li>
            <li> For the price, these have great pigment and color payoff! I love NYX and am so happy to find this palette. I bought this mainly for the matte shades on the bottom. I will definitely be repurchasing this palette once it runs out. It&#x27;s not to powdery and blends well. I have kind of deep set eyes and this also doesn&#x27;t crease when used with the Nyx high def primer.</li>
            <li> The shades are nice and warm.. I thought the size would be much bigger. This was my first time using this brand, so.. I thought (according to the photo) I would get a lot more.</li>
            <li> LOVE how dark and pigmented the matte colors are. I will no longer ever use traditional eyeliner (gel, liquid, pencil, etc); a slant tip brush and this black shadow is my dream come true for eyeliner: very dark, no smudging throughout the day, and can easily blend for a smokey eye. Can add a bit of water to brush to darken, as well. Haven&#x27;t used the shimmer colors, I feel like their pigments aren&#x27;t as strong, but I was onyl looking for a matte palate anyway. The beige matte colors are great for creating a flawless skin appearance to eyelids.</li>
            <li> Because it  work great&lt;br /&gt;If it work I will like it&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend to my friends and my family</li>
            <li> This palette is great.  Wonderful color and variety and it lasts all day!  Exactly what I had hoped.  Good stuff!</li>
