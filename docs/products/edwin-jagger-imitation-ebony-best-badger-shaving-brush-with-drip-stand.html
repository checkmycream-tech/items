            <li>Very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>, this is the absolute best brush on the market that I found.  </li>
            <li>It generates a very good lather and dries fairly quickly thanks to the stand provided.  </li>
            <li>I know there are better quality stands and brushes out there</li>
            <li>The lather I have been able to generate with this is thicker then anything I&#x27;ve gotten out of a can.</li>
            <li>Very soft and creates a great lather with Cella Shave Cream/Soap.</li>
            <li>order the medium size for a better fit.</li>
            <li>It is soft and creates a great lather.</li>
            <li>Everything I expected in a Best Badger brush by Edwin Jagger.  </li>
            <li>It lathers very quick and holds just the right amount of water to keep your lather nice and creamy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s size makes it easy to spread lather.</li>
            <li>Though the bristles aren&#x27;t silver tip, the brush provides a damn good lather without high price of silver tip brishes</li>
            <li>the brush quality is fine.</li>
            <li>I have lost a couple of hairs on the brush, but the overall quality is great.</li>
            <li>but now that I have it and use it I would still pay the full price of $60.</li>
            <li>If you are new to wet shaving or need a travel brush, this is perfect for you.</li>
            <li>The odor faded quickly, and their is plenty of hair to spare.</li>
            <li>It lathers quickly and fully.  </li>
            <li>This is a great little brush for the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Hairs started falling out of it immediately on first use.  </li>
            <li>No foul smell at all either before or after first use.</li>
            <li>Ben using everyday for about a year,very good.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly with the original bloom ready for the next shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but for someone like me who wants to test the product out without spending $100</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic brush, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>and it hasn&#x27;t lost that much hair.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I got a defective or uncleaned one, but man...the smell of the badger is just too much.</li>
            <li>I will say I like that it comes with a stand, and that it lathers very well.</li>
            <li>highly recommend the Edwin Jagger shaving brush.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised how much I like it.</li>
            <li>This is a well constructed brush, however, I found it to be too prickly for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brush, especially for beginners.</li>
            <li>Then you put the hot water on it, and you&#x27;ve got that distinctive aroma: wet badger.</li>
            <li>This brush is plenty big enough to accommodate my fairly large hands.  </li>
            <li>I noticed only a slight smell for the first couple of uses, but that slight smell went away quickly and was not at all unbearable.  </li>
            <li>I thought it might get better with repeat usages and rinses, but it smells like it may have grown worse over time.</li>
            <li>This brush does have a small handle(as many have commented on in other reviews), but the quality is in the badger hair.  </li>
            <li>6 months and not a single hair shed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Small enough that it dries quickly and comes with a small stand that fits right inside my Dopp.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> This shaving brush is working fantastically for me. The included stand for drying is a great addition. The quality is excellent provides a rich lather with the shaving soap. Though the bristles aren&#x27;t silver tip, the brush provides a damn good lather without high price of silver tip brishes</li>
            <li> seems a good value, holding up well</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful product. Shipped well, not one abnormal thing about it. Opened it up and was in perfect condition. The Bristles are stiff yet has a soft bristled feel to it. Overall this product is as it is described.</li>
            <li> the brush quality is fine. the size is much too small for a mans hand. order the medium size for a better fit.</li>
            <li> 6 months and not a single hair shed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is great for travel.  Small enough that it dries quickly and comes with a small stand that fits right inside my Dopp.  It isnearly the same brush that you will find at Crabtree &amp; Evelyn, but $20 cheaper.  I only use three fingers to hold my shaving brush - thumb, index, and middle.  This brush is plenty big enough to accommodate my fairly large hands.  Recommended for those looking for an inexpensive brush that lasts.</li>
            <li> This brush does have a small handle(as many have commented on in other reviews), but the quality is in the badger hair.  I noticed only a slight smell for the first couple of uses, but that slight smell went away quickly and was not at all unbearable.  It generates a very good lather and dries fairly quickly thanks to the stand provided.  I know there are better quality stands and brushes out there but for someone like me who wants to test the product out without spending $100+, this is the absolute best brush on the market that I found.  I paid $40 for it but now that I have it and use it I would still pay the full price of $60.</li>
            <li> I was a little surprised about the smaller size. but I have been using this brush now for about 2 months and I have gotten used to the size and it works for me. I get a great lather so much better then the entry level boars hair brush I purchased when I just started going back to DE shaving.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic brush, especially for the price.  Update 11/27/2016: I have been using the brush for about 3 years. It has held up great and works as well today as it did when I bought it. It has kept its shape and the hairs have stayed in place. It is soft and creates a great lather. It is small but has held up to the test of time. I highly recommend this brush, especially for beginners.</li>
            <li> was a great buy, would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a nice and good brush , have used it for 3mths and its still good.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected in a Best Badger brush by Edwin Jagger.  Very satisfied.  When it comes to brushes, YMMV.  I also have a Simogue Boar and Vie Long Horse.</li>
            <li> This brush was poorly made.  Hairs started falling out of it immediately on first use.  I tried to contact the company, Edwin Jagger about it by sending them an email.  I have never received a response.  I will not purchase their items in the future.</li>
            <li> Ben using everyday for about a year,very good.</li>
            <li> Just get it.  It&#x27;s worth the money.  I&#x27;ve had mine now for a while and it hasn&#x27;t lost that much hair.  It does its job and it&#x27;s simply a good product.</li>
            <li> Very soft and creates a great lather with Cella Shave Cream/Soap. No foul smell at all either before or after first use.</li>
            <li> Purchased with a shaving mug and double edge razor by the same brand, shaving has turned from a necessity into a something I look forward to every day. The lather I have been able to generate with this is thicker then anything I&#x27;ve gotten out of a can. I do see it shed the occasional hair, and there was an initial odor. The odor faded quickly, and their is plenty of hair to spare.</li>
            <li> This is a great little brush for the price. I have lost a couple of hairs on the brush, but the overall quality is great. It lathers very quick and holds just the right amount of water to keep your lather nice and creamy. If you are new to wet shaving or need a travel brush, this is perfect for you.</li>
            <li> This is a well constructed brush, however, I found it to be too prickly for my sensitive skin.  So I ended up buying a synthetic brush as a replacement.  However, I still use the stand.</li>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews about it being small I was surprised how much I like it. It fits great in my hand and I get a great lather.</li>
            <li> It lathers quickly and fully.  It dries quickly with the original bloom ready for the next shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the Edwin Jagger shaving brush.  I&#x27;ll no longer uselather from a can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edd Freeman</li>
            <li> Great brush. It&#x27;s size makes it easy to spread lather.</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a defective or uncleaned one, but man...the smell of the badger is just too much. I thought it might get better with repeat usages and rinses, but it smells like it may have grown worse over time. Then you put the hot water on it, and you&#x27;ve got that distinctive aroma: wet badger. Besides, it loses a couple of hairs with each use, and I use an electric razor, so then those badger hairs get pulverized into black pulp on my face. This is just not my thing. I will say I like that it comes with a stand, and that it lathers very well.</li>
