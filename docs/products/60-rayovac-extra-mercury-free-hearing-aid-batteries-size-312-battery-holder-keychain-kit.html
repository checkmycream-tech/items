            <li>What more would you like me to say?</li>
            <li>My hearing air specialist has recommended Rayovac batteries and I cannot find a better price anywhere.</li>
            <li>The convenience of getting these on line is most appealing.</li>
            <li>I wonder how many of these will be duds.</li>

            <li>Good price and fast shipping</li>
            <li>Good quality batteries, thanks</li>
            <li>Said these rayovac batteries lasted between 6-7 days, which was better than the original batteries they received with their hearing aid purchase.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and am now ordering  more.  </li>
            <li>Accurate description.  </li>
            <li>so these are much more economical than OTC  batteries.</li>
            <li>The price is right &amp; they are fresher than most of the ones I have found in stores.</li>
            <li>Works just as well as original equipment.</li>
            <li>but so far so good  lasts as long as others ive had  at a good price</li>
            <li>My wife finds them very consistent and reliable.</li>
            <li>If you carry extras in your purse, the wheel continues to turn and the batteries fall out regardless of how much effort I give to secure the plastic flap.</li>
            <li>The key chain battery holder was a nice plus.  </li>
            <li>Right stuff, right on tim.</li>
            <li>Priced right.  </li>
            <li>I received the order in  just a few days and am more than pleased.  </li>
            <li>The price cannot be beat, they were shipped quickly, and have performed very well.</li>

            <li>The shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li>I have not used this batteries from this latest order, but I have been using the same batteries from a prior order and have been extremely pleased with them.  </li>
            <li>So far not a bad battery in the 30</li>
            <li>Fast Delivery</li>
            <li>Came very promptly and just as description read.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping and quality product.</li>
            <li>Been using them for several weeks and just as good as the ones I purchased from my audiologist but at half the price.</li>
            <li>Fantastic because they are so long lasting.  </li>
