            <li>This wonderful collection of full size skin care sells at a terrific price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had no problems with it, and I feel this is just as good as some of the products that cost 3 times as much.</li>
            <li>on tops comes off easily</li>
            <li>no harsh perfumes and a good hydration..really cheap!</li>
            <li>which AVEENO or Murad does just fine for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy that I got this kit on Amazon for a low price.</li>
            <li>You can not beat the price and l did not receive this product for free.</li>
            <li>I wish I would have taken some detailed pictures before I started using Unique.  </li>
            <li>There products are very similar to a famous brand from Switzerland that sells for many times more.</li>
            <li>and I have found them to be better than the higher priced stored</li>
            <li>So far I am loving this product it makes your skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li>for any type of skin, the packaging was very protective, and the size is well worth it! , unique product, pleasant texture, smell, not harsh at all.</li>
            <li>I use this religiously and I have to honestly say it does make my skin, fresh, healthy and glowing.</li>
            <li>The products came to full sizes.</li>
            <li>They feel like silk when applying and absorb quickly.  </li>
            <li>The 24 hour serum absorbs quickly and does not leave your skin greasy.  </li>
            <li>So worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth buying again.</li>
            <li>This is silky, and has highly helped the tone, softness, and fine lines.  </li>
            <li>The cleanser is rich and gentle.</li>
            <li>, I can see a result almost right the way.</li>
            <li>I tried all the cosmetic brands, from expensive to cheap ones: this is an incredible deal.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical, but it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, not greasy, leaves my skin so soft, Love it, definitely planning to order again, try it!</li>
            <li>Will definitely order more.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if there was any difference in skin tone or appearance as I see my skin daily but a client who I had not seen in a while wanted to know if I had some work done!  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell how many products I have tried the last 40 years</li>
            <li>I was so surprised at the quality of this product they are rich and creamy and work very well on my skin.</li>
            <li>Large size products.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>The texture of the cream reminds me of very fancy brands that I tried years ago.</li>
            <li>So I thought I would give these a try figuring for the price, I wouldn&#x27;t lose much if they didn&#x27;t work out.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle to the skin.  </li>
            <li>I like it but will take time to see if it really works or not.</li>
            <li>My skin feels new and like satin and I very much like</li>
            <li>This kit would cost hundreds more if buying from other networks.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The pumps on the products are made of high quality and the bottles that contain the serums and eye cream are made of glass.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>Believe me I have tried them all, inexpensive and very expensive and this is far the best.  </li>
            <li>Have purchased in the past years eye care products and loved the results and feel the same way about these</li>
            <li>Only the cleanser works ok, but the rest are of these products are totally  dry</li>
            <li>I have used Estee Lauder for 30 years, I think I have found my new friend in tis product.</li>
            <li>Cheap packaging, with broken pumps, product might be fabulous</li>
            <li>so when it says anti-aging on a product, it doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s not any good for younger women.</li>
            <li>You will be surprised!</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t used it long enuf really to find out how it really works,  </li>
            <li>I can only speak for myself but my skin is now soft, has a nice radiant glow, pores are smaller, skin tone is improving, and my eyes are not as puffy or dark underneath.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe the price and truly hope the price doesn&#x27;t go up since I&#x27;m on a fixed income.  </li>
            <li>The aging process begins at 25 years old...</li>
            <li>I really think my skin is firmer, especially my neck.  </li>
            <li>is like they are too old</li>
            <li>So far just tried the cleanser and the 24 Hour Age Defying Serum.</li>
            <li>It completely clogged my pores and gave me acne all over my face.</li>
            <li>, I am 66 years old</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone that has dry sensitive skin and wants to help with their wrinkles.</li>
            <li>the non greasy feel so many products can leave behind.</li>
            <li>I have very nice skin with very few wrinkles (age 49) but it is extremely sensitive and it is very hard for me to find products that don&#x27;t burn or turn my face red.  </li>
            <li>And facial mask is not dry on your face at all .</li>
            <li>I have tried many products from less expensive to very costly, but these products work for me</li>

            <li> And facial mask is not dry on your face at all .</li>
            <li> I have tried many products from less expensive to very costly, but these products work for me</li>
            <li> I am only 26 but was advised by my dermatologist to start early from preventing aging and dark spots.</li>
            <li> I am 61 years old and look my age if not more.</li>
            <li> I am 48 and it is getting harder and harder to find products that make a difference with tone and elasticity.  </li>
            <li> It was not what what i expected it to be  drys my skin  </li>
            <li> I have literally spent hundreds of dollars in my lifetime for products that ended up in the garbage after one use.  </li>
            <li> Before I had sagging facial skin, uneven skin tone, acne that won&#x27;t go away, and dark &amp; puffy under my eyes.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Awesome product.  I keep buying it over and over again.</li>
            <li> I have been using the products for a little over a month now and I love them.  My skin has never been better.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Truly Amazing!!!  I am 61 years old and look my age if not more. I have tried the products now for 5 days and can truly say that I can see and feel amazing results already. I actually saw results on the 2nd day but I wanted to wait to see if there were other improvements, which there were. Before I had sagging facial skin, uneven skin tone, acne that won&#x27;t go away, and dark &amp; puffy under my eyes. I can only speak for myself but my skin is now soft, has a nice radiant glow, pores are smaller, skin tone is improving, and my eyes are not as puffy or dark underneath. Also, my acne is clearing and I haven&#x27;t broken out in bumps since I started using the products. I can&#x27;t believe the price and truly hope the price doesn&#x27;t go up since I&#x27;m on a fixed income.  I contacted the Seller, who was very nice and courteous, you still must use a SPF, which AVEENO or Murad does just fine for me. I have tried many products from less expensive to very costly, but these products work for me and I plan on ordering 2 more sets. Another for me and one for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Cheap packaging, with broken pumps, product might be fabulous but I have found it sticky and noticed no real differences in my skincare results as compared to other brands that are cheaper- and a couple of their products feel and smell identical to each other. Makes me wonder. Box did not contain any literature or lists of ingredients, etc... No instructions for use, frequency, steps of the process, etc...</li>
            <li> All&#x27;s I can say is OMG!!!!! This stuff is AMAZING! I notice a difference over night. My skin looks and feels way younger. I&#x27;m happy that I got this kit on Amazon for a low price. This kit would cost hundreds more if buying from other networks. I am going to stock up on this product.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with my purchase</li>
            <li> This is great! I highly recommend this! for any type of skin, the packaging was very protective, and the size is well worth it! , unique product, pleasant texture, smell, not harsh at all. I&#x27;ve had no problems with it, and I feel this is just as good as some of the products that cost 3 times as much. This is silky, and has highly helped the tone, softness, and fine lines.  I was skeptical, but it&#x27;s great!, you&#x27;ll love it!  :)</li>
            <li> Love this! I have been using it for a couple of months already and I see such a dramatic change. I am only 26 but was advised by my dermatologist to start early from preventing aging and dark spots. I use this religiously and I have to honestly say it does make my skin, fresh, healthy and glowing. Give it time to see any difference and use it day and night like the instructions state.</li>
            <li> The products came to full sizes. The cleanser tip package was peeling out after couple days later lol I love the serum the best . And facial mask is not dry on your face at all . It reminds me of moisture facial mask from Origins for night time is best time for using this . I love the smell as well . Also eye cream is pretty good non grassy at all . Perfect for young skin . If you looking for products that no animal using . This is good for you .</li>
            <li> i love all the combinations of these mosturizers but i do not like that the cleanser burns your eyes</li>
            <li> do not work got a allergic reaction, nivea is a better product.</li>
            <li> I have almost finished the 5 Unique products purchased at a great price and I want more.  My skin feels new and like satin and I very much like the non greasy feel so many products can leave behind.</li>
            <li> Simply amazing! I tried all the cosmetic brands, from expensive to cheap ones: this is an incredible deal. You get 5 good skincare product (day-night serum, anti-age serum, eye cream, cleanser, mask) for about 5 bucks each! I think it is from Switzerland. No strong perfume, not tested on animals and they aren&#x27;t greasy at all. I actually tried them all after the mask (the mask in moisturizing but not perfumed) and my skin look awesome. The pumps on the products are made of high quality and the bottles that contain the serums and eye cream are made of glass. The texture of the cream reminds me of very fancy brands that I tried years ago. The eye cream doesn&#x27;t bring any tear. The cleanser is rich and gentle. It&#x27;s not made for the eyes though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that brings me down is that I can&#x27;t find them anywhere else on the web, so when it will be time to reorder; it will be complicated. I say it&#x27;s a kit to get before the summer, no harsh perfumes and a good hydration..really cheap! The aging process begins at 25 years old...so when it says anti-aging on a product, it doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s not any good for younger women. I recommend it for yourself or to make a gift.</li>
            <li> This is awesome. Meaningful Beauty was my all time favorite,&lt;br /&gt;until I tried this. So worth it.</li>
            <li> I really loved these products.  I am 48 and it is getting harder and harder to find products that make a difference with tone and elasticity.  These are wonderful...I saw my skin overall tighter and wrinkles decrease. I am going to order more!</li>
            <li> Only the cleanser works ok, but the rest are of these products are totally  dry out!!!&lt;br /&gt;Waste money worst experience</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! Goes on smooth, not greasy, leaves my skin so soft, Love it, definitely planning to order again, try it! You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> At 79yrs old this kit is by far the best of the best for skin care products.  Believe me I have tried them all, inexpensive and very expensive and this is far the best.  People have asked me what am I using and I am happy to tell them Unique.  The price is awsome.  Large size products.  I use them twice a day. A little daub of each is all you need.  Have already ordered a second kit.</li>
            <li> Great product!!!!  Have seen great result with my skin after using these products. Have purchased in the past years eye care products and loved the results and feel the same way about these</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m placing my 2nd order today.  My skin feels firming and softer.  I wish I would have taken some detailed pictures before I started using Unique.  I really think my skin is firmer, especially my neck.  I haven&#x27;t had any comments of validation, but I like the results!</li>
            <li> I never heard about products of this company but price reduction gave a chance. My daughter bought it for me as a gift and I love it, I can see a result almost right the way. If you have tired skin and wrinkles that not big but annoying enough - try it. You will be surprised!</li>
            <li> There products are very similar to a famous brand from Switzerland that sells for many times more. Very good deal.</li>
            <li> This was a great purchase.  My skin is very happy and healthy feeling and you can&#x27;t beat the price!!!</li>
            <li> Not that Good as it looks the smell on them is like they are too old my Face looks shine when I use it</li>
            <li> It was not what what i expected it to be  drys my skin  made my skin itch  so it sits in my bathroom  i guess ill stick to aveno for the face</li>
            <li> So far I am loving this product it makes your skin feel smooth. I am in my late 40&#x27;s and my skin was really starting to show some age. I have only used ths product for a week and I can already see a difference in my skin. Have used renewing mask twice and all the other products 1-2 times a day. Will definitely order more.</li>
            <li> I have very nice skin with very few wrinkles (age 49) but it is extremely sensitive and it is very hard for me to find products that don&#x27;t burn or turn my face red.  I have literally spent hundreds of dollars in my lifetime for products that ended up in the garbage after one use.  So I thought I would give these a try figuring for the price, I wouldn&#x27;t lose much if they didn&#x27;t work out.  I absolutely love all of these products!  They feel like silk when applying and absorb quickly.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if there was any difference in skin tone or appearance as I see my skin daily but a client who I had not seen in a while wanted to know if I had some work done!  That was enough for me to believe this is working.  I just ordered my second batch.  You can&#x27;t beat it for the price and quality.</li>
            <li> I will purchase again--This wonderful collection of full size skin care sells at a terrific price.Compares to much more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> So far just tried the cleanser and the 24 Hour Age Defying Serum. Cleanser is phenomenal.  It&#x27;s gentle to the skin.  A little goes a long way.  The 24 hour serum absorbs quickly and does not leave your skin greasy.  Hydrates your skin well.</li>
            <li> Love love love it! This product is amazing my skin looks and feels great after just one use.</li>
            <li> I am so amazed!  The quality and quanity of the products is outstanding.  I have used Estee Lauder for 30 years, I think I have found my new friend in tis product.</li>
            <li> OH! I simply love these products.  My skin is better than its ever been since I started using this stuff.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with these...just great looking skin and more youthful !</li>
            <li> the product is very good</li>
            <li> Great product and such a great price for the size of bottles. I would recommend this to anyone that has dry sensitive skin and wants to help with their wrinkles. This is just as good or better than meaningful beauty!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Worth buying again. I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used it long enuf really to find out how it really works,  I like it but will take time to see if it really works or not.</li>
            <li> It completely clogged my pores and gave me acne all over my face. Definitely regret buying this!</li>
            <li> This product wasn&#x27;t all that I thought it was I am still waiting for results nothing has happened. I will not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> For the money and all you get it was great. i love the cleanser and mask, my skin looks great afterwards.</li>
            <li> Good product, packaging needs improvement.&lt;br /&gt;Gold on tops comes off easily</li>
            <li> I was so surprised at the quality of this product they are rich and creamy and work very well on my skin. You can not beat the price and l did not receive this product for free. I will reorder !</li>
            <li> This was a waste of my money, it never delivered that it promised</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with this amazing product and the price is perfect.. I will buy it again!!</li>
            <li> These products are unbelievable.  I can&#x27;t tell how many products I have tried the last 40 years, I am 66 years old and I have found them to be better than the higher priced stored products.&lt;br /&gt;This seller was great.  The product came as described and faster than expect.  I would highly recommend them.</li>
