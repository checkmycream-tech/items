            <li>It makes your complexion look great.</li>
            <li>Not as good as I hoped it would be.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Revision Skincare is a good company.  </li>
            <li>Good performing Retinol</li>
            <li>This is a good but product</li>
            <li>Might need more time.</li>
            <li>It definitely helps with cell turnover and I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>They are simply the best.</li>
            <li>But for the price, it is ok.</li>
            <li>Love this product</li>
            <li>Great stuff, really noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>Want to do more research.</li>
            <li>1% retinol is the best product I&#x27;ve found to get the benefits of retinoic acid without the extreme irritation of prescription retinoic acid.  </li>
            <li>Also note that this product, as well as most Vit A products should not be used when pregnant or breast</li>
            <li>I live Environ the best so far.</li>
            <li>It has made a huge difference in the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and I feel refreshed all day.</li>
            <li>The cream is nice, it&#x27;s a bit stong for sensitive skin, I ordered this because I love the neck cream from this skin care line.</li>
            <li>Also, you will want to ensure you use a good sunscreen as Retinol makes your skin sun sensitive which is counter productive for the intent of this product.</li>
            <li>I started the Revision System one month ago and so far so good.  </li>
            <li>I always get good, fast service and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin to begin with, but my dermatologist said this is great</li>
            <li>I love this whole line</li>
            <li>I love the anti-aging benefits but absolutely could not tolerate the prescription form (tretinoin or retinoic acid, i.e. Retin-A).  </li>
            <li>It may be best to introduce it slowly to build tolerance.  </li>
            <li>I have found that 100 % pure sweet almond oil works fantasic!</li>
            <li>It has minimized my fine lines and given an overall more youthful look to my skin.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the results so far.  </li>
            <li>I got tired of trying product after product with so  many additives that cant be good for our skin.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping, product exactly as shown.</li>
            <li>Love the entire Revision line</li>
            <li>Love this entire product line.</li>
            <li>When I first started using it</li>
            <li>Pretty soon you&#x27;ll be using it every night and you will be amazed by the results.</li>
            <li>In my opintion, Vit A is the gold standard skincare ingredient and Revision retinol is my favorite Vit A product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a licensed esthetician and have tried many different Vit A products, including prescription strength.  </li>
            <li>While 1% retinol is a less aggressive form of Vit A than prescription strength retinoic acid, it is still a very potent product.  </li>
            <li>Found it did n ot work but also made my skin even more dry.</li>
            <li>When I went back to using the correct amount, it worked fine.</li>
            <li>If you want smoother skin, floying skin and want wrinkles much dimiished just put a little almond oil on your face and watch amazing results.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I would order again as my senitive skin really burned after using this product.</li>
            <li>There wasn&#x27;t much improvement after 30 days.  </li>
            <li>I bought Revision&#x27;s Nectifirm from a local cosmetic surgeon&#x27;s office and fell in love with it, so I decided to try a few more of their products.  </li>
            <li>The Retinol Facial Repair is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I do really like the Nectifirm made by Revision.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend anything in the revision line!</li>
            <li>Just like it says, it doesn&#x27;t take much.  </li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t take much to cover my whole face</li>
            <li>I love the Revision line thus far, especially the Intellishade.</li>
            <li>I love this product because it doesn&#x27;t burn like other retinol products.  </li>
            <li>This allows them to keep the pricing reasonable for high quality products.</li>
            <li>Had high hoope sof this product.</li>
            <li>just ok, I spent the extra money and bought Retinol Complex by SkinMedica which is working better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have experienced a different outcome, unfortunately, I piled it on night after night.</li>
            <li>, my skin feels soft, and my skin  tone is even.</li>
            <li>As before, I like it so far.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is in a small bottle so easy to take with you on vacation.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to really tell the difference</li>
            <li>I did at first, and my face dried out some.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very dry and sensitive.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a very good skin care product.  I always get good, fast service and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> The cream is nice, it&#x27;s a bit stong for sensitive skin, I ordered this because I love the neck cream from this skin care line. I don&#x27;t know if I would order again as my senitive skin really burned after using this product. Perhaps if I&#x27;d used it a couple of times a week I&#x27;d have experienced a different outcome, unfortunately, I piled it on night after night. My husband who has oily skin loves it, thus would order again for him, but not for me.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it doesn&#x27;t burn like other retinol products.  It goes on smooth and I feel refreshed all day. Definitely a keeper.</li>
            <li> Love the entire Revision line</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product over the course of the last two years and beleive it does what it is supposed to do. My skin is very dry and sensitive. As a result can only use every other night. Also, you will want to ensure you use a good sunscreen as Retinol makes your skin sun sensitive which is counter productive for the intent of this product.</li>
            <li> Not as good as I hoped it would be. I didn&#x27;t expect miracles, but was expecting some improvement.  There wasn&#x27;t much improvement after 30 days.  Might need more time.</li>
            <li> Love this entire product line.</li>
            <li> I bought Revision&#x27;s Nectifirm from a local cosmetic surgeon&#x27;s office and fell in love with it, so I decided to try a few more of their products.  The Retinol Facial Repair is fantastic.  When I first started using it I did notice a burning sensation (because I was using it twice per day), and then I read that you should apply it once per day or every other day until your skin gets used to the product.  I am currently using this at bedtime only and I have not had any issues with the burning sensation since.  It definitely helps with cell turnover and I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I love the Revision line thus far, especially the Intellishade. I just bought the Retinol facial repair and find it is very drying and is making  my skin look worse. I have only used it for a week, but I use it nightly and have not noticed an improvement.  Should I stop using?  I have very dry skin to begin with, but my dermatologist said this is great and I just need to stick it out for a couple weeks and I will see and feel the difference.  Feeling a bit frustrated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it about two months and I think it has greatly improved the texture and color or my skin.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. I have used this for years. I have tried others, but always come back to Revision products. They are simply the best.</li>
            <li> Product just ok, I spent the extra money and bought Retinol Complex by SkinMedica which is working better.</li>
            <li> great product for keeping wrinkles away, i have been using this product for 5 years and always get compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li> I feel that it is making my skin smoother.&lt;br /&gt;It is in a small bottle so easy to take with you on vacation. I use it every night with no problems</li>
            <li> Have used other products that I prefer. I live Environ the best so far. But for the price, it is ok. I do really like the Nectifirm made by Revision.</li>
            <li> Had high hoope sof this product. Found it did n ot work but also made my skin even more dry. I have recently turned to home remedies for facial dry skin and aging skin. I have found that 100 % pure sweet almond oil works fantasic! I got tired of trying product after product with so  many additives that cant be good for our skin. If you want smoother skin, floying skin and want wrinkles much dimiished just put a little almond oil on your face and watch amazing results.</li>
            <li> Had already been using the wash.. Love this product</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping, product exactly as shown. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for awhile now. It has made a huge difference in the appearance of my skin. It has minimized my fine lines and given an overall more youthful look to my skin. I love this whole line</li>
            <li> I have been using Retinol Facial repair for about three in a half weeks now and I am beginning to see a difference in my skin. It has a natural glow to it, I don&#x27;t ware make-up everyday anymore, my skin feels soft, and my skin  tone is even. Can&#x27;t wait to see what the next three weeks will bring!</li>
            <li> Started purchasing this from a dermatologist a couple years ago. Started buying it on Amazon and couldn&#x27;t be happier. It makes your complexion look great. I had my sister buy it though, and she said that she had a little bit of irritation. If that happens to you I would recommend in the beginning just using it 2-three times a week. Pretty soon you&#x27;ll be using it every night and you will be amazed by the results. I would highly recommend anything in the revision line!</li>
            <li> In my opintion, Vit A is the gold standard skincare ingredient and Revision retinol is my favorite Vit A product.  I&#x27;m a licensed esthetician and have tried many different Vit A products, including prescription strength.  I love the anti-aging benefits but absolutely could not tolerate the prescription form (tretinoin or retinoic acid, i.e. Retin-A).  1% retinol is the best product I&#x27;ve found to get the benefits of retinoic acid without the extreme irritation of prescription retinoic acid.  After application, retinol goes through a chemical process to convert to retinoic acid, the same chemical as the prescription form.  (Retinoic acid is the bioavailable form of vit A.)  While 1% retinol is a less aggressive form of Vit A than prescription strength retinoic acid, it is still a very potent product.  It may be best to introduce it slowly to build tolerance.  I only apply it at night.  Also note that this product, as well as most Vit A products should not be used when pregnant or breast feeding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Revision Skincare is a good company.  They are the manufacturer so there is no middleman.  This allows them to keep the pricing reasonable for high quality products.</li>
            <li> Again, this is another product in this line that I purchased.  As before, I like it so far.  Just like it says, it doesn&#x27;t take much.  sont over use.  I did at first, and my face dried out some.  When I went back to using the correct amount, it worked fine.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, really noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> Good performing Retinol</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to really tell the difference but it doesn&#x27;t take much to cover my whole face</li>
            <li> This is a good but product but it does dry your face out.  Use with moisturizer or I use with their vitamin K.</li>
            <li> I started the Revision System one month ago and so far so good.  I rotate the Facial Repair with the Skin Resurfacer.  I am pleased with the results so far.  I&#x27;m not sure if I will stick with this when the bottle is empty and go with the Revox.  Want to do more research.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this brand.</li>
            <li> I use this product daily and I am hooked!</li>
