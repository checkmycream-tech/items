            <li> I ordered this by mistake, and since the directions were in Japanese, I had no idea how to use it or how long to leave it on.  </li>
            <li> By the third time I tried, it was too dry.</li>
            <li> My skin has been horribly dry this winter -- I&#x27;m talking noticeable flaking, scaliness, itching, and nothing</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty expensive, but I save this one for when my skin is super-duper dry and have started using other sheet masks for a total of 2-3 times per week</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive, but it was not the least bit irritated by this product.</li>
            <li> I buy them for airplanes where my skin gets dry and naughty.</li>
            <li> was working -- I was drinking a gallon of water a day, using heavy moisturizer, Vaseline at night, no difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think this mask has some whitening component to it, and it is quite harsh.</li>
            <li> When I first got it, I was a little bit disappointed by the wrap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not appealing, like not at all.</li>
            <li> I do not have exceptionally dry skin, but my skin has been very tired looking lately</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive skin and this mask doesn&#x27;t  have any bad effect to my skin.</li>
            <li> It is too narrow (and I have a thin face) and is very thin between the nose and mouth.</li>
            <li> It made all the difference, my skin was no longer flaky or painfully itchy, and it has noticeably helped some acne scarring I had, as well, and &amp;#34;plumps&amp;#34;</li>

            <li> Not as good as the beauty diary mask.</li>
            <li> The mask arrived quickly  - instructions are not in English but I asked a friend how to use it.  It worked very well.  Very hydrating. I put it on and then went into the steam room.  My skin felt very soft afterwards</li>
            <li> I should buy this mask when I was in Japan last year. This is one of the best facial mask I ever used so far.&lt;br /&gt;I felt so good after using it. But it only comes 5 packs in one box, I can&#x27;t keep using it even I want to....</li>
            <li> My skin has been horribly dry this winter -- I&#x27;m talking noticeable flaking, scaliness, itching, and nothing was working -- I was drinking a gallon of water a day, using heavy moisturizer, Vaseline at night, no difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These masks totally did the trick though.  I put it on for about 40 minutes (they don&#x27;t drip which is pretty convenient), and then allow any left-over stuff to absorb after I take it off.  It made all the difference, my skin was no longer flaky or painfully itchy, and it has noticeably helped some acne scarring I had, as well, and &amp;#34;plumps&amp;#34; the skin a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty expensive, but I save this one for when my skin is super-duper dry and have started using other sheet masks for a total of 2-3 times per week, my skin has been awesome!</li>
            <li> It was my first time to buy Hadabisei mask. When I first got it, I was a little bit disappointed by the wrap. It&#x27;s not appealing, like not at all. And When I put it on. I just fell in love with this product right away. I use masks a lot. And compares with my Beaty diary, this product not that waterish. But because of the material, it helps your skin to absorb every drop of the liquid from the mask. I leave it on my face for 20 mins and massage my face. Don&#x27;t through the used mask away. U can put it on ur neck and leave it for 10-15 min. Or just squeeze the liquid on your hands neck arms wherever u like. It is very moist the next morning.  I have a sensitive skin and this mask doesn&#x27;t  have any bad effect to my skin. Love it a lot.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend - the best</li>
            <li> Love this mask. It was recommended to me by a wardrobe friend who was doing a film and said that these were used all the time by his friend ( a makeup man). I tried them and he was right! They are fabulous!&lt;br /&gt;Leave the liquid on after you take the mask off and rub it into your face. Fabulous !</li>
            <li> Great moisture and hydration! I buy them for airplanes where my skin gets dry and naughty.</li>
            <li> You can pay more, but I doubt you&#x27;ll find a more therapuetic moisture infusing mask. Comes with 5 sheets that can be used more than once as each sheet holds a generous amount of \\&quot;magic\\&quot; fluid. If I don&#x27;t have time to mask my face, then I dip into it and use it that way, although, laying the mask over the entire face as instructed works best for a deep treatment.</li>
            <li> Loved the mask and the package arrived really quick considering it came all the way from Japan. I never tried Asian mask before but this one was highly recommended to me so I tried. Very soft, very moist. I left it for 40 min and my skin was very soft afterward. It can get a bit messy when you&#x27;re putting it on since the mask is really moist but your skin will love it afterward!</li>
            <li> seems pretty good. and you can reuse it once or twice!</li>
            <li> This kind of moisture mask is super moisture！I really like it！！！And I recommended it to my friends， they also like it！！！</li>
            <li> Never expected something to work immediately.  Definitely use as part of the five part system.  Can&#x27;t wait to try for the &amp;#34;winter skin&amp;#34; blues.</li>
            <li> I think this mask has some whitening component to it, and it is quite harsh. I use it on days I do not expose to the sun a lot.&lt;br /&gt;People with sensitive skin should be careful considering using this product because it is quite strong.</li>
            <li> Great Mask, not allergic, doesn&#x27;t break me out</li>

            <li> Very good moisturizing mask. My skin is sensitive, but it was not the least bit irritated by this product. I do not have exceptionally dry skin, but my skin has been very tired looking lately so I thought I would try this and I am very pleased with my results.&lt;br /&gt;Though I look like a potential axe murderer with it on, the result is well worth it.</li>
            <li> This really works! It moisturizes your face and plumps up fine lines. Leaves skin super soft!</li>

I think I left it on about 20 minutes and I was amazed by how good my skin looked and felt.  I have VERY sensitive skin, and I had fabulous results.  I plan to leave it on longer the next time.</li>
            <li> it is great, my wife like it</li>
            <li> I ordered this on a whim and so far have enjoyed using the masks. This particular paper mask isn&#x27;t a very good fit for my face. It is too narrow (and I have a thin face) and is very thin between the nose and mouth. However I was able to tug it into place more or less. There is a generous amount of serum in the packet so after I used it the first time, I folded it back into it&#x27;s foil packet, stapled it shut and saved it in the freezer to use again. There was plenty of serum for a second use. By the third time I tried, it was too dry. So I&#x27;ll count on each of these for 2 uses. If it were a better fit, I&#x27;d repurchase but I will try another brand.</li>
            <li> it is good for my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have been very happy with these masks. They are inexpensive, but come soaking in juices and do their job.</li>
            <li> Really works! Was recommended by friend, and was srprised how easily it applies and how smooth the skin is after.</li>
            <li> Deep moistrorize on my face. I live in a very dry area, and this really helps my face. I can feel it after first time use. The skin feels more soft and moist.</li>
            <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
            <li> the packing box was damaged, but the I still like it.</li>
            <li> Good product, the sheet fits really well and has sufficient moisture.</li>
            <li> My wife is very satisfied with the facial masks.</li>
            <li> Good face mask but can&#x27;t tell better than other masks</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in it but it feels cooling and tingly.  I leave it on for 30 minutes or so and then rinse and it leaves my skin feeling good.</li>
