            <li> I&#x27;m an ex-hairdresser who did extraordinary hair styles in San Franciso at salons (in the 1960 - 1975 era) . I then gave that up to become a computer printed-circuit board designer (for bigger bucks) and a much  better career - good decision! I actually discovered Roux Fermodyl while a hairresser and used in on any customer with thin, fine or limp, or overprocessed, or dull hair. There were a lot of them -fermodyl was my secret hair magic (it cost about $8.00 per salon application back then !! Adds body, life, shine, and really smooths the hair cuticle. I have used it ever since . . . . so I really freaked when my local Beauty Supply told me that Roux was discontinuing this product. My hair is not the same without it. I am 73 now and I hate my grey. It is dull and lifeless Makes me look like I really am 73 and I really totally dislike that look. I am now stocking up on Fermodyl 07  and plan to keep a genrous supply on hand until there is no more anywhere - or luxuroius looking hair is no longer the ideal. Ha, ha!</li>
            <li> Very good transaction.  Delivered as expected and the product was what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Where was this product all my life?  My hair loves it and I do too! It makes one&#x27;s hair stronger from the inside out! I use it twice weekly on dry hair and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> Loved this product used it in the early 80s when I was a hairdresser, have always been looking for it ever since, you go into hair supply places and they do not know what you are talking about.

I will continue purchasing from Amazon  on this product as long as they can keep getting it.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It was recommended to me by my hair dresser....thank you for selling it. It arrived as stated with no problems.</li>
            <li> Great stuff and it is so easy to use... no rinsing..  have used for many years...  thrilled to be able to get here.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Have used it for many years.</li>
            <li> I have used Fermodyl since 20 years old, recommended by my hairdresser, since I am a processed blonde. I am middle-aged now, and my hair is still silky and shiny, like young peoples&#x27; hair! I don&#x27;t use it every shampoo anymore, due to a fixed income, however definitely after processing, and weekends.</li>
            <li> great..helped my fine hair</li>
            <li> Great hair conditioner, this item is very hard to find in most beauty supply stores. This product has been on the market for years. I was very happy to find this product, after looking in many stores.</li>
            <li> My hair had been getting thin due to medication, and it is now getting more body and some is starting to grow back.  It is too soon to tell whether the Fermodyl is actually doing the job, but it certainly is making my hair fluffy and looking better.</li>
            <li> I am a retired hairdresser and have used this product since it first was marketed. It is just what I need for my hair. Love it.</li>
            <li> Normally, my hair is fine and limp....but now that I have been diagnosed with diabetes, my hair is in terrible condition.  This disease is totally dehydrating my hair.  My hair feels like straw....so I ordered fermodyl  to treat it.  Years ago in Beauty School, this was the product we used for different types of hair damage.  The number &amp;#34;07&amp;#34; was for over-processed hair....but I haven&#x27;t over-processed my hair in many years....but this disease known as diabetes, will dry your skin...your hair...and your nails.  I&#x27;m dry all over...which will make you itch.  I&#x27;ve been moisturizing my skin....and now that I have fermodyl...my hair feels like real hair again.  Thank you, Fermodyl!!!</li>
            <li> I am &amp;#34;folically-challenged&amp;#34; so I do not use hair products !!! However my wife has used this consistently and we keep the name / order information for re-ordering. Gives alot of life and vibrance to her hair (long, curly, red).</li>
            <li> Excellent For My Hair-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for many, many years and find that it works &amp;#34;Wonders&amp;#34; on my hair.  I have very fine hair and it really helps to strengthen it and makes it look much fuller.  I am &amp;#34;Sold&amp;#34; on this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Farrell E.  Manuel</li>
            <li> I am a retired hair stylist and I can tell you from years and years of experience that Fermodyl is a fabulous product. It is the best, and nothing can compare with it, in my experience. If your hair is sun damaged. chemically damaged, heat or curling iron damage, dry from lack of correct nutrition, kinky,delicate, too curly, dry breaking hair, limp or fine hair then Fermodyl is the answer. I prefer 07 but the others are great too. It is the best, in my opinion and has been around forever.</li>
            <li> If anything, it made my hair very limp and fly away.  It obviously wasn&#x27;t suited for my type of fine hair.</li>
            <li> Fermodyl works wonderfully! It makes my hair stronger &amp; doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. I lose less hair when I consistently use Fermodyl.</li>
