            <li>Love this cologne.</li>
            <li>for the price is ok.</li>
            <li>This stuff is no Jo Malone scent; it&#x27;s incredibly potent.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>Completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>Only the brave!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best suited for those who want a powerful cologne that&#x27;s masculine and long-lasting.</li>
            <li>This stuff is strong.</li>
            <li>A great place to search and fined pretty much anything your looking for.</li>
            <li>A member of my family was using it and loved it.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to take a chance and purchase it for my husband (something I usually do not do - body chemistry etc.</li>
            <li>Bogart Pour Homme seems to be one of those fantastic, \\&quot;undiscovered\\&quot; men&#x27;s fragrances.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Very nice and, to my nose, very masculine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Starts out a bit sweet then shifts into woody/tobacco.</li>
            <li>Not a scent for young men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One, or, at most, two light sprays to where your throat meets your chest -</li>
            <li>Great smell but doesn&#x27;t last for as long as I&#x27;m out and about.</li>
            <li>this is my third order of this product as I have received so many compliments on this fragrance my go to Cologne</li>
            <li>Personally, I would rate it in the Top 5.</li>
            <li>only exception is cheaper thanks  from a satisfied customer</li>
            <li>like the real thing as in</li>
            <li>but it smells just like the real Cologne</li>
            <li>Very pleasing.</li>
            <li>Very linear.</li>
            <li>he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>The scent is definitely something to get used to, since it&#x27;s strong and reminds me of Burberry&#x27;s London for men but with more fruit notes and less musk.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something unique that I could wear regularly.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s pretty much all I smell from beginning until nearly the end, when it smells less like cherry tobacco and more like Tonka</li>
            <li>you can pay a lot more  for a lot less</li>
            <li>Just a few sprays and it lasts most of the day.</li>
            <li>More than a few</li>
            <li>I believe the scent is actually better after a little time has passed (very strong initially but settles down).</li>
            <li>The scent is masculine and not sweet like so many colognes are today.  </li>
            <li>Once you get pass the first initial spray.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>The cherry tobacco, though I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s technically one of the notes, is very linear.</li>
            <li>Very strong and long lasting manly scent, old school stuff last long and projects</li>
            <li>Once dried down for a few hours it&#x27;s great</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It is sweet, yet hints of tobacco once dried down.</li>
            <li> Strong but not overwhelming, a little bit goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so strong that it can cause minor irritation if you apply it directly on your skin, especially in delicate areas such as the neck and armpits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not in a bad way the dry down is very nice.</li>
            <li> + men&#x27;s fragrances in the past year including the most expensive -all</li>
            <li> The  product was as described and expected.</li>
            <li> Bogart has a few different ones,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> And purchased for a fraction of what other colognes sell for.</li>
            <li> A few squirts and women will be chasing after you like Zombies looking for brains.</li>
            <li> And over time it just gets so dusty and powdery that it provokes choking.</li>
            <li> I thought it was fake</li>
            <li> Given the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong buying it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not for the faint of heart.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is primarily a cold weather scent.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Great smell but doesn&#x27;t last for as long as I&#x27;m out and about.</li>
            <li> escandalosa fragancia con fuertes cantidades de vainilla, pero una vainilla muy irritante, eso si, su sillage y longevidad son tremendas...si te gustan fragancias extremas, puede ser que te guste, aparte, por el precio vale la pena el riesgo</li>
            <li> like the real thing as in I thought it was fake but it smells just like the real Cologne only exception is cheaper thanks  from a satisfied customer</li>
            <li> Are you looking for an Instant Panty-Dropper on a budget? Well look no further Friends, this is the cologne for you. Bath in a mist of this on your neck and it will make their panties literally melt off their bodies! I&#x27;ve never met a lady who didn&#x27;t love Bogart. A few squirts and women will be chasing after you like Zombies looking for brains. Make sure you are well stocked up on Trojans when you check out with this cologne.</li>
            <li> Great!!!!!  Love this cologne.</li>
            <li> for the price is ok. I will not buy again</li>
            <li> Smells great. And purchased for a fraction of what other colognes sell for.</li>
            <li> Everything worked out great,delivery was as promised,shipped well,and packed well. The  product was as described and expected. A great place to search and fined pretty much anything your looking for.</li>
            <li> this is my third order of this product as I have received so many compliments on this fragrance my go to Cologne</li>
            <li> It smells great, hubby loved it for Christmas.  Awesome fragrance lasts a very long time, a turn on 4 sure!!!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is strong. Not in a bad way the dry down is very nice. Once you get pass the first initial spray.</li>
            <li> Strong but not overwhelming, a little bit goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starts out a bit sweet then shifts into woody/tobacco. Very nice scent!</li>
            <li> Bogart Pour Homme seems to be one of those fantastic, \\&quot;undiscovered\\&quot; men&#x27;s fragrances. I have tried 100+ men&#x27;s fragrances in the past year including the most expensive -all the Creeds, Clive Christians, Bonds, etc. This is absolutely one of the best. Personally, I would rate it in the Top 5. Given the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong buying it. The smell is wonderful, the projection is awesome, and it lasts for hours and hours without diminishing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d how to describe the smell. It is sweet, yet hints of tobacco once dried down. Very pleasing. It does go on quite strong tho!!! Just beware of that. Once dried down for a few hours it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> This fragrance is cherry pipe tobacco. Very linear. That&#x27;s pretty much all I smell from beginning until nearly the end, when it smells less like cherry tobacco and more like Tonka bean/vanilla.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is primarily a cold weather scent. In the summer it is way too cloyingly tonka bean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very nice and, to my nose, very masculine. Not a scent for young men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One, or, at most, two light sprays to where your throat meets your chest - that&#x27;s all you need. This stuff is no Jo Malone scent; it&#x27;s incredibly potent. A bottle will last forever. I once sprayed one squirt onto my inner elbow. It made its way to my shirt. It was there for a week until I got it laundered!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it. And I paid all of $17 for my bottle online. Wow.</li>
            <li> The cherry tobacco, though I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s technically one of the notes, is very linear. And over time it just gets so dusty and powdery that it provokes choking. I gave mine away.</li>
            <li> The scent is definitely something to get used to, since it&#x27;s strong and reminds me of Burberry&#x27;s London for men but with more fruit notes and less musk. All in all, it&#x27;s nice. Just a few sprays and it lasts most of the day. More than a few and you&#x27;ll probably turn heads.</li>
            <li> Very strong and long lasting manly scent, old school stuff last long and projects well.  you can pay a lot more  for a lot less</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this Eau de Toilette spray, while in Israel. A member of my family was using it and loved it.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to take a chance and purchase it for my husband (something I usually do not do - body chemistry etc.,).&lt;br /&gt;I was very successful! he absolutely loves it. So I rushed to Amazon and bought a second one. Bogart has a few different ones,&lt;br /&gt;but this is the favorite.&lt;br /&gt;The service was excellent too and everyone is very happy.</li>
            <li> The scent is masculine and not sweet like so many colognes are today.  I was looking for something unique that I could wear regularly.  I believe the scent is actually better after a little time has passed (very strong initially but settles down).</li>
            <li> Completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I like it, but it&#x27;s definitely not for everyone. It&#x27;s best suited for those who want a powerful cologne that&#x27;s masculine and long-lasting. It&#x27;s so strong that it can cause minor irritation if you apply it directly on your skin, especially in delicate areas such as the neck and armpits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not for the faint of heart. Only the brave!</li>
