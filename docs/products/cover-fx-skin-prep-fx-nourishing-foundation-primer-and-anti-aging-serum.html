            <li>It is nice as a moisturizer for the price point.</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice product that does the job.  </li>
            <li>Cover FX Skin Prep does a really great job making my foundation go on more smoothly and stay on longer.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smooth and not oily at all.</li>
            <li>Not greasy and really gives face a great look.</li>
            <li>I have tried many primers, will stick with this one.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>Love this product..</li>
            <li>I love it been using it for over 5 years and wouldn&#x27;t change it for anything else.  </li>
            <li>Makeup goes on easily but last and looks flawless.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff not greasy easy to prep for your foundation.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s lovely and light, affordable, and does what it is supposed to</li>
            <li>But as soon as I have a light layer smoothed on, it magically dries without a hint of shine or oiliness.  </li>
            <li>It seems to help my daytime tinter moisturizer/base to lie more smoothly.</li>
            <li>Like I said, this one feels oily and spreads easily as oil would.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>This product makes your skin feel fantastic.</li>
            <li>I first tried this as a sample, it appears as if it is going to be oily, Not at all!!.</li>
            <li>Makes skin smooth and goes on so clean.</li>
            <li>Make up glides on, your skin feels clean and moist for hours and hours, and even at the end of the day, your foundation looks fresh.  </li>
            <li>it is ultimately hydrating, isn&#x27;t oily or greasy and absorbs fast which is great if you&#x27;re in a hurry.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I love this product; it makes my skin dewey soft.....</li>
            <li>pretty decent for the price, doesnt irritate my skin and seems to blend well and help with makeup  staying power</li>
            <li>For the price I expected more.</li>
            <li>this is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased this.. and it makes your face feel so smooth...</li>
            <li>I discovered that it prevents irritation due to cannula for those who need oxygen; the primer allows the tubing to glide over the face and other areas of contact so that friction is greatly reduced.</li>
            <li>But this works as well, if not better and is definitely more economical.</li>
            <li>and I like it maybe a little bit more.</li>
            <li>But CoverFX helps make the best of a bad situation</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this primer</li>
            <li>It is also useful in treating minor skin irritations.  </li>
            <li>I just need a little, light undercoat to keep my skin moist when I wear foundation, and that&#x27;s what Cover FX provides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using a European \\&quot;botanical equivalent\\&quot; placental extract since the sobering day a clever saleswoman first told me that facial primers existed and I was in dire need of one.</li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t already having enough fun trying to stop the clock with serums, co-enzyme Q-10 rejuvenators, moisturizers, exfoliants, alpha-hydroxy skin peelers, eye bag shrinkers, pentapeptide-laced wrinkle fillers, pore shrinking astringents, at-home facial endermologie and the blood of virgins, here&#x27;s something else to add to the before-bed regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and a half, and people keep complimenting me on my &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; and how good my (late 30s)</li>
            <li>When I first opened the tube I was dismayed due to the oily feel.</li>
            <li>You know you&#x27;re past your sell-by date when Facial Primer becomes important.  </li>
            <li>While the color is apparent when it comes out of the tube, it isn&#x27;t visible at all on the face.</li>

            <li> Amazing best primer I&#x27;ve tired. Goes on smooth. Makes skin smooth and goes on so clean. Not greasy and really gives face a great look. Makeup goes on easily but last and looks flawless.  I was impressed limits pore size and gives a smooth and even look. No caking I did give it a minute or so after applying. It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff not greasy easy to prep for your foundation.</li>
            <li> this is a great product and I won&#x27;t use anything else!  It goes on very smooth and not oily at all.</li>
            <li> You know you&#x27;re past your sell-by date when Facial Primer becomes important.  But CoverFX helps make the best of a bad situation, it&#x27;s lovely and light, affordable, and does what it is supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using a European \\&quot;botanical equivalent\\&quot; placental extract since the sobering day a clever saleswoman first told me that facial primers existed and I was in dire need of one. Pronto.  The Cover FX version costs about 1/4 of what European stuff does and works just as well. Make up glides on, your skin feels clean and moist for hours and hours, and even at the end of the day, your foundation looks fresh.  Other primers I&#x27;ve tried are really heavy and feel sticky. Made to \\&quot;fill in\\&quot; wrinkles and enlarged pores. they feel almost like a mask. Hey, I&#x27;m not Shrek. Yet. I don&#x27;t need spackle. Yet. I just need a little, light undercoat to keep my skin moist when I wear foundation, and that&#x27;s what Cover FX provides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This versatile little product even promises to delay Spackle Day by doubling as a rejuvenating night serum. If you aren&#x27;t already having enough fun trying to stop the clock with serums, co-enzyme Q-10 rejuvenators, moisturizers, exfoliants, alpha-hydroxy skin peelers, eye bag shrinkers, pentapeptide-laced wrinkle fillers, pore shrinking astringents, at-home facial endermologie and the blood of virgins, here&#x27;s something else to add to the before-bed regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll revisit this review after I&#x27;ve had a chance to test the rejuvenating benefits.  Look, I don&#x27;t expect miracles. I just want to keep lying about my age without hearing guffaws. We&#x27;ll see. It would help if everyone prayed a little too.</li>
            <li> There is really no coverage at all. While the color is apparent when it comes out of the tube, it isn&#x27;t visible at all on the face. It is nice as a moisturizer for the price point.</li>
            <li> I first tried this as a sample, it appears as if it is going to be oily, Not at all!!. it is ultimately hydrating, isn&#x27;t oily or greasy and absorbs fast which is great if you&#x27;re in a hurry. I have tried many primers, will stick with this one.</li>
            <li> Sort of sticky so let it dry. I think it&#x27;s okay. For the price I expected more.</li>
            <li> Love this product.. this is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased this.. and it makes your face feel so smooth...</li>
            <li> I have used this as both my moisturizer and anti-aging primer for some time now.  It is also useful in treating minor skin irritations.  I discovered that it prevents irritation due to cannula for those who need oxygen; the primer allows the tubing to glide over the face and other areas of contact so that friction is greatly reduced.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product and the price is right!</li>
            <li> Nice product. Sad to see it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good but not as good as I thought</li>
            <li> THIS WORKS SO GOOD IN MY SKIN ,I AM 44 AND THIS IS GREAT ON MY SKIN ,HIGLY RECOMMEND AND GOOD PRICE</li>
            <li> I love this product; it makes my skin dewey soft.....too bad it has been discontinued in stores and replaced with a new formula.</li>
            <li> pretty decent for the price, doesnt irritate my skin and seems to blend well and help with makeup  staying power</li>
            <li> Works beautifully under my FX foundation.</li>
            <li> When I first opened the tube I was dismayed due to the oily feel. I have oily skin and the last thing I need is a primer that adds oil.  But I tried it and I&#x27;m very happy with it.  It feels unlike other primers which you can feel the silicone which helps them glide on. Like I said, this one feels oily and spreads easily as oil would. But as soon as I have a light layer smoothed on, it magically dries without a hint of shine or oiliness.  I was very fond of an expensive (Arbonne) primer, which I&#x27;ve used for several years.  But this works as well, if not better and is definitely more economical.</li>
            <li> Love this product !  It does make skin look dewy and flawless...It does, what it states it does!</li>
            <li> Cover FX Skin Prep does a really great job making my foundation go on more smoothly and stay on longer.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this primer</li>
            <li> I use this product on myself and my clients.  I cannot tell you how many of those clients have commented on its pleasant scent or the feeling of &amp;#34;silk&amp;#34; on their skin.  It&#x27;s a nice product that does the job.  The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because I&#x27;ve been trying the Smashbox primer and I like it maybe a little bit more.</li>
            <li> This product makes your skin feel fantastic. I put a dab on makeup on my face and then add this product. Makes the makeup glide on and makes your skin look flawless.</li>
            <li> I love it been using it for over 5 years and wouldn&#x27;t change it for anything else.  Well did try a few months back and nothing even comes close to this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and a half, and people keep complimenting me on my &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; and how good my (late 30s) skin looks, or how I am looking younger.  It seems to help my daytime tinter moisturizer/base to lie more smoothly.</li>
