            <li>I&#x27;ve been told they will be on her permanent shopping list. :-)</li>
            <li>I am glad I took the time to read the reviews.</li>
            <li>I have bought more than one.</li>
            <li>I love it so much more than the product I used to purchase.  </li>

            <li>I love the experience with HSI.</li>
            <li>I love the way this product makes my hair feel.  </li>
            <li>I had always been satisfied with chi</li>
            <li>I love love love love it.</li>
            <li>I have really enjoyed this and all of my girlfriends that have used it have as well.</li>
            <li>Thumbs up for the innovative idea to have a pump as a dispenser.</li>
            <li>and I love both products.</li>
            <li>After i shampooed my hair, it was noticeably softer and more manageable and the deep mask conditioner was phenomenal!!!  </li>
            <li>My hair looks healthy,  feels soft and it smells really good too!</li>
            <li>nothing strong, just a nice, clean scent.  </li>
            <li>love this product , makes your hair feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li>conditioner/oil leaves my hair feeling really soft and shiny and it smells great.</li>
            <li>It keeps the hair looking smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li>To be fair, I have not increased how much I put on -</li>
            <li>br /&gt;it came fast, is a good quality.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I could manage my curly hair easily with this oil.</li>
            <li>The order was delivered very quickly too.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling greasy but leaves it looking healthy and full of life.</li>
            <li>My 16 year old went sulphate free a year ago and has loved the effect this healthy oil has had on her hair.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and the transaction was nice and easy, just like it should be.</li>
            <li>Then I ordered HSI&#x27;s hair staightener (also wonderful), and they sent a little bottle of the Argan oil along with it.</li>
            <li>High quality oil, hair looks very healthy and shinny after it is styled.</li>
            <li>These HSI products are by far the best products I have ever invested in, they leave my hair soft, with shine without the access oils</li>
            <li>each strand leaves the hair unbelievably smooth, with a shine.  </li>
            <li>She has curly dryish hair and has used dozens if not hundreds of different &amp;#34;curly hair&amp;#34; products over the years, but had never been truly happy with any of them.  </li>
            <li>I admit I am not the best at wiping it down once cool</li>
            <li>I have tried one other argan oil product and it was good, but I came back to this one because it is excellent!</li>
            <li>Well worth it!</li>
            <li>Not only does it give healthy appearance but makes it more manageable also!</li>
            <li>and it made my baby fine hair feel much thicker and more texturized.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair super shiny and soft and so much more manageable in our extremely high humidity where I live, it&#x27;s just awesome</li>
            <li>- I do give it 4 stars since it has not been as great in our dry, winter weather.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair nice and soft!</li>
            <li>my hair was soft full of body, and healthy looking!</li>
            <li>I tried it, not expecting anything special, but I literally haven&#x27;t used another product since.</li>
            <li>Apply right before blow drying my hair and it turns silky smooth every time.</li>
            <li>This is the first time ever that my hair is silky and growing strong.</li>
            <li>i purchased the whole set, and it was SO worth it!!</li>
            <li>I work out daily and these products are wonderful in getting the mositure back after washing.</li>
            <li>Love this product makes my hair so soft and protects it from heat!!</li>
            <li>I always have very long hair thus am in need of good hair product.</li>
            <li>It gets absorbed quickly and does not leave a greasy feel.</li>
            <li>This oil did good job on my split and dry hair end.</li>
            <li>I use this product every time i style my hair and it has definitely helped prevent it from becoming more damaged.</li>
            <li>but with this it isnt such a huge deal because as I said no build up!!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>A full size bottle lasts forever, as you don&#x27;t need very much (about a quarter sized amount on my mid-back length hair).</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave that &amp;#34;gunky&amp;#34; feel like other styling products and has a pleasant smell as well.  </li>
            <li>Awesome service product is ok make my hair a little softer but not what i expected</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair soft, manageable and silky smooth!</li>
            <li>Makes my hair 100% more manageable, soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very hopeful, and ready to see any new/better changes to my hair after using these products, and I am sure to purchase again.</li>
            <li>It is totally worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always struggled with finding the right hair product</li>
            <li>My hair is always so silky, smooth, vibrant and void of flyaways.</li>
            <li>The smell of the oil is very nice and not strong to me.</li>
            <li>The only thing good I can say is that it leaves the hair feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a 10 for about a year and a half, it was good</li>
            <li>This product works miracles for my hair and the shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li>Did I mention that it is very reasonably priced?</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast, and bottle was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>it stays soft and free of frizzies.  </li>
            <li>They are now her absolute favorites!  </li>
            <li>It would be helpful if the product can be packaged better in the future.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for this product my whole life!</li>
            <li>At first my concern was is it too oily, will my hair feel greasy</li>
            <li>Thanks HSI!</li>
            <li>and she told me it leaves her hair soft and smooth and there is no greasy look.</li>
            <li>And if you are looking for a sulfate free shampoo, they have a natural variety one too.</li>
            <li>I always use it as a coating before I use the hot straightening iron.</li>
            <li>i would most definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time trying a leave-in conditioner</li>
            <li>I already used 3 bottles, really!</li>
            <li>My wife absolutely loves HSI products with argon oil!</li>
            <li>i Loooove this oil so much!</li>
            <li>I plan on ordering more in the future!</li>
            <li>Unless you have flat fine hair, do not buy this!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different products to help tame my frizz-prone hair, and I had been pretty satisfied with Aveda&#x27;s Smooth Infusion.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need a lot and surely this whole botte will last me awhile.</li>
            <li>When used when straightening my hair, made my hair feel silky smooth and soft along with no frizz and very manageable.</li>
            <li>I transferred some of the liquid into a small pump bottle (another brand, which was good, but not like this stuff) and applying the product by pumping a bit into my hand became easier.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think any of the others are as pure as HSI&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I have done color treatments on my hair, so finding a good brand to deal with a number of color treatments is hard to find.</li>
            <li>It gets rid of the frizz and makes it much easier to style.  </li>
            <li>I have a very curly hair and with the use of this product, my hair looks shiny even when it dries up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s helping so much with my frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and convenient.</li>
            <li>All things considered, there isn&#x27;t anything more I could have expected or asked for from this experience.</li>
            <li>and it really stops her hair from frizzing.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>There are 4 girls in our family and we all have very curly hair.  </li>
            <li>This oil works better than any other heat protectorate I&#x27;ve used I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I originally bought the HSI Argan oil products for my wife as a Christmas present.</li>
            <li>Thanks I will be using these products as long as they are available.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall - I am very pleased with this - a little goes a long way and is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Not only is it a lot of product, but it&#x27;s inexpensive and true to its quality.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without!</li>
            <li>It made it less frizzy and more manageable.</li>
            <li>It left my hair silky smooth, unbelievably soft, AND held my curls.</li>
            <li>I really like this oil, it smells good and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>but like it just as much as a leave-in conditioner, it makes the hair incredibly soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I really like the  HSI Professional argan oil product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using HSI products for a few months now and it has noticeable made my thinning hair have more body and shine.  </li>
            <li>I was amazed that now she is styling her hair well and without complaint on her own.</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t have anything negative to say about this product.</li>
            <li>You only need a tiny amount, maybe like a dime size or smaller because it can easily make your hair look greasy if you use too much!!</li>
            <li>This product works better than other products in the same category.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft and smooth, and I notice significantly less frizz on rainy or humid days.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t really work very well that way or using after i blow dry.</li>
            <li>I went from rough to smooth in a short while.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Pro - very simple to use and does not require much to make hair soft</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair soft, shiny and moisturizers all day.</li>
            <li>Helps make hair soft and shiny .</li>
            <li>The next day my hair still was straight with some touch ups.</li>
            <li>It keeps it soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping from Blue Novelties.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel soft and doesn&#x27;t look or feel greasy.</li>
            <li>I have natural 4c hair</li>
            <li>It works well at managing frizz and keeps the hair soft.</li>
            <li>My hair has been so dry all my life and this is the first product that has made my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>It finally is laying down and smooth</li>
            <li>Love that it only takes a little so the bottle will last!</li>
            <li>I usually use a keratin spray but this blows that out of the water for adding a smooth shiny lustre to my hair.  </li>
            <li>received a small sample when I bought my HI flat Iron and was absolutely in love with how my hair looked.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also have used pure argan oil, and it is leaves my hair with that greasy/oily look if I put it in when my hair is dry.  </li>
            <li>I use both the HSI Flat Iron (http://www.amazon.com/HSI-PROFESSIONAL-TOURMALINE-STRAIGHTENER-Treatment/dp/B001MA0QY2/ref&#x3D;sr_1_6?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1428597662&amp;sr&#x3D;8-6&amp;keywords&#x3D;hsi+curling+iron) and a deep wave curler (to smooth out my tight, natural curl) and</li>
            <li>The oil replenishes her over worked hair back into the silky soft  condition that both of us appreciate.</li>
            <li>She is very fussy about her hair and really tries to take care of it</li>
            <li>I am a person who rarely uses heat on my hair due to a fear of damage; however I ordered this product to use when I decided to flat iron my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft, even after torturing it day after day with a blow dryer, flat iron, and hot round brush.</li>
            <li>It has been COLD up  here, and I find it helps keep it smooth and soft but not as much.  </li>
            <li>I have long naturally curly hair and use about a nickel size amount of this in my hair while damp</li>
            <li>If you have thick frizzy and full hair like me, go for Tresemme (spelling) products.  </li>
            <li>hair is strong curly hair and it is so thin and no power because i always use iron to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been told they will be on her permanent shopping list. :-)</li>
            <li> I am glad I took the time to read the reviews.</li>
            <li> I have bought more than one.</li>
            <li> I love it so much more than the product I used to purchase.  </li>
            <li> I love love love this product.</li>

            <li> I love the experience with HSI.</li>
            <li> I love the way this product makes my hair feel.  </li>
            <li> I had always been satisfied with chi</li>
            <li> I love love love love it.</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed this and all of my girlfriends that have used it have as well.</li>
            <li> Thumbs up for the innovative idea to have a pump as a dispenser.</li>
            <li> and I love both products.</li>
            <li> After i shampooed my hair, it was noticeably softer and more manageable and the deep mask conditioner was phenomenal!!!  </li>
            <li> My hair looks healthy,  feels soft and it smells really good too!</li>
            <li> nothing strong, just a nice, clean scent.  </li>
            <li> love this product , makes your hair feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li> conditioner/oil leaves my hair feeling really soft and shiny and it smells great.</li>
            <li> It keeps the hair looking smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li> To be fair, I have not increased how much I put on -</li>
            <li> br /&gt;it came fast, is a good quality.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I could manage my curly hair easily with this oil.</li>
            <li> The order was delivered very quickly too.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling greasy but leaves it looking healthy and full of life.</li>
            <li> My 16 year old went sulphate free a year ago and has loved the effect this healthy oil has had on her hair.  </li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and the transaction was nice and easy, just like it should be.</li>
            <li> Then I ordered HSI&#x27;s hair staightener (also wonderful), and they sent a little bottle of the Argan oil along with it.</li>
            <li> High quality oil, hair looks very healthy and shinny after it is styled.</li>
            <li> These HSI products are by far the best products I have ever invested in, they leave my hair soft, with shine without the access oils</li>
            <li> each strand leaves the hair unbelievably smooth, with a shine.  </li>
            <li> She has curly dryish hair and has used dozens if not hundreds of different &amp;#34;curly hair&amp;#34; products over the years, but had never been truly happy with any of them.  </li>
            <li> I admit I am not the best at wiping it down once cool</li>
            <li> I have tried one other argan oil product and it was good, but I came back to this one because it is excellent!</li>
            <li> Well worth it!</li>
            <li> Not only does it give healthy appearance but makes it more manageable also!</li>
            <li> and it made my baby fine hair feel much thicker and more texturized.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair super shiny and soft and so much more manageable in our extremely high humidity where I live, it&#x27;s just awesome</li>
            <li> - I do give it 4 stars since it has not been as great in our dry, winter weather.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair nice and soft!</li>
            <li> my hair was soft full of body, and healthy looking!</li>
            <li> I tried it, not expecting anything special, but I literally haven&#x27;t used another product since.</li>
            <li> Apply right before blow drying my hair and it turns silky smooth every time.</li>
            <li> This is the first time ever that my hair is silky and growing strong.</li>
            <li> i purchased the whole set, and it was SO worth it!!</li>
            <li> I work out daily and these products are wonderful in getting the mositure back after washing.</li>
            <li> Love this product makes my hair so soft and protects it from heat!!</li>
            <li> I always have very long hair thus am in need of good hair product.</li>
            <li> It gets absorbed quickly and does not leave a greasy feel.</li>
            <li> This oil did good job on my split and dry hair end.</li>
            <li> I use this product every time i style my hair and it has definitely helped prevent it from becoming more damaged.</li>
            <li> but with this it isnt such a huge deal because as I said no build up!!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> A full size bottle lasts forever, as you don&#x27;t need very much (about a quarter sized amount on my mid-back length hair).</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave that &amp;#34;gunky&amp;#34; feel like other styling products and has a pleasant smell as well.  </li>
            <li> Awesome service product is ok make my hair a little softer but not what i expected</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair soft, manageable and silky smooth!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair 100% more manageable, soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very hopeful, and ready to see any new/better changes to my hair after using these products, and I am sure to purchase again.</li>
            <li> It is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always struggled with finding the right hair product</li>
            <li> My hair is always so silky, smooth, vibrant and void of flyaways.</li>
            <li> The smell of the oil is very nice and not strong to me.</li>
            <li> The only thing good I can say is that it leaves the hair feeling soft.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 10 for about a year and a half, it was good</li>
            <li> This product works miracles for my hair and the shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li> Did I mention that it is very reasonably priced?</li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast, and bottle was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> it stays soft and free of frizzies.  </li>
            <li> They are now her absolute favorites!  </li>
            <li> It would be helpful if the product can be packaged better in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this product my whole life!</li>
            <li> At first my concern was is it too oily, will my hair feel greasy</li>
            <li> Thanks HSI!</li>
            <li> and she told me it leaves her hair soft and smooth and there is no greasy look.</li>
            <li> And if you are looking for a sulfate free shampoo, they have a natural variety one too.</li>
            <li> I always use it as a coating before I use the hot straightening iron.</li>
            <li> i would most definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time trying a leave-in conditioner</li>
            <li> I already used 3 bottles, really!</li>
            <li> My wife absolutely loves HSI products with argon oil!</li>
            <li> i Loooove this oil so much!</li>
            <li> I plan on ordering more in the future!</li>
            <li> Unless you have flat fine hair, do not buy this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different products to help tame my frizz-prone hair, and I had been pretty satisfied with Aveda&#x27;s Smooth Infusion.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need a lot and surely this whole botte will last me awhile.</li>
            <li> When used when straightening my hair, made my hair feel silky smooth and soft along with no frizz and very manageable.</li>
            <li> I transferred some of the liquid into a small pump bottle (another brand, which was good, but not like this stuff) and applying the product by pumping a bit into my hand became easier.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think any of the others are as pure as HSI&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I have done color treatments on my hair, so finding a good brand to deal with a number of color treatments is hard to find.</li>
            <li> It gets rid of the frizz and makes it much easier to style.  </li>
            <li> I have a very curly hair and with the use of this product, my hair looks shiny even when it dries up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helping so much with my frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and convenient.</li>
            <li> All things considered, there isn&#x27;t anything more I could have expected or asked for from this experience.</li>
            <li> and it really stops her hair from frizzing.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> There are 4 girls in our family and we all have very curly hair.  </li>
            <li> This oil works better than any other heat protectorate I&#x27;ve used I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I originally bought the HSI Argan oil products for my wife as a Christmas present.</li>
            <li> Thanks I will be using these products as long as they are available.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall - I am very pleased with this - a little goes a long way and is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Not only is it a lot of product, but it&#x27;s inexpensive and true to its quality.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without!</li>
            <li> It made it less frizzy and more manageable.</li>
            <li> It left my hair silky smooth, unbelievably soft, AND held my curls.</li>
            <li> I really like this oil, it smells good and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> but like it just as much as a leave-in conditioner, it makes the hair incredibly soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I really like the  HSI Professional argan oil product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using HSI products for a few months now and it has noticeable made my thinning hair have more body and shine.  </li>
            <li> I was amazed that now she is styling her hair well and without complaint on her own.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t have anything negative to say about this product.</li>
            <li> You only need a tiny amount, maybe like a dime size or smaller because it can easily make your hair look greasy if you use too much!!</li>
            <li> This product works better than other products in the same category.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft and smooth, and I notice significantly less frizz on rainy or humid days.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t really work very well that way or using after i blow dry.</li>
            <li> I went from rough to smooth in a short while.  </li>

            <li> Makes my hair feel soft and doesn&#x27;t look or feel greasy.</li>
            <li> I have natural 4c hair</li>
            <li> It works well at managing frizz and keeps the hair soft.</li>
            <li> My hair has been so dry all my life and this is the first product that has made my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> It finally is laying down and smooth</li>
            <li> Love that it only takes a little so the bottle will last!</li>
            <li> I usually use a keratin spray but this blows that out of the water for adding a smooth shiny lustre to my hair.  </li>
            <li> received a small sample when I bought my HI flat Iron and was absolutely in love with how my hair looked.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also have used pure argan oil, and it is leaves my hair with that greasy/oily look if I put it in when my hair is dry.  </li>
            <li> I use both the HSI Flat Iron (http://www.amazon.com/HSI-PROFESSIONAL-TOURMALINE-STRAIGHTENER-Treatment/dp/B001MA0QY2/ref&#x3D;sr_1_6?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1428597662&amp;sr&#x3D;8-6&amp;keywords&#x3D;hsi+curling+iron) and a deep wave curler (to smooth out my tight, natural curl) and</li>
            <li> The oil replenishes her over worked hair back into the silky soft  condition that both of us appreciate.</li>
            <li> She is very fussy about her hair and really tries to take care of it</li>
            <li> I am a person who rarely uses heat on my hair due to a fear of damage; however I ordered this product to use when I decided to flat iron my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft, even after torturing it day after day with a blow dryer, flat iron, and hot round brush.</li>
            <li> It has been COLD up  here, and I find it helps keep it smooth and soft but not as much.  </li>
            <li> I have long naturally curly hair and use about a nickel size amount of this in my hair while damp</li>
            <li> If you have thick frizzy and full hair like me, go for Tresemme (spelling) products.  </li>
            <li> hair is strong curly hair and it is so thin and no power because i always use iron to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it with the hsi iron, as well as for generally getting a shine after a wash and blow dry as well.</li>
            <li> but I had to use a little extra than the instructions due to super dry curly hair.</li>
            <li> A few days later I ordered a full size bottle because I didn&#x27;t want to to run out of my little trial size.</li>
            <li> I put it on every time I use my flat iron.</li>
            <li> Smoothing the product over the hair before flat ironing</li>
            <li> I purchase this for my teen granddaughter (bi-racial) who couldn&#x27;t manage her long hair well and is tenderheaded.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any burning of the hair either with the increased temperatures of the flat iron.</li>
            <li> in fact not gone to a salon, but instead used this product with my flat irons.</li>
            <li> so it definitely goes a long way!</li>
            <li> After a styling mishap last year I was introduced to this product to treat the seriously dry ends of my hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is dry and this product puts the oil back in without over doing it!!</li>
            <li> usually when i wash my hair, my hair is really stripped and tangled after i shampoo it, and even after applying conditioner, i still have to apply a leave in before i blow dry it, or it&#x27;ll still be tangled somewhat.</li>
            <li> I received a small sample of HSI argan oil with the HSI Flat iron and I could not believe how soft it left my hair.</li>
            <li> If you curl, flat iron, blow dry or color your hair</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely dry and brittle from over coloring, over flat ironing.  </li>
            <li> It helped so much that I didn&#x27;t have to trim all the length I&#x27;d been working so hard to grow.  </li>
            <li> This HSI oil can be used on wet or dry hair and not leave it oily or greasy looking (if you only use a drop or two).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only problem is that you have to be very careful not to lose any liquid from this bottle as you pour it into your hand.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had frizzy, dry hair</li>
            <li> and it keeps my hair nourished and frizz-free, whether I am blow drying and flat-ironing it, or letting it air dry.</li>
            <li> it makes it softer and gives it a bit shiny look, I can take a shower and go out with my hair without having to worry about frizzes or that my hair is too dry not to use heat products,&amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I tried using it and let my hair air dry</li>
            <li> No oily gross head in a few hours like I&#x27;ve seen with similar products.</li>
            <li> A little definitely goes a long way (a couple drops).</li>
            <li> I use a little after flat ironing my hair then go over it again with the flat iron.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like smelly products especially in my hair as it is half way down my back</li>
            <li> It does not leave a greasy residue on wet or dry air.</li>
            <li> Also,  you only need to use a little so one bottle lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different hair products but never bought the same product twice as I was never completely satisfied with any of them.</li>
            <li> I use the Argan Oil Leave-In Hair Treatment on both wet and dry hair.</li>
            <li> The size of the bottle compared to how little is needed means this will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Pissed off i paid all these money and only got the argon oil not cool</li>
            <li> The only thing that is missing is this jar does not have a dropper or pump to dispense it.</li>
            <li> I had to returned it because I received almost empty bottle.</li>
            <li> The lid wasn&#x27;t completely closed</li>
            <li> This is the daily necessity, apply on my hair after or before use hair dryer, it helps alot to prevent my hair being fluffy and</li>
            <li> This is not pure argan oil.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, full hair and was looking for something to help and this just makes it worse?</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have a little bit dry hair</li>
            <li> My first bottle arrived with a loose cap, some liquid spilled, box soaked with the oil, and that was a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> I usually wash my hair every other day, but add a pump or two to my hair everyday - especially to the ends.  </li>
            <li> My hair is left silky which is hard to get done before</li>
            <li> After just about 3-4 days, the HSI shampoo and conditioner took out the crap from biosilk out of my hair and has made my hair soft and very manageable.</li>
            <li> This is so not worth the money!</li>
            <li> It is a little pricey</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh down or make my hair feel oily at all!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years now</li>
            <li> Wore this product in my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> Once you started using this every time before you dry your hair, you can never leave it!!!!!</li>
            <li> I typically apply a small amount in my hand, rub my hands together, and run it through the bottom of my hair working my way up.</li>
            <li> The liquid is very thick but not easy to dispense without a mess.  </li>
            <li> There is no amount of stressing the fact that this restores my hair without weighing it down!!!</li>
            <li> I was a bit nervous because I hate finding new shampoos/conditioners, but for a while, I&#x27;ve had no luck finding anything that worked well with my hair.</li>
            <li> I was shocked to see that it was cheaper than Chi and larger.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t go wrong here.</li>
            <li> The last shampoo/conditioner that I tried using was Biosilk, which was really awful for my hair.</li>
            <li> Give it a try you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My girl friend loves this product. The oil replenishes her over worked hair back into the silky soft  condition that both of us appreciate. If you curl, flat iron, blow dry or color your hair then you should use this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is miracle in a bottle(s). My hair has been so dry all my life and this is the first product that has made my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> Does what it says. My daughter raves about this stuff. She will use nothing else on her hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle since last summer.  I simply love this product!  After a styling mishap last year I was introduced to this product to treat the seriously dry ends of my hair.  It helped so much that I didn&#x27;t have to trim all the length I&#x27;d been working so hard to grow.  I have continued to use this product because it protects from heat damage and it smells great.  It is not greasy at all.  I have tried one other argan oil product and it was good, but I came back to this one because it is excellent!</li>
            <li> Pissed off i paid all these money and only got the argon oil not cool i want my money back</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and in perfect condition. The product itself is wonderful and will repurchase when it is done.</li>
            <li> This is not pure argan oil.  Argan oil is the 3rd ingredient and is among about 10 ingredients.  BUT, that is what I like about this oil ... it is not too greasy.  I also have used pure argan oil, and it is leaves my hair with that greasy/oily look if I put it in when my hair is dry.  This HSI oil can be used on wet or dry hair and not leave it oily or greasy looking (if you only use a drop or two).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is great at conditioning and protecting my hair, while also smoothing the frizzies.  The added bonus is that it smells really nice ... nothing strong, just a nice, clean scent.  The only thing that is missing is this jar does not have a dropper or pump to dispense it.</li>
            <li> Great product for heat styling!</li>
            <li> i purchased the whole set, and it was SO worth it!! usually when i wash my hair, my hair is really stripped and tangled after i shampoo it, and even after applying conditioner, i still have to apply a leave in before i blow dry it, or it&#x27;ll still be tangled somewhat. After i shampooed my hair, it was noticeably softer and more manageable and the deep mask conditioner was phenomenal!!!  my hair was soft full of body, and healthy looking! i will never use anything else again!!</li>
            <li> I have tried many different argan oils but the HSI is the best</li>
            <li> Very nice product! I like how the scent isn&#x27;t overpowering either. A little definitely goes a long way (a couple drops).</li>
            <li> I am using it for 4 months and I like the quality. I recommend to anyone. I will buy it again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using HSI products for a few months now and it has noticeable made my thinning hair have more body and shine.  It gets rid of the frizz and makes it much easier to style.  It doesn&#x27;t leave that &amp;#34;gunky&amp;#34; feel like other styling products and has a pleasant smell as well.  I would recommend for anyone with thinning or frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I think this product has helped me stop damaging my hair.  I went from rough to smooth in a short while.  I usually wash my hair every other day, but add a pump or two to my hair everyday - especially to the ends.  I don&#x27;t like smelly products especially in my hair as it is half way down my back so it surrounds me . . . if it smells too chemically or fruity - I can&#x27;t stand it!  This product is not like that, not greasy, and it helpful to your hair.  I use both the HSI Flat Iron (http://www.amazon.com/HSI-PROFESSIONAL-TOURMALINE-STRAIGHTENER-Treatment/dp/B001MA0QY2/ref&#x3D;sr_1_6?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1428597662&amp;sr&#x3D;8-6&amp;keywords&#x3D;hsi+curling+iron) and a deep wave curler (to smooth out my tight, natural curl) and the oil seems to keep it from looking fried.  Will buy again!</li>
            <li> This product has been one of the most amazing items I have come across. It keeps my hair soft, shiny and moisturizers all day. I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best hair product I have ever used, period! It makes my hair super shiny and soft and so much more manageable in our extremely high humidity where I live, it&#x27;s just awesome and I will be buying this product from now on. The shipping was fast and the transaction was nice and easy, just like it should be.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling greasy and smells great. A little goes a long way. I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so in love with this product! My hair is so soft, even after torturing it day after day with a blow dryer, flat iron, and hot round brush. I&#x27;m sold...repeat customer for sure!</li>
            <li> After using this product once, I cannot be without it.  I ordered this set 3 times already and the combination of those 4 products works beautifully!  My hair feels softer, shinner and healthier.  I have a very curly hair and with the use of this product, my hair looks shiny even when it dries up. Can&#x27;t live without!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a great leave-in conditioner.  I heard great things about the Argan Oil and thought I would give this a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro - very simple to use and does not require much to make hair soft - I put about a dime to nickel size in my palm and rub it through damp hair - it stays soft and free of frizzies.  Great scent too!!!  I can smell it during classes at the gym once I start sweating - and it is great to smell this rather than every one else&#x27;s sweat, but it is not overpowering.  Humidity was not an issue either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con - I do give it 4 stars since it has not been as great in our dry, winter weather.  It has been COLD up  here, and I find it helps keep it smooth and soft but not as much.  To be fair, I have not increased how much I put on - maybe that would work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - I am very pleased with this - a little goes a long way and is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I like this product and use daily and it help with my split ends. Great product!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Makes my hair feel amazing and never greasy.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product.  I love the way it makes my hair feel and smell.  I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this Argan oil. I bought the HSI hair iron and tried the sample that came with it. Because of the results of the sample and the raving reviews,I bought a larger sized one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had frizzy, dry hair and this was the solution to it. I didn&#x27;t need a lot and surely this whole botte will last me awhile. I&#x27;ve always struggled with finding the right hair product and I&#x27;m extremely happy with this one. It keeps my hair soft, manageable and silky smooth!</li>
            <li> I love it. Makes my hair 100% more manageable, soft and shiny. Definitely will buy again.</li>
            <li> This product works better than other products in the same category. It makes my daughter&#x27;s hair look healthy and shiny but not greasy. I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is by far one of the BEST purchases I have made in terms of hair products. I have long naturally curly hair and use about a nickel size amount of this in my hair while damp and it keeps my hair nourished and frizz-free, whether I am blow drying and flat-ironing it, or letting it air dry. It doesn&#x27;t weigh down or make my hair feel oily at all! The smell is AMAZING! You really can&#x27;t go wrong here. The size of the bottle compared to how little is needed means this will last a very long time. Well worth it!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product. Good with frizz.</li>
            <li> Love how this makes my hair feel and look! Not only does it give healthy appearance but makes it more manageable also! Love that it only takes a little so the bottle will last!</li>
            <li> I really like this oil, it smells good and a little goes a long way.  I put it on every time I use my flat iron. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years now and I&#x27;m very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Smells great not too strong. It does not leave a greasy residue on wet or dry air. I love the way it makes my hair feel.Helps make hair soft and shiny . I use with the shampoo and conditioner It&#x27;s helping so much with my frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Great line. I was a bit nervous because I hate finding new shampoos/conditioners, but for a while, I&#x27;ve had no luck finding anything that worked well with my hair. The last shampoo/conditioner that I tried using was Biosilk, which was really awful for my hair. I&#x27;ve read up on a lot of reviews and decided to purchase this set. After just about 3-4 days, the HSI shampoo and conditioner took out the crap from biosilk out of my hair and has made my hair soft and very manageable. I have done color treatments on my hair, so finding a good brand to deal with a number of color treatments is hard to find. After just about a week of usage, my hair feels like silk! I&#x27;m very hopeful, and ready to see any new/better changes to my hair after using these products, and I am sure to purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a year.  It works perfectly with the HSI iron straightener.  It makes my hair look silky!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product!  My hair is extremely dry and brittle from over coloring, over flat ironing.  Smoothing the product over the hair before flat ironing each strand leaves the hair unbelievably smooth, with a shine.  There is no product yet that has done this miracle for my coarse, damaged hair.  Only problem is that you have to be very careful not to lose any liquid from this bottle as you pour it into your hand.  The liquid is very thick but not easy to dispense without a mess.  I transferred some of the liquid into a small pump bottle (another brand, which was good, but not like this stuff) and applying the product by pumping a bit into my hand became easier.  My first bottle arrived with a loose cap, some liquid spilled, box soaked with the oil, and that was a disappointment.  If it were not for this flaw in packaging, I would give this 5 stars!</li>
            <li> Nice products! I did like it</li>
            <li> Ordered it for my wife and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff....hair gets straight, shiny, smells amazing and stays that way for up to 3 days!! No oily gross head in a few hours like I&#x27;ve seen with similar products. It is light and fresh on the hair and smells amazing!! As a side note I have the hsi straightener and this oil doesn&#x27;t built up on it when used daily I admit I am not the best at wiping it down once cool but with this it isnt such a huge deal because as I said no build up!! This is a must have in my house!!!</li>
            <li> Wore this product in my hair everyday. It made it less frizzy and more manageable. Did not make my hair feel greasy. When used when straightening my hair, made my hair feel silky smooth and soft along with no frizz and very manageable. The next day my hair still was straight with some touch ups.</li>
            <li> This argan oil is amazing for my hair. It keeps it soft and silky. I will continue to order this product.</li>
            <li> I order this product for my wife,and she is very happy with this oil&lt;br /&gt;it came fast, is a good quality.&lt;br /&gt;I will order more from this company.&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> Love this product makes my hair so soft and protects it from heat!! I highly recommend</li>
            <li> I purchase this for my teen granddaughter (bi-racial) who couldn&#x27;t manage her long hair well and is tenderheaded. I was amazed that now she is styling her hair well and without complaint on her own. This product helps keep her hair styled and manageable and healthy.</li>
            <li> I originally bought the HSI Argan oil products for my wife as a Christmas present. She has curly dryish hair and has used dozens if not hundreds of different &amp;#34;curly hair&amp;#34; products over the years, but had never been truly happy with any of them.  Being the good husband and google expert, I search the internet and Amazon to find her the best &amp;#34;curly dry hair&amp;#34; products and found the HSI products.  They are now her absolute favorites!  I&#x27;ve been told they will be on her permanent shopping list. :-)</li>
            <li> I like the product and have been purchasing it for a while now. However, when I received the product this time, the seal was open, and the oil spilled overall the place. It would be helpful if the product can be packaged better in the future.</li>
            <li> I am glad I took the time to read the reviews. This argon oil is wonderful. It leaves your hair shiny and silky. I use it with the HSI curling iron. If you are going to buy it go ahead and buy the big bottle. It is totally worth it. The shipping was fast and convenient. Give it a try you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Best ever!  Since I&#x27;ve been using this product people think i have extensions!  Makes my hair look softer and longer.  I&#x27;ve been looking for this product my whole life!</li>
            <li> IT IS REALLY GOOD FOR DAMAGED HAIR</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I&#x27;ve tried many different products to help tame my frizz-prone hair, and I had been pretty satisfied with Aveda&#x27;s Smooth Infusion. Then I ordered HSI&#x27;s hair staightener (also wonderful), and they sent a little bottle of the Argan oil along with it. I tried it, not expecting anything special, but I literally haven&#x27;t used another product since. A few days later I ordered a full size bottle because I didn&#x27;t want to to run out of my little trial size. It makes my hair so soft and smooth, and I notice significantly less frizz on rainy or humid days. A full size bottle lasts forever, as you don&#x27;t need very much (about a quarter sized amount on my mid-back length hair). I won&#x27;t buy anything else.</li>
            <li> Great product. I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> My number one go to hair product. Apply right before blow drying my hair and it turns silky smooth every time. Can&#x27;t go a day with out it. Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t have anything negative to say about this product. I have bought more than one. Not only is it a lot of product, but it&#x27;s inexpensive and true to its quality. At first my concern was is it too oily, will my hair feel greasy and I must say NO IT DOESN&#x27;T!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s absolutely amazing! You have to try it and I promise you&#x27;ll fall in love with it!</li>
            <li> I love it so much more than the product I used to purchase.  Fast shipping from Blue Novelties.</li>
            <li> Excellent buying experience. The product was delivered on time. High quality oil, hair looks very healthy and shinny after it is styled.</li>
            <li> Awesome service product is ok make my hair a little softer but not what i expected</li>
            <li> My wife was very satisfied with the product, and I was very pleased with the timing and the packaging.  All things considered, there isn&#x27;t anything more I could have expected or asked for from this experience.</li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast, and bottle was exactly as described. This product has definitely saved my hair, and I would definitely recommend it to a friend!</li>
            <li> this is my second bottle of this oil. My hair has never looked so good. It finally is laying down and smooth and I notice a condition has improved will definitely buy this again</li>
            <li> I love love love this product. It is the only thing I will ever use on my hair again. You will get hooked!!! Thanks HSI!</li>
            <li> I had to returned it because I received almost empty bottle. The lid wasn&#x27;t completely closed so oil was spilled in the box.</li>
            <li> The Argan oil is wonderful! My hair is so soft and shiny! My hairdresser asked me to get her a bottle! I love the HSI products!</li>
            <li> love this product , makes your hair feel silky smooth. Great product</li>
            <li> Works perfect for me, leave my hair soft and shiny, and smells good. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my granddaughter and she just loves it. She is very fussy about her hair and really tries to take care of it and she told me it leaves her hair soft and smooth and there is no greasy look. Its really good when it is damp and humid out and it really stops her hair from frizzing. She hasn&#x27;t used anything else since she got this and finds that her sister and her mother have been &#x27;borrowing&#x27; it. If she&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy. Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li> The product is very nice. It doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling greasy but leaves it looking healthy and full of life. I have not noticed any burning of the hair either with the increased temperatures of the flat iron. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I have had it with being duped into buying a product based on all good reviews! Unless you have flat fine hair, do not buy this! This is supposed to be a smoothing set? I have thick, full hair and was looking for something to help and this just makes it worse? The only thing good I can say is that it leaves the hair feeling soft.  This is so not worth the money! If you have thick frizzy and full hair like me, go for Tresemme (spelling) products.  The smoothing one does a better job than this stuff and is cheaper too.  I also like the strengthening one.  And if you are looking for a sulfate free shampoo, they have a natural variety one too.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product that a friend recommend! Works great for my hair:)</li>
            <li> love it!! My hair is dry and this product puts the oil back in without over doing it!!</li>
            <li> Really enjoying this product..  I bought it for heat protection but like it just as much as a leave-in conditioner, it makes the hair incredibly soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Love this.  My hair is left silky which is hard to get done before</li>
            <li> Everything they said it would be!!  but I had to use a little extra than the instructions due to super dry curly hair.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product with my HSI straightener and really loved it. This leave on conditioner/oil leaves my hair feeling really soft and shiny and it smells great. Would recommend and buy again.</li>
            <li> I love the Product..It makes my hair look amazing..</li>
            <li> This oil is really the best leave in product I&#x27;ve tried, I&#x27;ve been using It&#x27;s a 10 for about a year and a half, it was good I have a little bit dry hair and it worked okay, but this one is awesome, it is great, it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair frizzy it makes it softer and gives it a bit shiny look, I can take a shower and go out with my hair without having to worry about frizzes or that my hair is too dry not to use heat products,&amp;#60;3 I really love this and I bought HSI&#x27;s iron with it I loved them both, I recommend this to every one having dry hair or suffering from frizzes, great product, great price.</li>
            <li> Great product. I love the experience with HSI. I could manage my curly hair easily with this oil. It&#x27;s the constant part of my after shower treatment.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.  Fast shipping. Incredible price! I love the way this product makes my hair feel.  Washing strips my hair but I use the Argan oil before my straight iron and it protects and smoothes my hair beautifully! Also,  you only need to use a little so one bottle lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> I love this oil! It&#x27;s perfect! I will continue to be a repeat buyer from this seller as the product is wonderful and the seller truly cares about their customers. Always a good experience!</li>
            <li> I have tried different oils when straightening my hair with a straightening iron including chi and now HSI. I received a small sample of HSI argan oil with the HSI Flat iron and I could not believe how soft it left my hair. I had always been satisfied with chi but HSI brought my hair to another level of softness, strength, and shine. When I found this bottle online I was shocked to see that it was cheaper than Chi and larger. This oil works better than any other heat protectorate I&#x27;ve used I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how healthy and shiny my hair looks now using the HSI argan leave in oil.&lt;br /&gt;I received a small sample when I bought my HI flat Iron and was absolutely in love with how my hair looked.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product. My hair looks healthy,  feels soft and it smells really good too! Love love love everything about this oil!</li>
            <li> Amazing product!  I now have no frizz and it made my baby fine hair feel much thicker and more texturized.  I usually use a keratin spray but this blows that out of the water for adding a smooth shiny lustre to my hair.  I will buy again for sure!  Now it&#x27;s a must in my cabinet.</li>
            <li> Very good oil to use for hair conditioning. I use it with the hsi iron, as well as for generally getting a shine after a wash and blow dry as well. It gets absorbed quickly and does not leave a greasy feel. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Makes my hair feel soft and doesn&#x27;t look or feel greasy. I use a little after flat ironing my hair then go over it again with the flat iron.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair oil for my wavy hair. The smell of the oil is very nice and not strong to me. This oil did good job on my split and dry hair end. I always use it as a coating before I use the hot straightening iron.</li>
            <li> It is just amazing! Once you started using this every time before you dry your hair, you can never leave it!!!!! YOU SHOULD TRY!</li>
            <li> I use this product every time i style my hair and it has definitely helped prevent it from becoming more damaged. I found that  this product works best when using heat styling tools on it. I tried using it and let my hair air dry but it doesn&#x27;t really work very well that way or using after i blow dry. I typically apply a small amount in my hand, rub my hands together, and run it through the bottom of my hair working my way up. It helps with frizz and also protects my hair. You only need a tiny amount, maybe like a dime size or smaller because it can easily make your hair look greasy if you use too much!! It is a little pricey but I&#x27;m still using the bottle that I bought probably about a year ago so it definitely goes a long way! i would most definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I am a person who rarely uses heat on my hair due to a fear of damage; however I ordered this product to use when I decided to flat iron my hair. I had AMAZING results. I had coworkers literally asking me which salon I had gone to. I had to convince them I had in fact not gone to a salon, but instead used this product with my flat irons. It left my hair silky smooth, unbelievably soft, AND held my curls. That never happens! Great product. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I always have very long hair thus am in need of good hair product. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different hair products but never bought the same product twice as I was never completely satisfied with any of them. This one is definitely a keeper. This is my third time purchase and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll switch to another product any time soon. highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product ! It leaves my hair nice and soft! I already bought 2 and soon going for my third!!</li>
            <li> Perfect for your hair treatment. Second purchase already.</li>
            <li> I love love love love it. Makes my hair feel like heaven</li>
            <li> Keeps hair from drying out.</li>
            <li> I use the Argan Oil Leave-In Hair Treatment on both wet and dry hair. It works well either way. This product is non-greasy with a nice smell. It keeps the hair looking smooth and healthy. It&#x27;s my first time trying a leave-in conditioner and I like the result!</li>
            <li> I already used 3 bottles, really! This is the daily necessity, apply on my hair after or before use hair dryer, it helps alot to prevent my hair being fluffy and the most amazing thing is, it is oil but not oily!!!. Recommended to all girls.</li>
            <li> My wife absolutely loves HSI products with argon oil! It helps make her hair silky soft and smelling wonderful. Its good for her and its good for me!!!</li>
            <li> i Loooove this oil so much! The best argan oil ever!&lt;br /&gt;My hair is strong curly hair and it is so thin and no power because i always use iron to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after using products it gets healthier and repaired and shiny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommand this oil. i need 5 more star for it!</li>
            <li> Great product. Fast shipping. I recommend this item.</li>
            <li> This product works miracles for my hair and the shipping was super fast. Will purchase again</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products I have ever put on my hair or extensions. My hair is always so silky, smooth, vibrant and void of flyaways. I have really enjoyed this and all of my girlfriends that have used it have as well. I take it with me to the hair stylist because nothing she has works for my hair like this. There is no amount of stressing the fact that this restores my hair without weighing it down!!!</li>
            <li> This is really an excellent product. The best argan oil I&#x27;ve used thus far. Don&#x27;t think any of the others are as pure as HSI&#x27;s and that&#x27;s why I use it for everything. I&#x27;ve found it a perfect moisturizer for bought skin and hair and a perfect bath oil.  Will definitely continue to buy.</li>
            <li> I use this before straightening my hair. Works great!</li>
            <li> My hair is a testimony of this treatment. I have natural 4c hair and I use it immediately after I wash my hair. Thumbs up for the innovative idea to have a pump as a dispenser. Well done!</li>
            <li> There are 4 girls in our family and we all have very curly hair.  My 16 year old went sulphate free a year ago and has loved the effect this healthy oil has had on her hair.  Did I mention that it is very reasonably priced?</li>
            <li> These HSI products are by far the best products I have ever invested in, they leave my hair soft, with shine without the access oils</li>
            <li> I really like the  HSI Professional argan oil product. It works well at managing frizz and keeps the hair soft. The order was delivered very quickly too.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I plan on ordering more in the future! Just wish it came with a pump!! &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I have purchased both the Shampoo and leave in Argan Treatment and I love both products. This is the first time ever that my hair is silky and growing strong. Started the products in October and my hair has grown and is no longer breaking. I work out daily and these products are wonderful in getting the mositure back after washing. Thanks I will be using these products as long as they are available.</li>
