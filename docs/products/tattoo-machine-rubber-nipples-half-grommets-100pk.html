            <li>I&#x27;m in need of more</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get the top hat style nipples</li>
            <li>Really holds the needles on good.</li>
            <li>I ordered these grommets and they are made of good quality and arrived fast as well.</li>
            <li>The nipple style is better than the full gromments in my opinon.</li>
            <li>I like these better than the full gromets...</li>
            <li>the grommet wont fit on the post on tattoo gun and vise versa</li>
            <li>came quick exactly what i was looking for love</li>
            <li>but I have grown into them and prefer them over full grommets now.</li>
            <li>Will be ordering more shortly.</li>
            <li>the all work the same, just the top hat style is easier to to use.</li>
            <li>these are the best grommets,ive found,and they are worth every penny,save your tape.lol crazy rick</li>
            <li>They are pretty much garbage.</li>
            <li>I love these nipples there not soft or get tore up in the middle of the tattoo defenately worth it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these grommets especially, for my linner,and another thing these fit tight on your needle bar, but make sure you take pliers and bend your needle loop around them, and you don&#x27;thave know play.</li>
            <li>I have to re-order and wait for a new batch.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re easier to get on the niddle and do the exact same ammount of work.</li>
            <li>also they do not fit easily on my machines.</li>
            <li>Great for the price I did get a few in the packaging that where not made properly like a few defaulted ones where the plastic was all melted together</li>
            <li>i have used them but my needles slides of to easy and there was only half of them in there when i got it</li>
            <li>I tried to use one in front of a client and had to dip into my old bag which luckily I have a few left.</li>
            <li>The shipping speed was amazing, but I had to shape some of them, and others are just too thin and missing too much rubber to be useable.</li>

            <li> Shipping speed was fast but These feel like hard plastic not rubber</li>
            <li> that sold them tattoo xp supplies, they are medium soft and hard, other word they are just right, they don&#x27;t give and move when do your lining work, and I use them coloring and shading, sometimes, but I got some little bit softer ones I use for shading color work so its less trauma and a little give.</li>

            <li> it was really a waste of money for me....</li>
            <li> these grommets are to hard i need softer ones once you put the needle on the grommet</li>

            <li> Came quick, in great shape and they work great. Really holds the needles on good.</li>
            <li> My 100 pack came with a lot of inconsistencies from nipple to nipple. Some were too thin to be usable, others had a large amount of excess rubber attached. The shipping speed was amazing, but I had to shape some of them, and others are just too thin and missing too much rubber to be useable.</li>
            <li> I love these nipples there not soft or get tore up in the middle of the tattoo defenately worth it.</li>
            <li> came quick exactly what i was looking for love it deff would buy again there a lil softer then I&#x27;m used to but makes it earlier to get thru hole</li>
            <li> i like these gromments and the co. that sold them tattoo xp supplies, they are medium soft and hard, other word they are just right, they don&#x27;t give and move when do your lining work, and I use them coloring and shading, sometimes, but I got some little bit softer ones I use for shading color work so its less trauma and a little give.

            <li> Love these bibs will reorder</li>
            <li> i decided to minus one star just because for what it is it should have shipped faster... and i think i paid like $5 shipping for something that probably needed a stamp thrown on it.</li>
            <li> Fits great, love them and will as always be buying more of these. I used to hate these but I have grown into them and prefer them over full grommets now.</li>
            <li> Great for the price I did get a few in the packaging that where not made properly like a few defaulted ones where the plastic was all melted together but it was only a few I mean I get 100 so throwing away 5 isn&#x27;t a big deal . other than that they get the job done</li>
            <li> i have used them but my needles slides of to easy and there was only half of them in there when i got it the bag was riped and so was the bag that it cam in</li>
            <li> Not happy with this product hard plastic , to tight to go on my machine havent been able to use them since I recieved them because of it was really a waste of money for me....</li>
            <li> they work great but when it comes to putting them on the machine the needle hole wont go in, you have to place grommet in the needle before you place it in the machine</li>
            <li> I ordered these grommets and they are made of good quality and arrived fast as well. Is was a bargain for this product I am pleased.</li>
            <li> Shipping speed was fast but These feel like hard plastic not rubber also they do not fit easily on my machines. They are pretty much garbage. They have a lot of excess plastic around the edges. Great price though I guess you get what you pay for now I have to re-order and wait for a new batch.  I tried to use one in front of a client and had to dip into my old bag which luckily I have a few left.</li>
            <li> These are great. The nipple style is better than the full gromments in my opinon. They&#x27;re easier to get on the niddle and do the exact same ammount of work. Will be ordering more shortly.</li>
            <li> I like these better than the full gromets...</li>
            <li> What you see is what you get. I got something good. What /i got is what saw, and I like it.</li>
            <li> was a great price and couldn&#x27;t pass them up and I will be buying more as soon ass I&#x27;m in need of more</li>
            <li> Bought them for our new tattoo gun set and these worked great to go with it, I will be ordering more these where a great deal and shipping and packing worked out great</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the top hat style nipples I got the bullet style, but the all work the same, just the top hat style is easier to to use.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for</li>
            <li> these grommets are to hard i need softer ones once you put the needle on the grommet the grommet wont fit on the post on tattoo gun and vise versa</li>
            <li> Nunca me llegaron ala vergas</li>
