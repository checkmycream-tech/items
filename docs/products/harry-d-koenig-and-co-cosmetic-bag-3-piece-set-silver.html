            <li>I love these bags.</li>

            <li>many items fall out.  </li>
            <li>They are really more for travel than purse size.</li>
            <li>In addition, there was a 1/2 inch gap between the top of the zipper and the sides of the bag--so things could fall out.</li>

            <li>These are well made and easy to identify in your travel cases.  </li>

            <li>Mesh bags are very useful since you don&#x27;t have to guess what you put in them to begin with.  </li>
            <li>I can only assume that the quality of the bags has changed since the customers gave it good reviews.</li>

            <li>Not recommended unless you are keeping very large items inside.</li>
            <li>I think this Cosmetic Bag set is a must for anyone who wants their pocketbook organized, and at the same time, doesn&#x27;t want to add any more weight to it!</li>
            <li>They were exactly what I was looking for in stores and could not find.</li>
            <li>Very well made, useful.</li>
            <li>Although they are silver, you can see exactly what&#x27;s in each bag.</li>
            <li>I love the sheer mesh for visibility.  </li>
            <li>I wish you could see through them a bit better to tell what&#x27;s inside, but I can see well enough.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like them at first.</li>
            <li>Sure enough, openings on all sizes at both ends.</li>
            <li>Love the see through ability of these bags which enables us to know instantly that we have all our items.</li>
            <li>Well, first things first.</li>
            <li>AND, I lose stuff, so now I need to keep up with these nice little bags.</li>
            <li>keep my makeup in a tightly zippered bag that open up nicely and stays shut securely.</li>
            <li>Thanks amazon.</li>
            <li>Makes it much easier to grab what I need when I need it without digging around.</li>
            <li>I use them for storing and organizing electronics -- cords, plugs, chargers and all the gadgets and components that seem to accompany modern life.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>These bags fit the purpose and are bigger than I thought.  </li>
            <li>Ok not what I expected</li>
            <li>I am using this trio of mesh bags to organize my own everyday bag.</li>
            <li>Lightweight and nice for carrying in purse, especially the smaller one.  </li>
            <li>her clean and neat storage for all size cosmetics in a much larger bag.</li>
            <li>Sizes were true to measurements-they were roomy enough for my things.</li>
            <li>Easy to seperate different things into different bags.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re just the right size to carry all those extra things you don&#x27;t want to go digging for in your purse!</li>
            <li>The manufacturer has intentionally left a 2 inch gap and either side of the end of the zipper so that your stuff can just slide right out.  </li>
            <li>I live these cosmetic bags.</li>
            <li>(Four stars because with very much wear and tear, you&#x27;d want to put an extra stitch or the at the end of the zipper to keep the stitching from beginning to pull out.)</li>
            <li>Have used them in my gym bag for a few weeks now and they hold up fine.</li>
            <li>I did not like that their is a large opening at the back of the bag where the zipper should connect with the bag.</li>
            <li>Anything small can easily fall out.</li>
            <li>These bags are cheaply made and have about a 1 inch hole at the top on either end of the zipper making them impossible to use for cosmetics.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that was not great was that the bags are losing threads, kind of raveling in the seams and near the zipper.  </li>
            <li>If you use them to carry larger items, they&#x27;re fine, but if you have smaller stuff (like lipstick), they have tendency of falling out of the other side where the zipper is supposed to begin.</li>
            <li>Like the silver better than other black ones.</li>
            <li>Mine mostly live in a drawer, so it&#x27;s not a big issue for</li>
            <li>They feel metallic and are kind of odd, but I&#x27;m coming back to buy my second set because they&#x27;ve become my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; preference over a number of other bags.</li>
            <li>The zipper doesn&#x27;t completely seal the side so smaller items can still fall out.  </li>
            <li>Get a big old ungainly sack of a purse and get rolling.</li>
            <li>The whole point of a zippered bag is that you can close the zipper and throw it down without worrying about the contents of the bag coming out.  </li>

            <li> I keep my underwear and socks in the large one, extra meds in the mid-sized one, and travel sizes of hair &amp; teeth products in the small one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also the bottom isn&#x27;t really flat</li>
            <li> and I expect them to last a long time.</li>
            <li> Items smaller than 1\\&quot; wide may slip out if the bag is getting moved around, as happens with traveling.</li>
            <li> The material is rough and of lesser quality than the one I&#x27;ve had for years,</li>
            <li> Plenty of reviews with warnings about the strange openings on the sides...</li>
            <li> The medium and small are great for holding all my other random small items/makeup.  </li>
            <li> And as a long-time Amazon customer, I&#x27;m also disappointed that it didn&#x27;t bother to vet the kind of merchandise it lets its partners sell on its site.</li>
            <li> Not very smart.</li>
            <li> Raw edges were showing, seams were crooked.</li>
            <li> I purchased it to hold eye liners and other tint things for my makeup kit.</li>
            <li> A little stiffer than expected.  </li>
            <li> so if it leaks the mess is contained.</li>
            <li> I like that there is a little give to the material, so it accommodates oddly shaped and bulky items.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find the little hole by the zipper closure to be worrisome as long as you don&#x27;t put your small gold nuggets in there!</li>
            <li> I have a lot of little items I need to keep up with.</li>
            <li> It saves on the number of ziplock bags I destroy when traveling.</li>
            <li> There is at least a one inch gap between the zipper and mesh and</li>
            <li> Very small items tend to slip through the zipper area.</li>
            <li> Got tired of the zip lock baggies in my husbands computer bag and suitcases.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately there are gaps underneath the zippers on both sides so items fall out when in transit.  </li>
            <li> Very frustrating when you go to get your item</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get dirty or smeary like plastic.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> My experience with this company was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> (I hate using pens on counters at the bank), and so fill them up and haul your goodies everywhere.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s horrible.</li>
            <li> I got a terrible headache that lasted for days.  </li>
            <li> The workmanship was terrible on the cosmetic bags I received.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> These are perfect for traveling and I love the color it matches everything and every color of purse! Thanks amazon.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the travel to carry my cosmetics around. But it doesn&#x27;t work at all. Zip doesn&#x27;t close all the way and it always has big hole so all of my cosmetics come out from the bag without notice. it&#x27;s horrible. I regret to buy</li>
            <li> This set of 3 mesh cosmetics/travel bag set is brilliant I have found some many uses for them:- as a cosmetic bag and for storage bags when traveling. Advantage being that you can see what is in them and sizing is excellent and they are well made and strong and very smart looking. It would have been an advantage to have the measurements of sizes on web site before purchasing.</li>
            <li> I like the mesh material because you can see through it. What I don&#x27;t like is when you zip it up things can fall out.  Also the bottom isn&#x27;t really flat so they can stand up. Otherwise they seem well-made.</li>
            <li> I wanted zipper bags to keep items in the bags.  Unfortunately there are gaps underneath the zippers on both sides so items fall out when in transit.  I think whoever designed or manufactured these missed the point of having a zipper</li>
            <li> I like being able to see my cosmetics in the bags.  They were exactly what I was looking for in stores and could not find.</li>
            <li> Merchandise arrived in a timely manner and in good condition.  I am recommending this vendor.</li>
            <li> I love that it is see through, and mesh as opose to plastic. It keeps my bags neat. Very small items tend to slip through the zipper area. Otherwise great.</li>
            <li> Each size expands to hold alot. If looks matter, they are a nice silver mesh fabric. I don&#x27;t find the little hole by the zipper closure to be worrisome as long as you don&#x27;t put your small gold nuggets in there!</li>
            <li> Very nice. Easy to find items in bags.</li>
            <li> More like screen wire than fabric. Can&#x27;t use it in purse cause it will scratch the phone.</li>
            <li> I live these cosmetic bags. Very durable and pretty!! I believe you will be happy if you buy this product.</li>
            <li> These bags are perfect to use with any color handbag! They&#x27;re just the right size to carry all those extra things you don&#x27;t want to go digging for in your purse!</li>
            <li> Very well made, useful.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with this purchase. I have already purchased another set to give as a gift for a sister-in-law who loves to travel. I am using this trio of mesh bags to organize my own everyday bag. They are ultra light, and hold so much.  Although they are silver, you can see exactly what&#x27;s in each bag. I think this Cosmetic Bag set is a must for anyone who wants their pocketbook organized, and at the same time, doesn&#x27;t want to add any more weight to it!</li>
            <li> I am allergic to toxic metals.  When I opened this silver bag, I thought it looked beautiful.  Then within seconds, I started to feel queasy.  I got a terrible headache that lasted for days.  And my hand that I touched the bag with started to swell up like a balloon.  I told a family member, something about this bag is made with a toxic ingredient. They also became temporarily nauseous when coming into contact with the bag.  Perhaps, the silver paint is made with a toxic metal such as cadmium or aluminum.. The bag also has a tag that says &#x27;made in China&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of this severe reaction, I threw away the bags instantly.  I wanted to warn others to prevent them from having the same thing happen to them.</li>
            <li> Perfectly as described.  I love the sheer mesh for visibility.  Good construction/zipper.</li>
            <li> I have to see what is inside. Light weight and attractive</li>
            <li> I love these bags. The three sizes are perfect for packing toiletries for travel. I wish you could see through them a bit better to tell what&#x27;s inside, but I can see well enough. It saves on the number of ziplock bags I destroy when traveling.</li>
            <li> I have a big baggy purse and these work well to keep things separated inside.  Seem to be pretty good quality.</li>
            <li> These bags were okay, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy them again. If you use them to carry larger items, they&#x27;re fine, but if you have smaller stuff (like lipstick), they have tendency of falling out of the other side where the zipper is supposed to begin. There&#x27;s a gaping hole there.</li>
            <li> Easy to seperate different things into different bags.  Using these in my hospital bag for the birth of my second child.  I have personal care items, shower items, and baby/nursing items all in seperate bags.  Makes it much easier to grab what I need when I need it without digging around.</li>
            <li> actual mesh will hold up under anything is my guess.  Ordered fork me and my granddaughter&lt;br /&gt;gives her clean and neat storage for all size cosmetics in a much larger bag.</li>
            <li> They look good but they just don&#x27;t work.  There is at least a one inch gap between the zipper and mesh and many items fall out.  Very frustrating when you go to get your item an it&#x27;s rolling around in the car or the bottom of my purse</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for about a year and they&#x27;ve held up well. I use them for storing and organizing electronics -- cords, plugs, chargers and all the gadgets and components that seem to accompany modern life. I like that there is a little give to the material, so it accommodates oddly shaped and bulky items. As others have mentioned, there is a gap at both ends of the zipper. Items smaller than 1\\&quot; wide may slip out if the bag is getting moved around, as happens with traveling. Mine mostly live in a drawer, so it&#x27;s not a big issue for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like them at first. They feel metallic and are kind of odd, but I&#x27;m coming back to buy my second set because they&#x27;ve become my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; preference over a number of other bags. (Four stars because with very much wear and tear, you&#x27;d want to put an extra stitch or the at the end of the zipper to keep the stitching from beginning to pull out.)</li>
            <li> But these bags aren&#x27;t that great of quality.  The material is rough and of lesser quality than the one I&#x27;ve had for years,</li>
            <li> Plenty of reviews with warnings about the strange openings on the sides... I didn&#x27;t heed them, ordered 3 sets, THEN read the reviews. Sure enough, openings on all sizes at both ends. Immediately returned. Not recommended unless you are keeping very large items inside.</li>
            <li> These were given to me over 7 years ago and I have taken them everywhere.  I keep my underwear and socks in the large one, extra meds in the mid-sized one, and travel sizes of hair &amp; teeth products in the small one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is nice about the mesh:&lt;br /&gt;1.  You can easily see what is inside.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Doesn&#x27;t get dirty or smeary like plastic.&lt;br /&gt;3.  These bags flatten easily when you have used up some of the products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep my makeup in a tightly zippered bag that open up nicely and stays shut securely.</li>
            <li> A little stiffer than expected.  Lightweight and nice for carrying in purse, especially the smaller one.  Like the silver better than other black ones.</li>
            <li> If I am on the run, I want to know where everything is.  The mesh bags let you see where you stored all your beauty supplies and keeps them in place.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect bag for traveling.  I keep all my make up in it when I&#x27;m traveling.  Mesh bags are very useful since you don&#x27;t have to guess what you put in them to begin with.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using them to keep your travel shampoo in though.  It&#x27;s better to use a more solid bag so if it leaks the mess is contained.</li>
            <li> great sized bag but the zipper is not sewn at the end- tiny stuff falls out</li>
            <li> I like the bags because you can see what you have in them.  Great purse organizers for me.  The only thing that was not great was that the bags are losing threads, kind of raveling in the seams and near the zipper.  For the purchase price, they are worth the price paid.  Good bags for the money.</li>
            <li> Bought these to put these cords and that electronics stuff in.  Got tired of the zip lock baggies in my husbands computer bag and suitcases.  These are well made and easy to identify in your travel cases.  Perfect.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for to sort odds and ends in my purse. Mesh allows you to see what&#x27;s inside at a glance. Fast shipping. Thank you</li>
            <li> These were just what I needed for my toiletries.  They arrived quickly and are of good quality.  Sizes were true to measurements-they were roomy enough for my things.</li>
            <li> These bags are cheaply made and have about a 1 inch hole at the top on either end of the zipper making them impossible to use for cosmetics.  Anything small can easily fall out.</li>
            <li> The big size if perfect for my travel shower bottles and a full size can of shaving cream for in my gym bag.  The medium and small are great for holding all my other random small items/makeup.  Great set.  Well made.</li>
            <li> This product does not seal.  The whole point of a zippered bag is that you can close the zipper and throw it down without worrying about the contents of the bag coming out.  This bag does not do this.  The manufacturer has intentionally left a 2 inch gap and either side of the end of the zipper so that your stuff can just slide right out.  Not very smart.</li>
            <li> I love the silvertone mesh bags (for the clear tote I am hoping to get).  I would have preferred the sizes to be a little&lt;br /&gt;smaller.  They are really more for travel than purse size.</li>
            <li> We use these bags for everything from cosmetics to electrical needs used to charge our various articles we travel with. Love the see through ability of these bags which enables us to know instantly that we have all our items.</li>
            <li> I can only assume that the quality of the bags has changed since the customers gave it good reviews. The workmanship was terrible on the cosmetic bags I received. Raw edges were showing, seams were crooked. In addition, there was a 1/2 inch gap between the top of the zipper and the sides of the bag--so things could fall out. They couldn&#x27;t serve their purpose as cosmetic bags. My experience with this company was very disappointing. And as a long-time Amazon customer, I&#x27;m also disappointed that it didn&#x27;t bother to vet the kind of merchandise it lets its partners sell on its site.</li>
            <li> These bags fit the purpose and are bigger than I thought.  The zipper doesn&#x27;t completely seal the side so smaller items can still fall out.  For the price they were fine.</li>
            <li> comodas, flexibles, resistentes y duraderas, me encantan, el vendedor lo recomiendo 100% llego a tiempo y en buenas condiciones, me gusta.</li>
            <li> I purchased it to hold eye liners and other tint things for my makeup kit. I liked that it is see through. I did not like that their is a large opening at the back of the bag where the zipper should connect with the bag. All of my makeup pencils fall out.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of little items I need to keep up with. Three sizes, handy for taking care of and storing whatchamacallits. I put &#x27;em in these, and presto! they&#x27;re not lost anywhere. Lightweight, very sturdy, and puncture-proof, you&#x27;ll enjoy owning these and will find a pile of useful things to do with them. Makeup, pens, for signing stuff when you&#x27;re out in public (I hate using pens on counters at the bank), and so fill them up and haul your goodies everywhere. I put my phone in one, because I can&#x27;t stand hearing it ring and not being able to get to it. I also carry a flashlight so I can see to the bottom of my purse, which elicits questioning looks from people, but so what, and it goes into another of my nifty mesh bags. AND, I lose stuff, so now I need to keep up with these nice little bags. Well, first things first. Get a big old ungainly sack of a purse and get rolling.</li>
            <li> Ok not what I expected</li>
            <li> Really nice looking, silver mesh bags. Have used them in my gym bag for a few weeks now and they hold up fine. Zippers work well, no wear or tear showing and I expect them to last a long time. Good quality bags.</li>
