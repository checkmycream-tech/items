    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It lasts all day and looks flawless on my skin.</li>
            <li>This product hides the redness and patches, and feels absolutely wonderful.  </li>
            <li>It blends well, is lightweight, matches my skin tone and makes my skin look wonderful!  </li>
            <li>This one was just perfect.</li>
            <li>Awesome product.  </li>
            <li>Great for my 60+skin</li>
            <li>This  is a great  bb cream</li>
            <li>This bb cream is not oily nor does it make my face oily which is great.</li>
            <li>The coverage is great and it doesn&#x27;t look like you have makeup on.</li>
            <li>Great for men.  </li>
            <li>It can have the tendency to appear a bit cakey in bright lights, but it&#x27;s a good night time make up if you don&#x27;t get a lot of day time exposure.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great cream, very light but covers well and blends well too.  </li>
            <li>I love lumene BB cream, it works great</li>
            <li>Tightens the skin nicely and feels good when applied.</li>
            <li>moisturizing but not greasy or heavy..smells delish..like light orange cream!!</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li>I have some rosacea on my cheeks which this product covers amazingly..</li>
            <li>Great as a light foundation.  </li>
            <li>Felt great when I put it on until I started breaking out and my aestecian confirmed I was having an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li>YUM..not too expensive..a nice treat for me..</li>
            <li>when using a brush, it has a nice scent, the glow is supper flattering, and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out.</li>
            <li>This goes on smoothly and seems to work good.</li>
            <li>The first time I started wearing it, I honestly cannot count the number of compliments that I got on how great my skin looked.  </li>
            <li>The coverage is very light.</li>
            <li>OK so I purchased this BB Cream at a CVS</li>
            <li>I love most about this BB cream</li>
            <li>is that it makes my skin look better</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I would buy this again for sure</li>
            <li>I really love this BB cream.  </li>
            <li>I like the way it feels on my skin, the color was okay</li>
            <li>Maybe in 10 years I can tell the difference :).</li>
            <li>My skin looks younger and more perfect!  </li>
            <li>However, I love the product</li>
            <li>I have been using this for a couple of years and love it.  </li>
            <li>love it have had many compliments&lt;br /&gt;great</li>
            <li>/&gt;Compared to garnier&#x27;s one (which others said were dewey), this one is much more pinkish/orangeish, so make sure you blend in thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Love this but the color light is just a too orange for me</li>
            <li>so much I wanted to leave a good word for it here on Amazon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>formula is fine.</li>
            <li>The BB cream goes on smoothly and blends in easily, and I like that it has SPF coverage.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the moisturizing of this BB and after bronzes, the color is fine.</li>
            <li>This product really does give a kind of glow to your face.</li>
            <li>think original price is $14.98.</li>
            <li>It actually controls the oil somehow and even well into my day at the office my skin looks good (not oily).</li>
            <li>I am a fair-skinned girl with cool tones in her skin.</li>
            <li>What a great product got the 02 medium due to summer sun</li>
            <li>I love it much more than the SKIN79 super beblesh triple functions cream (the pink one)</li>
            <li>The color (I used the Light) is very orangey, and the cream started drying on my face before I could even blend it.  </li>
            <li>It also did not cause me to break out, which is a great thing when you have such sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The color blends in naturally and the coverage is a bit more than a tinted moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what it says it is: A lightly tinted moisturiser that offers light coverage.  </li>
            <li>I still love my sephora CC cream, however, but this one gives you pinkish glow, and gives you a complete light coverage, whereas sephora&#x27;s more of correcting colors and making acne scar look less reddish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I am fair skinned and it gave me a little color and evened out my skin tone without looking like I&#x27;m wearing a lot of makeup.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I ever had an allergic reaction to cosmetics.</li>
            <li>This was recommended by Dr. Oz, and I tried it for the first time.  </li>
            <li>This is great for me personally, as I&#x27;m prone to dry, flaky skin and eczema...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a couple of other BB creams and was less than impressed.  </li>
            <li>(This is my main cosmetic item honestly, along with lip balm, it is the 1 thing I wear literally every single day.) ^_^</li>
            <li>It really lives up to the product name that</li>
            <li>in all I really like this product</li>
            <li>wallgreens - much lower price</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure it would work out (and the price was such that I was hoping that it would), but I have been really pleased after using it for a few days.  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling fresh and soft.  </li>
            <li>that can also double as a lightly tinted coverage, try this.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way to orange and oxidizes even worse, if they fixed the color it would be great.</li>
            <li>The coverage IS light, but it&#x27;s also enough coverage that it completely evens out your skin tone.  </li>
            <li>The product is very light and doesn&#x27;t have that heavy feeling.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It may cost a little more, but it lasts quite a while.  </li>
            <li>but this is easily fixed by applying generous amounts and spreading it as fast as I can before it dries</li>
            <li>It works very well for mature skin.</li>
            <li>It does have a slightly heavy feel to it, so if you work outdoors and sweat a lot like I do it does feel more like foundation than just a moisturizer and sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for quite a few months now and love it.  </li>
            <li>I had never heard of the Lumene brand before, but when I began browsing for a new BB</li>
            <li>My skin is a bit hard to match (I am fairly fair, but not ivory, and I can get a bit of color when out in the sun, but I definitely don&#x27;t try to tan at all).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a thick enough coverage to cover scars or freckles, so if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for be aware that this BB cream won&#x27;t do it by itself</li>
            <li>It goes on easily enough, though long-wearing it most certainly is not.</li>
            <li>When I first opened up the packaging, the was a blob of product on the outside of the tube</li>
            <li>If I had a bit of a tan this would match, but instead the effect is something that you see on a middle school girl first trying out makeup</li>
            <li>It loses a star because of the potential greasiness, and the difficulty I&#x27;ve had in finding a concealer that will work well with it, but overall it&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li>am 24 years old, I have oily skin on my forhead, nose and chin.</li>
            <li>but I am a natural beige girl.</li>
            <li>but since I have combination skin - oily on my forehead and sensitive on my cheeks - I am content adding that step to my routine because this BB cream is moisturizing and works well).</li>
            <li>Looks natural.  </li>
            <li>It has never caused redness or breakouts, and I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I am not one to wear make-up and this is &amp;#34;just enough&amp;#34; for me to feel like there&#x27;s a bit of coverage &amp; color, and it goes well with my 40+ pale skin tone (in light color).  </li>
            <li>I gave it two stars only for the pretty nice coverage, but truly, it doesn&#x27;t deserve a single star, since it totally failed its purpose</li>
            <li>I really like this BB cream, but the one thing that I am a bit iffy on is that when it goes on there is a bit of a shine (not much, powder takes care of it,</li>
            <li>but for me, who never likes the heaviness of foundation / powder, I just use it over bare skin.  </li>
            <li>I was a bit skeptical at first because there are only two colors in the line, light and medium.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had other BB cream that are super heavy.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;ve had other BB cream that are super heavy.</li>
            <li> The overall effect seemed dry and greasy at the same time.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve tried several other BB creams and this was one of my favorites and two of the others were three times the price and by well known cosmetic and skin care providers.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about this product is that it is a little hard to blend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so pale as to give any Irish lass competition in the glow-in-the-dark department, but I do have issues finding foundations/bb creams/cc creams that match my skin.</li>
            <li> It is a subtle dewy finish, but it makes my skin look as if my skin is naturally dewy.</li>
            <li> Just got it this past week at Walgreens for only $9.99 on sale</li>
            <li> My skin has been extremely sun damaged over the years.  </li>
            <li> But on the other hand it does offer coverage and leaves my skin feeling moisturized after I remove it.</li>
            <li> I will be very very careful from now on to check prices very carefully.</li>
            <li> I will say it is VERY moisturising and if you are prone to oily skin or breakouts maybe pass on this, because, although it does blend well and feels very light on your skin once it&#x27;s been on for a few minutes, the moisturiser base in this product is a very thick and creamy,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too dark, and it&#x27;s rather orangey.</li>
            <li> The scent is slightly citrus, but not over-whelming.</li>
            <li> It has a slight tint to it, so you don&#x27;t have to wear makeup.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much less greasy/not greasy at all in my experience among others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> The Lumene is creamier and a little paler in color than the Estée Lauder.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 37 and my skin is looking a tiny bit tired.</li>
            <li> I had it all packaged up to return due to price, but I was unable to get my shade locally</li>
            <li> my skin is pale so an orange face does not match my pale neck</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s job as a sun-blocker at least a little, but no way of knowing that.</li>
            <li> I used those a couple times and now they sit in a drawer-total waste of money!</li>
            <li> I was not impressed by the coverage at all - was hoping for a one-step process, but I&#x27;m going back to moisturizer and foundation.</li>
            <li> Started getting small rashs the size of a dime on my forehead and chin area in addition to redness.  </li>
            <li> , could not match my skin color and made it look dull.</li>
            <li> but I can definitely see how someone with oily skin would hate this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy again, sadly; my hopes are dashed and the quest continues.</li>
            <li> It irritates my eyes badly.</li>

            <li> Great for my 60+skin..covers well...moisturizing but not greasy or heavy..smells delish..like light orange cream!!.. YUM..not too expensive..a nice treat for me..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way to orange and oxidizes even worse, if they fixed the color it would be great.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I ever had an allergic reaction to cosmetics. It irritates my eyes badly. Also, it dries my skin, like nothing else does. I gave it two stars only for the pretty nice coverage, but truly, it doesn&#x27;t deserve a single star, since it totally failed its purpose: it dries and it gives allergic reaction. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> This  is a great  bb cream</li>
            <li> OK so I purchased this BB Cream at a CVS but I like it so much I wanted to leave a good word for it here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 24 years old, I have oily skin on my forhead, nose and chin. This bb cream is not oily nor does it make my face oily which is great. It actually controls the oil somehow and even well into my day at the office my skin looks good (not oily). The first thing I noticed about this product is that it is a little hard to blend but this is easily fixed by applying generous amounts and spreading it as fast as I can before it dries on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love most about this BB cream is that it makes my skin look better, it leaves a dewy finish on my face it and makes it a bit luminous. It really lives up to the product name that its \\&quot;Vitamin C Illuminating\\&quot;. It is a subtle dewy finish, but it makes my skin look as if my skin is naturally dewy. ALSO, this does not make me break out. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 months and no breakouts. I love it much more than the SKIN79 super beblesh triple functions cream (the pink one) and I think that says a lot. I actually did not like the Skin79 one at all, could not match my skin color and made it look dull. Will definitely buy Lumene&#x27;s bb cream again.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. Just got it this past week at Walgreens for only $9.99 on sale think original price is $14.98. What a great product got the 02 medium due to summer sun but I am a natural beige girl. I have some rosacea on my cheeks which this product covers amazingly..It lasts all day and looks flawless on my skin.</li>
            <li> When I first opened up the packaging, the was a blob of product on the outside of the tube abd ut kioijed as though it had cracked in shipping, so I downloaded the Return forms.  Then I discoverred that the tube was intact. and fully sealed.  I do like the product, but asm stilll figuring out how that blob wound up inside the packaging.</li>
            <li> Love this but the color light is just a too orange for me makes my face color look like an oompa loompa and I am Hispanic in my 20s my skin is pale so an orange face does not match my pale neck and this was the lightest color. I hope to find a bb cream that is my shade</li>
            <li> This product really does give a kind of glow to your face. I apply this with a brush after applying a Mac primer to my skin . It can have the tendency to appear a bit cakey in bright lights, but it&#x27;s a good night time make up if you don&#x27;t get a lot of day time exposure.&lt;br /&gt;All in all I really like this product - it blends well when using a brush, it has a nice scent, the glow is supper flattering, and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out. I would buy this again for sure</li>
            <li> I really love this BB cream.  This was recommended by Dr. Oz, and I tried it for the first time.  My skin has been extremely sun damaged over the years.  This product hides the redness and patches, and feels absolutely wonderful.  The product is very light and doesn&#x27;t have that heavy feeling.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on this and decided to try it. I do like how it looks and feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> I like the way it feels on my skin, the color was okay, I am fair skinned and it gave me a little color and evened out my skin tone without looking like I&#x27;m wearing a lot of makeup. It does have a slightly heavy feel to it, so if you work outdoors and sweat a lot like I do it does feel more like foundation than just a moisturizer and sunscreen. But on the other hand it does offer coverage and leaves my skin feeling moisturized after I remove it. It also did not cause me to break out, which is a great thing when you have such sensitive skin. The scent is slightly citrus, but not over-whelming. I like it, I&#x27;ve tried several other BB creams and this was one of my favorites and two of the others were three times the price and by well known cosmetic and skin care providers. I used those a couple times and now they sit in a drawer-total waste of money!</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for three years. It works very well for mature skin. The coverage is great and it doesn&#x27;t look like you have makeup on.</li>
            <li> I am a fair-skinned girl with cool tones in her skin. I&#x27;m not so pale as to give any Irish lass competition in the glow-in-the-dark department, but I do have issues finding foundations/bb creams/cc creams that match my skin. Lumene being a Finnish company, and me being of Scandihoovian ancestry, I figured hey! this stuff might work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No. Just no. It&#x27;s too dark, and it&#x27;s rather orangey. If I had a bit of a tan this would match, but instead the effect is something that you see on a middle school girl first trying out makeup -- I have a freaking line where my face doesn&#x27;t match the rest of me and no amount of blending is helping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The formula is fine. It goes on easily enough, though long-wearing it most certainly is not. I won&#x27;t buy again, sadly; my hopes are dashed and the quest continues.</li>
            <li> I love lumene BB cream, it works great, it hides a lot of imperfections. I&#x27;ve used this for a couple of years.</li>
            <li> This goes on smoothly and seems to work good. Tightens the skin nicely and feels good when applied. I would hope that it does it&#x27;s job as a sun-blocker at least a little, but no way of knowing that. Maybe in 10 years I can tell the difference :).</li>
            <li> like the product -bought it @ wallgreens - much lower price</li>
            <li> This BB cream is too orange for me, even though I got the lightest shade. The coverage is very light. Returned it almost immediately.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 37 and my skin is looking a tiny bit tired. I&#x27;ve tried a couple of other BB creams and was less than impressed.  I tried this one on a whim and I absolutely love it!  It blends well, is lightweight, matches my skin tone and makes my skin look wonderful!  My skin looks younger and more perfect!  I&#x27;ve worn it every day since I purchased it and will definitely be buying this again!</li>
            <li> I had never heard of the Lumene brand before, but when I began browsing for a new BB cream/tinted moisturizer, I looked into it.  I was a bit skeptical at first because there are only two colors in the line, light and medium.  My skin is a bit hard to match (I am fairly fair, but not ivory, and I can get a bit of color when out in the sun, but I definitely don&#x27;t try to tan at all).  I wasn&#x27;t sure it would work out (and the price was such that I was hoping that it would), but I have been really pleased after using it for a few days.  The color blends in naturally and the coverage is a bit more than a tinted moisturizer.  The BB cream goes on smoothly and blends in easily, and I like that it has SPF coverage.  The anti-aging ingredients are a bonus too (I had never heard of Arctic Cloudberry before, but it promises antioxidant benefits, so I am hoping that that lives up to its promise).  I really like this BB cream, but the one thing that I am a bit iffy on is that when it goes on there is a bit of a shine (not much, powder takes care of it, but since I have combination skin - oily on my forehead and sensitive on my cheeks - I am content adding that step to my routine because this BB cream is moisturizing and works well).</li>
            <li> However, I love the product so I kept it.  I had it all packaged up to return due to price, but I was unable to get my shade locally so I kept it. I will be very very careful from now on to check prices very carefully.</li>
            <li> I saw this advertised in a magazine along with Estée Lauder&#x27;s BB.  I bought them both.  The Lumene is creamier and a little paler in color than the Estée Lauder.  I prefer the moisturizing of this BB and after bronzes, the color is fine.</li>
            <li> Does it all! Moisturizes, protects against sun, brightens, and moisturizes.  Great as a light foundation.  Leaves skin feeling fresh and soft.  Gives even color and covers flaws.  Great for men.  Looks natural.  I use some mineral powder over it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great cream, very light but covers well and blends well too.  I&#x27;ve had other BB cream that are super heavy. This one was just perfect.</li>
            <li> I purchased this at the local CVS after seeing it advertised in a magazine.  I am not one to wear make-up and this is &amp;#34;just enough&amp;#34; for me to feel like there&#x27;s a bit of coverage &amp; color, and it goes well with my 40+ pale skin tone (in light color).  I found it easier to blend when used in combination/applied at the same time as a moisturizer, immediately after washing my face.  I&#x27;ve been using it for quite a few months now and love it.  After trying to find coverage for rosacea on my cheeks, and having recently dealt with removing a spot basal cell carcinoma on my face, I will never go without SPF in a product.  It&#x27;s a no-brainer to take care of your skin 365 days a year.</li>
            <li> The color (I used the Light) is very orangey, and the cream started drying on my face before I could even blend it.  The overall effect seemed dry and greasy at the same time.  I was not impressed by the coverage at all - was hoping for a one-step process, but I&#x27;m going back to moisturizer and foundation.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a couple of years and love it.  It has a slight tint to it, so you don&#x27;t have to wear makeup.  It has never caused redness or breakouts, and I have sensitive skin.  Awesome product.  It may cost a little more, but it lasts quite a while.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Felt great when I put it on until I started breaking out and my aestecian confirmed I was having an allergic reaction. Started getting small rashs the size of a dime on my forehead and chin area in addition to redness.  Would not use again.</li>
            <li> love it have had many compliments&lt;br /&gt;great</li>
            <li> Well I tried to sum this up in the title..  This is exactly what it says it is: A lightly tinted moisturiser that offers light coverage.  I guess you could use it underneath foundation but for me, who never likes the heaviness of foundation / powder, I just use it over bare skin.  The coverage IS light, but it&#x27;s also enough coverage that it completely evens out your skin tone.  The first time I started wearing it, I honestly cannot count the number of compliments that I got on how great my skin looked.  It&#x27;s obvious to me that it gives a healthier glow to my complexion and also just helps even out some blotchiness and circles under my eyes.  It&#x27;s not a thick enough coverage to cover scars or freckles, so if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for be aware that this BB cream won&#x27;t do it by itself (you&#x27;ll need a separate concealer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If however you want a basic moisturiser (with SPF!) that can also double as a lightly tinted coverage, try this.  I will say it is VERY moisturising and if you are prone to oily skin or breakouts maybe pass on this, because, although it does blend well and feels very light on your skin once it&#x27;s been on for a few minutes, the moisturiser base in this product is a very thick and creamy, obviously oil-based, lotion.  This is great for me personally, as I&#x27;m prone to dry, flaky skin and eczema... but I can definitely see how someone with oily skin would hate this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I give Lumene BB Cream 4 stars.  It loses a star because of the potential greasiness, and the difficulty I&#x27;ve had in finding a concealer that will work well with it, but overall it&#x27;s a great product and I recommend it. (This is my main cosmetic item honestly, along with lip balm, it is the 1 thing I wear literally every single day.) ^_^</li>
            <li> I got this from Walgreen&#x27;s for only around $15! As a beginner to BB and CC creams, the products I&#x27;ve used in the past/currently include Garnier BB cream, Sephora brand cream, and this one as an addition!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to garnier&#x27;s one (which others said were dewey), this one is much more pinkish/orangeish, so make sure you blend in thoroughly. It&#x27;s much less greasy/not greasy at all in my experience among others I&#x27;ve used. I still love my sephora CC cream, however, but this one gives you pinkish glow, and gives you a complete light coverage, whereas sephora&#x27;s more of correcting colors and making acne scar look less reddish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this !</li>
