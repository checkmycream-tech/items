            <li>If I&#x27;m traveling someplace warm during the winter, I usually want to get a pedicure before I go; it is so cold to wear flip flops to avoid messing up the polish--these are the perfect solution.</li>
            <li>we live in Wisconsin but still like to get pedicures in the winter months.</li>
            <li>Very thick and warm .</li>
            <li>heat helps with those elastic items that you may find a big stiff. :-)</li>
            <li>On the other hand, sock is so versatile that it can be used with flip flops to preserve that fresh pedicure on your way out of salon.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t imagine how tight they are on someone with large feet!  </li>
            <li>They are MUCH thicker than I expected or wanted, essentially like tube socks without the toes.</li>

            <li> maybe for a polish change only... but not a full pedicure.</li>
            <li> , she has smaller fee that I do and narrow.</li>
            <li> They are slightly tighter at the toe but just enough to keep them from sliding down over your toes and smearing your polish.</li>

            <li> but I notice that the elastic is WAY to tight for my feet, I may iron some of the elastic to make them softer and THEN wear them....</li>
            <li> these are just a tad tight for me.  </li>
            <li> These are not to bad, material isn&#x27;t as soft as the other 2 I bought and</li>
            <li> I see that some reviewers complained that they were too small</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer, I am disappointed with how tight these are.</li>
            <li> These can be used in a yoga studio while teaching (if the floor is cold</li>

            <li> Great for the winter months when you get your pedicures or for just wearing around the house. Shipped Quickly. Love them!</li>
            <li> I really thought these would be great. I was looking for socks I could slide on after moisturizing my feet and heels at night. I specifically got these because they didn&#x27;t have toes. They are MUCH thicker than I expected or wanted, essentially like tube socks without the toes. They come up higher on your leg, too, and are very tight, even in my narrow feet. I really can&#x27;t see these being useful for much, honestly. I kept them for winter use, but don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m traveling someplace warm during the winter, I usually want to get a pedicure before I go; it is so cold to wear flip flops to avoid messing up the polish--these are the perfect solution. I see that some reviewers complained that they were too small but I didn&#x27;t have that problem. They are slightly tighter at the toe but just enough to keep them from sliding down over your toes and smearing your polish.</li>
            <li> Gift for wife... loves them</li>
            <li> Nice sox and they do the job, but the quality was a little less than I like.  There were a lot of &amp;#34;loose strings&amp;#34; along internal seams that had to be trimmed before they could be used.</li>
            <li> These arrived on time, good quality, very soft. Very pleased with service and my pedicure clients loved them! They sold very quickly and I will be ordering more very soon.</li>
            <li> Great color choices and a quality sock will keep your feet clean and warm for pedicure/spa treatment.  Comfy and totally machine wash/dry, don&#x27;t worry about lotions or oils.  Love these so much I bought several pair to give as gifts to my best girlfriends :)</li>
            <li> Christmas present.  Recipient loves it</li>
            <li> When I get a pedicure (in cool weather), I need to wear fit-flops and these socks go with them perfectly.  Also, if you don&#x27;t mind wearing them inside the house, it extends your fit-flop usefulness to 4 seasons per year.</li>
            <li> Love these socks. I bought 2 pairs. One for myself and one for a friend. we both love them. we live in Wisconsin but still like to get pedicures in the winter months. these are great! they keep your feet warm without messing up your fresh pedicure.</li>
            <li> Very cute, and the shipping was super fast!</li>
            <li> As a yoga teacher, I am always walking around barefoot while teaching my students.  I am very much aware that my toes are on display for all to see.  So having regular pedicures is a must - who wants to have a yoga teacher with bad toe nails?  This is all fine during tolerable weather seasons;  bt winter season in midwest and pedicure do not always agree.  I have seen many woment walk out of the salon in the middle of the winter in flip flops in attemt to not ruin their fresh pedicure.  Well, if you have ever worn flip flops in winter, you should know that is no fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During Christmas season I read in one of the magazines that pedi-sox makes a perfect &amp;#34;stocking&amp;#34; present and I started doing research on the product.  When I saw this sock on Amazon, I had to have it.  I loved the stripes and nice warm, girly color.  It leaves toes open but the rest of the foot is covered.  These can be used in a yoga studio while teaching (if the floor is cold - most students do not notice it becuase they are on the mat).  On the other hand, sock is so versatile that it can be used with flip flops to preserve that fresh pedicure on your way out of salon.  I am sure I wil lbe getting more of these in the future.</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer, I am disappointed with how tight these are. I&#x27;ve tried stretching them out with no luck. They are good for the purpose but uncomfortable and I have small feet. can&#x27;t imagine how tight they are on someone with large feet!  I&#x27;ve washed them twice now and the elastic is already starting to come out.</li>
            <li> Very thick and warm . Fits snug on your feet and I like the color variety. You can look stylish in the fall/winter with your freshly polished toes and reasonably priced pedi-sox.</li>
            <li> This sock is great to keep your heels and balls of your feet soft and moisturized, while allowing you to be able to paint your toenails. Definitely recommend for at home pedicures.</li>
            <li> Love these. Wish they were available years ago. I could have sold a ton of them in my shop.</li>
            <li> Everyone wants to know where I found these - keep feet toasty for winer pedicures.</li>
            <li> These are Perfect!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I received my socks but I notice that the elastic is WAY to tight for my feet, I may iron some of the elastic to make them softer and THEN wear them....heat helps with those elastic items that you may find a big stiff. :-)</li>
            <li> Love that I can keep my feet a bit warmer while letting my toes dry!</li>
            <li> Any pedicure ive ever had involves the foot being soaked in water....and putting these on after the pedicure would surely mess up the polish. i dont get it...maybe for a polish change only... but not a full pedicure.</li>
            <li> These are not to bad, material isn&#x27;t as soft as the other 2 I bought and these are just a tad tight for me.  I gave these ones to my sister, she has smaller fee that I do and narrow.</li>
