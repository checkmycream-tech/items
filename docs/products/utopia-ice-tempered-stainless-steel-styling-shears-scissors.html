    <ol>
            <li>and I was very happy with them!</li>
            <li>So all in all I would say these are great scissors, but</li>
            <li>Great price</li>
            <li>and they work great, sturdy and just as described.</li>
            <li>They will probably work great if you have a scissor sharpening service.</li>
            <li>Great quality for great price.</li>
            <li>(I received this product for a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.)</li>
            <li>they hold their edge and continue to cut like they did right out of the package, I&#x27;d say they were a VERY good</li>
            <li>Great product for trimming hair, good quality, right sizes as needed for it purpose.  </li>
            <li>The price was by far the best deal I&#x27;ve found on scissors.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t very comfortable at all.</li>
            <li>Not my FAVORITE pair of scissors..</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also lacking one of the finger rests that most shears have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these scissors.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I recently busted a cheap pair of shears, so I was hoping these would be a great replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re made of great quality stainless steel, so there&#x27;s no worry of them rusting up any time soon.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It handles the fine cat hair and the coarser dogs hair with no problem.  </li>
            <li>little pair was the perfect solution.  </li>
            <li>comfortable in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased these because I cut hair in my free time.</li>
            <li>Good quality scissor but a proper barber shear should have a blunted edge so it does not scrape the head of the &#x27;customer&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price</li>
            <li>Cuts quick and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I cut my own hair with these as a touch up between major trims.</li>
            <li>they are very sharp and give a great cut to get rid of my damaged ends.</li>
            <li>I bought these little scissors snd happy with them.  </li>
            <li>If you have hand the same size as a 5 year old, then these will work great.  </li>
            <li>Great scissors, very sharp!</li>
            <li>He has really thick beard/mustache hair and it was able to cut through that pretty good.</li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>The exact size I needed for what I will be using it for</li>
            <li>very happy, especially since i paid about one quarter the price of the exact same scissors at a local store.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t willing to drop $70 on professionals.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what I need.  </li>
            <li>I did use them as the only scissors to cut my son&#x27;s super-curly hair, but curly hair is also more forgiving than straight hair.  </li>
            <li>I am using them to get into &amp;#34;tricky&amp;#34; place on my doggies, the smallness allows me to cut around places like the eyes without the bulk of large scissors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a hair dresser and have not used them much.</li>
            <li>You might want to use them more for precision trimming after you do the major work of a haircut with bigger scissors.  </li>
            <li>Needless to say, these are not my favorite shears and I will continue my search for better ones.</li>
            <li>I tried with regular scissors, and it wasn&#x27;t right.  </li>
            <li>per the seller, these scissors are new to the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;They cut very well, and are pretty sharp.</li>
            <li>These are great little shears, I thought they would be a little larger</li>
            <li>Well..so far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but that mistake is completely on my end.</li>
            <li>I got the smallest ones thinking it was only measuring the blades, but it measures the whole thing.  </li>
            <li>If you are a professional hair stylist, I would not recommend these as your every day sheers.</li>
            <li>It may be because of me having small hands, but it isn&#x27;t really comfortable at all.</li>
            <li>Scissors work good for cutting our bangs.</li>
            <li>These are extremely sharp &amp; great for cutting hair.</li>

            <li> These are extremely sharp &amp; great for cutting hair.</li>
            <li> They stick quite a bit when you open and close them though, so that&#x27;s more than a tad dangerous.</li>
            <li> I should have read the description more closely as the ENTIRE scissor is 4.5.&amp;#34; I&#x27;d assumed the cutting blades were this size?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These shears are sharp, but tiny.  </li>
            <li> I had purchased other scissors locally and cannot believe they don&#x27;t cut hair with any easiness.</li>
            <li> The picture makes them look long, but of the 4 1/2 inch full length of the scissors, the cutting surface is only around an inch.  </li>

            <li> they are very sharp and get the job done immediately.  </li>
            <li> i bought these little scissors for my rescue maltese who&#x27;s afraid of scissors and freaks out whenever she sees a normal size pair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Too small for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll deal with the uncomfortable feeling for my hands since the only time I&#x27;m using them is cutting my husbands hair at home.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used one pair on parchment paper and very delicate silk material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The reason I gave it 3 instead of 5 stars is because these are not meant to be everyday hair cutting scissors.</li>
            <li> review comes from strictly from the fact it pulls a couple uncut hairs at the tip.  </li>
            <li> The grip is a bit awkward.</li>

            <li> Well..so far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too soon to say how they will hold up, but, they seem well made and cut easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No \\&quot;play\\&quot; in the blades.  They come together just right. I&#x27;ve used one pair on parchment paper and very delicate silk material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other for grooming the cats and dogs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It handles the fine cat hair and the coarser dogs hair with no problem.  Cuts quick and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very comfortable in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they hold their edge and continue to cut like they did right out of the package, I&#x27;d say they were a VERY good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As per the seller, these scissors are new to the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wonderful..low price, probably won&#x27;t stay that way if these scissors hold up well and word gets around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll use them for a bit longer.  If they hold up, I&#x27;ll buy some extra ones... before the price goes up..</li>
            <li> These shears are sharp, but tiny.  You might want to use them more for precision trimming after you do the major work of a haircut with bigger scissors.  I did use them as the only scissors to cut my son&#x27;s super-curly hair, but curly hair is also more forgiving than straight hair.  The picture makes them look long, but of the 4 1/2 inch full length of the scissors, the cutting surface is only around an inch.  So all in all I would say these are great scissors, but probably not the only pair you want in your hair-cutting toolbox.</li>
            <li> Not my FAVORITE pair of scissors.. I purchased these because I cut hair in my free time. I recently busted a cheap pair of shears, so I was hoping these would be a great replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re made of great quality stainless steel, so there&#x27;s no worry of them rusting up any time soon.

They stick quite a bit when you open and close them though, so that&#x27;s more than a tad dangerous. Needless to say, these are not my favorite shears and I will continue my search for better ones. (I received this product for a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.)</li>
            <li> I should have read the description more closely as the ENTIRE scissor is 4.5.&amp;#34; I&#x27;d assumed the cutting blades were this size?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My review comes from strictly from the fact it pulls a couple uncut hairs at the tip.  As such I can&#x27;t recommend them for trimming a mustache which was my intended purpose.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these scissors. They work.....I had purchased other scissors locally and cannot believe they don&#x27;t cut hair with any easiness. I am using them to get into &amp;#34;tricky&amp;#34; place on my doggies, the smallness allows me to cut around places like the eyes without the bulk of large scissors.</li>
            <li> These are great little shears, I thought they would be a little larger but that mistake is completely on my end. I used these the other day to trim my long hair and I was very happy with them!</li>
            <li> I got the smallest ones thinking it was only measuring the blades, but it measures the whole thing.  Instead I let me boyfriend use them to trim his mustache and they work well.  He has really thick beard/mustache hair and it was able to cut through that pretty good.</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair with these as a touch up between major trims. They are VERY tiny so I still use my larger pair when I need to cut all the way around.</li>
            <li> i thought the scissor blades would be 4 1/2 inches but that&#x27;s okay. they are very sharp and give a great cut to get rid of my damaged ends.</li>
            <li> The reason I gave it 3 instead of 5 stars is because these are not meant to be everyday hair cutting scissors. If you are a professional hair stylist, I would not recommend these as your every day sheers. They aren&#x27;t very comfortable at all. Now, that being said, i do like the way they cut hair, so its just a toss up for me. I&#x27;ll deal with the uncomfortable feeling for my hands since the only time I&#x27;m using them is cutting my husbands hair at home.</li>
            <li> Great product for trimming hair, good quality, right sizes as needed for it purpose.  The exact size I needed for what I will be using it for</li>
            <li> If you have hand the same size as a 5 year old, then these will work great.  Too small for me.</li>
            <li> i bought these little scissors for my rescue maltese who&#x27;s afraid of scissors and freaks out whenever she sees a normal size pair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this little pair was the perfect solution.  they are very sharp and get the job done immediately.  they are for adults, not children.  very happy, especially since i paid about one quarter the price of the exact same scissors at a local store.</li>
            <li> I bought these to cut my son&#x27;s curly hair.  He is two, and when we attempt to get a hair cut, they suggest shaving it.  No.  I tried with regular scissors, and it wasn&#x27;t right.  I wasn&#x27;t willing to drop $70 on professionals.  I thought I&#x27;d try these, because, hey, they&#x27;re only $5.  This is exactly what I need.  Can&#x27;t beat the price, either.</li>
            <li> I bought these little scissors snd happy with them.  Great price and they work great, sturdy and just as described.</li>
            <li> Scissors fall apart, a lot.</li>
            <li> They are not as sharp as they need to be. They will probably work great if you have a scissor sharpening service.</li>
            <li> Good quality scissor but a proper barber shear should have a blunted edge so it does not scrape the head of the &#x27;customer&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price</li>
            <li> Scissors work good for cutting our bangs.They seem to be sharp.I&#x27;m not a hair dresser and have not used them much.</li>
            <li> These are extremely sharp &amp; great for cutting hair. The price was by far the best deal I&#x27;ve found on scissors. I&#x27;m going to buy the other 2 sizes.</li>
            <li> Great scissors, very sharp! Bought this to cut my bangs and like them a lot. The 4.5 inches is a little short on the blade part, so I probably would have gone with 5\\&quot;</li>
            <li> These are a must have for every make up bag.  I&#x27;ve used them on my bangs, split ends, eye brows, everything!  My hubby loves reaching for them for his needs too.  Great quality for great price.</li>
