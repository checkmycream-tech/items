            <li>I don&#x27;t expect miracles from potions and creams, but I am very happy with this product and will continue to use.</li>
            <li>Very good product, everyone should try it!</li>
            <li>This is a great eye cream.</li>
            <li>The contents of this product are GREAT..........</li>
            <li>I can say the two applications I used felt amazing and had a great look under makeup.</li>
            <li>Softens the area and feels good applying it.  </li>
            <li>The face DNA cream is amazing.</li>
            <li>I just love this eye therapy solution.</li>
            <li>I love the product, but am having difficulty getting it to come out of the tube.</li>
            <li>Have used it many times before &amp; never had this problem before.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say for sure if it has long-term benefits any more than a petroleum product would.</li>
            <li>I am probably hooked for life and just need to buy it in bulk:)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had somewhat of a droopy lid... mostly noticeable to me.</li>
            <li>This is a winner:))</li>
            <li>Seems to smooth and tighten the skin for a while.  </li>
            <li>Currently  I have started on another&lt;br /&gt;private line, but had to find something good for lines surrounding&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the Neova Illuminating Eye Therapy, the only thing I would change would be the way that it is dispensed.</li>
            <li>WELL...in one moment the Neova Illuminating Eye Therapy&lt;br /&gt;worked very well..make that very very well.  </li>
            <li>After about half way thru the product the pump stops pumping the fluid out, but the copper in the product is great for the skin</li>
            <li>Very porcelain finish.</li>
            <li>It really does help under eye circles.</li>
            <li>My undereye concealer goes on much smoother</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to use nearly as much.  </li>
            <li>It tightens, lifts, and smooths the undereye area very well and is the first product I&#x27;ve tried that works to diminish early morning eye puffiness.  </li>
            <li>I am just over 50 years old and starting to have significant wrinkles and bag under my eyes and skin in general.</li>
            <li>It keeps my under eyes looking smooth and and less wrinkled.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a marked difference after 3 weeks.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I just love this eye therapy solution.</li>
            <li> I started using this product line about 6 weeks ago. I am just over 50 years old and starting to have significant wrinkles and bag under my eyes and skin in general. The face DNA cream is amazing. I thought I&#x27;d try the eye cream. Unfortunately, it has a faulty pump system. I only got two applications out of a tube that cost approximately 30 dollars. I can say the two applications I used felt amazing and had a great look under makeup. Very porcelain finish. However, because of the pump defaulted system I will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> I love the product, but am having difficulty getting it to come out of the tube. Have used it many times before &amp; never had this problem before.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd time I purchased this item.  Softens the area and feels good applying it.  Seems to smooth and tighten the skin for a while.  Can&#x27;t say for sure if it has long-term benefits any more than a petroleum product would.</li>
            <li> This is a great eye cream. It really does help under eye circles. However, I absolutely hate the packaging. The pump stopped working after a few days and then the package started to leak. I had to put the product in a different container. This irked me for the price. I still recommend the product, but buyer beware of the packaging. The company should do something about this.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but this product worked where others failed. I am probably hooked for life and just need to buy it in bulk:)</li>
            <li> It gets the job done well.  It keeps my under eyes looking smooth and and less wrinkled.  I use it every night.</li>
            <li> It does seem to lift my eyelids. I&#x27;ve always had somewhat of a droopy lid... mostly noticeable to me. With age (late 40s) the skin is thinnner there. This does seem to lift. I noticed a marked difference after 3 weeks. Must use it daily.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see a difference, however because everyone&#x27;s skin around their eyes are different it might work for someone else.</li>
            <li> very happy...no problems...thank you...</li>
            <li> I have used Neova for at least 13 years. Currently  I have started on another&lt;br /&gt;private line, but had to find something good for lines surrounding&lt;br /&gt;my eyes.  WELL...in one moment the Neova Illuminating Eye Therapy&lt;br /&gt;worked very well..make that very very well.  This is a winner:))</li>
            <li> I have bought this product from several different sources.  I ordered two from this company and both had the same problem.  The pump on the container is designed to work only if no air gets into the tube.  On both of the tubes I received, there was a hole in the side of the tube.  I had to squeeze the lotion through the hole instead of the pump. I was not able to use all of the product due to the faulty packaging.</li>
            <li> My aesthetic-an recommend this in her quarterly news letter, so I decided  to 1) give it try 2) the price was great!!&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed because my skin usually responds to Neova products. I would of settle for even softer lines-I saw&lt;br /&gt;no improvement after two weeks. Used the remaining on face and neck at least my skin felt softer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this once to twice daily for about 6 weeks or so.  It tightens, lifts, and smooths the undereye area very well and is the first product I&#x27;ve tried that works to diminish early morning eye puffiness.  After applying this and letting it absorb for about 10 minutes, I then apply Boots 7 primer.  My undereye concealer goes on much smoother and I don&#x27;t have to use nearly as much.  I don&#x27;t know if the lifting effects are temporary or if my skin will improve over time with use, but I do know that it has definitely improved the overall crepiness.  I don&#x27;t expect miracles from potions and creams, but I am very happy with this product and will continue to use.</li>
            <li> The contents of this product are GREAT..........however, THE PUMP DID NOT WORK..........I called NEOVA and will have to fax a copy of my purchase before they will think about replacement.</li>
            <li> I love the Neova Illuminating Eye Therapy, the only thing I would change would be the way that it is dispensed. After about half way thru the product the pump stops pumping the fluid out, but the copper in the product is great for the skin and I am definitely a believer! The product arrived as specified (I have used it before) and was on time- As I stated earlier my only issue is with the manufacturing of the product.</li>
            <li> Not the correct photo but worked as advertised.</li>
            <li> Very good product, everyone should try it!</li>
