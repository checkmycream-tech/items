            <li>The most beautiful fragrance.</li>
            <li>, I love it!</li>
            <li>Love this scent!</li>
            <li>Honestly think it was a knockoff product been sold to me.</li>
            <li>I loved the Jessical Simpson Fancy Love Gift Ste for Women,  I will order again.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments when I were this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>decided to keep the set because I really love the fragrance.</li>
            <li>Fabulous!  </li>
            <li>I love this fragrance ran out of it and had to order more.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>and it comes with free samples!</li>
            <li>My daughters favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>and, of course, the 3.4 ounce Fancy Love itself.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on Cloud Fancy Love Nine.</li>
            <li>My favorite scent, for years now, light</li>
            <li>I have bought it several times since and this one is as great as they always are.</li>
            <li>I like to use the lotion first before the perfume to have a more longer scent.</li>
            <li>I love it soo much</li>
            <li>This set was such a good value, large bottle of perfume, purse perfume, glittery body spray, body wash and lotion.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Fancy Love is a terrific sweet fragrance to begin with but this gift set is the bomb.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong and it&#x27;s not too soft.</li>
            <li>This flavor is the most delightful I&#x27;ve smelt and highly recommend it, only compairison would be flowerbomb which is also very delisious but three times more expensive.</li>
            <li>This was exactly how it is supposed to be.</li>
            <li>I first got this for Christmas from Macy&#x27;s a couple years ago.</li>
            <li>Very feminine.</li>
            <li>You get so much for the price.</li>
            <li>Burberry (original) comes close, but not as lasting.</li>
            <li>good at first but it wares off and eventually smells weird-</li>
            <li>Smells very soft.  </li>
            <li>I have boght some perfumes online which I think were old</li>
            <li>Be ware not to directly spray it on any white clothing as it can stain.</li>
            <li>It comes with a really convenient .34 ounce (10 ml) bottle of purse spray (the small long clear bottle), The lotion, the bath gel, a shimmering body spray (!)</li>

            <li> Please bring this back, cannot find anything like it. Burberry (original) comes close, but not as lasting.</li>
            <li> The most beautiful fragrance. I am a Big Fan of this one I get so many compliments when I were this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware this seller is using a visual deceiving method from the advertisement pic of the gift set. There&#x27;s one  product in the pic that does not come with the order so please read everything that&#x27;s suppose to go in the box before you purchase. I purchased the set think that I was getting everything in the pic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to keep the set because I really love the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Excellent price. Get a lot of items</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this scent for years.  I used to buy it at Ulta but they stopped carrying it years ago.  Now I get it on Amazon for a great price.  This set was such a good value, large bottle of perfume, purse perfume, glittery body spray, body wash and lotion.  Can&#x27;t beat that.  It arrived in great condition and the scent is as it should be.  I have boght some perfumes online which I think were old and they had gotten skunky.  This was exactly how it is supposed to be.</li>
            <li> Nixon watch is the best.</li>
            <li> Fabulous and a great price! Will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> Absolutely awesome deal!</li>
            <li> Fabulous!  Will order again!</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance ran out of it and had to order more. Unfortunately what I order must be a typo in the item that they currently hv  listed area. Cause I was suppose to hv received 2 lotions and only received one. But I guess it a typo. Not much I can do now but wear my perfume. Loving it!!!!</li>
            <li> great and arrived on time!!!</li>
            <li> I love it but it doesnt stay with me. If it did I would call it my scent but I have to have one that will stick with me.</li>
            <li> Great scent and it comes with free samples!</li>
            <li> Smells very soft.  Very feminine.</li>
            <li> The fragrance does not smell the same as the ones sold in stores. Honestly think it was a knockoff product been sold to me.</li>
            <li> I get tons of compliments everywhere I go. From strangers to family, friends and co workers. It has a charming scent. I like to use the lotion first before the perfume to have a more longer scent. Be ware not to directly spray it on any white clothing as it can stain.</li>
            <li> My daughters favorite perfume. Great price!</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance. It&#x27;s just enough. It&#x27;s not too strong and it&#x27;s not too soft. but just enough to get the attention of people. The scent and it&#x27;s just so sensuous, I love it!</li>
            <li> good at first but it wares off and eventually smells weird- maybe it reacts weird with my skin type possibly?</li>
            <li> love it!!! Will def buy another one soon! I&#x27;ve got places to be this year!!!</li>
            <li> Love this scent! The set is beautiful and a great gift to give!</li>
            <li> I first got this for Christmas from Macy&#x27;s a couple years ago. I have bought it several times since and this one is as great as they always are. Always get a LOT OF compliments when I wear this scent. Last all day especially if you layer the scents and wear the lotion and use the body wash. This is my go to scent. I haven&#x27;t met anyone that didn&#x27;t like it yet.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing!!!!! A fantastic deal!!!!!</li>
            <li> My favorite scent, for years now, light</li>
            <li> I loved the Jessical Simpson Fancy Love Gift Ste for Women,  I will order again. I&#x27;ve done this review twice.</li>
            <li> I love it soo much it&#x27;s a great buy</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Absolutely lovely, arrived perfect!</li>
            <li> This flavor is the most delightful I&#x27;ve smelt and highly recommend it, only compairison would be flowerbomb which is also very delisious but three times more expensive.</li>
            <li> Just awesome! Fancy Love is a terrific sweet fragrance to begin with but this gift set is the bomb. You get so much for the price. It comes with a really convenient .34 ounce (10 ml) bottle of purse spray (the small long clear bottle), The lotion, the bath gel, a shimmering body spray (!) and, of course, the 3.4 ounce Fancy Love itself. I&#x27;m on Cloud Fancy Love Nine. And the box it comes in is gorgeous. It looks like a wedding gift with the scrolly gold writing. So classy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would make a great gift. I think I&#x27;m going to repurchase.</li>
