            <li>This kit is for anyone who is not afraid of color and adventerous</li>
            <li>The package showed up right on time.</li>
            <li>I wore it for the first time and I will say that there was creasing on my lid whatsoever.</li>
            <li>it finially arrived a couple days after the first product review.</li>
            <li>but pretty.</li>
            <li>i have tried many different brands ranging from elf, to mac and makeup forever, and nyx eye shadows never disappoint.  </li>
            <li>this is a very versatile palette that you can use to create many different looks.</li>
            <li>I used the shimmery golden color on the far left bottom most corner and the shadow did not crease and lasted on my lids for 8+ hours.</li>
            <li>But for while they&#x27;re there, they apply long lasting, good color.</li>
            <li>I really recommend üëèüëèüëèüëè</li>

            <li>It was due to arrive more than a week ago.</li>
            <li>highly pigmented, blend easily, no major creasing or caking (except for the one light yellow-white color in this palette).  </li>
            <li>I enjoyed all the colors in this palette, especially the different finishes whether they were matte, translucent or shimmer.</li>
            <li>The colors are lovely pigmented and has a variety of colors for everyday looks.</li>
            <li>love the colors, and the textures (i&#x27;m starting to get a bit older, and i need to start switching away from the ultra shimmery loose mica eye-shadows).  </li>
            <li>All the shadows are high pigmented soft and silky.</li>
            <li>The colors really did not stay on that long even with the primer.</li>
            <li>they last all day and the you can actually see the color they don&#x27;t apply light like other generic brands which makes you apply the same color like 5 times</li>
            <li>of the colors don&#x27;t exactly go with my green eyes</li>

            <li> Love this set--the colors are amazing. Would definitely buy again!!!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my sister , she absolutely loves it  !!! The colors are lovely pigmented and has a variety of colors for everyday looks.</li>
            <li> I am the jubilant recipient of the NYX Wicked Dreams eye shadow palette. Many months ago I had added this item to my wish list and week after week I pined for this palette. Fortunately for me my boyfriend did the right and admiral thing and ordered it for me as a Christmas gift!!! I was stunned when I unwrapped this gift on Christmas night. The shadows are so pigmented.I wore it for the first time and I will say that there was creasing on my lid whatsoever. I did apply my Sorphia concealer all over my eyelid as an eye shadow prime just prior to putting on the NYX eye shadow. Unfortunately the shadows in this palette are not named or numbered but. I used the shimmery golden color on the far left bottom most corner and the shadow did not crease and lasted on my lids for 8+ hours.</li>
            <li> Great colors....and love the size of the compact...not too big. :)</li>
            <li> Of course it&#x27;s not the best quality, but for this price I have to give 5 stars. But I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it as only one option to have.</li>
            <li> Very popular item in the Middle East!  You have the best Price!  Very nice colors!  i will shop with you again!</li>
            <li> The colors are really nice, I do wish they did not had so many shimmers and more matte ones, from what i saw there is equal amounts of each. Though the quality is great for the price, not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li> The little color blocks don&#x27;t last very long before the metal at the bottom starts showing. I don&#x27;t even apply that heavy! But for while they&#x27;re there, they apply long lasting, good color.</li>
            <li> Where is it? It was due to arrive more than a week ago. It was ordered in December, I sent an email a couple days ago. No feedback whatsoever yet. Really disappointed!!! Hope I haven&#x27;t lost all that money...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well it finially arrived a couple days after the first product review. Still no response to my emails by the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kit seems smaller than I had expected. Colours are nice and strong as they should...its only had one use though...but pretty.</li>
            <li> GREAT palette.  love the colors, and the textures (i&#x27;m starting to get a bit older, and i need to start switching away from the ultra shimmery loose mica eye-shadows).  i have tried many different brands ranging from elf, to mac and makeup forever, and nyx eye shadows never disappoint.  highly pigmented, blend easily, no major creasing or caking (except for the one light yellow-white color in this palette).  this is a very versatile palette that you can use to create many different looks.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors. Make up stay on all day longer. I really recommend üëèüëèüëèüëè</li>
            <li> love all the color choices of this palette</li>
            <li> I love this pallet, the colors are so vibrant. The package showed up right on time. Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Some of the colors don&#x27;t exactly go with my green eyes but there&#x27;s pigments in there for every eye color.</li>
            <li> The colors really did not stay on that long even with the primer. Gave away to an Aunt.</li>
            <li> Love the colors! they last all day and the you can actually see the color they don&#x27;t apply light like other generic brands which makes you apply the same color like 5 times so you can see the shade!</li>
            <li> I have been buying a lot of NYX eyeshadows lately. I have really feel for the brand. All the shadows are high pigmented soft and silky. I enjoyed all the colors in this palette, especially the different finishes whether they were matte, translucent or shimmer. This kit is for anyone who is not afraid of color and adventerous</li>
            <li> Use this pallete often and I love it! Compact and the mirror is a plus.</li>
