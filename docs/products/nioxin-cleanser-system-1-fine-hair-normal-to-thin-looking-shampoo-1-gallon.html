            <li>product is good but very poor packaging and it was busted open when it arrived fortunately product inside is not damaged</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t looked into what the product does or how it works, but I can tell you it has made a large visual difference in my son&#x27;s hair.</li>

            <li> Everything was good, no problems, shipping great, product  good!! I have used this product before, so not much to say except you want me to write 20 words. It is just shampoo and I like it.</li>
            <li> My husband has used this for many years</li>
            <li> Wife loves this product.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and this shampoo along with the conditioner (scalp therapy) keeps my hair and scalp in perfect condition.  I have been using this for over 15 years.</li>
            <li> The greatest product for hair ever!!</li>
            <li> Good product. Good price.</li>
            <li> Great product. Used it for years. Tried other products but always went back t using Nioxin. Best product out there.</li>
            <li> This product is always great.  An even better buy in the gallon form.  You say lots of $$$ this way.</li>
            <li> My mom has a hairdresser license so usually shops in the professional store. This was a better price. My husband uses it because he breaks out on his scalp from almost everything else. Works great for him with thinning hair.</li>
            <li> As good as shampoo gets. Seems to help with the body of each hair.</li>
            <li> Nioxin is a wonderful product. If you have thinning hair, this product works where others don&#x27;t. Buying the one gallon container is cost effective compared to the smaller bottles.I will only buy in one gallon containers from now on.</li>
            <li> I was concerned when package arrived without the number 1 on the jug. However;  Back of jug is the same as my 1 liter bottles.  exactly the same ingredients, same descriptions, same smell, viscosity.  I would pay $121.80 for four 1L bottles with my chain&#x27;s cutting place&#x27;s \\&quot;BUY ONE GET ONE HALF PRICE\\&quot; and my cutting lady&#x27;s discount.  So the advertised savings of $58 IS 100% accurate.    It&#x27;s funny, my cutting place&#x27;s no deal price would be $170.  even I knew better!  This will last me 2 years at my short-hair usage rate.    well done H&amp;H!    FYI, I made a mistake of assuming this gallon jug was equal to four bottles of Nioxin I bought at the barber.  Well idiot me, I mixed up gallons with quarts and liters.  You get 3.78 liters not four. You get 7 ounces less than four 1 liter bottles. Still big savings though.</li>
            <li> Great price for a great product</li>
            <li> Delivery on time and product received as described.</li>
            <li> was good ,  a few drops leaked out , im sure from the rough shipping  maybe tape all around the cap  good job!</li>
            <li> This shampoo (cleanser) is excellent to ensure I can keep my hair healthy.  The one gallon size is a great value which allowed me to fill 4 smaller (previously empty) bottles and still have shampoo (cleanser) remaining.  Nioxin products are expensive but excellent for men&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> For thinning hair, this is the stuff to get. I have used this for almost 20 years. It&#x27;s the only shampoo I use. Stopped hair loss, and keep my hair from being oily. Great stuff!.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price.</li>
            <li> My son bought this shampoo and began using it (he lives in another state).  When I saw him this summer, his hair looked so much fuller.  I purchased the gallon as a Christmas present and when he arrived for Christmas his hair looked thicker and fuller then it did in the summer.  I haven&#x27;t looked into what the product does or how it works, but I can tell you it has made a large visual difference in my son&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> THE FORMULA IN THE ONE-GALLON JUG  DOESN&#x27;T CLEAN MY HAIR  AS WELL AS THE FORMULA IN MY INITIAL PURCHASE  OF THE SAME SHAMPOO THAT CAME IN THE 10.1 FL.OZ. BOTTLE.  I&#x27;M RETURNING THE JUG FOR A REFUND.</li>
            <li> product is good but very poor packaging and it was busted open when it arrived fortunately product inside is not damaged</li>
            <li> My daughter has itching problem with other products.  Not this one.  This shampoo also helps thinning problem.. It is pricy, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> accurate shipping excellent product.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome price for this product.  It&#x27;s exactly as advertised, too. I recommend you sign up if you need this product.</li>
            <li> I love it. It is great</li>
            <li> Love this product as well. And have used it along with the cleanser for years.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely amazing! My husband has psoriasis &amp; he loves the way his scalp is taken care of with this system! It is awesome &amp; he won&#x27;t go without Nioxin!</li>
            <li> Excellent Shampoo/Conditioner - purchasing in volume makes it more affordable than purchasing in a salon!</li>
            <li> Works just as well as the product purchased at the salon for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> Great buy and works great on stopping hair fall out.</li>
            <li> When we started to have to pay a ridiculous price at a salon for this product we thought he would have to stop using it.  I took a chance that I could find it on Amazon and we were very happy to find the gallon bottle and at such a discount!  This will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> Was glad to find this size.</li>
            <li> nioxin is a great product</li>
