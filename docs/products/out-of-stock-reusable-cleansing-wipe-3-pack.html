            <li>So, when I was asked, to review this product, I said yes, hoping it would be a nice alternative, and at a lower price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The opinion is my own.</li>
            <li>Even washing it with soap and warm water as the directions stated, make up did not wash out.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best.</li>
            <li>I will be honest, when I took one out</li>
            <li>infact they are so great I had to share with family, so I am sure I will be ordering more soon.  </li>
            <li>Not as effective as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li>and I find this very easy to use.</li>
            <li>really am surprised how well these have worked, any bumps I felt on my skin are gone, and I am very happy with this</li>
            <li>They are soft and do an excellent job of removing eye liner.  </li>
            <li>Our baby also seems to agree, so we love it!&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>It takes everything off very well and just use a good cleanser or makeup remover, it even does it well on its own.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I gave this product</li>
            <li>I love these,</li>
            <li>I have used Buff Puff reusable pads, and use to love them.</li>
            <li>This wipe is a cleansing wipe, not a moisturizer, so I am pleased with what it does for cleansing.</li>
            <li>Glad I got em for her</li>
            <li>Just love it.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love.....</li>
            <li>I bought 1 pack to try and ended up ordering more to give to friends who are now hooked on using them.  </li>
            <li>This is so much better than buying makeup remover wipes at the store.</li>
            <li>That I do not wear foundation makes it even MORE important that my skin is cleaned well!  </li>
            <li>I wanted to love this cleansing &amp;#34;wipe&amp;#34;, but it didn&#x27;t work too well for me.</li>
            <li>Plus, I get to save more since I don&#x27;t need to buy makeup remover towelettes.</li>
            <li>These are the best alternative to disposable facial cleansing sheets!  </li>
            <li>I have found a great new way to clean my face!  </li>
            <li>I also love that its travel friendly.</li>
            <li>And I will see what other products this company sells because the quality of this item is superb!</li>
            <li>The wipe is easy to wash out dirt and makeup with soap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does a great job of removing any types of make up (daily light make up and</li>
            <li>It turned into a gentle, flexible lightweight sponge fits nicely in my cupped hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t like to pull on my skin to clean or moisturize it.  </li>
            <li>I would say this would be good for someone who only uses light powders on their face.</li>
            <li>Great for cleansing the face without using a washcloth which to me is rough.  </li>
            <li>Hey, I can do that a couple times a week and safe a whole lot of money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was expecting true microfiber towels or towelettes</li>
            <li>They also quickly rinse out so clean when I am done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These pink soft sponges are so awesome!</li>
            <li>it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Super soft &amp; hypoallergenic great for sensitive</li>
            <li>overall I&#x27;m very satisfied, and I would purchase again.</li>
            <li>I just wet the wipe with warm water and just quickly and easy remove all the makeup and mascara.</li>
            <li>I definitely intend to buy more once these babies wear out!</li>
            <li>After I used these new pads, my face has that same lovely glow, and nice texture, and doesn&#x27;t cost me a fortune!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to carry around particularly for travel.</li>
            <li>At 3/$9.99 they aren&#x27;t worth the price.</li>
            <li>like they last a while &amp; its nice that 3 came in the package.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this for my wife as a fantastic reusable makeup remover wipe that she loves to use, but we also discovered a few other great uses for it!  </li>
            <li>They clean up really easy&lt;</li>
            <li>They become soft when wet &amp; do a great job</li>
            <li>a new way to clean my face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works exactly like it is supposed to and can re re-used over and over.  </li>
            <li>First time using it</li>
            <li>It works wonders and even adding a drop of facial cleanser can make it even better.</li>
            <li>I personally use it with my favorite mild facial cleanser (Kiehl&#x27;s Ultra Facial Cleanser) that is not quite effective by itself.  </li>
            <li>so soft that it doesn&#x27;t clean your face, these cloths soak up the face wash and don&#x27;t deposit it on the skin.</li>
            <li>This wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was expecting, as I was thinking they would be more of a microfiber cloth than a sponge type material, but as it turns out this product works just as well as the single use cloth products I had been using before.</li>
            <li>I generally have a &#x27;face brush&#x27; but obviously when travelling this is more convenient and is gentle enough yet better than hands alone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now using a whole lot less waste removing my makeup, and I&#x27;m really happy about that!</li>
            <li>and it also works very well as a bath scrub cloth.</li>
            <li>It is amazingly comfortable to the skin especially when you use it with lukewarm water.</li>
            <li>it dries up fast.  </li>
            <li>Seems to work very well</li>
            <li>(they won&#x27;t stay on your towel rack), but work really well.</li>
            <li>I see that this wipe takes off my eye makeup really well.  </li>
            <li>I now wash my face much faster at nite.  </li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>the bride-to-be had the same issue w/them, I was embarrassed and bought her a nice set of different sized micro-cloth</li>
            <li>These pink pads plump up nice and soft and remove my eye</li>
            <li>Just got this a few ways ago, and I&#x27;m loving</li>
            <li>These Reusable Cleaning Wipes are so smooth and soft that they simply moved the oil around on my skin without very much cleansing going on.  </li>
            <li>I tried them for a week hoping that I would figure out the &amp;#34;technique&amp;#34; I needed to use to get them to work well, but I just don&#x27;t like them as my face never felt as clean as it does when I use a simple wash cloth.</li>
            <li>I was in desperate search for an effective wash cloth when my old tiny awesome facial towel from Korea was out the door.  </li>
            <li>a dab of my facial cleanser &amp; a quick kneading under running water.&lt;br /&gt;Looks</li>
            <li>Very soft and gentle yet cleans all traces of makeup without scrubbing.</li>
            <li>It is just soooo soft and gentle on my face.</li>
            <li>I brought cleansing oil and small facial wash cloth that worked very well together from Korea, but it would be costly to fly back for my facials!  </li>
            <li>Subsequently, I tried harsh facial wipes which dried my face effectively and mild facial cleansers which did not remove make-up effectively.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>As a 27 year old, my face has returned to its 17 year old self!!</li>
            <li>Works really well to remove makeup and its gentle enough for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Other people may go longer before they clean it?</li>
            <li>These are pretty small, I don&#x27;t find them soft, may be I will clean w/them...</li>
            <li>The area around my eyes has recently been very troublesome.  </li>
            <li>They are so gently and do not cause any further irritation.  </li>
            <li>nd mascara completely off with out</li>
            <li>They are really soft too.</li>
            <li>I ended up using an old pant hanger to clip them on when they dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are so soft and can be used over and over again.  </li>
            <li>I ran it through water and it became this soft cloud-like fabric that I used to remove my WATERPROOF makeup.</li>
            <li>my skin feels soft and supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use them with warm water and they get rid of all the grime and makeup without over drying or irritating my skin.  </li>
            <li>I remember my sister used to use/love a funky Nike towel that dries your body and then itself for packing like no other.  </li>
            <li>I use with just a little bit of facial cleanser to clean my face and remove mascara.</li>
            <li>I was diagnosed with contact dermatitis and it is very itchy, red, scaly, and dry and</li>
            <li>but I have sensitive skin, and it&#x27;d feel so dry after.</li>
            <li>They feel a bit stiff, even when wet, and they don&#x27;t clean the skin as well as similar products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>

            <li> Subsequently, I tried harsh facial wipes which dried my face effectively and mild facial cleansers which did not remove make-up effectively.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> As a 27 year old, my face has returned to its 17 year old self!!</li>
            <li> Works really well to remove makeup and its gentle enough for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Other people may go longer before they clean it?</li>
            <li> These are pretty small, I don&#x27;t find them soft, may be I will clean w/them...</li>
            <li> The area around my eyes has recently been very troublesome.  </li>
            <li> They are so gently and do not cause any further irritation.  </li>
            <li> nd mascara completely off with out</li>
            <li> They are really soft too.</li>
            <li> I ended up using an old pant hanger to clip them on when they dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are so soft and can be used over and over again.  </li>
            <li> I ran it through water and it became this soft cloud-like fabric that I used to remove my WATERPROOF makeup.</li>
            <li> my skin feels soft and supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use them with warm water and they get rid of all the grime and makeup without over drying or irritating my skin.  </li>
            <li> I remember my sister used to use/love a funky Nike towel that dries your body and then itself for packing like no other.  </li>
            <li> I use with just a little bit of facial cleanser to clean my face and remove mascara.</li>
            <li> I was diagnosed with contact dermatitis and it is very itchy, red, scaly, and dry and</li>
            <li> but I have sensitive skin, and it&#x27;d feel so dry after.</li>
            <li> They feel a bit stiff, even when wet, and they don&#x27;t clean the skin as well as similar products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Difficult to clean; too soft.</li>
            <li> skin dries over winter and cleaning my face is always a challenge due to my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It is rather pointless to spend $150 for a product and put it on skin that needs exfoliation! ;)</li>
            <li> , now I always wipe one side of my face, look at the mirror, and compare the other side to see how it works against facial cleanser</li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason for FOUR stars rather than FIVE is because I want to see how long one pad lasts!  </li>
            <li> My face is still dry, but I do not think it is because of this wipe.  </li>
            <li> My face is just dry</li>
            <li> If I squeezed the water out to avoid this, well then, I had a dry sponge.</li>
            <li> just like regular sponge not worth the money</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also allows, those expensive products we buy to really get deep into our skin.</li>
            <li> just wet and all your make up comes off.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected at all.  </li>
            <li> but WITHOUT pulling my skin these pink babies leave my skin looking polished and plump.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint about this product is that it can sometimes be a bit hard to wash out all of the makeup of the product, and due to their size they can be a bit finicky to dry.</li>
            <li> looking like I have black eyes from it smearing all over</li>
            <li> they take of eyeliner, foundation, black anything etc,.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like these because they have a slick, almost slimy feel to them after they are wet.</li>
            <li> Little.</li>
            <li> Where have these little sponges been all my life???  </li>
            <li> It is not meant for harsh exfoliation.  </li>
            <li> heavy night-out make up).  </li>
            <li> I wear makeup to work everyday</li>
            <li> I wondered how such a thin looking, hard feeling object could do what it promised to do.  </li>
            <li> Not very effective.</li>
            <li> I cannot tell you if this wipe and the vaguely remembered towel are the same material, but I can tell you that this wipe can be used with soap and is not for drying.&lt;br</li>
            <li> all the small bumps that I used to get from makeup remover around my jawline is no longer an issue.  </li>
            <li> know all these pads are expensive, but when you go get a facial, they usually cost from $75-$125!</li>
            <li> it was a 3 hard pieces of some sort of  foam.  </li>
            <li> I felt like I had to tug at my eye area really hard to get the make up off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s deffiently worth a try ladies you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> And I absolutely hate it when loose fibers get left behind.</li>
            <li> Awkward to decide where to put them to dry</li>
            <li> The cleansing wipes are very hard unless they touch water.  </li>
            <li> any abrasive item that comes in contact with them makes the condition worse.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t spend an outrageous amount, so no big deal.</li>
            <li> However, I do use long-lasting liquid foundation, and that is difficult to remove already.</li>
            <li> I am, however, disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Terrible product EVER!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend them to anyone who isn&#x27;t terribly bothered by having to spend a bit of time getting them cleaned up after use.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I originally bought this for my wife as a fantastic reusable makeup remover wipe that she loves to use, but we also discovered a few other great uses for it!  It&#x27;s wonderful for drying our baby after a bath and it also works very well as a bath scrub cloth. It is amazingly comfortable to the skin especially when you use it with lukewarm water. Our baby also seems to agree, so we love it!&lt;br /&gt;Will surely buy again!!!</li>
            <li> Easy to carry around particularly for travel. I generally have a &#x27;face brush&#x27; but obviously when travelling this is more convenient and is gentle enough yet better than hands alone.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot the product is great and I don&#x27;t have to worry about mold Bc it dries up fast.  It takes everything off very well and just use a good cleanser or makeup remover, it even does it well on its own.</li>
            <li> These Reusable Cleaning Wipes are so smooth and soft that they simply moved the oil around on my skin without very much cleansing going on.  I tried them for a week hoping that I would figure out the &amp;#34;technique&amp;#34; I needed to use to get them to work well, but I just don&#x27;t like them as my face never felt as clean as it does when I use a simple wash cloth.</li>
            <li> Nice idea, not so great execution..so soft that it doesn&#x27;t clean your face, these cloths soak up the face wash and don&#x27;t deposit it on the skin. Convenient size and all, but I ended up not using them.</li>
            <li> Seems to work very well</li>
            <li> Little. Awkward to decide where to put them to dry (they won&#x27;t stay on your towel rack), but work really well. So: pluses and minuses.</li>
            <li> Very happy with these cloths. As a 27 year old, my face has returned to its 17 year old self!!</li>
            <li> I have used the Wonder Cloth for years and these work just as well!</li>
            <li> I did not like it.  Difficult to clean; too soft.</li>
            <li> Works really well to remove makeup and its gentle enough for my sensitive skin. I also love that its travel friendly. I used mine twice in the same day before washing. Other people may go longer before they clean it?</li>
            <li> The area around my eyes has recently been very troublesome.  I was diagnosed with contact dermatitis and it is very itchy, red, scaly, and dry and any abrasive item that comes in contact with them makes the condition worse.  These wipes have become a life saver.  They are so gently and do not cause any further irritation.  I really am very happy with this product and will continue to purchase them.</li>
            <li> I actually recieved  these today and I used one once I got home from work. I must say I am absolutely in love with this product! It took all my makeup off with out feeling like I just ripped my face off! I always have difficulty getting my eye liner nd mascara completely off with out looking like I have black eyes from it smearing all over but, I am proud to say this product put an end to that!!!! ðŸ˜Š I am so glad I gave this product a try cause now I&#x27;m a happy customer who will continue to buy! It&#x27;s deffiently worth a try ladies you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I love these, just wet and all your make up comes off. I finish cleaning my face with a cleansing oil and maybe a trace of mascara is left after using the sponge.</li>
            <li> just like regular sponge not worth the money</li>
            <li> I have used Buff Puff reusable pads, and use to love them. However, I feel the quality has deteriorated over the years. So, when I was asked, to review this product, I said yes, hoping it would be a nice alternative, and at a lower price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know all these pads are expensive, but when you go get a facial, they usually cost from $75-$125! So what do they do? They take pads like this and start to exfoliate your face. Hey, I can do that a couple times a week and safe a whole lot of money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I have left a facial, my skin always glowed. After I used these new pads, my face has that same lovely glow, and nice texture, and doesn&#x27;t cost me a fortune!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really am surprised how well these have worked, any bumps I felt on my skin are gone, and I am very happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also allows, those expensive products we buy to really get deep into our skin. It is rather pointless to spend $150 for a product and put it on skin that needs exfoliation! ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very nice product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent a sample to test and review. The opinion is my own.</li>
            <li> I was in desperate search for an effective wash cloth when my old tiny awesome facial towel from Korea was out the door.  I brought cleansing oil and small facial wash cloth that worked very well together from Korea, but it would be costly to fly back for my facials!  Subsequently, I tried harsh facial wipes which dried my face effectively and mild facial cleansers which did not remove make-up effectively.  I did some research and came across this product.  I gave it a shot although the pictures and descriptions were quite confusing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  The cleansing wipes are very hard unless they touch water.  Don&#x27;t let it scare you.  It is not meant for harsh exfoliation.  It softens immediately.&lt;br /&gt;2.  The softened wipes feel like activity towels(?).  I remember my sister used to use/love a funky Nike towel that dries your body and then itself for packing like no other.  I cannot tell you if this wipe and the vaguely remembered towel are the same material, but I can tell you that this wipe can be used with soap and is not for drying.&lt;br /&gt;3. I personally use it with my favorite mild facial cleanser (Kiehl&#x27;s Ultra Facial Cleanser) that is not quite effective by itself.  I see that this wipe takes off my eye makeup really well.  I am so amazed with this thing, now I always wipe one side of my face, look at the mirror, and compare the other side to see how it works against facial cleanser alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does a great job of removing any types of make up (daily light make up and heavy night-out make up).  My face is still dry, but I do not think it is because of this wipe.  My face is just dry no matter what I do.  This wipe is a cleansing wipe, not a moisturizer, so I am pleased with what it does for cleansing.</li>
            <li> Works great for removing make-up and mascara without any cleanser!  The wipe is easy to wash out dirt and makeup with soap. I now wash my face much faster at nite.  all the small bumps that I used to get from makeup remover around my jawline is no longer an issue.  I just wet the wipe with warm water and just quickly and easy remove all the makeup and mascara.</li>
            <li> My wife says they&#x27;re perfect for her skin. Glad I got em for her</li>
            <li> The cleansing wipes are phenomenal!  I bought them as a birthday gift for my girlfriend and she loves them!</li>
            <li> Terrible product EVER!! Not microfiber nothing! I was expecting true microfiber towels or towelettes it was a 3 hard pieces of some sort of  foam.  Not what I expected at all.  If I couldn&#x27;t even give it a rating I wouldn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was expecting, as I was thinking they would be more of a microfiber cloth than a sponge type material, but as it turns out this product works just as well as the single use cloth products I had been using before. They are really soft too. I&#x27;m now using a whole lot less waste removing my makeup, and I&#x27;m really happy about that! My only complaint about this product is that it can sometimes be a bit hard to wash out all of the makeup of the product, and due to their size they can be a bit finicky to dry. I ended up using an old pant hanger to clip them on when they dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But overall I&#x27;m very satisfied, and I would purchase again. I&#x27;d recommend them to anyone who isn&#x27;t terribly bothered by having to spend a bit of time getting them cleaned up after use.</li>
            <li> This product is a gem! Works exactly like it is supposed to and can re re-used over and over.  I use with just a little bit of facial cleanser to clean my face and remove mascara. Just love it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like these because they have a slick, almost slimy feel to them after they are wet. At 3/$9.99 they aren&#x27;t worth the price. Even more disturbing is the fact that they are made in China. I don&#x27;t want ANY product made in China on my skin or in my body!</li>
            <li> Love them. would like to know where I can get more from.!</li>
            <li> In theory, it is a wonderful idea. The first time it worked great! Even washing it with soap and warm water as the directions stated, make up did not wash out. I felt like I had to tug at my eye area really hard to get the make up off. Didn&#x27;t spend an outrageous amount, so no big deal. I am, however, disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Great make up remover wipes! They become soft when wet &amp; do a great job&lt;br /&gt;of removing my (regular not waterproof) mascara &amp; eye pencil without&lt;br /&gt;having to use an oil-based make up remover. They clean up really easy&lt;br /&gt;with a dab of my facial cleanser &amp; a quick kneading under running water.&lt;br /&gt;Looks like they last a while &amp; its nice that 3 came in the package. I&lt;br /&gt;would definitely buy these again! And I will see what other products this company sells because the quality of this item is superb!</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love.....I bought 1 pack to try and ended up ordering more to give to friends who are now hooked on using them.  Great for cleansing the face without using a washcloth which to me is rough.  These are so soft and can be used over and over again.  You got me hooked I will be ordering again and again....</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best. Very soft and gentle yet cleans all traces of makeup without scrubbing. I have very sensitive skin and these are perfect!</li>
            <li> These are pretty small, I don&#x27;t find them soft, may be I will clean w/them...I was looking forward to getting them. I had bought them for 1 bridal shower and kept 2, the bride-to-be had the same issue w/them, I was embarrassed and bought her a nice set of different sized micro-cloth and she loved those.</li>
            <li> These pink soft sponges are so awesome! First time using it I ran it through water and it became this soft cloud-like fabric that I used to remove my WATERPROOF makeup. It works wonders and even adding a drop of facial cleanser can make it even better. This is so much better than buying makeup remover wipes at the store. I definitely intend to buy more once these babies wear out!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE!!!!! they take of eyeliner, foundation, black anything etc,. I 100% recommend these and have NO complaints....they even got delivered n about 2 days!</li>
            <li> a new way to clean my face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin dries over winter and cleaning my face is always a challenge due to my sensitive skin.  I also don&#x27;t like to pull on my skin to clean or moisturize it.  And I absolutely hate it when loose fibers get left behind. I will be honest, when I took one out I wondered how such a thin looking, hard feeling object could do what it promised to do.  It turned into a gentle, flexible lightweight sponge fits nicely in my cupped hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I seldom wear foundation but I do wear lipstick and eye make up.  That I do not wear foundation makes it even MORE important that my skin is cleaned well!  I have found a great new way to clean my face!  These pink pads plump up nice and soft and remove my eye make up and residual lipstick (after I use my beauty oil to cleanse my lipstick away) with only water!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was amazed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With my cleanser but WITHOUT pulling my skin these pink babies leave my skin looking polished and plump.  There is no pulling of skin with their use. I love these! They also quickly rinse out so clean when I am done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for FOUR stars rather than FIVE is because I want to see how long one pad lasts!  Some reviewers have said a pad lasts a month!  If that is the case for me, these will get FIVE stars!</li>
            <li> Just got this a few ways ago, and I&#x27;m loving it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Super soft &amp; hypoallergenic great for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I used to take off my make with wipes but I have sensitive skin, and it&#x27;d feel so dry after. So I started use albolene to remove it and with the addition of these sponges my skin feels soft and supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.s. It also works well with a facial cleanser/scrub</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this cleansing &amp;#34;wipe&amp;#34;, but it didn&#x27;t work too well for me. However, I do use long-lasting liquid foundation, and that is difficult to remove already. These cleansing wipes are basically a sponge, and I didn&#x27;t care for how it soaked up water and squished all over when I applied it to my face. If I squeezed the water out to avoid this, well then, I had a dry sponge. Not very effective. I would say this would be good for someone who only uses light powders on their face.</li>
            <li> I wear makeup to work everyday and I find this very easy to use. Plus, I get to save more since I don&#x27;t need to buy makeup remover towelettes. Two thumbs up for this product!</li>
            <li> the reusable cleansing wipes are wonderful.....infact they are so great I had to share with family, so I am sure I will be ordering more soon.  It is just soooo soft and gentle on my face. These would be so wonderful for babys too! I love them!</li>
            <li> Great product. Works really well. I like not having to use all the cotton&lt;br /&gt;balls to remove makeup.</li>
            <li> These are the best alternative to disposable facial cleansing sheets!  They are soft and do an excellent job of removing eye liner.  I use them with warm water and they get rid of all the grime and makeup without over drying or irritating my skin.  Where have these little sponges been all my life???  These are also great for travel.</li>
            <li> Not as effective as I&#x27;d hoped. They feel a bit stiff, even when wet, and they don&#x27;t clean the skin as well as similar products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
