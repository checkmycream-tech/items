            <li> was not expected to be like that. ink did not cover tattoo, it was bad</li>
            <li> Ink sucks low quality doesn&#x27;t lay right</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan at all. The color does not stick to skin like my other inks. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Lots of great colors!! Love it!</li>
            <li> Most colors I&#x27;ve used so far are okay, most labels are spelled wrong which indicates cheap and fast production. Also a couple colors had to be thrown out right away due to being gloppy and wierd looking. Blue colors were WAY darker than they appear to be when actually used on skin.</li>
            <li> Some of the ink is good, but some is not even usable. Globbed and very thick. We also had a problem with the purple not sticking. Used on several people and doesn&#x27;t keep its color after a few weeks. Fades and hard to see.</li>
            <li> good shipping but the ink was inconsistent even after mixing it up and it does not take to skin well.</li>

            <li> never used them my dad said the ink was to watery so they were trashed.</li>
            <li> It is what it says it is but some colors of my ink were dry and unable to be used. I don&#x27;t know if I would get my ink here again.</li>
