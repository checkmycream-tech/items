    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Best ones I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>These are the best.</li>
            <li>I tried cheaper ones before and the pleasure plack, even flavored, however me and my girlfriend have the best time with these.</li>
            <li>Both of us have been very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>great price best on the market</li>
            <li>There is some decrease in sensation, as you will find in any condom, but the lubricant makes things nicer, and the end result, while not as great as would be without a condom, is as close as you can get, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Or you&#x27;re being a good boy</li>
            <li>good practice</li>
            <li>Perfect fit ....</li>
            <li>Always good to stock up on condoms.</li>
            <li>Not that you&#x27;ll need much practice - these are easy and wonderful to use when &amp;#</li>
            <li>Would not re-order but great seller, fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Thoroughly satisfied.</li>
            <li>Much better than ultra thins.</li>
            <li>These rarely break andfeel pretty good.</li>
            <li>And you&#x27;ll both simply have a great time and be protected.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t like the fit.</li>
            <li>You will love these, I have tried different brands, and so far even from trojan these are the best condoms I have tried</li>
            <li>, they are fit, they aresuper confortable and makes sex feel like you are not even using a condom</li>
            <li>haha, more like the confidence of the guys I find :)</li>
            <li>We tried other condoms, from ribbed to her pleasure, many variety packs and things just did not end happily.</li>
            <li>They go right on, they fit properly (stay on unless you&#x27;re really just not that into her) and they feel awesome.  </li>
            <li>Great if you&#x27;re a little thicker than most men.  </li>
            <li>Have you ever lost out on a good time with a girl simply for lack of having a condom (because they supposedly suck)?  </li>
            <li>Cheap fast and easy.</li>
            <li>its nice to find a product that makes big man so comfortable.</li>
            <li>The shipment process was what i expected,  I knew this would be a good product to purchase and was excited when i received it.</li>
            <li>You may even find they are fun when you&#x27;re alone...</li>
            <li>And the gold foil packets are pretty classy :)</li>
            <li>Maybe you took a lot of chances because normal condoms didn&#x27;t fit right</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is an awesome value (yes you really get 2 boxes of 36ct for 72 total), for what is the perfect condom if you&#x27;re sick and tired of normal-sized condoms that supposedly &amp;#34;should fit fine for most guys&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t get performance anxiety on a hot date ;)</li>
            <li>They broke many times, even though they were also the same brand, Trojan.</li>
            <li>They certainly restrict some sensation, but I&#x27;m more concerned about contraception effectiveness and over the last 10 years</li>
            <li>You just may love these so much you&#x27;ll start using them by yourself occasionally.  </li>
            <li>Feel very plastic feeling.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Buying these by the 72-count is a great value, sure beats the absurd prices they charge in the grocery store for smaller quantities.  </li>
            <li>And these are much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>Really the girth was the issue.</li>
            <li>Haha, how on earth are you supposed to rate condoms?</li>
            <li>They came earlier then expected, which in this case was a good thing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really for those with a little more thickness.  </li>
            <li>Use &#x27;em to rub one out in the bathroom or to avoid having to clean a mess in your Fleshlight.)  </li>
            <li>Condoms, one size does not fit all, it is important to have the right size so there isn&#x27;t too much nor too little condom to work properly.</li>
            <li>Yeah, right - you can stretch a small t-shirt onto a large dude, doesn&#x27;t mean it fits properly or is anywhere near comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I can barely feel them and my husband has no problem with them either.</li>
            <li>Whatever - the point is there&#x27;s no excuse anymore</li>
            <li>When you find someone where the normal size condom cuts into the base of their bits, it&#x27;s good to move up a size for their comfort, reduced risk of breakage, and general politeness.</li>

            <li> I recently went off of birth control although my husband and I are not ready for children.</li>
            <li> The Magnum is just that little bit larger so it FITS without discomfort or numbness</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to say here.</li>
            <li> All those years of complaining \\&quot;condoms suck, they never fit right, they&#x27;re uncomfortable...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands of \\&quot;slightly larger\\</li>
            <li> The lube they put on it isn&#x27;t disgusting, doesn&#x27;t interfere with my good time.  </li>
            <li> even something a little bit too tight can be unusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Guys would just hate on condoms altogether and hope their women were clean and on the pill.  </li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t as tight and uncomfortable as the standard size.</li>
            <li> but you get the least bit vigorous and the damn thing breaks (because it was too small to begin with).  </li>
            <li> Seriously, try it.  </li>
            <li> but seriously folks these condoms rock</li>

            <li> \\&quot; yadda yadda as you talk yourself into unnecessary risks.  </li>
            <li> The thin ones are almost identical to these.  </li>
            <li> those miserable days, when they only came in one size?  </li>
            <li> He told me that these do not feel like they are cutting off circulation.  </li>
            <li> I always thought condoms were annoying and uncomfortable until i tried these.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Not only to prevent hiv spreading, I use these for oral sex.  There are std&#x27;s you can share non consensually if you have oral sex unprotected.  The lube they put on it isn&#x27;t disgusting, doesn&#x27;t interfere with my good time.  Condoms, one size does not fit all, it is important to have the right size so there isn&#x27;t too much nor too little condom to work properly.</li>
            <li> When you find someone where the normal size condom cuts into the base of their bits, it&#x27;s good to move up a size for their comfort, reduced risk of breakage, and general politeness. This does the job! The lubricant on these condoms doesn&#x27;t smell/taste too bad, either. And the gold foil packets are pretty classy :)</li>
            <li> You just may love these so much you&#x27;ll start using them by yourself occasionally.  (Not kidding.  Use &#x27;em to rub one out in the bathroom or to avoid having to clean a mess in your Fleshlight.)  Not that you&#x27;ll need much practice - these are easy and wonderful to use when &amp;#34;the moment&#x27;s right&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s like &amp;#34;OMG, so THIS is how a condom SHOULD work.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an awesome value (yes you really get 2 boxes of 36ct for 72 total), for what is the perfect condom if you&#x27;re sick and tired of normal-sized condoms that supposedly &amp;#34;should fit fine for most guys&amp;#34;.  Just because you can stretch &#x27;em over a baseball bat.  Yeah, right - you can stretch a small t-shirt onto a large dude, doesn&#x27;t mean it fits properly or is anywhere near comfortable.  And at this scale (oh, let&#x27;s say 6x6 for argument&#x27;s sake) even something a little bit too tight can be unusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember those miserable days, when they only came in one size?  Maybe you took a lot of chances because normal condoms didn&#x27;t fit right and you&#x27;d just rather not wear one (or some girls would ask to take it off, God bless &#x27;em).  Guys would just hate on condoms altogether and hope their women were clean and on the pill.  Or you&#x27;re being a good boy but you get the least bit vigorous and the damn thing breaks (because it was too small to begin with).  Inevitably all that leads you to the clinic... But today, we have Magnums.  And Magnum XL for the showoffs.  Whatever - the point is there&#x27;s no excuse anymore, every guy can find a condom to fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could give the 20-year-old me ten boxes of these.  Hell, I&#x27;d give them to 15-year-old me and cut out all those condom-phobia years altogether.  Because these Magnums are a life-changer.  They go right on, they fit properly (stay on unless you&#x27;re really just not that into her) and they feel awesome.  Girl asks you to not use one or to take it off, you&#x27;ll have no problem saying &amp;#34;sorry baby, I can&#x27;t do that&amp;#34;.  And you&#x27;ll both simply have a great time and be protected.  Have you ever lost out on a good time with a girl simply for lack of having a condom (because they supposedly suck)?  I have.  God I wish I&#x27;d had one of these - that condom problem is sorted, and sometimes that&#x27;s the only obstacle.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the fit. Feel very plastic feeling. Low stimulation. Would not re-order but great seller, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> How I wish the Magnum had been around since my teens!!  All those years of complaining \\&quot;condoms suck, they never fit right, they&#x27;re uncomfortable...\\&quot; yadda yadda as you talk yourself into unnecessary risks.  The Magnum is just that little bit larger so it FITS without discomfort or numbness and you can actually get used to using one, no awkwardness.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands of \\&quot;slightly larger\\&quot; condoms but nothing quite feels as \\&quot;right\\&quot; as these.  You may never want to even THINK about doing without a condom after you become accustomed to the Magnum.  Seriously, try it.  You may even find they are fun when you&#x27;re alone... good practice anyway so you don&#x27;t get performance anxiety on a hot date ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buying these by the 72-count is a great value, sure beats the absurd prices they charge in the grocery store for smaller quantities.  Shipping was prompt and discreet.  Thoroughly satisfied.</li>
            <li> The thin ones are almost identical to these.  And these are much cheaper.  Best ones I&#x27;ve ever used.  You don&#x27;t need to be gigantic to use these.  It&#x27;s really for those with a little more thickness.  These aren&#x27;t as tight and uncomfortable as the standard size.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to say here. These do the job of preventing pregnancy well. There is some decrease in sensation, as you will find in any condom, but the lubricant makes things nicer, and the end result, while not as great as would be without a condom, is as close as you can get, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> These are the best. I tried cheaper ones before and the pleasure plack, even flavored, however me and my girlfriend have the best time with these. These rarely break andfeel pretty good.</li>
            <li> great price best on the market</li>
            <li> They came earlier then expected, which in this case was a good thing. If you are a person that gets a little weird about buying from a store then this is the way to go. Cheap fast and easy.</li>
            <li> I recently went off of birth control although my husband and I are not ready for children. We tried other condoms, from ribbed to her pleasure, many variety packs and things just did not end happily. These condoms made all the difference! I can barely feel them and my husband has no problem with them either. Really the girth was the issue. He told me that these do not feel like they are cutting off circulation.  Both of us have been very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Much better than ultra thins. They broke many times, even though they were also the same brand, Trojan.</li>
            <li> The shipment process was what i expected,  I knew this would be a good product to purchase and was excited when i received it.</li>
            <li> You will love these, I have tried different brands, and so far even from trojan these are the best condoms I have tried, they are fit, they aresuper confortable and makes sex feel like you are not even using a condom</li>
            <li> Perfect fit .... its nice to find a product that makes big man so comfortable. but seriously folks these condoms rock</li>
            <li> Great if you&#x27;re a little thicker than most men.  This is the only brand that doesn&#x27;t cut off my circulation!</li>
            <li> CAN&#x27;T get rid of these! not the fault of the product though... haha, more like the confidence of the guys I find :)</li>
            <li> Finally a condom that fits my big cock!</li>
            <li> No extra babies yet. Haha, how on earth are you supposed to rate condoms? They certainly restrict some sensation, but I&#x27;m more concerned about contraception effectiveness and over the last 10 years my wife and I have only had kids when we decided we wanted them.</li>
            <li> Always good to stock up on condoms. 36 pack is cheaper than 3 12-packs.</li>
            <li> I always thought condoms were annoying and uncomfortable until i tried these.  They make all the difference.  If you have ever had the feeling that the condom squeezes you or cuts off circulation, give these a shot.</li>
