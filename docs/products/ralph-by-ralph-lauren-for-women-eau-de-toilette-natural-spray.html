            <li>I have worn this fragrance for years as my signature scent and never tire of it, always looking forward to its application during my morning ritual, and catching glimpses of it as it is released throughout the day.</li>

            <li>Thank you  :)</li>
            <li>She has been wearing this perfume for the better part of three decades.  </li>
            <li>Lauren by Ralph Lauren is my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>I wanted her to be able to wear it all the time</li>
            <li>This is, and has been for many, many years, my FAVORITE cologne.  </li>
            <li>they always have it at Macy&#x27;s  :)</li>
            <li>This is my favorite perfume.  </li>
            <li>I love wearing it</li>
            <li>; love you lots &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>Need more.....</li>
            <li>This is a perfume that I have been wearing for over 15 years and have received many compliments.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>I began using Lauren Perfume in the 70&#x27;s and fell in love with it immediately.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad some stock was available.</li>
            <li>If you know and love the original, do not be fooled.</li>
            <li>Happy Camper who has her signature scent back!!</li>
            <li>I am in shock that it is no longer available in stores and is now discontinued!?!&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>My wife loves this and it is not easy to find, especially at a good price.  </li>
            <li>On line at the Lauren website ($65.00) or at Macy&#x27;s Dept. Store ($69.00), it&#x27;s much more reasonable.</li>
            <li>Everyone near her always asks what she is wearing because it smells nice, but its not overpowering.</li>
            <li>This must be the most classic scent.</li>
            <li>I wonder how much longer it will be available on line...</li>
            <li>It is distinct as well</li>
            <li>She will not use any other perfume, so it must be good.</li>
            <li>The original, real scent is unmistakeable and this is not it.</li>
            <li>does not mean it&#x27;s more reasonable.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>I was pretty sure that she came back to the first time she sensed it 16 years ago.    </li>
            <li>I first bought this for my wife when we were first dating- over thirty years ago.</li>
            <li>Anyway, it&#x27;s the best but too expensive.</li>
            <li>Thanks Ralph Lauren!</li>
            <li>The smell is so mild it pleases nearly every one.</li>
            <li>This does not smell like the real perfume at all.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell much about the perfume itself.</li>
            <li>my very fav. perfume..</li>
            <li>Thanks again.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely NOT THE REAL THING!!!!  </li>
            <li>She has been wearing it for years and wanted to only wear it on special occasions</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I can find it online, as for some reason it&#x27;s not available in stores.</li>
            <li>bought it many years ago and ran out and kept the bottle so that I would remember to purchase it again, then I misplaced the bottle..  </li>
            <li>A COMPLETE RIP OFF!  </li>
            <li>T WAS JUST WHAT I EXPECTED, RALPH LAUREN FRAGRANCE IS SOFT AND MILD</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Lauren&amp;#34; is my favorite all time, classic, elegant, headturning perfume ever.&lt;br /&gt;Highly disappointed it will no longer be avaialbe at all.  </li>
            <li>Thank you AMAZON for not only having the product but having it in a larger size and getting it to me so fast.  </li>
            <li>A timelessly classic fragrance evoking lily, and other florals with a hint of spice.</li>

            <li> can&#x27;t go wrong with this perfume...</li>
            <li> She was afraid this perfume was not being produced anymore.</li>
            <li> #34;still crazy after all these years&amp;#34;(Thanks Mr. Simon)</li>

            <li> This does not smell like the real perfume at all.  It smells like a total knockoff. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> For more than a year, my girlfriend keeps asking me to find this fragrance. She was afraid this perfume was not being produced anymore. When she got it in her hands I was pretty sure that she came back to the first time she sensed it 16 years ago.    I can&#x27;t tell much about the perfume itself. I just feel that I would pay 3 times its price to see my girlfriend&#x27;s amazed and happy face again.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect perfume for me. I&#x27;m so glad I can find it online, as for some reason it&#x27;s not available in stores.</li>
            <li> Thank you Amazon and Sellers,&lt;br /&gt;I have been wearing Lauren for 27 years and I cannot change. NOTHING compares to this scent.I love it!!!  it is truly a part of who I am. I cannot understand why the company stopped making it. It is their most beautiful fragrance. I am so grateful to find it on Amazon. Please sellers, keep it in stock as I buy a minimum of 3 bottles of the 4 oz spray a year. Thank you Thank you Thank you  :)</li>
            <li> This must be the most classic scent. The smell is so mild it pleases nearly every one. It is distinct as well so you don&#x27;t blend in with the crowd. I have worn it for years and find it hard to accept anything in its place. It is perfect for day and evening wear. It lasts for hours.</li>
            <li> My Wife has been using this for years and it keeps getting harder to find. She will not use any other perfume, so it must be good.</li>
            <li> I have worn Lauren for years,, could not find in the stores any more,,,  am happy I can order it now,,  It&#x27;s my signature fragrance,, everyone always think of me ,,, when they smell it.....  Great compliment !!!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this and it is not easy to find, especially at a good price.  Even on Amazon, the price varies.  Put it in your cart, keep an eye on things and get a great deal.</li>
            <li> She has been wearing this perfume for the better part of three decades.  It is too bad the Lauren is discontinued.  We buy it when we see it and I&#x27;m glad some stock was available.</li>
            <li> Ok. This is absolutely NOT THE REAL THING!!!!  The original, real scent is unmistakeable and this is not it. A COMPLETE RIP OFF!  If you know and love the original, do not be fooled. They did a nice copy of the bottle, that&#x27;s all I can say.</li>
            <li> Lauren by Ralph Lauren is my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume. She has been wearing it for years and wanted to only wear it on special occasions but since everyday is a gift from God I wanted her to be able to wear it all the time so I bought a big bottle.</li>
            <li> This is a very good idea. Made points with my wife. That&#x27;s always a very good idea! Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I gave the product 4 stars because it&#x27;s great, however just because it&#x27;s offered on Amazon does not mean it&#x27;s more reasonable. On line at the Lauren website ($65.00) or at Macy&#x27;s Dept. Store ($69.00), it&#x27;s much more reasonable. I paid $75.00 plus shipping and handling. opps!</li>
            <li> I Love this Fragrabce and hope I cn find more !!</li>
            <li> only though you we can find it thank you for having it.</li>
            <li> T WAS JUST WHAT I EXPECTED, RALPH LAUREN FRAGRANCE IS SOFT AND MILD&lt;br /&gt;IT WORKS WELL WITH MY BODY CHEMISTRY&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD RECOMMEND TO A FRIEND</li>
            <li> This is, and has been for many, many years, my FAVORITE cologne.  I really love the &amp;#34;fresh! post-shower&amp;#34; smell. This came shipped nicely</li>
            <li> It may be discontinued by they always have it at Macy&#x27;s  :)&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s cheaper!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the only thing my Mom will wear.</li>
            <li> I first bought this for my wife when we were first dating- over thirty years ago. It&#x27;s still great on her, and she loves it. So do I. I guess you could say we&#x27;re &amp;#34;still crazy after all these years&amp;#34;(Thanks Mr. Simon)</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume.  I love wearing it and I always receive compliments when I do use it.  I recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> My wife has been wearing this since I met her 33 years ago.  We&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s being discontinued, at which point I may have to discontinue our marriage.  KIDDING. Anyway, it&#x27;s the best but too expensive. I used to pay $35-40 for 4 oz, now it&#x27;s over $70. arrgh</li>
            <li> bought this for my mom, she always loved this perfume, now she owns it! merry christmas mom ; love you lots &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I have used Lauren for 36 years,the retail stores closet to me do not carry it any more :(  however once again Amazon had what i wanted and needed!!! Its still has the same fragrance and in the same box so i know its NOT a knock off!!! Happy Camper who has her signature scent back!!</li>
            <li> Very pleased, Will be ordering again!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Charles (manny)</li>
            <li> I have used this perfume for over 10 years now.  I am in shock that it is no longer available in stores and is now discontinued!?!&lt;br /&gt;What a girl to do!!  &amp;#34;Lauren&amp;#34; is my favorite all time, classic, elegant, headturning perfume ever.&lt;br /&gt;Highly disappointed it will no longer be avaialbe at all.  My plan is to order whatever is left online and stock pile to last me over for another 2 yrs or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, no plans to make gifts with &amp;#34;Lauren&amp;#34;, but will be used carefully by yours truely.&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong with this perfume...at all!  Totally in love!!</li>
            <li> Love it !!!!!! Need more.....</li>
            <li> This is a perfume that I have been wearing for over 15 years and have received many compliments.  I don&#x27;t think it matters what is current but rather what smells the best on you.</li>
            <li> my very fav. perfume.. bought it many years ago and ran out and kept the bottle so that I would remember to purchase it again, then I misplaced the bottle..  its got a great fragrant..</li>
            <li> A timelessly classic fragrance evoking lily, and other florals with a hint of spice. I have worn this fragrance for years as my signature scent and never tire of it, always looking forward to its application during my morning ritual, and catching glimpses of it as it is released throughout the day.</li>
            <li> My wife hated it. I paid a lot of money for it and she said I was ripped off... Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Not as I remembered - disappointed:(</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this fragrance. My mother has worn it my entire life. Its the only thing she asks for for Christmas every year. It is such a timeless fragrance. Everyone near her always asks what she is wearing because it smells nice, but its not overpowering. Thanks Ralph Lauren!</li>
            <li> You cant find this perfume in the store any longer... I wonder how much longer it will be available on line... I love this scent!</li>
            <li> Es un excelente producto, lo recomiendo mucho y es exactamente como lo descrito por el vendedor, tambien el empaque fue adecuado y llegó en buenas condiciones, sin daños ni problemas</li>
            <li> In the first place, you cannot go wrong in choosing a Ralph Lauren product.  I began using Lauren Perfume in the 70&#x27;s and fell in love with it immediately.  Recently, it has become increasingly more difficult to find.  Thank you AMAZON for not only having the product but having it in a larger size and getting it to me so fast.  Thanks again.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this fragrance for years, and get tons of compliments. its my signature scent, one I can&#x27;t do without!</li>
