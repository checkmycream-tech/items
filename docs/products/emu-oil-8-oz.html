            <li>had better.</li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>not terrible.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t one of the best Emu Oil I&#x27;ve used or purchased but for the price is one of the most reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging is simple and does what is intended to do.</li>
            <li>I love love this oil....</li>
            <li>I must order some more....</li>
            <li>I read up on Emu oil and thought okay</li>
            <li>This oil is a good quality and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>It is true, it stays on your skin but does not feel greasy.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly into skin, not greasy.  </li>
            <li>My forehead fine lines are diminishing and this oil soaks into my skin pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>This product is great, it really helped grow the edges of my hair back!</li>
            <li>I massage it on my edges every night and began seeing results rather quickly.</li>
            <li>I put the oil on my leg and realized that my cats were very interested in this stuff.  </li>
            <li>amazing is the only word to describe it !</li>
            <li>They have shiny coats and rarely get hairballs.</li>
            <li>this was a very good buy, i&#x27;m using it to grow back the hair on my temples which i lost from an experiment, so far so good,little baby hairs are coming in,i also added castor and rosemary essential oils to the emu.</li>
            <li>I must say I am surprised by how quickly it has worked.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was also much faster.</li>
            <li>I also have the start of eczema on my ankle and it was really getting itch.  </li>
            <li>I was originally concerned about how runny this one is compared to my regular Australia Natuals brand.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel really soft!</li>
            <li>I look forward to seeing future benefits with this brand after consistent usage.</li>
            <li>and I think it makes my face soft.  </li>
            <li>I love emu oil for dry skin, especially in winter when the heat inside is dry and parching to the skin.</li>
            <li>so I am not sure how it would do on fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat the price for the size, and lastly it helps moisturize the skin and keep it soft.</li>
            <li>When I pumped some into a bowl, the cats went wild for it and now they continue to beg me every night for their daily pump of emu oil!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great oil.  Refined enough to stay liquid.  Absorbs quickly into skin, not greasy.  Wish they had a larger size to purchase</li>
            <li> I love the quality and price!  Was using a different brand but it was too thick and very pricy</li>
            <li> We use this on my mom who has very fragile skin.  It helps with bruising and this company has the best value!</li>
            <li> amazing is the only word to describe it !</li>
            <li> I love emu oil for dry skin, especially in winter when the heat inside is dry and parching to the skin. If you&#x27;ve not tried it, you need to. This oil is a good quality and reasonably priced. Give it a go - you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> this was a very good buy, i&#x27;m using it to grow back the hair on my temples which i lost from an experiment, so far so good,little baby hairs are coming in,i also added castor and rosemary essential oils to the emu.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel really soft!</li>
            <li> I love emu oil. This brand is as good as any of the others but a much better price. Shipping was also much faster. Very pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li> fast shipping, great product.</li>
            <li> you only need a Little and it last all day</li>
            <li> Got rid of corns on my wife&#x27;s toes. Moisturizes and makes her heels smoother also.  She loves it! This is a healer item!</li>
            <li> slippery watered down feel. had better. ok. not great. not terrible. eh. not thrilled. maybe find another. but good price.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t one of the best Emu Oil I&#x27;ve used or purchased but for the price is one of the most reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging is simple and does what is intended to do. I use it daily for hair &amp; skin.</li>
            <li> Smooth, great oil! Love it! Thank u!</li>
            <li> As advertised emu oil</li>
            <li> and became a convert. The other Emu oil I was using was expensive, between $20.00 - $25.00 for a small or large size. This oil has the same consistency as the pricier version. Can&#x27;t beat the price for the size, and lastly it helps moisturize the skin and keep it soft. I hope this product comes back.</li>
            <li> I love love this oil....I must order some more....</li>
            <li> I received promptly and at a good price&lt;br /&gt;  Time will tell if it works well.</li>
            <li> I love this company!!!  I hope they continue to sell emu oil forever.  I started out looking for emu oil for myself, and have bought more expensive brands in the past.  I was thrilled to find Radiant Health Products on Amazon.  I buy in bulk and store them.  The price is right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I not only use the emu oil for the humans in the house, but also the cats.  I put the oil on my leg and realized that my cats were very interested in this stuff.  When I pumped some into a bowl, the cats went wild for it and now they continue to beg me every night for their daily pump of emu oil!  They have shiny coats and rarely get hairballs.</li>
            <li> I switched fron a more expensive brand that I have used for years to this one. I was originally concerned about how runny this one is compared to my regular Australia Natuals brand. Its only been a week of using and consistency aside,  this brand is a winner. My forehead fine lines are diminishing and this oil soaks into my skin pretty quickly.  I use emu oil on my face,  neck and hair. I look forward to seeing future benefits with this brand after consistent usage.</li>
            <li> I read up on Emu oil and thought okay what is the harm in trying it?  I didn&#x27;t think that it would work as well as it did! It is true, it stays on your skin but does not feel greasy.  I feel my skin is moisturized.  I also have the start of eczema on my ankle and it was really getting itch.  I put this on just a few days in a row and the bumps are gone.  I use this at night as a moisturizer on my face and I think it makes my face soft.  I must say I am surprised by how quickly it has worked.  I use it on my hair, I am part African American so I am not sure how it would do on fine hair.  I&#x27;m sold.</li>
            <li> This product is great, it really helped grow the edges of my hair back! The smell is bearable to nonexistent. I massage it on my edges every night and began seeing results rather quickly. 8 ounces at this price is a steal considering that all you need is a little bit at a time, it is all natural and it works.</li>
