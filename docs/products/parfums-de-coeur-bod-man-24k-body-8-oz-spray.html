            <li>This is my favorite fragrance and it just disappeared from the stores.</li>
            <li>Found it on Amazon after looking at many stores.</li>
            <li>On time every time I would like to order more Just cant afford it rite</li>
            <li>yes I would gladly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I have problems with many smelly products and this is one that I found I like and can be around.</li>
            <li>then anything I have used and would recommand it to anyone who wants to smell great.</li>
            <li>I love the way that it smells after combining with my chemistry.</li>
            <li>but most of the womenseem to like the way it smells on me.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad amazon has it.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t been able to find this in the store for awhile.</li>
            <li>I very excited that you still carry it.  </li>
            <li>I think its pretty good stuff for being so cheap!</li>
            <li>If you like the good smells would absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It is always a special surprise for him when he sees that gold bottle!</li>
            <li>it so its overwhelming and gross), and that my mom had a great sense of humor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think the best one is the black.  </li>
            <li>This is no longer available.</li>
            <li>and at such a great price.</li>
            <li>Clea, fresh, sexy.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much !!!</li>
            <li>it smells clean and lasts  all day  not an over powering smell .</li>
            <li>because of all of the Bod Man Spray its the only one that is any good and stays with you.</li>
            <li>A couple of years ago, I bought this as a joke for my 12 year old son, but I ended up LOVING it.  </li>
            <li>HUSBAND LOVES THIS &amp; WANTS ME TO BUY MORE .  </li>
            <li>More of an older man cologne , smells like a lot of musk, not over powering, more of an old spice resemblance</li>
            <li>My wife loves this stuff on me, it really smells good and last a long time, thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li>:) i was really surprised...</li>
            <li>The shipping made the product twice the price but smelling it on my husband made it worth it...</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorites as far as the many bod sprays go.</li>
            <li>fresh guy...</li>
            <li>For me, this is much more preferable than an aerosol which mainly perfumes the air and not so much</li>
            <li>I love the slightly persian hint to it and have used it for many years.</li>
            <li>The &#x27;Black&#x27; fragrance is 2nd best.</li>
            <li>When it was no longer available at our local store I was excited to find it online</li>
            <li>first of all i did not know anything of this BOD products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got selected after some technical questions :)</li>
            <li>Better price then the local drug stores.</li>
            <li>THE SCENT LAST ALL DAY AND GET MANY COMPLIMENTS ON IT.</li>
            <li>)and with names like \\&quot;really ripped abs\\&quot;, I could only assume these were for the same demographic that buy Axe(Kilo by Axe is great, but the type of people that buy this brand overspray</li>
            <li>my husband wears this everyday to work he and gets lots of comments on how good he smells.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t remember too well how the other BOD&#x27;s smelled, but the 24k body spray is amazing.</li>
            <li>Looking for a good smelling male fragrance for a low price, this is the one Bod Man 24k.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>most wanted is a very close second.</li>
            <li>Now that&#x27;s a careing ,responsible company who looks after the customers.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell too.  </li>
            <li>THIS IS A VERY INEXPENSIVE AFTERSHAVE OR BODY SPRAY.</li>
            <li>I just got around to filling out feedback on products.gave feedback on first three orders poor.the last order came with product wrapped in bubble wrap and standing right side up.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has little to no staying power on the skin past the first hour or so but the fresh fragrance is a pleasant experience during that time and it does linger on ones clothes so beware.  </li>
            <li>My husband loves this particular bod and I cannot get it in the store any longer.  </li>
            <li>I receive more compliments on this cologne then the most expensive products that I&#x27;ve used over the years.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m going to make sure to stock up on plenty of this stuff, especially now that I hear it&#x27;s becoming hard to find.</li>
            <li>I think it was as a joke, because normally she buys me overly-expensive cologne as a stocking stuffer (Armani, Gucci, Escada...</li>
            <li>After the long hot shower that accompanies a good work out, after the pool or anytime you want to freshen up clean skin with a something other than your usual colognes.</li>
            <li>It does not last that long on your skin like traditional colognes, but I mostly use it to just hang around the house after a workout or B4 going to bed.  </li>
            <li>no sir smell like some old grandpa cologne with s hint of old spice</li>
            <li>As a 32 year old man I don&#x27;t wanna smell like this body spray.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be that guy that smells like a old man.</li>
            <li>old people don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>We live in Jacksonville, FL and the only time we find the BOD</li>
            <li>Industrial feel and delivery system while at first seemed off putting, actually allows you to spray heartily and distribute evenly as it goes on wet.  </li>
            <li>only see this stuff sold in really run down department stores, like my local Rite Aid, right next to the Axe and other tacky mens cologne(with country singers and stuff on them!)</li>

            <li> Having limited experience with Bod Man body sprays, other than a tiny travel can I acquired somewhere, I was pleasantly surprised by this product.</li>
            <li> I just wish it wasn&#x27;t becoming so difficult to find.  </li>
            <li> Bod Man 24K 8 oz Body Spray]] purchased four differnt types of bod from this company the first three orders, the bottles where just laying in the box on their side and and at least one to two of the bottles leaked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been too embarrassed to buy it in the stores, because unless you&#x27;ve smelled how awesome this stuff is first hand, you are just going to assume it&#x27;s some low-end, gross, tacky stuff, with awful packaging and a silly bottle.</li>
            <li> Got email frrom company concerened about my poor shopping experince and they offered to make it right.</li>
            <li> Wear this to bed  after a long shower and look out!</li>
            <li> It does last a bit longer on clothes, so a little bit on the bod and the rest on the shirt goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Specific Bod products are hard to find, however Amazon has them.  </li>
            <li> black...</li>
            <li> It also last all day some expensive colognes disappear in a few hours this last 12 hours plus</li>
            <li> 24K is at Christmas; however, it comes in a small bottle with two other types that go to waste.  </li>
            <li> I received a variety pack of Bod as a stocking stuffer from my mom a few years ago.</li>
            <li> I would only use it when I was out of my \\&quot;fancier\\&quot; cologne, but I would always get plenty of random compliments, asking what cologne I was wearing.</li>
            <li> You no better...</li>
            <li> Hard to find this one in stores,</li>
            <li> BUT AT LEAST THEY HAVE IT.</li>
            <li> The shipping was slow.</li>
            <li> DISCONTINUED:( sad sad day.</li>
            <li> Some of the others are really bad</li>
            <li> That is too bad since my husband and I both like it</li>
            <li> Smells bad, gives me a headache.</li>
            <li> crazy about this fragrance!!!</li>

            <li> I like 24k because of all of the Bod Man Spray its the only one that is any good and stays with you. Used to get at Wal-Mart but they quit selling it have the others but not 24K. Some of the others are really bad so people say when I&#x27;ve used them.</li>
            <li> my husband wears this everyday to work he and gets lots of comments on how good he smells.  It also last all day some expensive colognes disappear in a few hours this last 12 hours plus</li>
            <li> I have used this product before but it became unavable localy. So when I found it on Amazon I bout 10 bottles.</li>
            <li> A couple of years ago, I bought this as a joke for my 12 year old son, but I ended up LOVING it.  When I asked my husband what he wanted for Christmas, he told me he wanted some Bod Man 24K.  Now they both wear it and I love it!!  Great Price and Quick Ship.</li>
            <li> first of all i did not know anything of this BOD products.&lt;br /&gt;After seeing some good reviews, i wanted to give a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously it smells awesome. Almost all my friends ask me what i cologne i was wearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently i went for an interview. The director immediately asked me if i am wearing BOD cologne. :) i was really surprised... He was saying he too loved BOD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW..I got selected after some technical questions :)</li>
            <li> Best bod smell out there no lie.  I  get so many compliments with this scent.</li>
            <li> DISCONTINUED:( sad sad day.</li>
            <li> Bod Man 24K smells awesome!  I love when my husband puts it on!  I just wish it wasn&#x27;t becoming so difficult to find.  Why is it whenever you find something you like, the company decides to stop making it?  Hopefully Amazon will be able to continue to carry it when no one else does.</li>
            <li> I use to by this spray at the local Wal-mart and Walgreens, but they no longer carry it. I love the slightly persian hint to it and have used it for many years. I bought plenty to keep a stock of it. Everyone always asks what I am wearing and where they can get it. I think its pretty good stuff for being so cheap!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance and it just disappeared from the stores. Found it on Amazon after looking at many stores.</li>
            <li> This is no longer available. That is too bad since my husband and I both like it</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0017OJ2F2 Bod Man 24K 8 oz Body Spray]] purchased four differnt types of bod from this company the first three orders, the bottles where just laying in the box on their side and and at least one to two of the bottles leaked. I just got around to filling out feedback on products.gave feedback on first three orders poor.the last order came with product wrapped in bubble wrap and standing right side up. Gave feedback as great. Got email frrom company concerened about my poor shopping experince and they offered to make it right. Now that&#x27;s a careing ,responsible company who looks after the customers.</li>
            <li> More of an older man cologne , smells like a lot of musk, not over powering, more of an old spice resemblance</li>
            <li> I started using 24k about a year ago. and I am always getting compliments on how good I smell. I work in an office enviroment, so I don&#x27;t want to be overpowering, but I want to be noticed. From the cafeteria ladies, to my wifes volleyball moms, they all notice how good I smell. Thanks Amazon for making this product available, I will be a repeat customer, and I am a happy one too !!!</li>
            <li> This is the only scent from Bod Man that my guy will use.  I really like the smell too.  We can not find it in the stores, so we buy it online.  The product is the same as in the store.  Very pleased with our purchase.</li>
            <li> We live in Jacksonville, FL and the only time we find the BOD 24K is at Christmas; however, it comes in a small bottle with two other types that go to waste.  My husband and son love this one and was very happy to find it on line.  Out of all the BOD sprays, this is the best one&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for making my Christmas shopping easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonnie</li>
            <li> great body spray Great serv. On time every time I would like to order more Just cant afford it rite now I have worn this for 6 years now and wont wear anything but Bode 24 K  Thank you so much !!!</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance!! When it was no longer available at our local store I was excited to find it online and at such a great price.</li>
            <li> it smells clean and lasts  all day  not an over powering smell . yes I would gladly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Ive been looking for this flavor for awhile! now that I found it I will be back!!!! this is the only BOD spray my husband likes.I was sad to see the stores dont carry it any more. Soooo glad I found it!</li>
            <li> This is my favourite spray and I have had to order it to a address in the USA so my friend can send it to me in England.an absolutely superb body spray,especially when ladies are asking where I purchased it as they have never smelt such a great cologne before.10/10 from me.</li>
            <li> This body spray is the best smelling on my husband! I am not allergic to it and  Bod Man 24K is has a very sexy smell.</li>
            <li> Great price and very good fragrance</li>
            <li> I purchased this product online because I could not find it in any local stores in my area.... I was very pleased to find it.  The shipping made the product twice the price but smelling it on my husband made it worth it... I have problems with many smelly products and this is one that I found I like and can be around. If you like the good smells would absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Smells bad, gives me a headache. The shipping was slow. Dont buy, save your money and buy something else that doesnt smell like elderly woman perfume.</li>
            <li> Specific Bod products are hard to find, however Amazon has them.  Better price then the local drug stores.</li>
            <li> Having limited experience with Bod Man body sprays, other than a tiny travel can I acquired somewhere, I was pleasantly surprised by this product. Industrial feel and delivery system while at first seemed off putting, actually allows you to spray heartily and distribute evenly as it goes on wet.  For me, this is much more preferable than an aerosol which mainly perfumes the air and not so much the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has little to no staying power on the skin past the first hour or so but the fresh fragrance is a pleasant experience during that time and it does linger on ones clothes so beware.  Best use?  After the long hot shower that accompanies a good work out, after the pool or anytime you want to freshen up clean skin with a something other than your usual colognes.</li>
            <li> good product....everyone asks what is the scent ........takes place of more expensive products and gives me what I want in a cologne spray</li>
            <li> THIS IS A VERY INEXPENSIVE AFTERSHAVE OR BODY SPRAY. THE SCENT LAST ALL DAY AND GET MANY COMPLIMENTS ON IT. FOR SOME REASON WALMART STOPPED CARRYING THIS PRODUCT. IT ISN&#x27;T ANY CHEAPER ON AMAZON BUT AT LEAST THEY HAVE IT.</li>
            <li> This is some of the best smelling colonge out there I get more commits about the smell of this then anything I have used and would recommand it to anyone who wants to smell great.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorites as far as the many bod sprays go. I love the way that it smells after combining with my chemistry. Granted not everyone likes it but most of the womenseem to like the way it smells on me. A thing to note, I had to go online to get anymore as the local stores seem to have stopped carrying this one.</li>
            <li> My husband always gets comments from men and women!  This has a wonderful fragrance.  Clea, fresh, sexy. The &#x27;Black&#x27; fragrance is 2nd best.</li>
            <li> I always look at the percentage and the price..this person happened to have both and now I know why.  Everything was great.</li>
            <li> I received a variety pack of Bod as a stocking stuffer from my mom a few years ago. I think it was as a joke, because normally she buys me overly-expensive cologne as a stocking stuffer (Armani, Gucci, Escada...)and with names like \\&quot;really ripped abs\\&quot;, I could only assume these were for the same demographic that buy Axe(Kilo by Axe is great, but the type of people that buy this brand overspray it so its overwhelming and gross), and that my mom had a great sense of humor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t remember too well how the other BOD&#x27;s smelled, but the 24k body spray is amazing. I would only use it when I was out of my \\&quot;fancier\\&quot; cologne, but I would always get plenty of random compliments, asking what cologne I was wearing. Every time I was hanging out with my gf with this stuff on, she&#x27;d be all over me asking what I was wearing. Eventually I just stopped wearing the pricier cologne all together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only see this stuff sold in really run down department stores, like my local Rite Aid, right next to the Axe and other tacky mens cologne(with country singers and stuff on them!) I&#x27;ve always been too embarrassed to buy it in the stores, because unless you&#x27;ve smelled how awesome this stuff is first hand, you are just going to assume it&#x27;s some low-end, gross, tacky stuff, with awful packaging and a silly bottle. Not the case!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to make sure to stock up on plenty of this stuff, especially now that I hear it&#x27;s becoming hard to find.</li>
            <li> I liked bod since I was a kid . But 24k no sir smell like some old grandpa cologne with s hint of old spice</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff on me, it really smells good and last a long time, thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> Girls love this scent! Hard to find this one in stores, but I&#x27;m glad amazon has it.  Wear this to bed  after a long shower and look out! She will not keep her hands off you.  It does not last that long on your skin like traditional colognes, but I mostly use it to just hang around the house after a workout or B4 going to bed.  It does last a bit longer on clothes, so a little bit on the bod and the rest on the shirt goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this particular bod and I cannot get it in the store any longer.  I very excited that you still carry it.  It is always a special surprise for him when he sees that gold bottle!</li>
            <li> all the ladies like it</li>
            <li> HUSBAND LOVES THIS &amp; WANTS ME TO BUY MORE .  HE GETS COMPLIMENTED QUITE OFTEN !  HUM  HUM</li>
            <li> The scent stays on me awhile.It has a nice scent to it.I would recommend 24K to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve ever used. I receive more compliments on this cologne then the most expensive products that I&#x27;ve used over the years. Women loved it.</li>
            <li> Looking for a good smelling male fragrance for a low price, this is the one Bod Man 24k.&lt;br /&gt;Just crazy about this fragrance!!!</li>
            <li> As a 32 year old man I don&#x27;t wanna smell like this body spray. I have a collection of sprays. I have red,most wanted..black...fresh guy... I think the best one is the black.  Red bottle most wanted is a very close second. Don&#x27;t be that guy that smells like a old man. You no better...old people don&#x27;t. ......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  DON&#x27;T BE THAT GUY!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been able to find this in the store for awhile. So excited to find it now, that we got 3!!!</li>
