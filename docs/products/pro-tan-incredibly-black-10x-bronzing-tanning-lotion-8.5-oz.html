            <li>I got fairly good color from this and the smell is pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Works great inatanning booth, nice odor and not too greasy.</li>
            <li>It smells sooooooooooooo good.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion!  </li>
            <li>But for those with no fear  CRISP IT UP!!!!  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing amazing about this product</li>
            <li>but it smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li>and I got nice and brown....  </li>
            <li>the kind that kills you.  </li>
            <li>it smelled nice and it looks just like the picture.</li>
            <li>Good product, great price, and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Great product reasonably priced!</li>
            <li>and i got way more tan than i was</li>
            <li>This is my all time favorite tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>so all in all not a terrible purchase.  </li>
            <li>It smells really good, totally worth the 12 or so bucks, I do wish I had gotten a lotion with more bronzers</li>
            <li>Gives me a great color and definitely works the way I like it to</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite tanning lotion!</li>
            <li>Came in the mail quick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different lotions over the years, and I&#x27;m so glad I discovered this one.</li>
            <li>no unpleasant odor whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>Love it and the natural color it gave me !</li>
            <li>Just the right amount of bronzing power for me.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast this got me tan!</li>
            <li>It gives you a natural looking bronze tan instead of the unnatural kind of tan that doesn&#x27;t last like some products do.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Moisturizes my skin really well.  </li>
            <li>cause I havent seen much of a difference</li>
            <li>Although you will pay slightly more for those as well, approximately 10 or 15 dollars more.</li>
            <li>There are just other lotions that give slightly better or quicker tan color.  </li>
            <li>but no seriously this stuff made me smell like a yummy piece of candy...</li>
            <li>really easily and was using a different product before this that gave me good color but was greasy and streaky when you first put it on plus had a bad after smell.</li>
            <li>After only a couple of tans with this lotion, I definitely notice a huge difference in my color.</li>
            <li>Dont waste money on other stuff when tjis works just as good, and never streaky</li>
            <li>It does take a few tanning sessions to see lasting results so if you try it make sure you give it</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m only 24 years old.  </li>
            <li>This goes on white like a regular lotion, smells good, and the after smell isn&#x27;t so bad.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I got this and I got nice and brown....  and I also got skin cancer... yeah the kind that kills you.  tanning beds are bad.  and i&#x27;m only 24 years old.  so needless to say I dont tan anymore.  But for those with no fear  CRISP IT UP!!!!  Burn your bubbies off.  but no seriously this stuff made me smell like a yummy piece of candy... and i got way more tan than i was</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the last few years now and I choose to only use this one. Gives me a great color and definitely works the way I like it to</li>
            <li> Great product reasonably priced!</li>
            <li> Works great inatanning booth, nice odor and not too greasy.</li>
            <li> Love it and the natural color it gave me !</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing amazing about this product it&#x27;s like a lot of the others..they work but no difference . I usually go to Sally Beauty Supply for mine and I&#x27;ll probably keep going there...</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite tanning lotion. Smells great and makes your skin feel great.  Works very well. Will purchase again when mibe runs out.</li>
            <li> I got fairly good color from this and the smell is pleasant.  However since trying a few other tanning lotions I do prefer others over this one now.  However, this is a great price and you receive quite a bit for the price, so all in all not a terrible purchase.  There are just other lotions that give slightly better or quicker tan color.  Although you will pay slightly more for those as well, approximately 10 or 15 dollars more.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Smells wonderful....no unpleasant odor whatsoever.  Moisturizes my skin really well.  I definitely recommend this product.  I&#x27;ve never been dissatisfied with any products from Pro Tan!</li>
            <li> This is the best, cheapest tanning lotion to buy. It smells sooooooooooooo good. Dont waste money on other stuff when tjis works just as good, and never streaky</li>
            <li> Came in the mail quick. Great smell. Just the right amount of bronzing power for me. I like to be actually tan and not wash it off in the shower.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price and arrived on time</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product, especially considering the price on Amazon. I&#x27;ve only used it about 4-5 times and I have already seen a difference in my skin color. I tan really easily and was using a different product before this that gave me good color but was greasy and streaky when you first put it on plus had a bad after smell. This goes on white like a regular lotion, smells good, and the after smell isn&#x27;t so bad. It gives you a natural looking bronze tan instead of the unnatural kind of tan that doesn&#x27;t last like some products do. It does take a few tanning sessions to see lasting results so if you try it make sure you give it it&#x27;s fair chance! Good product, great price, and fast shipping. I&#x27;ll be buying it again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion!  Smells great!</li>
            <li> Saw results in less than a week!</li>
            <li> One of the best tanning lotions I&#x27;ve ever had (&amp; I&#x27;ve tried a lot of them). Doesn&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;after tan&amp;#34; smell after you use it, it&#x27;s sort of pineapple like. After only a couple of tans with this lotion, I definitely notice a huge difference in my color. This is my favorite Pro Tan product and it&#x27;s at a great price! The smell, the price and how tan it gets me so quick are all A++++!!!!</li>
            <li> It smells really good, totally worth the 12 or so bucks, I do wish I had gotten a lotion with more bronzers cause I havent seen much of a difference but it smells AMAZING. And no tingle!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast this got me tan! I have very pale skin and I&#x27;m already seeing results in just three tanning sessions! You can&#x27;t beat the price and the results!</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite tanning lotion! I have fair skin and freckles, and this lotion works perfect for me. I&#x27;ve used many different lotions over the years, and I&#x27;m so glad I discovered this one.</li>
            <li> I have used this at the pool this summer. It works great.</li>
            <li> it smelled nice and it looks just like the picture. but I gave it away because I don&#x27;t tan in a tanning bed.</li>
