            <li>I will be ordering more thats for sure</li>
            <li>Love these pro tools.</li>
            <li>So glad it wasn&#x27;t more.</li>
            <li>They look like they will do the job better then</li>
            <li>which is what I have been doing :))</li>
            <li>love it....</li>
            <li>Pushes back the cuticles with Precision, shaping them perfectly.</li>
            <li>Great price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>love the pusher and use it as a scooper for acrylic nail work.</li>
            <li>This is such a great deal for 2 cuticle pushers, I couldn&#x27;t pass it up!</li>
            <li>is okay.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
            <li>My boyfriend asked me if I stole this from my nail salon :)</li>
            <li>Love them, and a friend of me, also loved them so much that i had to reorder again!</li>
            <li>Pretty good for what I was looking to do.</li>
            <li>But since the price is very reasonable, and the tools work great, it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li>i believe these are the perfect cuticle pusher, reason why is because its not too sharp were you can hurt yourself but also its not too shabby</li>
            <li>and I am able to sanitize them and keep them clean.</li>
            <li>These tools easily remove the flakes from your nails.</li>
            <li>end results is nothing short of beautiful.</li>
            <li>These work just fine.</li>
            <li>You can heat them up over a blow dryer and smooth down the nail wraps if you have any wrinkles - they are the best tool!  </li>
            <li>They are easy to handle and very useful.  </li>
            <li>The tools are not flimsy or cheap.</li>
            <li>The metal isn&#x27;t cheap...</li>
            <li>This is a great deal and will last for decades.  </li>
            <li>so this was just convenient and cheap.</li>
            <li>; free shipping, and it was worth the wait :)</li>
            <li>very nice quality and would definitely order from this company again.</li>
            <li>These are nice, high quality nail tools.</li>
            <li>Came the day it said it would and definitely made out of good material even though the price was so cheap.</li>
            <li>those are the amazing nails tools that i ever had, very usefull and not expensive for the quality...</li>
            <li>Overall an good</li>
            <li>Solid, with a good weight feel.</li>
            <li>I use to use similar plastic products but they didn&#x27;t work as good.</li>
            <li>And the price for them should cost a whole lot more in my opinion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These were such handy fine tools; they got used to clean stripped paint off a door, (worked great in tight</li>
            <li>Wow really surprised for the cost great quality.  </li>
            <li>These are so nice at such a cheap price, they are just like the ones that are used in the salon</li>
            <li>,they are super strong stainless steel</li>
            <li>Received item within the shipping estimate, item was exactly as described!</li>
            <li>The price was right, the shipping and delivery super, and this item was just what I needed</li>
            <li>Comes in two little plastic protective cases which is great.</li>
            <li>But they are great little tools for woodworking and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>These stainless steel pieces are fantastic.</li>
            <li>This is better than my old pusher remover.</li>
            <li>I told him he could not have mine, as I felt the same, hence why I ordered them; but I would buy him his own set.</li>
            <li>these are just right</li>
            <li>i felt like goldy locks when she was trying to find the right stuff</li>
            <li>I mean they are good quality and you couldn&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li>This is a two piece set same tools most Nail salons use ,i read one reviewer that said they were made cheap made me laugh only cheap thing about these</li>
            <li>Wonder for the price that they are they are very gentle and doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li>I purchased similar tools here locally at much much higher price yet not half as good as these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>If the rust, I will replace with higher quality tools.</li>
            <li>If you can&#x27;t deal with their ship times, pay more for the ones who&#x27;ll get it to you next day.</li>
            <li>I love the different sizes and features.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>They work for so many different things..</li>
            <li>They are small and a little light, but for the price it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how the sharp point of this tool so easily removes excess cuticle and skin around your nail for a perfectly clean, smooth, and professional finish.  </li>
            <li>I love these tools, works great when I push my cuticles and cutting them.</li>
            <li>Not as good as the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li>They are very gentle when used properly and can get the job done easily</li>
            <li>This is my first pusher/trimmer of the stainless steel variety</li>
            <li>We love the tools, it fits right in with our other nail equipment.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected and does the job well :)</li>
            <li>Quality, better than other places like born pretty.</li>
            <li>Cleaner works really well for under my nails, too.</li>
            <li>Very well packaged for shipment.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t slip and it cleans very well.</li>
            <li>and they work very well</li>
            <li>Very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have much of a comparison to make</li>
            <li>Love the ONE tool i got but expected to get TWO... paid 5.99 for them two days ago and now they cost 2.59...</li>
            <li>Nothing like the ones in the pic, they have very sharp/rough edges</li>
            <li>These items are listed as stainless steel...</li>
            <li>These were really inexpensive nail tools.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>haha)</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ll get filed down, should be okay).</li>
            <li>highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The shipping took a little more time from China.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re sharp and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>One with a &amp;#34;pointy&amp;#34; end like a under the nail scraper/digger and the other shows kind of like a flat knife form.</li>
            <li>thought it was worth mentioning that these are two different types of nail pushers.</li>
            <li>the pusher is kind of thick.</li>
            <li>The pusher is kind of thick, but it works.</li>
            <li>Good in a pinch and for scraping off polish, but not for underneath nails with that sharp edge that needs filed down.</li>
            <li>Good solid tools, I just wish the handles were a little larger in diameter.</li>
            <li>this is steel, so when pushing back the cuticle be gentle and do not scratch off part of your nail!</li>
            <li>Sharp, easy to use to clean my toe nails and the dried skin around the cuticles.</li>
            <li>This cuticle remover seems pretty sturdy and removes pretty easily, but this promises 2 cuticle removers and, for the time it takes to get here, getting 1 is kind of disappointing :\</li>
            <li>And I got a little bracelet with it for free.</li>
            <li>It shipped fast, given where it was coming from, and it&#x27;s the same product as what I&#x27;ve seen nail techs use.</li>
            <li>Definitely professional quality product.</li>
            <li>I only got one of the items but other than that it works fine</li>
            <li>Finally, sharp and useful tools for cuticles, cleaning nails, toenails, ingrown nails etc.</li>
            <li>I have been using them consistently for about 7 months now with absolutely no problems.</li>
            <li>The new ones I arrived were absolutely different in design and dimensions, and the one I needed happened to arrive damaged.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The tools came from the Far East, and it did take a few weeks to arrive, but they are well worth the wait.  </li>
            <li>In fact I found myself surprised when I received mine much earlier than expected.&lt;br</li>
            <li>VERY pointy end, be careful.</li>
            <li>They were much, much heavier than I expected</li>
            <li>Its bulky, thick and not at all precise.</li>
            <li>Normally the foreign made garbage just doesn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> So glad it wasn&#x27;t more.</li>
            <li> They look like they will do the job better then</li>
            <li> which is what I have been doing :))</li>
            <li> love it....</li>
            <li> Pushes back the cuticles with Precision, shaping them perfectly.</li>
            <li> Great price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> love the pusher and use it as a scooper for acrylic nail work.</li>
            <li> This is such a great deal for 2 cuticle pushers, I couldn&#x27;t pass it up!</li>
            <li> is okay.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend asked me if I stole this from my nail salon :)</li>
            <li> Love them, and a friend of me, also loved them so much that i had to reorder again!</li>
            <li> Pretty good for what I was looking to do.</li>
            <li> But since the price is very reasonable, and the tools work great, it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> i believe these are the perfect cuticle pusher, reason why is because its not too sharp were you can hurt yourself but also its not too shabby</li>
            <li> and I am able to sanitize them and keep them clean.</li>
            <li> These tools easily remove the flakes from your nails.</li>
            <li> end results is nothing short of beautiful.</li>
            <li> These work just fine.</li>
            <li> You can heat them up over a blow dryer and smooth down the nail wraps if you have any wrinkles - they are the best tool!  </li>
            <li> They are easy to handle and very useful.  </li>
            <li> The tools are not flimsy or cheap.</li>
            <li> The metal isn&#x27;t cheap...</li>
            <li> This is a great deal and will last for decades.  </li>
            <li> so this was just convenient and cheap.</li>
            <li> ; free shipping, and it was worth the wait :)</li>
            <li> very nice quality and would definitely order from this company again.</li>
            <li> These are nice, high quality nail tools.</li>
            <li> Came the day it said it would and definitely made out of good material even though the price was so cheap.</li>
            <li> those are the amazing nails tools that i ever had, very usefull and not expensive for the quality...</li>
            <li> Overall an good</li>
            <li> Solid, with a good weight feel.</li>
            <li> I use to use similar plastic products but they didn&#x27;t work as good.</li>
            <li> And the price for them should cost a whole lot more in my opinion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These were such handy fine tools; they got used to clean stripped paint off a door, (worked great in tight</li>
            <li> Wow really surprised for the cost great quality.  </li>
            <li> These are so nice at such a cheap price, they are just like the ones that are used in the salon</li>
            <li> ,they are super strong stainless steel</li>
            <li> Received item within the shipping estimate, item was exactly as described!</li>
            <li> The price was right, the shipping and delivery super, and this item was just what I needed</li>
            <li> Comes in two little plastic protective cases which is great.</li>
            <li> But they are great little tools for woodworking and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> These stainless steel pieces are fantastic.</li>
            <li> This is better than my old pusher remover.</li>
            <li> I told him he could not have mine, as I felt the same, hence why I ordered them; but I would buy him his own set.</li>
            <li> these are just right</li>
            <li> i felt like goldy locks when she was trying to find the right stuff</li>
            <li> I mean they are good quality and you couldn&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> This is a two piece set same tools most Nail salons use ,i read one reviewer that said they were made cheap made me laugh only cheap thing about these</li>
            <li> Wonder for the price that they are they are very gentle and doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> I purchased similar tools here locally at much much higher price yet not half as good as these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> If the rust, I will replace with higher quality tools.</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t deal with their ship times, pay more for the ones who&#x27;ll get it to you next day.</li>
            <li> I love the different sizes and features.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> They work for so many different things..</li>
            <li> They are small and a little light, but for the price it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how the sharp point of this tool so easily removes excess cuticle and skin around your nail for a perfectly clean, smooth, and professional finish.  </li>
            <li> I love these tools, works great when I push my cuticles and cutting them.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> They are very gentle when used properly and can get the job done easily</li>
            <li> This is my first pusher/trimmer of the stainless steel variety</li>
            <li> We love the tools, it fits right in with our other nail equipment.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected and does the job well :)</li>
            <li> Quality, better than other places like born pretty.</li>
            <li> Cleaner works really well for under my nails, too.</li>
            <li> Very well packaged for shipment.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t slip and it cleans very well.</li>
            <li> and they work very well</li>
            <li> Very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have much of a comparison to make</li>
            <li> Love the ONE tool i got but expected to get TWO... paid 5.99 for them two days ago and now they cost 2.59...</li>
            <li> Nothing like the ones in the pic, they have very sharp/rough edges</li>
            <li> These items are listed as stainless steel...</li>
            <li> These were really inexpensive nail tools.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> haha)</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ll get filed down, should be okay).</li>
            <li> highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The shipping took a little more time from China.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sharp and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> One with a &amp;#34;pointy&amp;#34; end like a under the nail scraper/digger and the other shows kind of like a flat knife form.</li>
            <li> thought it was worth mentioning that these are two different types of nail pushers.</li>
            <li> the pusher is kind of thick.</li>
            <li> The pusher is kind of thick, but it works.</li>
            <li> Good in a pinch and for scraping off polish, but not for underneath nails with that sharp edge that needs filed down.</li>
            <li> Good solid tools, I just wish the handles were a little larger in diameter.</li>
            <li> this is steel, so when pushing back the cuticle be gentle and do not scratch off part of your nail!</li>
            <li> Sharp, easy to use to clean my toe nails and the dried skin around the cuticles.</li>
            <li> This cuticle remover seems pretty sturdy and removes pretty easily, but this promises 2 cuticle removers and, for the time it takes to get here, getting 1 is kind of disappointing :\</li>
            <li> And I got a little bracelet with it for free.</li>
            <li> It shipped fast, given where it was coming from, and it&#x27;s the same product as what I&#x27;ve seen nail techs use.</li>
            <li> Definitely professional quality product.</li>
            <li> I only got one of the items but other than that it works fine</li>
            <li> Finally, sharp and useful tools for cuticles, cleaning nails, toenails, ingrown nails etc.</li>
            <li> I have been using them consistently for about 7 months now with absolutely no problems.</li>
            <li> The new ones I arrived were absolutely different in design and dimensions, and the one I needed happened to arrive damaged.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The tools came from the Far East, and it did take a few weeks to arrive, but they are well worth the wait.  </li>
            <li> In fact I found myself surprised when I received mine much earlier than expected.&lt;br</li>
            <li> VERY pointy end, be careful.</li>
            <li> They were much, much heavier than I expected</li>
            <li> Its bulky, thick and not at all precise.</li>
            <li> Normally the foreign made garbage just doesn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding anything similar in stores near me (and I live in LA!)</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for as far as looks but they are as sharp as any.</li>
            <li> I would keep them well maintained and they will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Did take a long time to arrive though....</li>
            <li> The pointed ends are sharp enough to cut the cuticle, so don&#x27;t let your kids play with them.</li>
            <li> They are sharp and last!</li>
            <li> I received this tool set after more than 2 months and now I feel guilty for the negative feedback that I left to the seller and also for the refund they made.</li>
            <li> I had looked in normal drugstores for some professional type cuticle pusher, they were either to expensive or the quality wasn&#x27;t substantial.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Same thing with the little knife.  </li>
            <li> The product is garbage don&#x27;t waste you money even though it is only $2.</li>
            <li> They were nicer than I expected.  </li>
            <li> It did take a like while to be delivered, but that&#x27;s expected.</li>
            <li> just as expected</li>
            <li> but that is to be expected if you&#x27;re buying from china.</li>
            <li> function exactly as expected and the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> not really does the job well.</li>
            <li> The only thing that kinda stinks about this was in the picture it clearly shows two different tools.</li>
            <li> These are sharp and get the job done.</li>
            <li> The tools are long, heavy, with non-slip handles.</li>
            <li> The spoon ends of both tools are sharp around the edge and scratched my nails.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the time or effort to return or refund.  </li>
            <li> It beats anything else hands down.  </li>
            <li> A little cheaper than I thought, just don&#x27;t have the \\&quot;feel\\&quot; of my other tools.</li>
            <li> They feel really sharp around the edges, but I think I can file them down!</li>
            <li> Very sharp and does what it is suppose to.</li>
            <li> This instrument was very sharp and hurt to use.</li>
            <li> One of the pushers was slightly cracked.</li>
            <li> But they seem to have less &amp;#34;polish&amp;#34; than salon tools sold at beauty stores.</li>
            <li> Of course they are a fraction of the cost, so the slightly rougher edges are manageable.</li>
            <li> PREVIOUS REVIEW:</li>
            <li> All the dead skin around the edges and at the base of your nails comes up and off so easily.  </li>
            <li> Wasted $2.</li>
            <li> Heavy duty salon quality.</li>
            <li> It scraps well and helps with getting into small areas and cleaning under nails as well.</li>
            <li> the metal on these seems a bit cheaper than nail pushers i&#x27;ve used in the past, but they get the job done.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t use them yet, but they&#x27;re very heavy and well made.</li>
            <li> In fact I found it to be quite dull.</li>
            <li> seem to have issues with slow shipping</li>
            <li> This company is shady and untruthful!  </li>
            <li> Also has a curvy pointy end which comes in helpfull for your feet toes, when you&#x27;ve had a long day and want to get the dirty residue off the corners.</li>
            <li> I got two of the same :-(</li>
            <li> Am looking at picture and now Am confused was</li>
            <li> I was a gift so unable to say anything about it.</li>
            <li> Horrible product - metal shavings still attached, razor sharp edges.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This cuticle remover seems pretty sturdy and removes pretty easily, but this promises 2 cuticle removers and, for the time it takes to get here, getting 1 is kind of disappointing :\</li>
            <li> Both products are the same they just show you different images. The product is garbage don&#x27;t waste you money even though it is only $2. Just throw that $2 in the trash.</li>
            <li> They are easy to handle and very useful.  The two sizes are great along with the cleaning tool for under the nails.</li>
            <li> i love them and the tools were packaged nicely. The tools are not flimsy or cheap. I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase and would recommend these items.</li>
            <li> Great product and great price.</li>
            <li> Works great love themðŸ˜„</li>
            <li> Best I have found to use to push back my cuticles. Cleaner works really well for under my nails, too.</li>
            <li> I discovered this tool during my last pedicure at the spa.  I was amazed at how the sharp point of this tool so easily removes excess cuticle and skin around your nail for a perfectly clean, smooth, and professional finish.  I had to have it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tools came from the Far East, and it did take a few weeks to arrive, but they are well worth the wait.  If you give yourself pedicures and manicures, this is THE tool to have to prepare your nails and cuticle.  It beats anything else hands down.  All the dead skin around the edges and at the base of your nails comes up and off so easily.  Of course, you have to put on cuticle remover first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The end results is nothing short of beautiful.</li>
            <li> Quality, better than other places like born pretty. and a great price... thank you :]</li>
            <li> Great product, but it took forever to get here.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for as far as looks but they are as sharp as any.</li>
            <li> They were nicer than I expected.  They have a nice weight, balance and feel to them.  I would buy these again.</li>
            <li> One of the pushers was slightly cracked.</li>
            <li> I was a gift so unable to say anything about it.</li>
            <li> These work just fine. They&#x27;re sharp and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> I only got one of the items but other than that it works fine</li>
            <li> Wow really surprised for the cost great quality.  I do my own shellac most of the time these tools get the job done well.</li>
            <li> I bought these awhile ago and used twice. Its bulky, thick and not at all precise. I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this it really works, and for the price it&#x27;s a great deal</li>
            <li> This is great I&#x27;ve realized I don&#x27;t have nearly as many lifts.</li>
            <li> Great product for price. It scraps well and helps with getting into small areas and cleaning under nails as well.</li>
            <li> Great price an easy to use I like that it come with two different sizes. An has a nice grip</li>
            <li> Love them, and a friend of me, also loved them so much that i had to reorder again!; free shipping, and it was worth the wait :)</li>
            <li> These items arrived on time. very nice quality and would definitely order from this company again. Very well packaged for shipment. I haven&#x27;t use them yet, but they&#x27;re very heavy and well made. My husband looked at them and stated how well made they looked, and that he has a similar set in his garage. Great purchase!</li>
            <li> Finally, sharp and useful tools for cuticles, cleaning nails, toenails, ingrown nails etc. These are sharp and get the job done. I had to shop around till I found something substantial that actually works. Comes in two little plastic protective cases which is great.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal and the product Is very durable. I would recommend this product. I will be ordering more thats for sure</li>
            <li> This is better than my old pusher remover. It doesn&#x27;t slip and it cleans very well. Would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for and great price!!!</li>
            <li> Love these pro tools. Save time and money by buying these and doing your own manis! Great quality product also</li>
            <li> Horrible product - metal shavings still attached, razor sharp edges. No way to use these on my cuticle or nails. Wasted $2. So glad it wasn&#x27;t more.</li>
            <li> These are the best tools! The metal isn&#x27;t cheap...it has a good weight and the one w/a curved end is the best for prepping cuticles and cleaning polish off of cuticles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These were such handy fine tools; they got used to clean stripped paint off a door, (worked great in tight corners).&lt;br /&gt;I bought another set.</li>
            <li> I received this tool set after more than 2 months and now I feel guilty for the negative feedback that I left to the seller and also for the refund they made. The set it&#x27;s very good meeting my needs. I want to repair my feedback and pay for the set, I just need to find the way to do it.  Thank you</li>
            <li> We love the tools, it fits right in with our other nail equipment.</li>
            <li> the pusher is kind of thick. but it works. looks very cheap though.</li>
            <li> This is very good quality and very good price , my friend and I love it so much.thank you again .</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for. They are small and a little light, but for the price it&#x27;s perfect. And I got a little bracelet with it for free. It did take a like while to be delivered, but that&#x27;s expected. Love it!</li>
            <li> These are so nice at such a cheap price, they are just like the ones that are used in the salon and they work very well</li>
            <li> These are amazing for self manis and pedis!</li>
            <li> Just like what is used in the salons and what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I still wearing for my order ...</li>
            <li> This is a great deal and will last for decades.  Very sharp and does what it is suppose to. I ordered two sets.</li>
            <li> I got two of the same :-(</li>
            <li> The only thing that kinda stinks about this was in the picture it clearly shows two different tools. One with a &amp;#34;pointy&amp;#34; end like a under the nail scraper/digger and the other shows kind of like a flat knife form. And I got two of the same tools. It was supposed to be two different tools. Also it did come in the time frame that it said but came on the very last day, which was a month wait time. But still gets the job done at a good price.</li>
            <li> This instrument was very sharp and hurt to use. It also scraped some of my nail off. Very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> This is a two piece set same tools most Nail salons use ,i read one reviewer that said they were made cheap made me laugh only cheap thing about these was the price ,they are super strong stainless steel and i do not think you can find these as inexpensive any where else ,Great price,product, and seller.</li>
            <li> I plan to use these to remove gel nail polish after I soak them...They feel really sharp around the edges, but I think I can file them down! They look like they will do the job better then my finger nails (which is what I have been doing :))</li>
            <li> works great and good price !</li>
            <li> They r perfect. Well spend money. I will buy it again. Recommend to others. It cleans n push cuticles nicely.</li>
            <li> Took a while to get but they are nice.</li>
            <li> The price was right, the shipping and delivery super, and this item was just what I needed</li>
            <li> work amazing. just as expected</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected and does the job well :)</li>
            <li> Perfect. The price was insanely good too. It shipped fast, given where it was coming from, and it&#x27;s the same product as what I&#x27;ve seen nail techs use. Great for taking care of your cuticles on your own.</li>
            <li> love it....works perfectly and I am able to sanitize them and keep them clean.</li>
            <li> Good tools for removing nail polish.  After soaking nails in the nail polish remover for gel polish, the polish starts to come off in flaky chunks, but still stick to the nails.  These tools easily remove the flakes from your nails.</li>
            <li> Pretty good for what I was looking to do. This is my first pusher/trimmer of the stainless steel variety so I don&#x27;t have much of a comparison to make but it seems to get the job done. Pushes back the cuticles with Precision, shaping them perfectly. I didn&#x27;t find the trimmer to be &amp;#34;razor sharp&amp;#34;. In fact I found it to be quite dull. I&#x27;ll probably go ahead and sharpen it myself, though. Overall an good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know a lot of people here seem to have issues with slow shipping but that is to be expected if you&#x27;re buying from china. In fact I found myself surprised when I received mine much earlier than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought from : GO Carol(Ships From Hong Kong)</li>
            <li> Arrived just as it looks in the description at a great price too! Very pleased!</li>
            <li> Love the ONE tool i got but expected to get TWO... paid 5.99 for them two days ago and now they cost 2.59...</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. Not as good as the more expensive ones. When will I learn? I keep one in each car now. VERY pointy end, be careful.</li>
            <li> what I was looking for. Sharp, easy to use to clean my toe nails and the dried skin around the cuticles.</li>
            <li> These tools do the job (scraping off gel polish.) But they seem to have less &amp;#34;polish&amp;#34; than salon tools sold at beauty stores. Of course they are a fraction of the cost, so the slightly rougher edges are manageable. If the rust, I will replace with higher quality tools.</li>
            <li> Very solid construction. The tools are long, heavy, with non-slip handles. The shipping took a little more time from China. But since the price is very reasonable, and the tools work great, it was worth the wait. I purchased similar tools here locally at much much higher price yet not half as good as these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used these for a while, and leave them in the humid bathroom. They have not rusted.  If they do, I will not hesitate to purchase another set from the same seller. Five stars!</li>
            <li> Came the day it said it would and definitely made out of good material even though the price was so cheap.</li>
            <li> The material of these products is good but I need to get used to them.</li>
            <li> Great price, fast shipping. Very satisfied with purchase.</li>
            <li> The spoon ends of both tools are sharp around the edge and scratched my nails.  The curved point on the larger tool is like a needle and and I don&#x27;t know what I would use it for.  Same thing with the little knife.  But they are great little tools for woodworking and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Nothing like the ones in the pic, they have very sharp/rough edges</li>
            <li> Love them, didn&#x27;t arrive brown or anything defective!</li>
            <li> Just what i needed for nail cuticles and feet cuticle! Also has a curvy pointy end which comes in helpfull for your feet toes, when you&#x27;ve had a long day and want to get the dirty residue off the corners. Also be ware this is steel, so when pushing back the cuticle be gentle and do not scratch off part of your nail! I love this tool and so does my husband!</li>
            <li> i believe these are the perfect cuticle pusher, reason why is because its not too sharp were you can hurt yourself but also its not too shabby were you cant remove the access skin from the nail. these are just right i felt like goldy locks when she was trying to find the right stuff except i found these cuticle pushers</li>
            <li> These items are listed as stainless steel...they are rusted when I received them!  When they arrived by USPS the customs label stated that a phone case was in the package!  This company is shady and untruthful!  Do not buy from them! No where did it state in the product description (that i could find) that it was coming from Hong Kong!</li>
            <li> Great scraper and cutical pusher.</li>
            <li> love the pusher and use it as a scooper for acrylic nail work. this tool is amazing and wouldnt know what to do without it.</li>
            <li> I ended up damaging one, so I decided to reorder. The new ones I arrived were absolutely different in design and dimensions, and the one I needed happened to arrive damaged. Not worth the time or effort to return or refund.  PREVIOUS REVIEW: Solid, with a good weight feel. If you can&#x27;t deal with their ship times, pay more for the ones who&#x27;ll get it to you next day.</li>
            <li> These were really inexpensive nail tools.  I had actually ordered this same set for myself and when I saw my father last he tried to steal them from me! He said he had been looking for tools just like these.  I told him he could not have mine, as I felt the same, hence why I ordered them; but I would buy him his own set. No complaints here! Buy them even if you are unsure,  these are so cheap!!!!</li>
            <li> This is great, it helps to take the gel off my nails, clean under my nails and helps to apply nail art!  Great!</li>
            <li> Perfect works like a dream!</li>
            <li> This is such a great deal for 2 cuticle pushers, I couldn&#x27;t pass it up! I bought these to heat up and seal my nail wraps with. These are amazing.</li>
            <li> This is a durable, functional set that works great for applying Jamberry nail wraps!  I love the different sizes and features.  I give them as gifts to my customers and they all love them!  You can heat them up over a blow dryer and smooth down the nail wraps if you have any wrinkles - they are the best tool!  If you want to try them with a Jamberry nail wraps, check them out at www.LindseyUT.jamberrynails.net</li>
            <li> I love these tools, works great when I push my cuticles and cutting them. I also scrape any glue or nail polish left on my nails. I use to use similar plastic products but they didn&#x27;t work as good. The pointed ends are sharp enough to cut the cuticle, so don&#x27;t let your kids play with them. I would keep them well maintained and they will last a very long time. This product exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> I purchased these to assist with removal of gel nail polish after soaking. (I do my own gel nails at home.)  These tools are just like what my salon uses, and come in 2 sizes.&lt;br /&gt;They function exactly as expected and the price can&#x27;t be beat. However the shipping speed leaves something to be desired.  It took upwards of 3 weeks for these to arrive.</li>
            <li> those are the amazing nails tools that i ever had, very usefull and not expensive for the quality...i loved it</li>
            <li> Normally the foreign made garbage just doesn&#x27;t cut it. These stainless steel pieces are fantastic. They are sharp and last! I use them for cleaning coral growth off of fossils. Anything that can withstand that will make mincemeat of nails. I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> Really nice and well made.  Excellent product!</li>
            <li> Received item within the shipping estimate, item was exactly as described!</li>
            <li> Heavy duty salon quality. Nice to have at home</li>
            <li> I can not believe how good these are. They are made so well! And the price for them should cost a whole lot more in my opinion. (Now that I have them haha) I&#x27;m very pleased with these as a pair.</li>
            <li> Great tools.  I like that 2 different kinds of instruments are included.  Good quality.</li>
            <li> I absoultey love these! I often do my nails and use these all the time. They are very gentle when used properly and can get the job done easily</li>
            <li> Definitely professional quality product.</li>
            <li> The pusher is kind of thick, but it works.Great product for price.</li>
            <li> Good solid tools, I just wish the handles were a little larger in diameter.</li>
            <li> Great product! Fast shipping! Thank you! A+</li>
            <li> the metal on these seems a bit cheaper than nail pushers i&#x27;ve used in the past, but they get the job done. thought it was worth mentioning that these are two different types of nail pushers. not the sellers fault, but i didn&#x27;t realize that when i was purchasing the item. can&#x27;t complain with the price though. recommended.</li>
            <li> Wonder for the price that they are they are very gentle and doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> Wish I had these sooner. They work for so many different things.. Would order these nail art tools a second time.</li>
            <li> shipping takes a while.. but if you can wait.. it&#x27;s a great deal</li>
            <li> Love love it! Recommend getting this again!!!</li>
            <li> is okay. not really does the job well.</li>
            <li> Picture shoes 2 diffrent tools I received both of the same ones the one with the big hook type at the end definitely do not recommend unless u need both of the same tools but they are steel I doubt they will break</li>
            <li> After 2 months waiting for this item, I only received 1 not TWO!!</li>
            <li> The quality is not that good! But it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
            <li> excellent product.  highly recommend. great company to deal with.</li>
            <li> A little cheaper than I thought, just don&#x27;t have the \\&quot;feel\\&quot; of my other tools. Not as refined, some metal not stamped out and hangs off the end (I&#x27;ll get filed down, should be okay). Good in a pinch and for scraping off polish, but not for underneath nails with that sharp edge that needs filed down.</li>
            <li> These tools were super cheap and of great quality! They were much, much heavier than I expected and I suspect they will last forever. I have been using them consistently for about 7 months now with absolutely no problems.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend asked me if I stole this from my nail salon :) They are very good tools, too good you can&#x27;t leave them laying around because they may poke you lol.</li>
            <li> These are some good utensils to have in your makeup bag. Great for scraping plaster from under neath your nails!</li>
            <li> These are nice, high quality nail tools. Don&#x27;t buy if you are in a rush though as they took several week to arrive. If you&#x27;re not in a rush then definitely get these. I had a hard time finding anything similar in stores near me (and I live in LA!) so this was just convenient and cheap. I think you could find at specialty beauty supply stores, but not at your local drugstore.</li>
            <li> Works as it should, very satisfied</li>
            <li> Am looking at picture and now Am confused was I suppose to get 2 different ones?..cause I got 2 of the same ..I mean they are good quality and you couldn&#x27;t beat the price! Did take a long time to arrive though....</li>
            <li> I had looked in normal drugstores for some professional type cuticle pusher, they were either to expensive or the quality wasn&#x27;t substantial.&lt;br /&gt;These are very nice.  Just got them so can&#x27;t rate them for durability.</li>
