            <li>I&#x27;ll be the voice of skepsis here to temper all of the &amp;#34;this is the greatest soap ever!&amp;#34; reviews.  </li>
            <li>the title says, Williams is the best shavring soap ever!</li>
            <li>It is good shaving soap !!</li>
            <li>&quot; This is the best damn shaving soap on the market, I use it every day, and it makes me look forward to shaving.  </li>
            <li>and I could smell the wonderful fragrance from this soap through the packaging.</li>
            <li>Best way there is to shave...</li>
            <li>Williams soap was once a very good soap</li>
            <li>Used with plenty of water, I&#x27;ve found that Williams fluffs up beautifully.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m happy to call Williams Mug Shaving Soap my starter soap.</li>
            <li>works great, no complaints</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t need to soak the soap before using, you won&#x27;t need to worry about foamy lather, you&#x27;ll just get a great shave.  </li>
            <li>I also use a Parker badger brush and get great results...</li>
            <li>Smells good and gives you great lather.</li>
            <li>Good lather, great smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a pleasant citronella aroma -- if you like citronella, which reminds me of summer anti-mosquito candles and soaps you&#x27;d use while camping.  </li>
            <li>and i was able to get an amazing lather which offered an excellent close shave as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using good ole Williams Mug Shaving Soap since I was 15</li>
            <li>Smells good, and works well</li>
            <li>shaving soap that smells good and lathers well.&lt;br /&gt;not</li>
            <li>I loved it, my son to whom I gave it as a birthday gift loved it.</li>
            <li>a try just to know what a good lather is like.</li>
            <li>Generates a good lather.</li>
            <li>But the protection was nice and the shave was good and</li>
            <li>Lathers good, smells like dial soap which is nice.  </li>
            <li>I said in the header, it never fails to lather up perfectly.</li>
            <li>Better to be frugal!</li>
            <li>up nice...</li>
            <li>one of our better buys, we&#x27;d do it again if the opportunity presented itself; we&#x27;re very satisfied with the product</li>
            <li>I liked it ok, but will probably not order again.  </li>
            <li>Very stylish, affordable, and apparently easy to use.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more like a nice jazz chord on a guitar :)</li>
            <li>This soap is very hard to lather and not the best for a beginner, it seems like a good soap for more experienced shavers</li>
            <li>A quick splash of aftershave, and my girlfriend was delighted at the smoothness of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I like it better than shaving gel.</li>
            <li>However, I still feel like Williams doesn&#x27;t tend to give the most luxurious foam.</li>
            <li>However, I still feel like Williams doesn&#x27;t tend to give the most luxurious foam.</li>
            <li>1800&#x27;s farm old-fashioned :)  SCENT.</li>
            <li>Sure, it&#x27;s &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; if you love citronella candles and the herb verbena, because that&#x27;s what it smells like, nothing else, no complexity.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surethere are even better scents out there.  </li>
            <li>It looks like the better soaps mix the two.</li>
            <li>Well, with this soap you&#x27;ll feel like a buck-fitty :)</li>
            <li>The fragrance is not my favorite.</li>
            <li>never cut myself so many times shaving than i did when using this product.</li>
            <li>It is also a better performer.</li>
            <li>add 5-8 drops of liquid glycerine, either on the brush or on top of the puck and start blathering in the bowl.</li>
            <li>An inexpensive shaving soap that works ok.  </li>
            <li>So glad to find it on line.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cannot wait to use shaving soap ....will order some more.</li>
            <li>I like Proraso Shaving Cream much better.</li>
            <li>And most of your shaving mugs are nothing more than a coffee mug.</li>
            <li>Although the fragrance has a nice clean smell to it.</li>
            <li>excellent product with long history - stays moist for an extended period of time - also moistens the face</li>
            <li>I have heard of some people being or becoming allergic to this.</li>
            <li>I shave with double-edge safety razors (Van Der Hagen and Merkur 37c SLANT) and occasionally straight edge, so I require a good protective lather.</li>
            <li>Works good when you figure out how much water you need to add to get it to lather,</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t get a good lather, too much water</li>
            <li>The shave soap was as described and in new boxes it is nice to find a honest sales point on the Internet.</li>
            <li>My Proraso, which costs a bit more, but still inexpensive per ounce, has a decidedly epicurean scent - you can&#x27;t exactly describe it, but many friends who tried it ended up ordering it too.</li>
            <li>It is cheap and lathers well.  </li>
            <li>can filled with aerosol to shave my face.</li>
            <li>can that old electric razor in favor of a GOOD MUG SOAP</li>
            <li>There is no fancy smell, just a soap smell which I actually like, so if you&#x27;re into the smells then this probably won&#x27;t be a good soap, but you just want a great shave, you should definitely try this.</li>
            <li>The soap builds into a rich lather when worked with a brush, and applying it to your face is smooth and very soothing to my skin, which tends to get irritated by most shaving creams.    </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d smell it all day; it is just one of those subtle but pleasant aromas that makes you feel good.</li>
            <li>Gotta say I was expecting something dramatically inferior, but it does the trick as beautifully as anything priced ten time as much.</li>
            <li>The lather rinsed off cleanly and with no effort at all- a quick splash of water and there was no residue.</li>
            <li>&quot; I don&#x27;t see it.&lt;br /&gt;I bought several bars at one time &amp; it does not Lather good at all.</li>
            <li>; I figured that was a good enough</li>
            <li>The lather produced by this product is unstable, breaks down very quickly, and it takes a lot of product to give a good amount of lather.    </li>
            <li>I like it better than that clear orange soap that they sell it bites the face a bit, this is mild.</li>
            <li>what kind of results you will get with the commercial three blade 4 blade and 5 blade razors (I.E. mach3 and fusion, or the Schick quatro).</li>
            <li>I honestly cannot recommend this product enough.</li>
            <li>Of course, there are many other soaps for more money that work nearly as well as Arko, but Arko is dirt-cheap and a top performer.  </li>
            <li>Takes some experience and elbow grease to get the right consistency for the lather, but once you get it right, you&#x27;ll want to shave for hours.</li>
            <li>: I recently moved to where water is very soft and decided to try the soap again, to be fair.</li>
            <li>, I hadn&#x27;t yet learned how Williams requires a little more hot water than most soaps.</li>
            <li>get the full experience, I&#x27;ve learned to follow an old technique and soak the puck in a mug full of steaming hot water along with my brush while I do my pre-shave prep.</li>
            <li>Packaged very very well...</li>
            <li>Unlike the majority of canned shaving creams and gels, Williams has a nice clean scent without a lot of heavy perfumes which is one of the biggest perks for me.</li>
            <li>Willians Mug Shaving Soap can be gotten at most local pharmacies, so try looking around before you pay shipping.</li>
            <li>my first effort</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit, I was interested -</li>
            <li>This is an OK shaving soap, but for about the same price you can get a puck of &amp;#34;Shaving Factory&amp;#34; soap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned how to lather and that really helps!</li>
            <li>I soak my soap and brush with hot water in the shaving mug while I take a shower.</li>
            <li>At first, I didn&#x27;t know how to make lather.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive so prepping the skin is important.</li>
            <li>Not the absolute best shaving soap you can get, but WAY better than the Van der Hagen crap.</li>
            <li>If you are highly sensitive to allergic ingredients or develop new allergies easily, I would avoid this, just in case.</li>
            <li>Try boiling some water, then filling a mug about 3/4 of the way, soaking your brush in it, then pour out about half of it, rub your brush on the soap, vigorously, then make a nice lather in the mug.  </li>
            <li>I was reviewing a new disposable during my initial shave on top of being unfamiliar with the method.</li>
            <li>, so you&#x27;re really just paying for shipping here.  </li>
            <li>; It lathers much easier and provides a creamier and slicker lather.</li>
            <li>Arko happens to very close to Williams in scent too, if you happen to like the scent of Williams.</li>
            <li>I should mention though that i used this with an old fashioned Merkur double edge razor, so I&#x27;m not quite sure</li>
            <li>I get more than enough lather to do 4 complete passes.</li>
            <li>Someone who hasn&#x27;t had much experience with shave soaps, and are using soaps like Colonel Conk, VDH &amp; many other \\&quot;glycerin\\&quot; soaps that are in actuality detergent based, might actually find this an OK product for their review here, however anyone who has experienced a thick, creamy, slick, cushioning lather from many other shave soaps available here on Amazon will find this product extremely lacking in most areas.    </li>
            <li>Williams is a fine product with a long history and my Dad and both my Grandpas used it before I did.</li>
            <li>Not bad for something that costs only about one dollar!</li>
            <li>I still built up a lather to equal or beat anything I&#x27;ve ever gotten out of a can, although it wasn&#x27;t as fluffy as a good lather should be.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended to shavers of all experience levers.</li>
            <li>Again, great workhorse, but I&#x27;ll definitely be getting a more expensive model in my cabinet as an occasional treat.&lt;br</li>

            <li>Again, great workhorse, but I&#x27;ll definitely be getting a more expensive model in my cabinet as an occasional treat.     </li>
            <li>It lathered ok, kinda on the weak side, but wasn&#x27;t full of perfume or flowery smells.  </li>
            <li>First off I should mention, if you are just starting to straight razor shave, this is the product for you.  </li>
            <li>Wiilliams is one of the long time, well known, most inexpensive American shaving soaps on the market.  </li>
            <li>The scent is not unpleasant to me, but really is flat.</li>
            <li>The secret to using it is get you a nice badger hair brush and hold the brush under extremely hot running water till the bristles are soaked, then pinch out the excess water and a few swirls over a cake of Williams in your mug and you&#x27;ve got tons of rich lather!</li>
            <li>I bought some shaving soap from a local soap shop that was closing, never did figure out how to use it right.</li>
            <li>My face feels fresher and cleaner than it has in a long time, and although I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll purchase more expensive soaps for special occasions, I can see Williams being my mainstay soap for a long time to come.</li>

            <li>This was my first time shaving with a soap rather than a traditional shave products like the foams and the gels.</li>
            <li>For someone on a REALLY tight budget it would probably be just fine.</li>
            <li>I got a rather wet loose lather, maybe need to load the brush even more.</li>
            <li>If scents were like tones in music, this would be a kazoo or maybe the dial tone - a clear tone, but unremarkable.</li>
            <li>I am just getting back into using shaving soap and Williams is working out very well for me.  </li>
            <li>, unfortunately the product was re-formulated several times, the last reformulation being many many years ago.  </li>
            <li>That old time smell...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to believe there&#x27;s such a perfect soap for such a small price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to believe there&#x27;s such a perfect soap for such a small price.</li>
            <li>: It&#x27;s been over a month since I started with Williams, and I&#x27;m still working on the same puck of soap despite using the soak method and shaving pretty much daily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been over a month since I started with Williams, and I&#x27;m still working on the same puck of soap despite using the soak method and shaving pretty much daily.</li>
            <li>but after the barber cut my hair he&#x27;d spread hot lather and shave above my ears and the back of my neck</li>
            <li>Not bad unless you don&#x27;t like the smell of soap, and not a strong scented soap at that.  </li>
            <li>NO OTHER SHAVING SOAP THET COMES CLOSE TO WILIAMS SHAVING SOAP</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit, I haven&#x27;t tried many shaving soaps, but I use Proraso in a white tub (Green Tea/Oatmeal) and by comparison the Wilson puck only produced lather one would expect from a bar of regular bath soap.</li>
            <li>I would be very surprised if this same cake didn&#x27;t last me through September, and I shave nearly every day.</li>
            <li>As far as the smell, I don&#x27;t notice it anymore - it definitely doesn&#x27;t hang around.</li>
            <li>the smell is really strong and definitely not for everyone... its not too hard to lather up, easier than vdh or any soap for this price...</li>
            <li>On the other hand, now that we&#x27;ve switched from cartridge razor ripoffs, we&#x27;re saving money, even if we buy super expensive soaps and frankly life is too short to use a cheap/flat shaving soap :)  </li>
            <li>Then I drained out the water, make circles with my brush over the soap a few times, then holding the brush with my right hand, made circles with the brush into my left hand to make lather.</li>
            <li>It fits very well in a regular coffee cup which I like due to the shaving mugs are  over priced.</li>
            <li>The men would lay back in the green trimmed leather barber’s chairs with hot towels wrapped on their faces,  an occasional toot of steam came up as they made small talk with the barber about fish or local happenings while the barber in his white smock whipped up a hot mug of Williams shaving soap into a high peak froth before dotting it all over their faces.  </li>
            <li>If you have a lot of facial hair and live in a dry enviroment like I do</li>
            <li>It leaves the skin soft, softens and loosens hair, and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin or leave you smelling \\&quot;soapy.\\</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other soaps and this is not only the least expensive, but it lathers perfectly every time.</li>

            <li> It is cheap and lathers well.  </li>
            <li> can filled with aerosol to shave my face.</li>
            <li> can that old electric razor in favor of a GOOD MUG SOAP</li>
            <li> There is no fancy smell, just a soap smell which I actually like, so if you&#x27;re into the smells then this probably won&#x27;t be a good soap, but you just want a great shave, you should definitely try this.</li>
            <li> The soap builds into a rich lather when worked with a brush, and applying it to your face is smooth and very soothing to my skin, which tends to get irritated by most shaving creams.    </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d smell it all day; it is just one of those subtle but pleasant aromas that makes you feel good.</li>
            <li> Gotta say I was expecting something dramatically inferior, but it does the trick as beautifully as anything priced ten time as much.</li>
            <li> The lather rinsed off cleanly and with no effort at all- a quick splash of water and there was no residue.</li>
            <li> &quot; I don&#x27;t see it.&lt;br /&gt;I bought several bars at one time &amp; it does not Lather good at all.</li>
            <li> ; I figured that was a good enough</li>
            <li> The lather produced by this product is unstable, breaks down very quickly, and it takes a lot of product to give a good amount of lather.    </li>
            <li> I like it better than that clear orange soap that they sell it bites the face a bit, this is mild.</li>
            <li> what kind of results you will get with the commercial three blade 4 blade and 5 blade razors (I.E. mach3 and fusion, or the Schick quatro).</li>
            <li> I honestly cannot recommend this product enough.</li>
            <li> Of course, there are many other soaps for more money that work nearly as well as Arko, but Arko is dirt-cheap and a top performer.  </li>
            <li> Takes some experience and elbow grease to get the right consistency for the lather, but once you get it right, you&#x27;ll want to shave for hours.</li>
            <li> : I recently moved to where water is very soft and decided to try the soap again, to be fair.</li>
            <li> , I hadn&#x27;t yet learned how Williams requires a little more hot water than most soaps.</li>
            <li> get the full experience, I&#x27;ve learned to follow an old technique and soak the puck in a mug full of steaming hot water along with my brush while I do my pre-shave prep.</li>
            <li> Packaged very very well...</li>
            <li> Unlike the majority of canned shaving creams and gels, Williams has a nice clean scent without a lot of heavy perfumes which is one of the biggest perks for me.</li>
            <li> Willians Mug Shaving Soap can be gotten at most local pharmacies, so try looking around before you pay shipping.</li>
            <li> my first effort</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit, I was interested -</li>
            <li> This is an OK shaving soap, but for about the same price you can get a puck of &amp;#34;Shaving Factory&amp;#34; soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned how to lather and that really helps!</li>
            <li> I soak my soap and brush with hot water in the shaving mug while I take a shower.</li>
            <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t know how to make lather.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive so prepping the skin is important.</li>
            <li> Not the absolute best shaving soap you can get, but WAY better than the Van der Hagen crap.</li>
            <li> If you are highly sensitive to allergic ingredients or develop new allergies easily, I would avoid this, just in case.</li>
            <li> Try boiling some water, then filling a mug about 3/4 of the way, soaking your brush in it, then pour out about half of it, rub your brush on the soap, vigorously, then make a nice lather in the mug.  </li>
            <li> I was reviewing a new disposable during my initial shave on top of being unfamiliar with the method.</li>
            <li> , so you&#x27;re really just paying for shipping here.  </li>
            <li> ; It lathers much easier and provides a creamier and slicker lather.</li>
            <li> Arko happens to very close to Williams in scent too, if you happen to like the scent of Williams.</li>
            <li> I should mention though that i used this with an old fashioned Merkur double edge razor, so I&#x27;m not quite sure</li>
            <li> I get more than enough lather to do 4 complete passes.</li>
            <li> Someone who hasn&#x27;t had much experience with shave soaps, and are using soaps like Colonel Conk, VDH &amp; many other \\&quot;glycerin\\&quot; soaps that are in actuality detergent based, might actually find this an OK product for their review here, however anyone who has experienced a thick, creamy, slick, cushioning lather from many other shave soaps available here on Amazon will find this product extremely lacking in most areas.    </li>
            <li> Williams is a fine product with a long history and my Dad and both my Grandpas used it before I did.</li>
            <li> Not bad for something that costs only about one dollar!</li>
            <li> I still built up a lather to equal or beat anything I&#x27;ve ever gotten out of a can, although it wasn&#x27;t as fluffy as a good lather should be.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended to shavers of all experience levers.</li>
            <li> Again, great workhorse, but I&#x27;ll definitely be getting a more expensive model in my cabinet as an occasional treat.&lt;br</li>

            <li> It lathered ok, kinda on the weak side, but wasn&#x27;t full of perfume or flowery smells.  </li>
            <li> First off I should mention, if you are just starting to straight razor shave, this is the product for you.  </li>
            <li> Wiilliams is one of the long time, well known, most inexpensive American shaving soaps on the market.  </li>
            <li> The scent is not unpleasant to me, but really is flat.</li>
            <li> The secret to using it is get you a nice badger hair brush and hold the brush under extremely hot running water till the bristles are soaked, then pinch out the excess water and a few swirls over a cake of Williams in your mug and you&#x27;ve got tons of rich lather!</li>
            <li> I bought some shaving soap from a local soap shop that was closing, never did figure out how to use it right.</li>
            <li> My face feels fresher and cleaner than it has in a long time, and although I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll purchase more expensive soaps for special occasions, I can see Williams being my mainstay soap for a long time to come.</li>

            <li> This was my first time shaving with a soap rather than a traditional shave products like the foams and the gels.</li>
            <li> For someone on a REALLY tight budget it would probably be just fine.</li>
            <li> I got a rather wet loose lather, maybe need to load the brush even more.</li>
            <li> If scents were like tones in music, this would be a kazoo or maybe the dial tone - a clear tone, but unremarkable.</li>
            <li> I am just getting back into using shaving soap and Williams is working out very well for me.  </li>
            <li> , unfortunately the product was re-formulated several times, the last reformulation being many many years ago.  </li>
            <li> That old time smell...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to believe there&#x27;s such a perfect soap for such a small price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to believe there&#x27;s such a perfect soap for such a small price.</li>
            <li> : It&#x27;s been over a month since I started with Williams, and I&#x27;m still working on the same puck of soap despite using the soak method and shaving pretty much daily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been over a month since I started with Williams, and I&#x27;m still working on the same puck of soap despite using the soak method and shaving pretty much daily.</li>
            <li> but after the barber cut my hair he&#x27;d spread hot lather and shave above my ears and the back of my neck</li>
            <li> Not bad unless you don&#x27;t like the smell of soap, and not a strong scented soap at that.  </li>
            <li> NO OTHER SHAVING SOAP THET COMES CLOSE TO WILIAMS SHAVING SOAP</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit, I haven&#x27;t tried many shaving soaps, but I use Proraso in a white tub (Green Tea/Oatmeal) and by comparison the Wilson puck only produced lather one would expect from a bar of regular bath soap.</li>
            <li> I would be very surprised if this same cake didn&#x27;t last me through September, and I shave nearly every day.</li>
            <li> As far as the smell, I don&#x27;t notice it anymore - it definitely doesn&#x27;t hang around.</li>
            <li> the smell is really strong and definitely not for everyone... its not too hard to lather up, easier than vdh or any soap for this price...</li>
            <li> On the other hand, now that we&#x27;ve switched from cartridge razor ripoffs, we&#x27;re saving money, even if we buy super expensive soaps and frankly life is too short to use a cheap/flat shaving soap :)  </li>
            <li> Then I drained out the water, make circles with my brush over the soap a few times, then holding the brush with my right hand, made circles with the brush into my left hand to make lather.</li>
            <li> It fits very well in a regular coffee cup which I like due to the shaving mugs are  over priced.</li>
            <li> The men would lay back in the green trimmed leather barber’s chairs with hot towels wrapped on their faces,  an occasional toot of steam came up as they made small talk with the barber about fish or local happenings while the barber in his white smock whipped up a hot mug of Williams shaving soap into a high peak froth before dotting it all over their faces.  </li>
            <li> If you have a lot of facial hair and live in a dry enviroment like I do</li>
            <li> It leaves the skin soft, softens and loosens hair, and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin or leave you smelling \\&quot;soapy.\\</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other soaps and this is not only the least expensive, but it lathers perfectly every time.</li>
            <li> 5 stars for quality, minus one star as the small size and need for water lead to relatively quick replacements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>

            <li> Also, if you live in a big city you can probably find one of these in a drugstore for less than 2 dollars, I paid $1.13 for mine.</li>
            <li> Then I learned to submerge the brush and soap with hot water in the mug for at least five to ten minutes.</li>
            <li> I have been using the same cake for almost 6 months with a simple boar-hair brush and ceramic shaving cup, and I still have nearly half a cake left.</li>

            <li> Unlike excess shave gel which gets washed down the drain, excess shave soap suds can stay in the cup, where they will dry out (back into hard soap) only to be used the next time you shave.    </li>

            <li> I do need to reapply when I get near the end of shaving, but I think it&#x27;s because I go slow and take my time shaving.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This soap is very hard to lather and not the best for a beginner, it seems like a good soap for more experienced shavers</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this soap for over a year for shaving. Love it. Smells good and gives you great lather. I like it better than shaving gel.</li>
            <li> Willians Mug Shaving Soap can be gotten at most local pharmacies, so try looking around before you pay shipping. The product just broadcasts tradition, with no-nonsense packaging. You get a small (1.75oz) shaving puck in a simple cardboard pack, and that&#x27;s it. I&#x27;m just begining to learn \\&quot;real\\&quot; shaving with a shave soap, and I started out practicing my lathering technique using a disposable razor and a [[ASIN:B000G647Y8 Tweezerman Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my first effort, I hadn&#x27;t yet learned how Williams requires a little more hot water than most soaps. I still built up a lather to equal or beat anything I&#x27;ve ever gotten out of a can, although it wasn&#x27;t as fluffy as a good lather should be. The lather was thick, and smelled faintly of citronella and bar soap. My face was well-protected, and there was plenty of foam left for multiple lathers. The lather rinsed off cleanly and with no effort at all- a quick splash of water and there was no residue. My face felt a little dry and tight, but that could be my fault as I&#x27;m still learning. A quick splash of aftershave, and my girlfriend was delighted at the smoothness of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get the full experience, I&#x27;ve learned to follow an old technique and soak the puck in a mug full of steaming hot water along with my brush while I do my pre-shave prep. Pour out the mug into the rinse water, and then build lather on the softened puck. This leads to a shorter life for the pick, but since Williams is dirt-cheap, that&#x27;s not a big concern. Used with plenty of water, I&#x27;ve found that Williams fluffs up beautifully. The value is lessened a bit when you combine the small puck and the water-soak method, but you still get a lot of bang for your buck (almost literally).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to call Williams Mug Shaving Soap my starter soap. I got the closest shave of my life, and the bulk of the cutting and irritation that I got is surely my own fault. I was reviewing a new disposable during my initial shave on top of being unfamiliar with the method. My face feels fresher and cleaner than it has in a long time, and although I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll purchase more expensive soaps for special occasions, I can see Williams being my mainstay soap for a long time to come. It&#x27;s hard to believe there&#x27;s such a perfect soap for such a small price.

            <li> I picked up one of these at my local drugstore and it was probably the easiest shave i ever had. This was my first time shaving with a soap rather than a traditional shave products like the foams and the gels. The soap create some sort of barrier that allows the razor to effortlessly glide on your face without any resistance leaving you with no razor burn or irritation whatsoever. I should mention though that i used this with an old fashioned Merkur double edge razor, so I&#x27;m not quite sure what kind of results you will get with the commercial three blade 4 blade and 5 blade razors (I.E. mach3 and fusion, or the Schick quatro). There is no fancy smell, just a soap smell which I actually like, so if you&#x27;re into the smells then this probably won&#x27;t be a good soap, but you just want a great shave, you should definitely try this. Also, if you live in a big city you can probably find one of these in a drugstore for less than 2 dollars, I paid $1.13 for mine.</li>
            <li> For a shave Soap that states \\&quot;Lasting Lather\\&quot; I don&#x27;t see it.&lt;br /&gt;I bought several bars at one time &amp; it does not Lather good at all.</li>
            <li> I just got back to the basics and got a sturdy safety razor, mug and brush. The soap I got with the set was sub-par. I&#x27;ve used Williams in the past and eagerly awaited my trusty old friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said in the header, it never fails to lather up perfectly. I&#x27;ve tried other soaps and this is not only the least expensive, but it lathers perfectly every time.</li>
            <li> just a plain no nonsense product .lathers up nice...no perfume smell ..it is shipped with no fancy box or chain wrapped around it..just soap</li>
            <li> Good lather, great smell. Not the absolute best shaving soap you can get, but WAY better than the Van der Hagen crap. That stuff feels greasy, but this one almost makes me feel like I&#x27;m cleaning at the same time I&#x27;m shaving. WARNING : I have heard of some people being or becoming allergic to this. If you are highly sensitive to allergic ingredients or develop new allergies easily, I would avoid this, just in case.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be the voice of skepsis here to temper all of the &amp;#34;this is the greatest soap ever!&amp;#34; reviews.  I&#x27;ll admit, I was interested - this was among the inexpensive tallow-based soaps. I got mine from a local Discount Drug Mart for $1.29 plus tax. I also saw it at CVS for $1.49 and I understand it is found everywhere, so you&#x27;re really just paying for shipping here.  LATHER. The lather is &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ll admit, I haven&#x27;t tried many shaving soaps, but I use Proraso in a white tub (Green Tea/Oatmeal) and by comparison the Wilson puck only produced lather one would expect from a bar of regular bath soap. I use a badger-hair brush and a mug. It worked, but wasn&#x27;t as slick as Proraso. I shave with double-edge safety razors (Van Der Hagen and Merkur 37c SLANT) and occasionally straight edge, so I require a good protective lather. UPDATE 06/10/2015: I recently moved to where water is very soft and decided to try the soap again, to be fair. I got a rather wet loose lather, maybe need to load the brush even more. But the protection was nice and the shave was good and this being summer I even skipped balm and only used alum followed by witch hazel, no dryness. But the scent didn&#x27;t help with the smell of well water - instead of masking it, the scent mixed with it in an unpleasant way. Wasn&#x27;t terrible, but was &amp;#34;very&amp;#34; old-fashioned, like 1800&#x27;s farm old-fashioned :)  SCENT. The scent is not unpleasant to me, but really is flat. One-dimensional. If scents were like tones in music, this would be a kazoo or maybe the dial tone - a clear tone, but unremarkable. Sure, it&#x27;s &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; if you love citronella candles and the herb verbena, because that&#x27;s what it smells like, nothing else, no complexity. My Proraso, which costs a bit more, but still inexpensive per ounce, has a decidedly epicurean scent - you can&#x27;t exactly describe it, but many friends who tried it ended up ordering it too. In terms of music tones it&#x27;s more like a nice jazz chord on a guitar :) I&#x27;m surethere are even better scents out there.  I don&#x27;t consider it a loss, but I also don&#x27;t feel the need to sacrifice and use it. For someone on a REALLY tight budget it would probably be just fine. On the other hand, now that we&#x27;ve switched from cartridge razor ripoffs, we&#x27;re saving money, even if we buy super expensive soaps and frankly life is too short to use a cheap/flat shaving soap :)  For you tallow-based soap enthusiasts, please note that this soap only has sodium tallowate, not potassium tallowate. It looks like the better soaps mix the two. There is nothing &amp;#34;wrong&amp;#34; with this soap, but really, wet shaving is meant to be a guy&#x27;s &amp;#34;spa&amp;#34; pampering experience, an indulgence. You won&#x27;t find that here, although it won&#x27;t ruin your day. You know how they say &amp;#34;feel like a million bucks&amp;#34;? Well, with this soap you&#x27;ll feel like a buck-fitty :)</li>
            <li> I am just getting back into using shaving soap and Williams is working out very well for me.  You can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> The product does the job. The fragrance is not my favorite. Although the fragrance has a nice clean smell to it.</li>
            <li> never cut myself so many times shaving than i did when using this product. it&#x27;s literally as ineffective as using household handwashing soap bars. save yourself the dollar and the grief</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using good ole Williams Mug Shaving Soap since I was 15 and I&#x27;ve never found a product that works as well! Tried shaving foam a few times to my regret and tried a couple of other shaving soaps that just didn&#x27;t work as well. Williams is a fine product with a long history and my Dad and both my Grandpas used it before I did. The secret to using it is get you a nice badger hair brush and hold the brush under extremely hot running water till the bristles are soaked, then pinch out the excess water and a few swirls over a cake of Williams in your mug and you&#x27;ve got tons of rich lather! If you have a lot of facial hair and live in a dry enviroment like I do you might have to relather the area around your mouth once you&#x27;ve done your neck and cheeks before you shave that area. And a good little tip for shaving is to rinse your razor in very cold water since that contracts the steel in the blade or blades for a closer shave!&lt;br /&gt;As the title says, Williams is the best shavring soap ever! Nothing compares for price or quality!</li>
            <li> Only recently got into wet shaving initially it was a bit hard to get a decent lather but a while of looking at wet shaving forums and youtube and i was able to get an amazing lather which offered an excellent close shave as well.</li>
            <li> This is an OK shaving soap, but for about the same price you can get a puck of &amp;#34;Shaving Factory&amp;#34; soap. Which is re branded &amp;#34;Derby.&amp;#34; It lathers much easier and provides a creamier and slicker lather. I would also recommend trying &amp;#34;Arko&amp;#34; shaving soap.  It is also a better performer.</li>
            <li> excellent product with long history - stays moist for an extended period of time - also moistens the face</li>
            <li> Gust what i expected !!  I have been using this soap for years and its what i received.  It is good shaving soap !!</li>
            <li> Smells good, and works well</li>
            <li> I have been using Williams Shaving Soap for the last 6 months and to tell the truth I almost look forward to shaving in the morning!    Unlike the majority of canned shaving creams and gels, Williams has a nice clean scent without a lot of heavy perfumes which is one of the biggest perks for me. I don&#x27;t need Gillete or Barbasol to decide what I smell like all day.     The soap also lasts at least as long if not longer than any canned shaving gel I have ever used. I have been using the same cake for almost 6 months with a simple boar-hair brush and ceramic shaving cup, and I still have nearly half a cake left. I would be very surprised if this same cake didn&#x27;t last me through September, and I shave nearly every day. Not bad for something that costs only about one dollar! Unlike excess shave gel which gets washed down the drain, excess shave soap suds can stay in the cup, where they will dry out (back into hard soap) only to be used the next time you shave.    The soap builds into a rich lather when worked with a brush, and applying it to your face is smooth and very soothing to my skin, which tends to get irritated by most shaving creams.    I honestly cannot recommend this product enough. For such an inexpensive price, if you need to shave regularly you owe it to yourself to try this product out!</li>
            <li> shaving soap that smells good and lathers well.&lt;br /&gt;not the best.&lt;br /&gt;but good.&lt;br /&gt;it gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;can&#x27;t argue with the price.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;d say go for it.</li>
            <li> I loved it, my son to whom I gave it as a birthday gift loved it. Very stylish, affordable, and apparently easy to use.</li>
            <li> The shave soap was as described and in new boxes it is nice to find a honest sales point on the Internet.</li>
            <li> works great, no complaints</li>
            <li> Gotta say I was expecting something dramatically inferior, but it does the trick as beautifully as anything priced ten time as much. Better to be frugal!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call this the worst shave soap available to the general public, but it&#x27;s definitely in the bottom 25%    The lather produced by this product is unstable, breaks down very quickly, and it takes a lot of product to give a good amount of lather.    Williams soap was once a very good soap, unfortunately the product was re-formulated several times, the last reformulation being many many years ago.  The last reformulation (produced by Combs) is only a reflection of it&#x27;s former quality self.    Someone who hasn&#x27;t had much experience with shave soaps, and are using soaps like Colonel Conk, VDH &amp; many other \\&quot;glycerin\\&quot; soaps that are in actuality detergent based, might actually find this an OK product for their review here, however anyone who has experienced a thick, creamy, slick, cushioning lather from many other shave soaps available here on Amazon will find this product extremely lacking in most areas.    If you are new to wet shaving and brush/soap lathering, do yourself a favor, get a stick of Arko for less than a dollar, give the Arko [[ASIN:B002A5OLHQ Arko Shaving Soap Stick]] a try just to know what a good lather is like. Of course, there are many other soaps for more money that work nearly as well as Arko, but Arko is dirt-cheap and a top performer.  You won&#x27;t need to soak the soap before using, you won&#x27;t need to worry about foamy lather, you&#x27;ll just get a great shave.  Arko happens to very close to Williams in scent too, if you happen to like the scent of Williams.</li>
            <li> First off I should mention, if you are just starting to straight razor shave, this is the product for you.  It leaves the skin soft, softens and loosens hair, and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin or leave you smelling \\&quot;soapy.\\&quot; This is the best damn shaving soap on the market, I use it every day, and it makes me look forward to shaving.  Try boiling some water, then filling a mug about 3/4 of the way, soaking your brush in it, then pour out about half of it, rub your brush on the soap, vigorously, then make a nice lather in the mug.  Takes some experience and elbow grease to get the right consistency for the lather, but once you get it right, you&#x27;ll want to shave for hours.</li>
            <li> Wiilliams is one of the long time, well known, most inexpensive American shaving soaps on the market.  It&#x27;s got a pleasant citronella aroma -- if you like citronella, which reminds me of summer anti-mosquito candles and soaps you&#x27;d use while camping.  Generates a good lather.</li>
            <li> one of our better buys, we&#x27;d do it again if the opportunity presented itself; we&#x27;re very satisfied with the product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned how to lather and that really helps! I also use a Parker badger brush and get great results...I lather on my face. I soak my soap and brush with hot water in the shaving mug while I take a shower. I drain the water and...big secret here...add 5-8 drops of liquid glycerine, either on the brush or on top of the puck and start blathering in the bowl. When my brush \\&quot;loads\\&quot; up I start swirling it on my face to continue building. The glycerine is inexpensive and helps my razor glide over my skin...and also keeps the layer from drying on my face. I get more than enough lather to do 4 complete passes.</li>
            <li> An inexpensive shaving soap that works ok.  It lathered ok, kinda on the weak side, but wasn&#x27;t full of perfume or flowery smells.  I liked it ok, but will probably not order again.  It&#x27;s a plain shave soap.</li>
            <li> It is cheap and lathers well.  I&#x27;ve read that others think it smells bad.  It smells like soap.  Not bad unless you don&#x27;t like the smell of soap, and not a strong scented soap at that.  Just my opinion.</li>
            <li> the smell is really strong and definitely not for everyone... its not too hard to lather up, easier than vdh or any soap for this price...</li>
            <li> Meijers no longer carries this shaving soap.  I don&#x27;t want to use a metal and plastic can filled with aerosol to shave my face. So glad to find it on line. I like it better than that clear orange soap that they sell it bites the face a bit, this is mild.</li>
            <li> I went to the mail box and I could smell the wonderful fragrance from this soap through the packaging.That old time smell...&lt;br /&gt;Cannot wait to use shaving soap ....will order some more.Packaged very very well...</li>
            <li> Best way there is to shave...can that old electric razor in favor of a GOOD MUG SOAP and then chose the razor of your choice...</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I wanted to try shaving with a mug and brush. At first, I didn&#x27;t know how to make lather. I just got my brush wet and circled the soap inside a mug. Then I painted my face to shave. Then I learned to submerge the brush and soap with hot water in the mug for at least five to ten minutes. Then I drained out the water, make circles with my brush over the soap a few times, then holding the brush with my right hand, made circles with the brush into my left hand to make lather. After about 20 seconds, I apply the brush to my face. It seems every time I use Williams, my face is irritated for the rest of the day. I apply a preshave before I apply Williams and I still have irritated skin. My skin is sensitive so prepping the skin is important. It didn&#x27;t seem to matter. Close shave, with irritation. I like Proraso Shaving Cream much better.</li>
            <li> I AM 83 YEARS OLD,BEEN USING WILLIAMS SHAVING SOAP FOR AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER.AS FOR ME THERE IS NO OTHER SHAVING SOAP THET COMES CLOSE TO WILIAMS SHAVING SOAP IT IS #1.</li>
            <li> Not much to say due to every one else has already said.  Lathers good, smells like dial soap which is nice.  It fits very well in a regular coffee cup which I like due to the shaving mugs are  over priced. And most of your shaving mugs are nothing more than a coffee mug.</li>
            <li> Works good when you figure out how much water you need to add to get it to lather, too little and you don&#x27;t get a good lather, too much water and it drips all over. I do need to reapply when I get near the end of shaving, but I think it&#x27;s because I go slow and take my time shaving. I did find this product after purchasing on Walgreen&#x27;s website for $1.49 though.</li>
            <li> The scent of Williams shaving soap conjures memories of going to the barbershop with my Dad back in the 60’s; there were 4 or 5 chairs lined up in a row each having a razor strop used to hone the strait blades to a surgical edge.  The men would lay back in the green trimmed leather barber’s chairs with hot towels wrapped on their faces,  an occasional toot of steam came up as they made small talk with the barber about fish or local happenings while the barber in his white smock whipped up a hot mug of Williams shaving soap into a high peak froth before dotting it all over their faces.  I didn&#x27;t shave my face then but after the barber cut my hair he&#x27;d spread hot lather and shave above my ears and the back of my neck and I&#x27;d smell it all day; it is just one of those subtle but pleasant aromas that makes you feel good.</li>
            <li> I bought some shaving soap from a local soap shop that was closing, never did figure out how to use it right. Bought this after seeing a review that said &amp;#34;BEEN USING THIS FOR 83 YEARS.&amp;#34; I figured that was a good enough endorsement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using this, wet your brush, flick it twice, start working a lather and then rinse your brush slightly, flick it twice again and then work the lather that you will use on your face. I like to then work the lather as I apply the soap to my face. I only do half of my face at a time. As far as the smell, I don&#x27;t notice it anymore - it definitely doesn&#x27;t hang around.</li>
            <li> It lathered well.  But, it smells like mosquito bug repellent.  Horrid horrid smell.</li>
