            <li>this is some good stuff!</li>
            <li>Based on Alterna&#x27;s reputation, I knew this had to be a great product</li>
            <li>It worked great.</li>
            <li>However I use the alterna shampoo and conditioner and was happy with both products.</li>
            <li>This masque is amazing!</li>
            <li>this stuff is nice!</li>
            <li>Perfect product with nice aroma and the packaging is also very elegant.</li>

            <li>Alterna 10 line smells like Marc Jacobs for the hair, my clients tell me I smell so good</li>
            <li>Good hair masque.....</li>
            <li>My research found that it most people who used it, loved it!</li>
            <li>I am super impressed...</li>
            <li>My Family has used many Alterna Hair Products,most all we have used worked great</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>used my Alterna 10 masque in conjunction with a steam treatment and when I washed it out, my hair felt moisturized and healthy!</li>
            <li>but i LOVE it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>The product is very nice and easy to use.</li>
            <li>did leave this on for about 15 minutes and the end results were amazing .No</li>
            <li>I use this masque about once a week and leave it in underneath a warm towel for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>very happy, fast delivery</li>
            <li>After a week of use my hair look more brilliant and most important - stronger.</li>
            <li>Alterna 10 masque is good not heavy not greasy just a great moisturizing conditioner.</li>
            <li>And one more tip (you&#x27;ll actually find it on the instructions,that comes with the product): after you apply the masque on the hair, wrap it with the warm towel and let it sit for 10-15 min for the best result!</li>
            <li>This product worked fine but on my hair was nothing spectacular, not for the price.  </li>
            <li>Thank you very much!!!</li>
            <li>Love how it leaves my hair and love the smell</li>
            <li>and I just love this Masque.</li>
            <li>I looked for it only for about $30 each and was very happy.</li>
            <li>I just dyed my hair brunette and was wanting something to make it look healthy.</li>
            <li>I have used Alterna Caviar products for the better part of 5 years and a fan for life.</li>
            <li>,hair had a nice smooth shine.</li>
            <li>Very impressed, and after three jars, intend to make this a regular in my bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am overall very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>I love both products</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Alterna Ten Hair Masque is the best masque on the market.  </li>
            <li>This product takes some time to develop and doesn&#x27;t produce more noticeable results.</li>
            <li>For me, it did not do anything memorable.</li>
            <li>Alterna has the most outstanding products in the market.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the great product.</li>
            <li>The best product I ever  used I have bleached white hair</li>
            <li>This may not matter to many, however, if you have an allergy to Gluten</li>
            <li>Iv used a lot of high end luxury brand hair products, I used the Nano works line for over a year, and None of them have performed as good as this masque.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this amazing product to absolutely all hair types.</li>
            <li>It feels like my split end are filled and smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so rich, you don&#x27;t need to use alot.</li>
            <li>It is pricey, but worth every penny!  </li>
            <li>was looking for a good hair masque to give me a deep conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li>It really helps my highlighted hair stay healthy.</li>
            <li>I love it so much and get it quickly.</li>
            <li>This has really has made a huge change in my Daughters Hair as well as mine ,the first use i was happy how our Hair looked like we just left the Hair Dresser .I</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say don&#x27;t buy it, might be worth a try once.  </li>
            <li>I have only used it once so far, as i just got it today; but good googly moogly</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just my hair;-)</li>
            <li>The masque arrived first</li>
            <li>and I used it the first time without the matching shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Did you know that Gluten is found in many different products that you use every day???</li>
            <li>Alterna 10 is an absolute 11!</li>
            <li>but i have to say this Science of Ten is by far the best Hair Masque of all the other Alterna Masques.</li>
            <li>Actually I think it would be fair to refund the money back to my credit card for this purchase, but i do not have so mch time to deal with it</li>
            <li>I have used Alterna products in the past and have always had very good results...for this reason, and this reason only, I was willing to fork out the money to try the 10 line (shampoo, conditioner and masque).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been happy with other Alterna products, so I figured I&#x27;d try their deep conditioning masque - and it doesn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li>This mask has many extracts and oils that heal dry hair.  </li>
            <li>because I really like the really bright reds and they are hard to keep.</li>
            <li>I plan on using this along with a Vitamin Shampoo that i use and would recommend this to anyone looking for a fast way to repair your Hair from damage and split ends.</li>
            <li>I have used it twice now and really like this.</li>
            <li>This gives my hair about the same appearance and feel that the conditioner did, which means it makes it silky smooth and resistant to frizz.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The absolute thickest conditioner product I have ever seen, in or out of a saloon.</li>
            <li>I had originally bought the regular alterna 10 conditioner in a store here for $60.</li>
            <li>As a result, my hair was becoming very dry.</li>
            <li>I have tried numerous deep conditioning masks and this is one of the better ones on the market.</li>
            <li>more like a deep mask you only needed once a week or every two weeks.</li>
            <li>I am very aware of what ingredients actually benefit the hair and which ones just \\&quot;cover up\\&quot; the look dry/damaged hair.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this mask.</li>
            <li>This one thrilled me least.</li>
            <li>I do have friends with &#x27;normal&#x27; hair who say it makes their hair baby soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair, although not terribly damaged, does run dry and frequently lacks luster because of my age (44), grey content (a whole lot) and chemical enhancement.</li>
            <li>I live in Phx where there is no moisture in the air</li>
            <li>Also my hair feels so soft!</li>
            <li>I was reluctant to buy this product because its more money than I would usually spend on a conditioning masque.</li>
            <li>After one use my hair was shiny, bouncy and soft!  </li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>With my hair being low porosity, I need a good deep conditioner and usually use it with steam.</li>
            <li>The only improvement they could make on this product is its fragrance which is not terrible but in my opinion is just a bit odd.</li>
            <li>This stuff made my hair so soft and felt like silk.</li>
            <li>Alterna is one of the very few companies who&#x27;s entire product line is Gluten Free!  </li>
            <li>It is not all natural, but it does have several natural and quality extracts that are beneficial to the hair.  </li>
            <li>It definitely makes my hair very soft and silky.</li>
            <li>so any product that can make my hair soft is nothing short of a miracle.  </li>
            <li>It is not certainly dry anymore.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s hard to get white but even harder to keep  healthy</li>
            <li>The tiny jar hardly seems worth the money online</li>
    </ol>

            <li> jar was actually without the protecting paper... and the mask has partially leaked away.</li>
            <li> I had used the Alterna Ten shampoo and regular conditioner previously.  </li>
            <li> Frizz or dry ends</li>
            <li> My hair was dry, brittle and breaking.</li>
            <li> If you are having a problem with dry, breaking hair.</li>
            <li> I have dry and frizzy hair</li>
            <li> I only used a little.</li>
            <li> You only need a little and at the cost for this product.</li>
            <li> It should only take a little.</li>
            <li> A small bit applied to my hair transforms it from the consistency of steel wool to normal, without the heavy</li>
            <li> I have waste long dry hair.</li>
            <li> A little will go a long way.</li>
            <li> I am a hair product snob I have long thick wavy hair that i curl, blow dry and abuse.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick, coarse hair</li>
            <li> The only bad thing was that it cost so much.</li>
            <li> but I have very thick short hair</li>
            <li> extract just to name a few.  </li>
            <li> It was thick and creamy.</li>
            <li> but they are SOOO expensive.  </li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed!!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Love how it leaves my hair and love the smell</li>
            <li> This is the best Masque out there! I am African American and I just love this Masque. It&#x27;s so rich, you don&#x27;t need to use alot. Based on Alterna&#x27;s reputation, I knew this had to be a great product and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed!!</li>
            <li> I was impressed by all reviews that I found about this product online. So decided to try I was NOT dissapointed at all.After a week of use my hair look more brilliant and most important - stronger.I would recommend this amazing product to absolutely all hair types.And one more tip (you&#x27;ll actually find it on the instructions,that comes with the product): after you apply the masque on the hair, wrap it with the warm towel and let it sit for 10-15 min for the best result!</li>
            <li> Good product. Excellent Job.</li>
            <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jar was actually without the protecting paper... and the mask has partially leaked away. Actually I think it would be fair to refund the money back to my credit card for this purchase, but i do not have so mch time to deal with it (talk with the seller, return the purchase etc)... but it is last time I order through them..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best Regards,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anna</li>
            <li> I had originally bought the regular alterna 10 conditioner in a store here for $60. It worked great. The only bad thing was that it cost so much. Then I read that there was a conditioning mask and I was looking for it in all the stores and hair salons since they didn&#x27;t have it in the store I purchased the regular conditioner. I looked for it only for about $30 each and was very happy. I bought two. It felt like forever in waiting and receiving them. But when I used it I was so impressed. I just dyed my hair brunette and was wanting something to make it look healthy. This did it! It feels like my split end are filled and smooth. Also my hair feels so soft! I love it!</li>
            <li> Let me begin by stating my hair type: low porosity, relaxed, no color, arm-pit length. With my hair being low porosity, I need a good deep conditioner and usually use it with steam. I have used Alterna Caviar products for the better part of 5 years and a fan for life. I have tried others, but Alterna is the best for my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a good hair masque to give me a deep conditioning treatment. I do these every week, as I need moisture in my hair at all times! I read some not-so-good reviews about the Alterna Caviar masque, so I decided to research the Alterna 10 one. My research found that it most people who used it, loved it! And now, I am no exception!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used my Alterna 10 masque in conjunction with a steam treatment and when I washed it out, my hair felt moisturized and healthy! Even two days later, my hair has this shine and moisturized feeling! I will be using this masque for the immediate future! Price be darned ... this is some good stuff! A little will go a long way. I plan on using this every week for about a month and then tapering off to about every two weeks!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for moisture-infused hair ... this product will be an excellent jump start!</li>
            <li> My Family has used many Alterna Hair Products,most all we have used worked great but i have to say this Science of Ten is by far the best Hair Masque of all the other Alterna Masques.This has really has made a huge change in my Daughters Hair as well as mine ,the first use i was happy how our Hair looked like we just left the Hair Dresser .I did leave this on for about 15 minutes and the end results were amazing .No Frizz or dry ends ,hair had a nice smooth shine.I plan on using this along with a Vitamin Shampoo that i use and would recommend this to anyone looking for a fast way to repair your Hair from damage and split ends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been happy with other Alterna products, so I figured I&#x27;d try their deep conditioning masque - and it doesn&#x27;t disappoint. A small bit applied to my hair transforms it from the consistency of steel wool to normal, without the heavy, weighed-down feeling you sometimes get. Very impressed, and after three jars, intend to make this a regular in my bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I am a hair product snob I have long thick wavy hair that i curl, blow dry and abuse. I live in Phx where there is no moisture in the air so deep conditioning is a must once a week. Alterna 10 masque is good not heavy not greasy just a great moisturizing conditioner. some dont&#x27;t like the smell but i LOVE it! Alterna 10 line smells like Marc Jacobs for the hair, my clients tell me I smell so good and it&#x27;s just my hair;-)</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous deep conditioning masks and this is one of the better ones on the market. I have waste long dry hair. I was weary that it would not be moisturizing enough because it says it&#x27;s for all hair types.  However, I did find it moisturizing.  It is not all natural, but it does have several natural and quality extracts that are beneficial to the hair.  I am very aware of what ingredients actually benefit the hair and which ones just \\&quot;cover up\\&quot; the look dry/damaged hair.  This mask has many extracts and oils that heal dry hair.  Such ingredients include cassia leaf extract, carrot root extract, evening primrose extract, rosemary, algae extract, nettle, grape seed oil, and arnica extract just to name a few.  It also contains silk amino acids and lipids for both strength and moisture.  It also smells divine like flowers, but it is not overpowering.  I highly recommend this mask.</li>
            <li> I tried the Alterna Hair Masque. I only used a little. This stuff made my hair so soft and felt like silk. It was thick and creamy. You only need a little and at the cost for this product. It should only take a little. My hair was dry, brittle and breaking. After using this only one time. I notice a big difference. I have used it twice now and really like this. I will definitely buy again. If you are having a problem with dry, breaking hair. You should try this out. It&#x27;s like giving my hair a spa day!</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to buy this product because its more money than I would usually spend on a conditioning masque. However I use the alterna shampoo and conditioner and was happy with both products. I color my hair a lot (like every month or so) because I really like the really bright reds and they are hard to keep. As a result, my hair was becoming very dry. I use this masque about once a week and leave it in underneath a warm towel for about 5 minutes. It definitely makes my hair very soft and silky. The tiny jar hardly seems worth the money online but I have very thick short hair and I use only a dime size amount so the jar is going to last me quite a while. I am overall very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I had used the Alterna Ten shampoo and regular conditioner previously.  I love both products but they are SOOO expensive.  This gives my hair about the same appearance and feel that the conditioner did, which means it makes it silky smooth and resistant to frizz.</li>
            <li> I have used Alterna products in the past and have always had very good results...for this reason, and this reason only, I was willing to fork out the money to try the 10 line (shampoo, conditioner and masque).  The masque arrived first and I used it the first time without the matching shampoo and conditioner. My hair, although not terribly damaged, does run dry and frequently lacks luster because of my age (44), grey content (a whole lot) and chemical enhancement. After one use my hair was shiny, bouncy and soft!  I am super impressed...for once a product actually exceeded my expectations...by a mile.... The only improvement they could make on this product is its fragrance which is not terrible but in my opinion is just a bit odd.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I am african american and my hair is chemically relaxed. This product works well on my hair.</li>
            <li> very happy, fast delivery</li>
            <li> Good hair masque.....I like it very much.&lt;br /&gt;without this hair masque I don&#x27;t know what to do to my hair.</li>
            <li> Alterna Ten Hair Masque is the best masque on the market.  It is pricey, but worth every penny!  It does what it claims, has excellent ingredients and repairs damaged hair.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Iv used a lot of high end luxury brand hair products, I used the Nano works line for over a year, and None of them have performed as good as this masque. I have only used it once so far, as i just got it today; but good googly moogly this stuff is nice! One application yielded the same results as a $25 dollar keratin treatment. The absolute thickest conditioner product I have ever seen, in or out of a saloon. Just get it, sell plasma if you have to. This stuff is like crack for your hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent conditioner. more like a deep mask you only needed once a week or every two weeks.</li>
            <li> The product is very nice and easy to use. I love it so much and get it quickly. Recommend to buy it.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much!!!</li>
            <li> This product didnt do it for me. I used it a couple of times and now its collecting dust in my drawer. I have dry and frizzy hair so I need products that can help me...pass!</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve tried all the Caviar products.  This one thrilled me least. The time factor became a problem because I want to finish all my hair care in the shower.  This product takes some time to develop and doesn&#x27;t produce more noticeable results.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick, coarse hair so any product that can make my hair soft is nothing short of a miracle.  This product worked fine but on my hair was nothing spectacular, not for the price.  I do have friends with &#x27;normal&#x27; hair who say it makes their hair baby soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say don&#x27;t buy it, might be worth a try once.  For me, it did not do anything memorable.</li>
            <li> Alterna has the most outstanding products in the market. Alterna has totally changed and improved my hair. It is not certainly dry anymore.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair mask in my opinion. Perfect product with nice aroma and the packaging is also very elegant. Thanks for the great product.</li>
            <li> The best product I ever  used I have bleached white hair it&#x27;s hard to get white but even harder to keep  healthy this stuff helps a lot well wort the money!</li>
            <li> Ottimo prezzo veloce spedizione</li>
            <li> WOW!  Did you know that Gluten is found in many different products that you use every day??? This may not matter to many, however, if you have an allergy to Gluten like I do, this information is of mega importance!  Alterna is one of the very few companies who&#x27;s entire product line is Gluten Free!  I started using their line and stopped using another line that contained gluten (unbeknownst to me) and guess what - My hair started growing like a weed!!!  This masque is amazing! Alterna 10 is an absolute 11!</li>
            <li> Love it! It really helps my highlighted hair stay healthy.</li>
