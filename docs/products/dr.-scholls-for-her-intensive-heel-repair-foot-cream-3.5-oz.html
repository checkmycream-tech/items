            <li>it&#x27;s good for the moment and must apply every day!!</li>
            <li>best one.  </li>
            <li>crema.&lt;br /&gt;the seller is perfect.  </li>
            <li>was excellent</li>
            <li>for the price it is a good product!</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Cream is good - however, if you stop one time skin needs re-application of cream -</li>
            <li>My heels never looked so good...</li>
            <li>Is one of the best for your foot it made my feet soft and it super great  </li>
            <li>Try it!  :)</li>
            <li>i just love to using it,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>need to order more for this fantastik</li>
            <li>I really love this heel repair cream....</li>
            <li>I think someone who is not particular in the texture would like this best.  </li>
            <li>This product is great for keeping heels soft and moist.  </li>
            <li>Really do like this ...helped my feet repair and feel and look good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with how soft both my heels and elbows have been since I started using this cream a couple of months ago.</li>
            <li>Later in the day I noticed my hands/cuticles were still moist and looking good.</li>
            <li>Wow what a great product it made my 60 year old feet feel like they felt when I was 20..</li>
            <li>will tell all my friend to buy this with the super price and shipment</li>
            <li>I apply about a pea-size amount to each foot, concentrating on the heel, and surprisingly that pea-size amount is enough to spread over my whole foot and keep my skin in tip-top condition.  </li>
            <li>I keep Dr. Scholls products in my personal item inventory and have a nice assortment.</li>
            <li>oh and it does work on the feet/heels - smile</li>
            <li>When the price is right, I purchase.</li>
            <li>Fast &amp; Right !</li>
            <li>Make sure you exfoliate with one of those huge foot files first, removing the rough skin.  </li>
            <li>Used this every night before bed (wear socks so you don&#x27;t get the foot cream on your sheets) and after a couple weeks my heels were healed ;)</li>
            <li>The first day I put this cream on my feet</li>
            <li>After trying many foot creams over many years, I finally found one that helps by dry heels.</li>
            <li>Then, you can maintain healthy feet with very infrequent exfoliation after that (2-3x/year), as long as you apply this stuff to your feet after each shower or foot wash.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It works, but you will have to give it a couple of days/ weeks to really kick in!&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Very long lasting and great for the hands after dishwashing or any other hands in the water activity like gardening.</li>
            <li>Surprised to find out this truly works.</li>

            <li> Surprised to find out this truly works.</li>
            <li> I live in the desert and my heels had never undergone such a brutal change from proper moisture to rough dry scaling and chipping.&lt;br /&gt;After using a pumice stone on my once beautiful feet, I drench them with this stuff and manage the smoothness a lot longer now.</li>
            <li> It works well if you use it for a long time.</li>
            <li> This is the stuff I have been waiting for to fix my dry, cracked heels.  </li>
            <li> for my dry cuticles.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cure the problem of dry feet, one i stop using it</li>
            <li> my heels get badly dry again, that happens with any cream.</li>
            <li> I had long bleeding cracks in my heels and they seem to be gone after only a few days.</li>
            <li> along with some heavy daily exfoliation.</li>
            <li> i always have dry heels, think it&#x27;s in the family genes!!  </li>
            <li> i got this cream before the due date,  .</li>
            <li> The results for me were not unlike any other foot cream.</li>
            <li> So I keep the tube in my pocketbook and use just a little every time  </li>
            <li> I first used this Dr. Scholl&#x27;s product when I had terrible callus&#x27; that were starting to split (I was doing a lot of  walking in sandals).</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores so easier to order thru Amazon.</li>
            <li> My heels are badly cracked so, this intensive cream is just what I neededl.</li>

            <li> Really do like this ...helped my feet repair and feel and look good&lt;br /&gt;Dr.  Scholl does it again and again!</li>
            <li> Keeps my feet from splitting and cracking with dryness in the winter.  After trying many foot creams over many years, I finally found one that helps by dry heels.</li>
            <li> Fast &amp; Right ! What I Like ! Thanks</li>
            <li> It seems to be working...along with some heavy daily exfoliation. I had long bleeding cracks in my heels and they seem to be gone after only a few days.</li>
            <li> Wow what a great product it made my 60 year old feet feel like they felt when I was 20..you got to try it to believe it</li>
            <li> This is the stuff I have been waiting for to fix my dry, cracked heels.  Make sure you exfoliate with one of those huge foot files first, removing the rough skin.  (You can get those at Body Shop.)  Then, you can maintain healthy feet with very infrequent exfoliation after that (2-3x/year), as long as you apply this stuff to your feet after each shower or foot wash.  I apply about a pea-size amount to each foot, concentrating on the heel, and surprisingly that pea-size amount is enough to spread over my whole foot and keep my skin in tip-top condition.  Try it!  :)</li>
            <li> I first used this Dr. Scholl&#x27;s product when I had terrible callus&#x27; that were starting to split (I was doing a lot of  walking in sandals).

            <li> Cream is good - however, if you stop one time skin needs re-application of cream - it&#x27;s good for the moment and must apply every day!!</li>
            <li> i got this cream before the due date,  . i just love to using it,&lt;br /&gt;and the price? best one.  need to order more for this fantastik crema.&lt;br /&gt;the seller is perfect.  thank you: IRENE</li>
            <li> It works, but you will have to give it a couple of days/ weeks to really kick in!&lt;br /&gt;But for the price it is a good product!</li>
            <li> This foot lotion is creamy and vaseline-like at the same time.  I think someone who is not particular in the texture would like this best.  The results for me were not unlike any other foot cream.</li>
            <li> Have used this foot cream before. It works well if you use it for a long time.</li>
            <li> I keep Dr. Scholls products in my personal item inventory and have a nice assortment. When the price is right, I purchase. With this product I noticed my hands before my feet. I have purchased all kinds of oils, sally hensen products, shea butter etc. for my dry cuticles. The first day I put this cream on my feet I rubbed the excess on my hands. Later in the day I noticed my hands/cuticles were still moist and looking good. So I keep the tube in my pocketbook and use just a little every time  I wash my hands. oh and it does work on the feet/heels - smile</li>
            <li> Bought this locally at a close-out. I like the thickness of this but use it on my hands instead of the heels as it is made for. Very long lasting and great for the hands after dishwashing or any other hands in the water activity like gardening. Great product.</li>
            <li> Surprised to find out this truly works. I live in the desert and my heels had never undergone such a brutal change from proper moisture to rough dry scaling and chipping.&lt;br /&gt;After using a pumice stone on my once beautiful feet, I drench them with this stuff and manage the smoothness a lot longer now.</li>
            <li> i always have dry heels, think it&#x27;s in the family genes!!  I used this stuff once and it made a difference. I put in on at night time and have a sock on for couple hours to give it chance to soak in.  It doesn&#x27;t cure the problem of dry feet, one i stop using it my heels get badly dry again, that happens with any cream. I&#x27;ve tried alot if creams and this does work, yay!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with how soft both my heels and elbows have been since I started using this cream a couple of months ago.</li>
            <li> I really love this heel repair cream....I can not go a day without using it...My heels never looked so good...</li>
            <li> Is one of the best for your foot it made my feet soft and it super great  thank  will tell all my friend to buy this with the super price and shipment was excellent</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week and it is starting to make a difference.  My heels are badly cracked so, this intensive cream is just what I neededl.</li>
            <li> This product is great for keeping heels soft and moist.  Hard to find in stores so easier to order thru Amazon.</li>
