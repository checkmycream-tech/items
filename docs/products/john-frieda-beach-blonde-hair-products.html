    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It smells wonderful!</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m clueless as to how to best use.</li>
            <li>Smell is not obnoxious, somewhat tropical, and works great!</li>
            <li>Best of all, the wave lasted all day.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with the results!!</li>
            <li>It smells great too!!</li>
            <li>-- It gives me that perfect &amp;#34;bed/sex hair&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>After it air dries, it looks like perfect beach waves.</li>
            <li>This is not the best one I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>And this product does an excellent job of replicating it.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll wake up with perfect bedhead!</li>

            <li>This really is a great &amp;#</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t any drying out or stiffening of my hair, which is great.</li>
            <li>It does not smell too great either.</li>
            <li>I was so happy when they re-released it.</li>
            <li>Excellent styling mist gives hair very nice shine kind of makes it</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this!!</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>I was impressed that my hair didn&#x27;t look greasy afterwards, since many products have that effect on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product gives your hair a nice beachy wave and makes your hair even lighter and look shiny!</li>
            <li>The best stuff on Earth! :)</li>
            <li>This spray is wonderful, I feel no need to spend more money on the Bumble and Bumble brand.</li>
            <li>I love the way my hair looks after applying and it has a great scent!</li>
            <li>It does nothing good for my hair.</li>
            <li>Good.</li>
            <li>But a light misting makes my hair look awesome.</li>
            <li>If so then I will update my post just to be fair.</li>
            <li>Works but not as good as cheaper supermarket brands like Fructis.  </li>
            <li>Also a good price.</li>
            <li>Just give your hair a good shake</li>
            <li>Good product though if you are at the beach and want your hair to have that look.</li>
            <li>I never found any replacement to be as good as this stuff</li>
            <li>And my hair has beautiful beachy waves that look really healthy.  </li>
            <li>I was very satisfied with John Freida Sea Spray.  </li>
            <li>Love this!  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what it claims and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on my hair with this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>the light coconut scent is great.</li>
            <li>Amazing product</li>
            <li>I honestly think it didn&#x27;t do any changes to my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair looked nice.</li>
            <li>As it dries I get some really nice waves.  </li>
            <li>The product also smells really nice too, which is a bonus.</li>
            <li>This one however makes my hair nice and wavy</li>
            <li>This spray has a nice beach-y (coconut) smell that adds to the illusion that the waves were created during a day at the beach.  </li>
            <li>what this way when I ordered it, (I thought it was some kind of spray on styling gel?)</li>
            <li>Smells nice and works well.</li>
            <li>Nice, summery scent and holds waves well.  </li>
            <li>After washing, spraying, scrunching and air-drying, my hair is honestly enviable, a claim I even hesitate to make anonymously.</li>
            <li>My daughter is beyond thrilled with the results on her hair.  </li>
            <li>Smells really great (kind of coconut-y), makes my hair look really good after a fresh shampoo, and helps create really nice waves.</li>
            <li>Super cool I love it!!!</li>
            <li>Wow, this stuff is seriously amazing!!!</li>
            <li>The greatest for a natural, wavy look.</li>
            <li>This has a very strong beachy smell which at first smells great</li>
            <li>Does a nice job at adding texture to my fine hair.</li>
            <li>Gives me those beach waved hair that I love</li>
            <li>It brings out a nice wave in my hair, and I have proudly lied and said it was my natural hair, which none of my friends have ever seen.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the smell of this stuff.</li>
            <li>(I did not believe it to be too chemically or overwhelming).</li>
            <li>Not in love.</li>
            <li>SO glad John Frieda brought back this amazing product!!!</li>
            <li>I could have been OK with that, if the style had been presentable, but it wasn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Glad to finally be able to get this again.</li>
            <li>I feel like my hair looks great when I use it for straight or wavy.</li>
            <li>I can safely say that I am satisfied with the results and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no wonder it returned after being discontinued for a while :)</li>
            <li>I love this spray.</li>
            <li>I am able to prolong my hair styles by using this spray.</li>
            <li>I love John Frieda, and have used the frizz ease products for years.</li>
            <li>However, sometimes I don&#x27;t have time for that routine and that&#x27;s when I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Perfect beachy curls/waves that last without frizzing.</li>
            <li>I have short hair so this is perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t get better than that.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li>My hair does have some more texture.</li>
            <li>It ended up being more of a texturizing/volumizing spray.</li>
            <li>My wife says it&#x27;s an OK product.</li>
            <li>I love this product a lot :-).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been notice more split ends...</li>
            <li>It is just okay.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t love it.  </li>
            <li>I sprayed the John Frieda Beach Blonde Sea Waves liberally over my hair and was not overly impressed.  </li>
            <li>I found the smell to be a bit overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>Or even better, wash your hair, and go to sleep.</li>
            <li>love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>This is an okay product.  </li>
            <li>My daughter and I have both enjoyed using this product.  </li>
            <li>my hair would have stayed better with the curlers/curling iron alone.  </li>
            <li>She is getting more of a wavy effect than I am which is probably because her hair is longer.  </li>
            <li>We will return for more when this bottle is gone.  </li>
            <li>This is the best hair styler of my long life!</li>
            <li>product does have a strong but appealing coconut smell.  </li>
            <li>It took me a few applications to figure out how best to apply and if I even liked the product.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect fix for my flat, fine, glassy hair.</li>
            <li>This would be great if you already have naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>I do get texture, and great smelling hair, but there&#x27;s no mermaid action going on here.</li>
            <li>It arrived very quickly, and I use it every day.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, and not sticky.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
            <li>The results are that wavy full sexy look.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone, it is not sticky, not heavy and has wonderful scent.</li>
            <li>It gives definition and body to my fine curls.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s fine and frizzy.</li>
            <li>My shoulder length hair is fine and it did not appear wavy at all after using this product.  </li>
            <li>Soft and super great smelling.  </li>
            <li>It has a light, coconut-smell that does remind you of the beach.</li>
            <li>So happy they brought this back.</li>
            <li>How can I say this where I don&#x27;t sound too provocative?</li>
            <li>It gave my hair a great deal of body even after I use it several days in a row.  </li>
            <li>But at 61 the look doesn&#x27;t fit.  </li>
            <li>that I wasn&#x27;t going to enjoy this product from here on out.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pleased to announce that it was a success when using it in this manner.  </li>
            <li>Was so happy to see this come back on the market.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with it overall.</li>
            <li>First of all, the smell is wonderful; a very light coconut that doesn&#x27;t heavily linger like suntan oil.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell anywhere near as good as the original</li>
            <li>Btw, I have super fine straight blonde hair and my hair looked amazing all day!!!</li>
            <li>I have originally curly hair</li>
            <li>Nothing like the feel or smell of the original.</li>
            <li>It did not perform anything like the original.</li>
            <li>that Sedu makes a sea salt spray that is like the original John Frieda</li>
            <li>I wish this was like the original, but it isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>Nothing like original.</li>
            <li>makes one that you shake to mix like the original ocean waves.  </li>
            <li>It smells and works like the original.  </li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t work as well as the original.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been loving the combination, and will hope to be able to add this product on a daily basis, assuming it is eventually stocked.</li>
            <li>And because the product is kind of like a hair spray, I was able to keep my hair wavy but not frizzy for much longer than would have normally been possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didnt notice anything special about this product.</li>
            <li>daughter loves this spray, she says it reminds her of Myrtle Beach, and she&#x27;s right!</li>
            <li>Ok, it might not be exactly the same as the original beach blonde spray, but it&#x27;s still awesome.</li>
            <li>John Frieda makes products which are super unique and special.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li>I get really nice wavy body that everyone at work has complimented and it is pretty much wash and go.  </li>
            <li>Sea Waves is a nice product that I would recommend if you want a naturally wavy/curly look.    </li>
            <li>Loved this back in the day!</li>
            <li>This adds a nice hold to the my shorter hair, while still allowing a natural look.</li>
            <li>I used one of these beachy waves sea salt product several years ago and loved it.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this product, but I can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Not like the old one - I loved the original Sea Waves Sea Salt Spray SO much.  </li>
            <li>On the dry hair though I just sprayed and scrunched and t looked amazing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d simply waste a good hair washing for nothing!  </li>
            <li>It disappears fairly quickly after application.</li>
            <li>Interestingly, they made a similar one many years ago</li>
            <li>It has a great beachy scent, and gives defined, bouncy waves without being crunchy or weighed down.  </li>
            <li>Great product for light lazy day styling</li>
            <li>At the current posted price on Amazon of about $9, it is a pretty good value.</li>
            <li>The spray did keep her curls and waves even in this dry mid-January air, and she loved the scent.</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this!!</li>
            <li>When you&#x27;re hair air dries, you&#x27;ll have loose, gorgeous, beachy waves.</li>
            <li>very baby fine, high-lighted  Update -</li>
            <li>I have fine extremely straight hair and when I did try using the spray with a diffuser dryer, I ended up looking like something out of a horror movie.  </li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend this product to anyone who wants a bit more wave to their hair which lasts throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I end up with a straight, smooth hairstyle.  </li>
            <li>A great sea salt/texturizing spray that isn&#x27;t too heavy or sticky.</li>
            <li>And I much prefer to run my fingers through silky smooth hair than matte hair.</li>
            <li>Guessing that someone with natural curls would have better luck.</li>
            <li>this was a slightly better outcome, but not anywhere near my hopes.  </li>
            <li>You definitely will have to style and smooth your hair on your own, BUT this spray really does help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With a busy lifestyle, I like to have a few hair styling options that are quick and easy, but still attractive.</li>
            <li>Still good, but it makes my hair look tangled and messy - not tousled and beachy like the original one did.</li>
            <li>My wife and daughter (right on the heels of snatching away my John Freida anit-frizz hair spray) snapped up this sea salt spray as well.</li>
            <li>Smells pretty good, just not at all what I expected.</li>
            <li>I hope they start producing more of this - as of right now, it seems like quantities are limited and there is a huge mark-up on those that have it in stock.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use it a few more times or google it and see if it works better but it will probably be a product that sits on my shelf until I throw it out.  </li>
            <li>Be careful how much you use - too many sprays (more than 5 for my waist-length hair) makes your hair really tangled when it dries.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m always excited about the thought of a new hair style that doesn&#x27;t require me to spend the required 25 minutes blowdrying it.  </li>
            <li>The combo from above make my hair look more natural and LOVE IT, HIGHLY Recommend</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more in case they stop selling the spray again.</li>
            <li>Following this, I purchased two more.</li>
            <li>When I woke up the next morning, I had considerably more wave to my hair.</li>
            <li>First of all:  don&#x27;t follow the directions on the label.  </li>
            <li>I was pretty pessimistic about this product.  </li>
            <li>First of all, saying that it has sea salt in it</li>
            <li>was pretty off-putting to me.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time that I have ever used this type of product.</li>
            <li>It does its job exactly.</li>
            <li>I will try it one more time to see if anythings different .</li>
            <li>My first attempt was to put this in damp hair after showering.  </li>
            <li>but I was able to find the product locally.</li>
            <li>John Frieda Beach Blonde Sea Waves Sea Salt is a light spray with a mild scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it on freshly washed hair, &amp;#34;day after wash&amp;#34; hair, and my wet hair - any way I&#x27;ve tried it, it works well to give me that full look to my fine hair.</li>
            <li>Enjoy your time in the fabulous gorgeous water and emerge looking like Bottecelli&#x27;s Venus and smelling delicious!&lt;br /&gt;Empower yourself all day long, everyday!</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling clean - not heavy or greasy.  </li>
            <li>Still wish they would bring back the sparkling spray but this at least smells great!</li>
            <li>towel-dried hair, I was able to get fairly regular, tight waves, although I think I need a little more practice with the product to get it really good.  </li>
            <li>I love the delicate coconut smell, doesn&#x27;t last all day not overpowering but a nice fresh scent in the am.</li>
            <li>I stopped using this stuff for a while, thinking my hair was starting to reject the notion of easy styling.</li>
            <li>My hair already has a bit of a wave when I let it air dry, so that may be why I didn&#x27;t notice much more.  </li>
            <li>I just opened my second bottle and ordered two more on a new subscribe and save subscription.</li>
            <li>I used this as a replacement for dry shampoo and it worked much better for that application than as a straight styling tool.  </li>
            <li>This gave me much needed volume and felt a lot better than dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>My hair is blonde and fine</li>
            <li>Wow, super fun wavy beach hair from the 80&#x27;s with a modern sensibility and not feeling like you used old gel products to get the scrunchy look.  </li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t really see a difference.</li>
            <li>I scrunch and re-apply to the areas that aren&#x27;t curling up too much, and then put in my finishing polish on the ends to curl them upwards.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>it really is an odor</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want my hair straight and tamed.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I have very curly/frizzy hair already, but wanted to try to keep my beach waves after leaving the beach.</li>
            <li>so I figured I would not need much of the product.</li>
            <li>If you have straight hair and want to get some &amp;#34;beach waves&amp;#34;, it doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>Really downgraded the condition of my hair.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not quite wavy and not quite straight.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re ready to go.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and after just 2 times my hair instantly got lighter, it seems as if it looks more like natural highlights.</li>
            <li>I normally wear my hear the second day in braids or an up do and the third day I take down, spray this in and it looks beach wave perfect.</li>
            <li>I fine, flat hair but plenty of it</li>
            <li>Sea Waves gave my waves nice definition and did not leave my hair stiff or tacky feeling.</li>
            <li>and it works exactly like the old one!</li>
            <li>Like other reviewers have said, this spray isn&#x27;t some miracle product that will magically transform your hair into post-beach perfection.</li>
            <li>It seriously smells so good (like coconut) and doesn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy like most other sprays.</li>
            <li>I usually have to constantly rotate my hair products because, one day my hair looks great and</li>
            <li>There is a high probability that I sprayed too much product in my hair though.  </li>
            <li>I typically wash my hair every 3 days so to use this product and have to do it more isn&#x27;t really for me.</li>
            <li>Then I use the low and cool setting on my hair dryer to give it the windblown effect.</li>
            <li>With a new baby, spraying this in and leaving my hair semi-wavy is sooo much easier.</li>
            <li>I tried using more or less product to see if it made a difference, none seen.  </li>
            <li>I try to wash my hair every 3 days as I color it red and it fades so quickly.</li>
            <li>The scent is &amp;#34;beachy&amp;#34; - a coconutty scent that isn&#x27;t too over-powering, though it can seem a little strong at first.</li>
            <li>She has long wavy hair and was excited to try this out.</li>
            <li>It dries into loose beachy waves that are frizz free and not crunchy.</li>
            <li>more like, one side curls up with far apart waves, while half of it stays straight.</li>
            <li>It does have a matte sheen as promised, but I think I would prefer a little more</li>
            <li>It has a refreshing smell and a little spray goes along ways.</li>
            <li>I have long fine hair that is naturally wavy, but sometimes needs some encouragement.</li>
            <li>This product will enhance the natural wave in your hair - it will not make your hair wavy / curly if it is straight.</li>
            <li>My hair dries completely within an hour, it doesn&#x27;t feel crunchy or oily, apart from where I put in too much polish.   </li>
            <li>I have thick, wavy hair and this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>I have thick, wavy hair and sea spray can make it look amazing, just not this one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it seems as it everyone wants the wild and tousled look at the moment.</li>
            <li>I added some more after it dried too.</li>
            <li>If you do have naturally curly and thick hair, this is probably a better product to use right after washing.  </li>
            <li>I used a 1 inch curling iron to create some natural looking wave and instead of washing it the next day, I spritzed some of the spray through out my hair and quickly used a blast from the blow dryer to add volume.  </li>
            <li>In a few hours, my hair was dry and then, when I took my hair down, it had that perfect beachy texture.</li>
            <li>now I can&#x27;t live with - and wouldn&#x27;t want anyone else to smell either.</li>
            <li>I have fine, wavy hair that I generally blow dry and straighten.</li>
            <li>I am in the midst of one of our toughest winters yet, and I might as well be luxuriating near a tropical beach,under a big, colorful sun</li>
            <li>My first time using sea salt spray and this product definitely works!</li>
            <li>Out of curiosity, I started using the third bottle I had purchased, and it worked just as well asthe first bottle had.</li>
            <li>However, at the first use I realized it was not the same formula.</li>
            <li>This is from a short hair gal reviewer - I use to purchase the original Sea Waves spray that you shook up to mix and got new/improved release of the John Frieda Beach Blonde Sea Waves Sea Salt Spray.  </li>
            <li>and my hair is pretty short</li>
            <li>Unfortunately it is not the same product as before.</li>
            <li>This is a light product that won&#x27;t weigh down your hair</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that this product works just as well on my short, thick, straight pixie style haircut as the old product.  </li>
            <li>I defiantly got a different curl than usual and I liked the smell.</li>
            <li>good!i already have very dry hair and with this one dry my hair even more and after a moth using it</li>
            <li>and I kept my half filled, old bottle in the freezer.</li>
            <li>I had tried many sea salt sprays and they all left my hair a frizzy mess.  </li>
            <li>Was so excited to see they brought this product back, only to find they actually just released a new product.  </li>
            <li>I already have a bit of natural wave, which should have helped this product achieve that goal.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and my hair is naturally wavy to begin with.</li>
            <li>The fragrance reminded me of days at the beach smelling the soft scent of coconut tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>If you wear perfume (I do not), then it may clash, so I suggest working this through your hair early on before you dress.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>and it stays soft.  </li>
            <li>I have chin length hair that is naturally curly.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair but often straighten it.</li>
            <li>(the old stuff did wonders)&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this John Freida Beach Blonde spray for a few weeks now, and I love it.</li>
            <li>so well that I can sleep on it and the fourth day have a cute messy ponytail for gym/brunch/errands/etc.</li>
            <li>For the record, I do have pretty thick, long hair, though, so maybe it would work better on people with easier hair to work with.</li>
            <li>It just left my hair too dried out looking and more frizzy.  </li>
            <li>It definitely left it feeling salty and tousled, but also has a super strange SMELL to it.</li>
            <li>I apply it to almost dry hair and dry lightly with a diffuser.  </li>
            <li>I have long hair that is a bit past my shoulders, and I love to find new ways to style it.</li>
            <li>Since we do not typically go to a beach</li>
            <li>Used many sea sprays in the past... hmmm open to suggestions as to why this isn&#x27;t the miracle</li>
            <li>so probably is good for people who has oily hair or at least use it a tiny bit for who has dry hair like me</li>
            <li>I spray it on pretty generously on fairly wet to damp hair, give it a scrunch and go.  </li>
            <li>I get the concept, I spent the first 44 years of my life on the east coast of south Florida  and am fond of the day at the beach look.  </li>
            <li>The poor child does not like her straight hair any more than I did when I was younger.  </li>
            <li>Also, while this product smells really great, be aware that it does contain some less than desirable ingredients like sulfates and and artificial fragrances, etc.</li>
            <li>It did have a little more body but not much else.</li>
            <li>The easiest option was to straight it all, as trying to dry my hair, mousse it, and put in a &amp;#34;curling&amp;#34; spray never worked</li>
            <li>IF I DON&#x27;T BLOW DRY IT STRAIGHT.  </li>
            <li>It is also good to have a couple of casual style options, which is why the John Frieda Beach Blonde Sea Waves Sea Salt Spray caught my eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it does take so much product, even for fine hair like mine, so one would have to purchase new bottles rather frequently, which can get expensive.</li>
            <li>my hair has a natural wave to it, but needs a little assistance to look pretty when I wear it curly.</li>
            <li>I was obsessed with this stuff in high school and over the years had NEVER been able to find one comparable, and I bought them all...  </li>
            <li>The second bottle I purchased was a complete dud.</li>
            <li>After hearing so much about this spray, I was curious to try it out for myself.</li>
            <li>I just washed my hair and sprayed a very generous amount in it while it was wet.</li>
            <li>The review I had written was made about half way through my first bottle.</li>
            <li>wanted the short hair gals to know that for us, this product works the same as the old...</li>
            <li>Just be careful; if you use too much, it will make your hair look a little &amp;#34;dirty.&amp;#34; I also try not to use it every day, so I won&#x27;t have too much build up of the product.</li>
            <li>I scrunch up my hair first, and then spray a few times around my head.</li>
            <li>The original was better because it was an oil base.</li>
            <li>It felt really loaded down</li>
            <li>, it would never look dry, would crunch, and took even longer for my to style my natural hair than to straighten it.   </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have enough punch to give me a tousled look or to hold my curls, but it works for mild curl days and freshens my thick hair.</li>
            <li>Going through an old cabinet at a friend&#x27;s grandmother&#x27;s house a few years ago, I found an old bottle of it that was still 1/4 full, so I cherished it for months and tried so hard to make it last.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> It smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m clueless as to how to best use.</li>

            <li> After it air dries, it looks like perfect beach waves.</li>
            <li> This is not the best one I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> And this product does an excellent job of replicating it.  </li>

            <li> There isn&#x27;t any drying out or stiffening of my hair, which is great.</li>
            <li> It does not smell too great either.</li>
            <li> I was so happy when they re-released it.</li>
            <li> Excellent styling mist gives hair very nice shine kind of makes it</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this!!</li>
            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> I was impressed that my hair didn&#x27;t look greasy afterwards, since many products have that effect on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product gives your hair a nice beachy wave and makes your hair even lighter and look shiny!</li>
            <li> The best stuff on Earth! :)</li>
            <li> This spray is wonderful, I feel no need to spend more money on the Bumble and Bumble brand.</li>
            <li> I love the way my hair looks after applying and it has a great scent!</li>
            <li> It does nothing good for my hair.</li>
            <li> Good.</li>
            <li> But a light misting makes my hair look awesome.</li>
            <li> If so then I will update my post just to be fair.</li>
            <li> Works but not as good as cheaper supermarket brands like Fructis.  </li>
            <li> Also a good price.</li>
            <li> Just give your hair a good shake</li>
            <li> Good product though if you are at the beach and want your hair to have that look.</li>
            <li> I never found any replacement to be as good as this stuff</li>
            <li> And my hair has beautiful beachy waves that look really healthy.  </li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with John Freida Sea Spray.  </li>
            <li> Love this!  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what it claims and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on my hair with this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> the light coconut scent is great.</li>
            <li> Amazing product</li>
            <li> I honestly think it didn&#x27;t do any changes to my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair looked nice.</li>
            <li> As it dries I get some really nice waves.  </li>
            <li> The product also smells really nice too, which is a bonus.</li>
            <li> This one however makes my hair nice and wavy</li>
            <li> This spray has a nice beach-y (coconut) smell that adds to the illusion that the waves were created during a day at the beach.  </li>
            <li> what this way when I ordered it, (I thought it was some kind of spray on styling gel?)</li>
            <li> Smells nice and works well.</li>
            <li> Nice, summery scent and holds waves well.  </li>
            <li> After washing, spraying, scrunching and air-drying, my hair is honestly enviable, a claim I even hesitate to make anonymously.</li>
            <li> My daughter is beyond thrilled with the results on her hair.  </li>
            <li> Smells really great (kind of coconut-y), makes my hair look really good after a fresh shampoo, and helps create really nice waves.</li>
            <li> Super cool I love it!!!</li>
            <li> Wow, this stuff is seriously amazing!!!</li>
            <li> The greatest for a natural, wavy look.</li>
            <li> This has a very strong beachy smell which at first smells great</li>
            <li> Does a nice job at adding texture to my fine hair.</li>
            <li> Gives me those beach waved hair that I love</li>
            <li> It brings out a nice wave in my hair, and I have proudly lied and said it was my natural hair, which none of my friends have ever seen.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the smell of this stuff.</li>
            <li> (I did not believe it to be too chemically or overwhelming).</li>
            <li> Not in love.</li>
            <li> SO glad John Frieda brought back this amazing product!!!</li>
            <li> I could have been OK with that, if the style had been presentable, but it wasn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Glad to finally be able to get this again.</li>
            <li> I feel like my hair looks great when I use it for straight or wavy.</li>
            <li> I can safely say that I am satisfied with the results and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no wonder it returned after being discontinued for a while :)</li>
            <li> I love this spray.</li>
            <li> I am able to prolong my hair styles by using this spray.</li>
            <li> I love John Frieda, and have used the frizz ease products for years.</li>
            <li> However, sometimes I don&#x27;t have time for that routine and that&#x27;s when I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Perfect beachy curls/waves that last without frizzing.</li>
            <li> I have short hair so this is perfect for me.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get better than that.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li> My hair does have some more texture.</li>
            <li> It ended up being more of a texturizing/volumizing spray.</li>
            <li> My wife says it&#x27;s an OK product.</li>
            <li> I love this product a lot :-).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been notice more split ends...</li>
            <li> It is just okay.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t love it.  </li>
            <li> I sprayed the John Frieda Beach Blonde Sea Waves liberally over my hair and was not overly impressed.  </li>
            <li> I found the smell to be a bit overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> Or even better, wash your hair, and go to sleep.</li>
            <li> love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love it...</li>
            <li> This is an okay product.  </li>
            <li> My daughter and I have both enjoyed using this product.  </li>
            <li> my hair would have stayed better with the curlers/curling iron alone.  </li>
            <li> She is getting more of a wavy effect than I am which is probably because her hair is longer.  </li>
            <li> We will return for more when this bottle is gone.  </li>
            <li> This is the best hair styler of my long life!</li>
            <li> product does have a strong but appealing coconut smell.  </li>
            <li> It took me a few applications to figure out how best to apply and if I even liked the product.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect fix for my flat, fine, glassy hair.</li>
            <li> This would be great if you already have naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> I do get texture, and great smelling hair, but there&#x27;s no mermaid action going on here.</li>
            <li> It arrived very quickly, and I use it every day.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, and not sticky.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
            <li> The results are that wavy full sexy look.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to anyone, it is not sticky, not heavy and has wonderful scent.</li>
            <li> It gives definition and body to my fine curls.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s fine and frizzy.</li>
            <li> My shoulder length hair is fine and it did not appear wavy at all after using this product.  </li>
            <li> Soft and super great smelling.  </li>
            <li> It has a light, coconut-smell that does remind you of the beach.</li>
            <li> So happy they brought this back.</li>
            <li> How can I say this where I don&#x27;t sound too provocative?</li>
            <li> It gave my hair a great deal of body even after I use it several days in a row.  </li>
            <li> But at 61 the look doesn&#x27;t fit.  </li>
            <li> that I wasn&#x27;t going to enjoy this product from here on out.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pleased to announce that it was a success when using it in this manner.  </li>
            <li> Was so happy to see this come back on the market.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with it overall.</li>
            <li> First of all, the smell is wonderful; a very light coconut that doesn&#x27;t heavily linger like suntan oil.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell anywhere near as good as the original</li>
            <li> Btw, I have super fine straight blonde hair and my hair looked amazing all day!!!</li>
            <li> I have originally curly hair</li>
            <li> Nothing like the feel or smell of the original.</li>
            <li> It did not perform anything like the original.</li>
            <li> that Sedu makes a sea salt spray that is like the original John Frieda</li>
            <li> I wish this was like the original, but it isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Nothing like original.</li>
            <li> makes one that you shake to mix like the original ocean waves.  </li>
            <li> It smells and works like the original.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t work as well as the original.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been loving the combination, and will hope to be able to add this product on a daily basis, assuming it is eventually stocked.</li>
            <li> And because the product is kind of like a hair spray, I was able to keep my hair wavy but not frizzy for much longer than would have normally been possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didnt notice anything special about this product.</li>
            <li> daughter loves this spray, she says it reminds her of Myrtle Beach, and she&#x27;s right!</li>
            <li> Ok, it might not be exactly the same as the original beach blonde spray, but it&#x27;s still awesome.</li>
            <li> John Frieda makes products which are super unique and special.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li> I get really nice wavy body that everyone at work has complimented and it is pretty much wash and go.  </li>
            <li> Sea Waves is a nice product that I would recommend if you want a naturally wavy/curly look.    </li>
            <li> Loved this back in the day!</li>
            <li> This adds a nice hold to the my shorter hair, while still allowing a natural look.</li>
            <li> I used one of these beachy waves sea salt product several years ago and loved it.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product, but I can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Not like the old one - I loved the original Sea Waves Sea Salt Spray SO much.  </li>
            <li> On the dry hair though I just sprayed and scrunched and t looked amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d simply waste a good hair washing for nothing!  </li>
            <li> It disappears fairly quickly after application.</li>
            <li> Interestingly, they made a similar one many years ago</li>
            <li> It has a great beachy scent, and gives defined, bouncy waves without being crunchy or weighed down.  </li>
            <li> Great product for light lazy day styling</li>
            <li> At the current posted price on Amazon of about $9, it is a pretty good value.</li>
            <li> The spray did keep her curls and waves even in this dry mid-January air, and she loved the scent.</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this!!</li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re hair air dries, you&#x27;ll have loose, gorgeous, beachy waves.</li>
            <li> very baby fine, high-lighted  Update -</li>
            <li> I have fine extremely straight hair and when I did try using the spray with a diffuser dryer, I ended up looking like something out of a horror movie.  </li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend this product to anyone who wants a bit more wave to their hair which lasts throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I end up with a straight, smooth hairstyle.  </li>
            <li> A great sea salt/texturizing spray that isn&#x27;t too heavy or sticky.</li>
            <li> And I much prefer to run my fingers through silky smooth hair than matte hair.</li>
            <li> Guessing that someone with natural curls would have better luck.</li>
            <li> this was a slightly better outcome, but not anywhere near my hopes.  </li>
            <li> You definitely will have to style and smooth your hair on your own, BUT this spray really does help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With a busy lifestyle, I like to have a few hair styling options that are quick and easy, but still attractive.</li>
            <li> Still good, but it makes my hair look tangled and messy - not tousled and beachy like the original one did.</li>
            <li> My wife and daughter (right on the heels of snatching away my John Freida anit-frizz hair spray) snapped up this sea salt spray as well.</li>
            <li> Smells pretty good, just not at all what I expected.</li>
            <li> I hope they start producing more of this - as of right now, it seems like quantities are limited and there is a huge mark-up on those that have it in stock.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use it a few more times or google it and see if it works better but it will probably be a product that sits on my shelf until I throw it out.  </li>
            <li> Be careful how much you use - too many sprays (more than 5 for my waist-length hair) makes your hair really tangled when it dries.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m always excited about the thought of a new hair style that doesn&#x27;t require me to spend the required 25 minutes blowdrying it.  </li>
            <li> The combo from above make my hair look more natural and LOVE IT, HIGHLY Recommend</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more in case they stop selling the spray again.</li>
            <li> Following this, I purchased two more.</li>
            <li> When I woke up the next morning, I had considerably more wave to my hair.</li>
            <li> First of all:  don&#x27;t follow the directions on the label.  </li>
            <li> I was pretty pessimistic about this product.  </li>
            <li> First of all, saying that it has sea salt in it</li>
            <li> was pretty off-putting to me.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time that I have ever used this type of product.</li>
            <li> It does its job exactly.</li>
            <li> I will try it one more time to see if anythings different .</li>
            <li> My first attempt was to put this in damp hair after showering.  </li>
            <li> but I was able to find the product locally.</li>
            <li> John Frieda Beach Blonde Sea Waves Sea Salt is a light spray with a mild scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on freshly washed hair, &amp;#34;day after wash&amp;#34; hair, and my wet hair - any way I&#x27;ve tried it, it works well to give me that full look to my fine hair.</li>
            <li> Enjoy your time in the fabulous gorgeous water and emerge looking like Bottecelli&#x27;s Venus and smelling delicious!&lt;br /&gt;Empower yourself all day long, everyday!</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling clean - not heavy or greasy.  </li>
            <li> Still wish they would bring back the sparkling spray but this at least smells great!</li>
            <li> towel-dried hair, I was able to get fairly regular, tight waves, although I think I need a little more practice with the product to get it really good.  </li>
            <li> I love the delicate coconut smell, doesn&#x27;t last all day not overpowering but a nice fresh scent in the am.</li>
            <li> I stopped using this stuff for a while, thinking my hair was starting to reject the notion of easy styling.</li>
            <li> My hair already has a bit of a wave when I let it air dry, so that may be why I didn&#x27;t notice much more.  </li>
            <li> I just opened my second bottle and ordered two more on a new subscribe and save subscription.</li>
            <li> I used this as a replacement for dry shampoo and it worked much better for that application than as a straight styling tool.  </li>
            <li> This gave me much needed volume and felt a lot better than dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair is blonde and fine</li>
            <li> Wow, super fun wavy beach hair from the 80&#x27;s with a modern sensibility and not feeling like you used old gel products to get the scrunchy look.  </li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t really see a difference.</li>
            <li> I scrunch and re-apply to the areas that aren&#x27;t curling up too much, and then put in my finishing polish on the ends to curl them upwards.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> it really is an odor</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want my hair straight and tamed.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> I have very curly/frizzy hair already, but wanted to try to keep my beach waves after leaving the beach.</li>
            <li> so I figured I would not need much of the product.</li>
            <li> If you have straight hair and want to get some &amp;#34;beach waves&amp;#34;, it doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> Really downgraded the condition of my hair.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not quite wavy and not quite straight.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re ready to go.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and after just 2 times my hair instantly got lighter, it seems as if it looks more like natural highlights.</li>
            <li> I normally wear my hear the second day in braids or an up do and the third day I take down, spray this in and it looks beach wave perfect.</li>
            <li> I fine, flat hair but plenty of it</li>
            <li> Sea Waves gave my waves nice definition and did not leave my hair stiff or tacky feeling.</li>
            <li> and it works exactly like the old one!</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers have said, this spray isn&#x27;t some miracle product that will magically transform your hair into post-beach perfection.</li>
            <li> It seriously smells so good (like coconut) and doesn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy like most other sprays.</li>
            <li> I usually have to constantly rotate my hair products because, one day my hair looks great and</li>
            <li> There is a high probability that I sprayed too much product in my hair though.  </li>
            <li> I typically wash my hair every 3 days so to use this product and have to do it more isn&#x27;t really for me.</li>
            <li> Then I use the low and cool setting on my hair dryer to give it the windblown effect.</li>
            <li> With a new baby, spraying this in and leaving my hair semi-wavy is sooo much easier.</li>
            <li> I tried using more or less product to see if it made a difference, none seen.  </li>
            <li> I try to wash my hair every 3 days as I color it red and it fades so quickly.</li>
            <li> The scent is &amp;#34;beachy&amp;#34; - a coconutty scent that isn&#x27;t too over-powering, though it can seem a little strong at first.</li>
            <li> She has long wavy hair and was excited to try this out.</li>
            <li> It dries into loose beachy waves that are frizz free and not crunchy.</li>
            <li> more like, one side curls up with far apart waves, while half of it stays straight.</li>
            <li> It does have a matte sheen as promised, but I think I would prefer a little more</li>
            <li> It has a refreshing smell and a little spray goes along ways.</li>
            <li> I have long fine hair that is naturally wavy, but sometimes needs some encouragement.</li>
            <li> This product will enhance the natural wave in your hair - it will not make your hair wavy / curly if it is straight.</li>
            <li> My hair dries completely within an hour, it doesn&#x27;t feel crunchy or oily, apart from where I put in too much polish.   </li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair and this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair and sea spray can make it look amazing, just not this one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it seems as it everyone wants the wild and tousled look at the moment.</li>
            <li> I added some more after it dried too.</li>
            <li> If you do have naturally curly and thick hair, this is probably a better product to use right after washing.  </li>
            <li> I used a 1 inch curling iron to create some natural looking wave and instead of washing it the next day, I spritzed some of the spray through out my hair and quickly used a blast from the blow dryer to add volume.  </li>
            <li> In a few hours, my hair was dry and then, when I took my hair down, it had that perfect beachy texture.</li>
            <li> now I can&#x27;t live with - and wouldn&#x27;t want anyone else to smell either.</li>
            <li> I have fine, wavy hair that I generally blow dry and straighten.</li>
            <li> I am in the midst of one of our toughest winters yet, and I might as well be luxuriating near a tropical beach,under a big, colorful sun</li>
            <li> My first time using sea salt spray and this product definitely works!</li>
            <li> Out of curiosity, I started using the third bottle I had purchased, and it worked just as well asthe first bottle had.</li>
            <li> However, at the first use I realized it was not the same formula.</li>
            <li> This is from a short hair gal reviewer - I use to purchase the original Sea Waves spray that you shook up to mix and got new/improved release of the John Frieda Beach Blonde Sea Waves Sea Salt Spray.  </li>
            <li> and my hair is pretty short</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it is not the same product as before.</li>
            <li> This is a light product that won&#x27;t weigh down your hair</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that this product works just as well on my short, thick, straight pixie style haircut as the old product.  </li>
            <li> I defiantly got a different curl than usual and I liked the smell.</li>
            <li> good!i already have very dry hair and with this one dry my hair even more and after a moth using it</li>
            <li> and I kept my half filled, old bottle in the freezer.</li>
            <li> I had tried many sea salt sprays and they all left my hair a frizzy mess.  </li>
            <li> Was so excited to see they brought this product back, only to find they actually just released a new product.  </li>
            <li> I already have a bit of natural wave, which should have helped this product achieve that goal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and my hair is naturally wavy to begin with.</li>
            <li> The fragrance reminded me of days at the beach smelling the soft scent of coconut tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> If you wear perfume (I do not), then it may clash, so I suggest working this through your hair early on before you dress.  </li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> and it stays soft.  </li>
            <li> I have chin length hair that is naturally curly.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair but often straighten it.</li>
            <li> (the old stuff did wonders)&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this John Freida Beach Blonde spray for a few weeks now, and I love it.</li>
            <li> so well that I can sleep on it and the fourth day have a cute messy ponytail for gym/brunch/errands/etc.</li>
            <li> For the record, I do have pretty thick, long hair, though, so maybe it would work better on people with easier hair to work with.</li>
            <li> It just left my hair too dried out looking and more frizzy.  </li>
            <li> It definitely left it feeling salty and tousled, but also has a super strange SMELL to it.</li>
            <li> I apply it to almost dry hair and dry lightly with a diffuser.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair that is a bit past my shoulders, and I love to find new ways to style it.</li>
            <li> Since we do not typically go to a beach</li>
            <li> Used many sea sprays in the past... hmmm open to suggestions as to why this isn&#x27;t the miracle</li>
            <li> so probably is good for people who has oily hair or at least use it a tiny bit for who has dry hair like me</li>
            <li> I spray it on pretty generously on fairly wet to damp hair, give it a scrunch and go.  </li>
            <li> I get the concept, I spent the first 44 years of my life on the east coast of south Florida  and am fond of the day at the beach look.  </li>
            <li> The poor child does not like her straight hair any more than I did when I was younger.  </li>
            <li> Also, while this product smells really great, be aware that it does contain some less than desirable ingredients like sulfates and and artificial fragrances, etc.</li>
            <li> It did have a little more body but not much else.</li>
            <li> The easiest option was to straight it all, as trying to dry my hair, mousse it, and put in a &amp;#34;curling&amp;#34; spray never worked</li>
            <li> IF I DON&#x27;T BLOW DRY IT STRAIGHT.  </li>
            <li> It is also good to have a couple of casual style options, which is why the John Frieda Beach Blonde Sea Waves Sea Salt Spray caught my eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it does take so much product, even for fine hair like mine, so one would have to purchase new bottles rather frequently, which can get expensive.</li>
            <li> my hair has a natural wave to it, but needs a little assistance to look pretty when I wear it curly.</li>
            <li> I was obsessed with this stuff in high school and over the years had NEVER been able to find one comparable, and I bought them all...  </li>
            <li> The second bottle I purchased was a complete dud.</li>
            <li> After hearing so much about this spray, I was curious to try it out for myself.</li>
            <li> I just washed my hair and sprayed a very generous amount in it while it was wet.</li>
            <li> The review I had written was made about half way through my first bottle.</li>
            <li> wanted the short hair gals to know that for us, this product works the same as the old...</li>
            <li> Just be careful; if you use too much, it will make your hair look a little &amp;#34;dirty.&amp;#34; I also try not to use it every day, so I won&#x27;t have too much build up of the product.</li>
            <li> I scrunch up my hair first, and then spray a few times around my head.</li>
            <li> The original was better because it was an oil base.</li>
            <li> It felt really loaded down</li>
            <li> , it would never look dry, would crunch, and took even longer for my to style my natural hair than to straighten it.   </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have enough punch to give me a tousled look or to hold my curls, but it works for mild curl days and freshens my thick hair.</li>
            <li> Going through an old cabinet at a friend&#x27;s grandmother&#x27;s house a few years ago, I found an old bottle of it that was still 1/4 full, so I cherished it for months and tried so hard to make it last.  </li>
            <li> - you don&#x27;t need a lot of this product (at least I don&#x27;t, with my fine strands), work it gently in your dry hair: I squeeze my hair just a little and then let it dry.</li>
            <li> but Frieda adds other ingredients that keep my hair shiny and soft at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;Grab</li>
            <li> My hair is short, thick, fine, dark brown, and beginning to gray.  </li>
            <li> My hair is naturally wavy, but not a consistent wave throughout...</li>
            <li> I got a body wave about two months ago and it is starting to go flat.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if my hair has changed or if it just doesn&#x27;t have as much holding power, but my hair is just plain straight still.</li>
            <li> I do wish it came in a bigger bottle-this one wont last long.</li>
            <li> and it really gave my hair very little texture.</li>
            <li> I recently cut my hair short and it&#x27;s been a bit dull with it straight.</li>
            <li> look - the one where my very baby fine hair has a slightly messy and wavy, and thick, look to it - a little bit wild but still tame enough to go out.  </li>
            <li> By the end of the day, my hair has usually gone fairly straight because of the weight of my hair.</li>
            <li> Then you simply twist sections of your hair, if you have long hair like I</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair fuller and not lay flat to my head.</li>
            <li> I knew this wouldn&#x27;t last long once it was unwrapped.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical since it&#x27;s not the same product, but it&#x27;s actually a fine replacement.</li>
            <li> I brushed my hair as usually, and let it air dry for a bit to get the waves really showing.  </li>
            <li> I towel dry my hair enough so that if I squeeze it, no water comes out.  </li>
            <li> Or, you can spray it onto your wet hair, work it in, and let it dry naturally or blow it dry.  </li>
            <li> Left it alone to dry.</li>
            <li> So the thought of washing my hair, spraying it with this John Frieda Beach Blonde Sea Waves Sea Salt Spray and letting it air dry gave me hives.  </li>
            <li> I usually blow it dry and use a large curling iron.  </li>
            <li> This works differently than other similar products I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I sprayed the product in separated sections, did a little twisting and let it fall naturally.  </li>
            <li> and I am not young.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got long, color-treated, wavy and somewhat frizzy hair...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and with a gentle curl.</li>
            <li> This spray ( I used it on dry and wet hair) left my hair shiny and texturized.</li>
            <li> Did nothing other than make my hair feel coarse.</li>
            <li> dry hair</li>
            <li> After I wash my hair, I spritz this stuff throughout, scrunch, and I let it air dry.  </li>
            <li> I tried this again after straightening my hair with an iron and again instead of washing, I used the spray as a dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> i spray this on my wet hair, twist a few sections, and my hair will find it&#x27;s natural waves.</li>
            <li> This giving limited options for styling.   </li>
            <li> My second attempt was after I had blow dried, flat ironed and curled it.  </li>
            <li> I had loose beachy waves in no time.</li>
            <li> This summer the humidity was making my hair impossible to dry, so i decided to make the most of what I have.</li>
            <li> I never used the original formula, but I doubt it could have been this bad and had such a cult following.</li>
            <li> Seems like any other product I buy claiming to do something extra for my hair only to disappoint and waste my money.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t create beachy waves no matter if my hair is wet, damp, or dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy, have fairly short hair, and use this in combination with Jack Black texture cream.</li>
            <li> It seems very similar the the previous product.</li>
            <li> Tried it with damp hair, dry hair and wet hair</li>
            <li> I tried this on wet, towel-dried, and dry hair and it gave me a little texture with the dry hair only.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair very dry and brittle looking.</li>
            <li> each time I try it my hair looks greasy, I&#x27;ve used it on wet &amp; dry hair, not beach wavy at all!  </li>
            <li> I have very thick, course blond hair that I wear straight and wavy depending on the day-</li>
            <li> Had to return it because it was creating a flat, dry, and limp look to my hair.</li>
            <li> It has a coconut like smell, which I&#x27;m not really a fan of.</li>
            <li> i have a lot of thin, slippery, mostly straight hair.</li>
            <li> Have a lot of hair but not much body.  </li>
            <li> A few minutes later, your waves are revitalized.</li>
            <li> After a few minutes my hair was so clammy and gross</li>
            <li> The next day I decided to re-wash, blow dry and style it as usual</li>
            <li> Seriously, thank you JF for finally bringing it back</li>
            <li> On my dry hair, I would spray this all over and just mess my hair up.</li>
            <li> I am an Asian with thick, long hair, and this works wonders!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed that this was not like the original!!!</li>
            <li> I tried this product on both dry hair and wet but towel dried hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the effect on already dried hair more than used on wet because my hair is very thin and curly and it make it hard to style.</li>
            <li> Due to no crunch or dampness, they were none the wiser.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is the same result</li>
            <li> From other reviewers and varying hair length textures/lengths/thicknesses this is not always</li>
            <li> but if you have used and enjoyed sea salt hair products before, you might be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Was disappointed it didn&#x27;t give me the love I was hoping.  </li>
            <li> but a little goes a very long way.  </li>
            <li> I learned to apply to damp or dry hair heavily.</li>
            <li> Honestly, half the time, if I don&#x27;t carefully blow out and straighten, I feel like cousin it.</li>
            <li> I have to change my review to 2 stars because something awful happened to the pleasant scent  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely thick, extremely coarse, extremely frizz-prone</li>
            <li> Even better, if you&#x27;re feeling lazy, and wake w/ bad hair, skip a wash and spritz this in.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t end up with very beach-y waves.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me it didn&#x27;t works really</li>
            <li> The smell seemed to disappear after my hair dried, but was again noticeable when I got my hair wet.    </li>
            <li> The other side curls under, with tight and uniform waves, almost like a crimped one side of my head.</li>
            <li> I usually towel dry my hair and then spray it all over and into my roots.</li>
            <li> It cuts my dry time due to us having hard water as well.</li>
            <li> , that is extremely wavy all over except a few sections in the front.  </li>
            <li> in that unmatched beach smell and texture -- not this odd chemical smell.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used maybe half of it or less</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up with a mess that looked like I had slept in it without styling it at all.</li>
            <li> I used to bring home water from the beach and keep it in a bottle in the fridge to use it as spritz on my hair to give it  a little texture.  </li>
            <li> I just wanted a little volume and texture to my hair so this is working for my needs.  </li>
            <li> Just know that you will have to work with the product a little bit.</li>
            <li> I scrunch it up again and push it all back while I put on makeup and straighten my bangs while a fan is behind me.</li>
            <li> washed and towel dried my hair</li>
            <li> it did was make my hair heavy and snarled.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s heavy and greasy-looking.  </li>
            <li> It dried out my hair and made it frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have been spritzing this liberally on towel dried hair and then scrunching.  </li>
            <li> stuff smells like fake suntan scent - the old stuff smelled like the beach.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But this one dried out my hair</li>
            <li> do a few spritzes of the product afterwards</li>
            <li> When it dried completely (naturally dried, not blow dried), it was like straw—dry, but with sticky residue.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my hair stiff, but does add some texture and bounce.  </li>
            <li> sticky and just plain felt</li>
            <li> Guess natural is the only way to go for this girl:(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m naturally a dark dirty blonde but my hair has been dyed a medium to dark brown for a year &amp; needed change.</li>
            <li> It allows my hair to frizz less and perks up dull locks.</li>
            <li> In fact I saw very little difference.  </li>
            <li> Too bad, because I really did like this product.  </li>
            <li> No more.</li>
            <li> I even had a hard time putting it in a poly tail.  </li>
            <li> I sprayed a liberal amount onto towel dried hair and twisted my hair while it air dried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never liked the feeling of my hair up at all, and don&#x27;t like spending a lot of time in front of the mirror every morning.</li>
            <li> I kept imagining my hair feeling the way it does when you come back from the beach - dirty.  </li>
            <li> My one complaint?</li>
            <li> I feel that it gives my style an edgy look.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, corse, curly hair that is a couple inches below my shoulders (medium to long).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Perhaps there is a learning curve I am missing with this product, but I am not happy with it and would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> and I would not recommend if you hair is thick, and colored.</li>
            <li> does NOTHING to my thick hair</li>
            <li> - it is really unpleasant enough that I am going to go re-wash my hair.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because I thought this product would make my hair stiff, but no, not if you use it as directed!</li>
            <li> I have VERY thick hair</li>
            <li> Also, it dried out my hair so horribly, it took me about a week to get the moisture back in it.  </li>
            <li> I was getting to so tired of having burnt hair from a straighter.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical when purchasing this product.  </li>
            <li> This proved to be wrong.</li>
            <li> My hair is what you call difficult.  </li>
            <li> So sad.</li>
            <li> I have really weirdly textured hair.</li>
            <li> Chalk this up to another product fail.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m just using this wrong or what the deal is...</li>
            <li> Smells like vacation and creates a casual look.</li>
            <li> My hair was dry, crunchy, and felt terrible.</li>
            <li> I have a dandruff shampoo that smells kinda bad</li>
            <li> It looked just as bad – there was no increase in body or wave</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a go and was quite frankly shocked with the results.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll just say I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed and would not bother buying it again.</li>
            <li> and I was disappointed in that one too.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried VERY expensive brands and they smell horrible.</li>
            <li> Too bad its sold out everywhere!</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to pay outrageous amounts for it!!</li>
            <li> It just looked awful.</li>
            <li> It smells terrible.</li>
            <li> This is probably the worst beach spray I have purchased.</li>
            <li> It also helps my really annoying bangs to stay in place!</li>
            <li> Horrible stuff.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Leaves your hair a bit greasy....</li>
            <li> Wow, this stuff is seriously amazing!!! It seriously smells so good (like coconut) and doesn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy like most other sprays. I sprayed a liberal amount onto towel dried hair and twisted my hair while it air dried. I undid the twist and used a hair dryer. Blow the air from the bottom to maintain the curls and crunch while drying. I had loose beachy waves in no time. Btw, I have super fine straight blonde hair and my hair looked amazing all day!!! I will definitely buy more in case they stop selling the spray again.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Works great with my hair and I get a ton of compliments!</li>
            <li> This was so so ! Maybe I just don&#x27;t know how to use it.</li>
            <li> Gives me those beach waved hair that I love</li>
            <li> I Have John Frieda Beach Blonde Sea Waves Shampoo and I use organixs lemon highlights conditioner and after just 2 times my hair instantly got lighter, it seems as if it looks more like natural highlights. I&#x27;m naturally a dark dirty blonde but my hair has been dyed a medium to dark brown for a year &amp; needed change. The combo from above make my hair look more natural and LOVE IT, HIGHLY Recommend</li>
            <li> Sea Waves is a nice product that I would recommend if you want a naturally wavy/curly look.    This product will enhance the natural wave in your hair - it will not make your hair wavy / curly if it is straight. Sea Waves gave my waves nice definition and did not leave my hair stiff or tacky feeling. It smells wonderful! It will remind you of a day at the beach. The smell seemed to disappear after my hair dried, but was again noticeable when I got my hair wet.    This will be a staple in my pool bag. A spray of conditioner followed by Sea Waves and my hair will look great.</li>
            <li> I tried this product on both dry hair and wet but towel dried hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On dry hair, I didn&#x27;t really see a difference. I was impressed that my hair didn&#x27;t look greasy afterwards, since many products have that effect on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On towel-dried hair, I was able to get fairly regular, tight waves, although I think I need a little more practice with the product to get it really good.  I did focus the spray about an inch below my roots, since I can&#x27;t twist that part into the style (as recommended on the back of the bottle).  It does have a matte sheen as promised, but I think I would prefer a little more shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does have a strong but appealing coconut smell.  It disappears fairly quickly after application.</li>
            <li> My first time using sea salt spray and this product definitely works! I recently cut my hair short and it&#x27;s been a bit dull with it straight. But this product helps it look like I curled it.</li>
            <li> I honestly think it didn&#x27;t do any changes to my hair. I have originally curly hair and I just wanted it to fix the curls, but I didn&#x27;t notice any changes.</li>
            <li> When I found out this had made a return, I was ecstatic and ordered it immediately.  I was obsessed with this stuff in high school and over the years had NEVER been able to find one comparable, and I bought them all...  Going through an old cabinet at a friend&#x27;s grandmother&#x27;s house a few years ago, I found an old bottle of it that was still 1/4 full, so I cherished it for months and tried so hard to make it last.  Seriously, thank you JF for finally bringing it back so I don&#x27;t have to pay outrageous amounts for it!!</li>
            <li> Loved this back in the day! Now it&#x27;s back!! Ya HOOOOOO!</li>
            <li> I was getting to so tired of having burnt hair from a straighter. I&#x27;ve never liked the feeling of my hair up at all, and don&#x27;t like spending a lot of time in front of the mirror every morning. This giving limited options for styling.   My hair is naturally wavy, but not a consistent wave throughout... more like, one side curls up with far apart waves, while half of it stays straight. The other side curls under, with tight and uniform waves, almost like a crimped one side of my head. It just looked awful. The easiest option was to straight it all, as trying to dry my hair, mousse it, and put in a &amp;#34;curling&amp;#34; spray never worked, it would never look dry, would crunch, and took even longer for my to style my natural hair than to straighten it.   It has a coconut like smell, which I&#x27;m not really a fan of. I towel dry my hair enough so that if I squeeze it, no water comes out.  I scrunch up my hair first, and then spray a few times around my head. I scrunch it up again and push it all back while I put on makeup and straighten my bangs while a fan is behind me. I scrunch and re-apply to the areas that aren&#x27;t curling up too much, and then put in my finishing polish on the ends to curl them upwards. My hair dries completely within an hour, it doesn&#x27;t feel crunchy or oily, apart from where I put in too much polish.   It brings out a nice wave in my hair, and I have proudly lied and said it was my natural hair, which none of my friends have ever seen. Due to no crunch or dampness, they were none the wiser.  Update: The review I had written was made about half way through my first bottle. Following this, I purchased two more. The second bottle I purchased was a complete dud. I was basically putting coconut water into my hair, making it crunchy and leaving it un-styled. I stopped using this stuff for a while, thinking my hair was starting to reject the notion of easy styling. Out of curiosity, I started using the third bottle I had purchased, and it worked just as well asthe first bottle had. I guess the consistency of the product is not the same in every bottle.</li>
            <li> It smells terrible. Nothing like the feel or smell of the original. It does nothing good for my hair.</li>
            <li> Love this!  It does exactly what it claims and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> I LOVE the smell of this stuff. It is just like coming out of the ocean and having that beach tossed hair. It smells amazing and it makes your hair look awesome</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair and this stuff is amazing. After I wash my hair, I spritz this stuff throughout, scrunch, and I let it air dry.  It dries into loose beachy waves that are frizz free and not crunchy. I get so many compliments on my hair with this stuff!</li>
            <li> I have thick, corse, curly hair that is a couple inches below my shoulders (medium to long).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed and towel dried my hair so it wasn&#x27;t dripping and liberally sprayed the John Frieda Sea Salt Spray on my hair. I defiantly got a different curl than usual and I liked the smell. (I did not believe it to be too chemically or overwhelming). My hair looked nice. Since we do not typically go to a beach I&#x27;m not sure if it is the same result I would get from the actual ocean or not.&lt;br /&gt;I did not like that the next day my hair felt like j had to start over with a shower. It felt really loaded down (like I had put a lot of hairspray on it). I typically wash my hair every 3 days so to use this product and have to do it more isn&#x27;t really for me. If I use it again it will be when I know I can have a couple ponytail days afterward.</li>
            <li> Good. Not in love. Maybe I&#x27;m clueless as to how to best use. Used many sea sprays in the past... hmmm open to suggestions as to why this isn&#x27;t the miracle I thought it would be...</li>
            <li> Wife loves it! Smell is not obnoxious, somewhat tropical, and works great!</li>
            <li> Excellent styling mist gives hair very nice shine kind of makes it</li>
            <li> SO glad John Frieda brought back this amazing product!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. i have a lot of thin, slippery, mostly straight hair. i spray this on my wet hair, twist a few sections, and my hair will find it&#x27;s natural waves. can boost up the volume to 11 with this stuff. A+!</li>
            <li> Does a nice job at adding texture to my fine hair. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect fix for my flat, fine, glassy hair.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like the beach  Haven&#x27;t decided if I like or not?</li>
            <li> I have long hair that is a bit past my shoulders, and I love to find new ways to style it. With a busy lifestyle, I like to have a few hair styling options that are quick and easy, but still attractive. It is also good to have a couple of casual style options, which is why the John Frieda Beach Blonde Sea Waves Sea Salt Spray caught my eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My expectation of this product was that it would help me produce piecy, beachy type waves in my hair. I already have a bit of natural wave, which should have helped this product achieve that goal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle says to spritz it all over your hair, then comb it through. You should start with towel-dried or blow-dried hair. Then you simply twist sections of your hair, if you have long hair like I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up with a mess that looked like I had slept in it without styling it at all. It definitely gave my hair some texture, but I didn&#x27;t like the texture at all. I could have been OK with that, if the style had been presentable, but it wasn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps there is a learning curve I am missing with this product, but I am not happy with it and would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> i have highlights and have also dyed my hair numerous times. This product gives your hair a nice beachy wave and makes your hair even lighter and look shiny! Would definitely recommend this over the sephora bumble bee hair products. A must have for blondes!</li>
            <li> Smalls great.  I have a dandruff shampoo that smells kinda bad, I spray this on so my hair smells like the beach instead.</li>
            <li> Still wish they would bring back the sparkling spray but this at least smells great! I&#x27;ve tried VERY expensive brands and they smell horrible. Glad to finally be able to get this again.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.  Doesn&#x27;t create beachy waves no matter if my hair is wet, damp, or dry. I tried using more or less product to see if it made a difference, none seen.  Had to return it because it was creating a flat, dry, and limp look to my hair.</li>
            <li> when I heard that John Frieda Beach Blonde sea waves spray was back on the market, I rushed out to buy it as I have been waiting for it for years and was so upset when they discontinued it. However, at the first use I realized it was not the same formula. It did not perform anything like the original. My hair was dry, crunchy, and felt terrible. It looked just as bad – there was no increase in body or wave and my hair is naturally wavy to begin with. I threw the rest out after one use! I read on another review here that Sedu makes a sea salt spray that is like the original John Frieda so I will be purchasing that next. I am very disappointed that this was not like the original!!!</li>
            <li> Wanted to try it - thought it would give me waves.&lt;br /&gt;All it did was make my hair heavy and snarled. There is nothing that I could do but wash my hair.&lt;br /&gt;NOT happy and I would not recommend if you hair is thick, and colored.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this John Freida Beach Blonde spray for a few weeks now, and I love it. I hope they start producing more of this - as of right now, it seems like quantities are limited and there is a huge mark-up on those that have it in stock. At the current posted price on Amazon of about $9, it is a pretty good value. I&#x27;m a guy, have fairly short hair, and use this in combination with Jack Black texture cream. It has a light, coconut-smell that does remind you of the beach. It&#x27;s not too strong. I&#x27;ve been loving the combination, and will hope to be able to add this product on a daily basis, assuming it is eventually stocked.</li>
            <li> Why did John Freida &amp;#34;bring back&amp;#34; a completely different product?  What I wanted you to bring back was the same product you had before -- in that unmatched beach smell and texture -- not this odd chemical smell.  Why did you fix something that wasn&#x27;t broke.  So dissapointed.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I have medium weight hair with wave in it. By the end of the day, my hair has usually gone fairly straight because of the weight of my hair. I used John Frieda Beach Blonde Sea Waves in the evening after washing and towel drying my hair. When I woke up the next morning, I had considerably more wave to my hair. Best of all, the wave lasted all day. The fragrance reminded me of days at the beach smelling the soft scent of coconut tanning lotion. I like the way my hair looked, smelt, and felt. I would certainly recommend this product to anyone who wants a bit more wave to their hair which lasts throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Great product for light lazy day styling</li>
            <li> Smells like vacation and creates a casual look. Even my husband loves the smell. Happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Ok, it might not be exactly the same as the original beach blonde spray, but it&#x27;s still awesome. It has a great beachy scent, and gives defined, bouncy waves without being crunchy or weighed down.  I was skeptical since it&#x27;s not the same product, but it&#x27;s actually a fine replacement. I&#x27;ve been waiting years for something similar.</li>
            <li> The best stuff on Earth! :)</li>
            <li> I bought this spray as a way to try sea salt on my hair at a lower cost than the Bumble and Bumble brand that my stylist recommended. I have very thick, course blond hair that I wear straight and wavy depending on the day- my hair has a natural wave to it, but needs a little assistance to look pretty when I wear it curly. This spray is wonderful, I feel no need to spend more money on the Bumble and Bumble brand. It cuts my dry time due to us having hard water as well. I feel like my hair looks great when I use it for straight or wavy. I am very satisfied with the results!! It smells great too!!</li>
            <li> Love it! Especially the smell</li>
            <li> So happy they brought this back. The original was better because it was an oil base. I just added a teaspoin of coconut oil and it works exactly like the old one! Too bad its sold out everywhere!</li>
            <li> After hearing so much about this spray, I was curious to try it out for myself. I can safely say that I am satisfied with the results and the light coconut scent is great. It&#x27;s no wonder it returned after being discontinued for a while :)</li>
            <li> Super cool I love it!!!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair very dry and brittle looking.</li>
            <li> Wow, super fun wavy beach hair from the 80&#x27;s with a modern sensibility and not feeling like you used old gel products to get the scrunchy look.  Soft and super great smelling.  Amazing product</li>
            <li> This adds a nice hold to the my shorter hair, while still allowing a natural look. The spray does not cause a thickness that prevents fingers from being run through it. It has a refreshing smell and a little spray goes along ways.</li>
            <li> Not like the old one - I loved the original Sea Waves Sea Salt Spray SO much.  I wish this was like the original, but it isn&#x27;t.  Still good, but it makes my hair look tangled and messy - not tousled and beachy like the original one did.</li>
            <li> I love this spray. I try to wash my hair every 3 days as I color it red and it fades so quickly. I am able to prolong my hair styles by using this spray. I normally wear my hear the second day in braids or an up do and the third day I take down, spray this in and it looks beach wave perfect. It smells divine and it hold the &amp;#34;wave&amp;#34; so well that I can sleep on it and the fourth day have a cute messy ponytail for gym/brunch/errands/etc. I would highly recommend it to anyone, it is not sticky, not heavy and has wonderful scent.</li>
            <li> This really is a great &amp;#34;beachy waves&amp;#34; product.  I spray it on pretty generously on fairly wet to damp hair, give it a scrunch and go.  As it dries I get some really nice waves.  The product also smells really nice too, which is a bonus.</li>
            <li> This is from a short hair gal reviewer - I use to purchase the original Sea Waves spray that you shook up to mix and got new/improved release of the John Frieda Beach Blonde Sea Waves Sea Salt Spray.  I can honestly say that this product works just as well on my short, thick, straight pixie style haircut as the old product.  From other reviewers and varying hair length textures/lengths/thicknesses this is not always the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just wanted the short hair gals to know that for us, this product works the same as the old...</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I love the way my hair looks after applying and it has a great scent!</li>
            <li> Hair type: very baby fine, high-lighted  Update - I have to change my review to 2 stars because something awful happened to the pleasant scent  - it is really unpleasant enough that I am going to go re-wash my hair. Maybe it goes rancid after a while? I&#x27;ve used maybe half of it or less and I&#x27;ll have to toss it - it really is an odor now I can&#x27;t live with - and wouldn&#x27;t want anyone else to smell either. Too bad, because I really did like this product.  ----  I was skeptical because I thought this product would make my hair stiff, but no, not if you use it as directed! I do like this product for those days I don&#x27;t want my hair straight and tamed. How can I say this where I don&#x27;t sound too provocative? -- It gives me that perfect &amp;#34;bed/sex hair&amp;#34; look - the one where my very baby fine hair has a slightly messy and wavy, and thick, look to it - a little bit wild but still tame enough to go out.  Just spray the sea salt spray throughout your hair - you don&#x27;t need a lot of this product (at least I don&#x27;t, with my fine strands), work it gently in your dry hair: I squeeze my hair just a little and then let it dry. The results are that wavy full sexy look. There isn&#x27;t any drying out or stiffening of my hair, which is great. Or, you can spray it onto your wet hair, work it in, and let it dry naturally or blow it dry.  The scent is &amp;#34;beachy&amp;#34; - a coconutty scent that isn&#x27;t too over-powering, though it can seem a little strong at first. If you wear perfume (I do not), then it may clash, so I suggest working this through your hair early on before you dress.  I&#x27;ve used it on freshly washed hair, &amp;#34;day after wash&amp;#34; hair, and my wet hair - any way I&#x27;ve tried it, it works well to give me that full look to my fine hair. Just be careful; if you use too much, it will make your hair look a little &amp;#34;dirty.&amp;#34; I also try not to use it every day, so I won&#x27;t have too much build up of the product.</li>
            <li> First of all:  don&#x27;t follow the directions on the label.  I have fine extremely straight hair and when I did try using the spray with a diffuser dryer, I ended up looking like something out of a horror movie.  That said, when I used this product the second day after I had washed and styled my hair, it came out glorious!  I used a 1 inch curling iron to create some natural looking wave and instead of washing it the next day, I spritzed some of the spray through out my hair and quickly used a blast from the blow dryer to add volume.  I used this as a replacement for dry shampoo and it worked much better for that application than as a straight styling tool.  If you do have naturally curly and thick hair, this is probably a better product to use right after washing.  I tried this again after straightening my hair with an iron and again instead of washing, I used the spray as a dry shampoo.  This gave me much needed volume and felt a lot better than dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> I was pretty pessimistic about this product.  First of all, saying that it has sea salt in it was pretty off-putting to me.  I kept imagining my hair feeling the way it does when you come back from the beach - dirty.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  First of all, the smell is wonderful; a very light coconut that doesn&#x27;t heavily linger like suntan oil.  It gave my hair a great deal of body even after I use it several days in a row.  I usually have to constantly rotate my hair products because, one day my hair looks great and the next it&#x27;s heavy and greasy-looking.  I would definitely recommend this product.  I really like it.</li>
            <li> This is probably the worst beach spray I have purchased. It dried out my hair and made it frizzy. It does not smell too great either.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when purchasing this product.  I had tried many sea salt sprays and they all left my hair a frizzy mess.  This one however makes my hair nice and wavy and it stays soft.  My hair is probably thanking me for trying this product because I haven&#x27;t heat styled my hair in about 2 weeks now.  Will definitely be purchasing again.  I do wish it came in a bigger bottle-this one wont last long.</li>
            <li> Smells really great (kind of coconut-y), makes my hair look really good after a fresh shampoo, and helps create really nice waves. Be careful how much you use - too many sprays (more than 5 for my waist-length hair) makes your hair really tangled when it dries. But a light misting makes my hair look awesome. Will definitely keep using this.</li>
            <li> I love John Frieda, and have used the frizz ease products for years. I have very curly/frizzy hair already, but wanted to try to keep my beach waves after leaving the beach. I sprayed this LIBERALLY throughout my hair. It definitely left it feeling salty and tousled, but also has a super strange SMELL to it. Almost like a yeasty smell. If I had just done 2-3 spritzes I could probably handle it, but spraying it all over...I smelled repulsive</li>
            <li> I have chin length hair that is naturally curly.  I usually blow it dry and use a large curling iron.  I end up with a straight, smooth hairstyle.  However, sometimes I don&#x27;t have time for that routine and that&#x27;s when I love this product.  It gives definition and body to my fine curls.  I apply it to almost dry hair and dry lightly with a diffuser.  Perfect beachy curls/waves that last without frizzing.</li>
            <li> It took me a few applications to figure out how best to apply and if I even liked the product. My hair is blonde and fine so I figured I would not need much of the product. This proved to be wrong. I learned to apply to damp or dry hair heavily. Then I use the low and cool setting on my hair dryer to give it the windblown effect. Once I figured this out I can say that I do like this product. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it does take so much product, even for fine hair like mine, so one would have to purchase new bottles rather frequently, which can get expensive.</li>
            <li> This works differently than other similar products I&#x27;ve tried.  It doesn&#x27;t make my hair stiff, but does add some texture and bounce.  I have short hair so this is perfect for me.  It leaves my hair feeling clean - not heavy or greasy.  I like this product.</li>
            <li> I got a body wave about two months ago and it is starting to go flat.  I have been spritzing this liberally on towel dried hair and then scrunching.  I get really nice wavy body that everyone at work has complimented and it is pretty much wash and go.  Can&#x27;t get better than that.  I love the delicate coconut smell, doesn&#x27;t last all day not overpowering but a nice fresh scent in the am.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this product every summer years ago. I was so happy when they re-released it. It seems very similar the the previous product. Not sure if my hair has changed or if it just doesn&#x27;t have as much holding power, but my hair is just plain straight still. I tried the twist method for longer hair and it&#x27;s just ok. My hair does have some more texture. I added some more after it dried too. This would be great if you already have naturally curly hair. If you have straight hair and want to get some &amp;#34;beach waves&amp;#34;, it doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> This spray has a nice beach-y (coconut) smell that adds to the illusion that the waves were created during a day at the beach.  Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t end up with very beach-y waves.  My hair already has a bit of a wave when I let it air dry, so that may be why I didn&#x27;t notice much more.  It ended up being more of a texturizing/volumizing spray.</li>
            <li> As pictured. Actually came from Target, via 3rd party. My wife says it&#x27;s an OK product.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I have ever used this type of product. I am an Asian with thick, long hair, and this works wonders! It does its job exactly. I usually towel dry my hair and then spray it all over and into my roots. Then I tie my hair up in 4 different mini buns and wait an hour. After it air dries, it looks like perfect beach waves. On my dry hair, I would spray this all over and just mess my hair up. It also helps my really annoying bangs to stay in place! I love this product a lot :-).</li>
            <li> My hair is what you call difficult.  I have tons of it, it&#x27;s fine and frizzy. I decided to give this a go and was quite frankly shocked with the results.  I just washed my hair and sprayed a very generous amount in it while it was wet. Left it alone to dry. And my hair has beautiful beachy waves that look really healthy.  I absolutely recommend this!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me it didn&#x27;t works really good!i already have very dry hair and with this one dry my hair even more and after a moth using it I&#x27;ve been notice more split ends...so probably is good for people who has oily hair or at least use it a tiny bit for who has dry hair like me</li>
            <li> I do not think it is the product, it just doesn&#x27;t work for my hair. It does provide me with some curl but then it falls with time (1 to 2 hrs).</li>
            <li> Did nothing other than make my hair feel coarse. Bummer.</li>
            <li> Tried it with damp hair, dry hair and wet hair but just makes my hair frizzy not one bit like the advert. I&#x27;m trying not to call it rubbish so I&#x27;ll just say I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> I didnt notice anything special about this product. Seems like any other product I buy claiming to do something extra for my hair only to disappoint and waste my money. I will try it one more time to see if anythings different . If so then I will update my post just to be fair.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews raving about this stuff I just had to give it a try.  I use sea salt sprays all the time to get the wave to come out in my hair.  This is not the best one I have ever used.  It is just okay.  Works but not as good as cheaper supermarket brands like Fructis.  I was disappointed and would not bother buying it again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it. Nothing like original. So sad.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  Have a lot of hair but not much body.  This product makes my hair fuller and not lay flat to my head.</li>
            <li> A great sea salt/texturizing spray that isn&#x27;t too heavy or sticky. I will buy this one again. Also a good price.</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with John Freida Sea Spray.  It arrived very quickly, and I use it every day. Very good hair product .</li>
            <li> This hair product did not work out for me.  I don&#x27;t hate it but I don&#x27;t love it.  I think it&#x27;s a youthful look and I am not young.  My hair is short, thick, fine, dark brown, and beginning to gray.  I get the concept, I spent the first 44 years of my life on the east coast of south Florida  and am fond of the day at the beach look.  And this product does an excellent job of replicating it.  But at 61 the look doesn&#x27;t fit.  And I much prefer to run my fingers through silky smooth hair than matte hair.</li>
            <li> I sprayed the John Frieda Beach Blonde Sea Waves liberally over my hair and was not overly impressed.  This has a very strong beachy smell which at first smells great but a little goes a very long way.  I found the smell to be a bit overwhelming.  My shoulder length hair is fine and it did not appear wavy at all after using this product.  In fact I saw very little difference.  It did have a little more body but not much else.</li>
            <li> This spray ( I used it on dry and wet hair) left my hair shiny and texturized. I like the effect on already dried hair more than used on wet because my hair is very thin and curly and it make it hard to style. On the dry hair though I just sprayed and scrunched and t looked amazing!</li>
            <li> Sort of works but not really much different than air drying.  Also, it dried out my hair so horribly, it took me about a week to get the moisture back in it.  I like the idea but it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
            <li> I knew this wouldn&#x27;t last long once it was unwrapped. My wife and daughter (right on the heels of snatching away my John Freida anit-frizz hair spray) snapped up this sea salt spray as well. Which actually, I had no idea what this way when I ordered it, (I thought it was some kind of spray on styling gel?) and my hair is pretty short so I have no need for this curling product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter loves this spray, she says it reminds her of Myrtle Beach, and she&#x27;s right! This spray has a sun lotion-y coconut smell which immediately makes you think of sandy beaches and sitting poolside. She has long wavy hair and was excited to try this out. The spray did keep her curls and waves even in this dry mid-January air, and she loved the scent.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!!! I have naturally curly hair but often straighten it. With a new baby, spraying this in and leaving my hair semi-wavy is sooo much easier. It doesn&#x27;t make hair oily or crunchy but adds lots of volume. Will definitely be stocking up on this stuff!</li>
            <li> JUNK - NOT THE SAME AS THE ORIGINAL!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does NOTHING to my thick hair (the old stuff did wonders)&lt;br /&gt;This stuff smells like fake suntan scent - the old stuff smelled like the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BRING BACK OUR BEACH WAVES!</li>
            <li> I have long fine hair that is naturally wavy, but sometimes needs some encouragement. I sprayed a tiny bit of this into my hair, and it looked wavy for about an hour. When it dried completely (naturally dried, not blow dried), it was like straw—dry, but with sticky residue. Horrible stuff. Really downgraded the condition of my hair. I never used the original formula, but I doubt it could have been this bad and had such a cult following. this is going in the trash.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and works well.</li>
            <li> This is a light product that won&#x27;t weigh down your hair but if you have used and enjoyed sea salt hair products before, you might be disappointed. I tried this on wet, towel-dried, and dry hair and it gave me a little texture with the dry hair only. I used one of these beachy waves sea salt product several years ago and loved it. But this one dried out my hair and it really gave my hair very little texture. I have thick, wavy hair and sea spray can make it look amazing, just not this one.</li>
            <li> I have really weirdly textured hair. It&#x27;s extremely thick, extremely coarse, extremely frizz-prone and it&#x27;s not quite wavy and not quite straight. Honestly, half the time, if I don&#x27;t carefully blow out and straighten, I feel like cousin it. No more. I just tested out Sea Waves. I tried it out for two weeks, and it is a MIRACLE for hair like mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just wash, spritz, and go. When you&#x27;re hair air dries, you&#x27;ll have loose, gorgeous, beachy waves. Or even better, wash your hair, and go to sleep. You&#x27;ll wake up with perfect bedhead! Even better, if you&#x27;re feeling lazy, and wake w/ bad hair, skip a wash and spritz this in. A few minutes later, your waves are revitalized. Just give your hair a good shake and you&#x27;re ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff. My one complaint? I need a bigger bottle!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got long, color-treated, wavy and somewhat frizzy hair... IF I DON&#x27;T BLOW DRY IT STRAIGHT.  So the thought of washing my hair, spraying it with this John Frieda Beach Blonde Sea Waves Sea Salt Spray and letting it air dry gave me hives.  I&#x27;d simply waste a good hair washing for nothing!  I was up for the challenge and I&#x27;m always excited about the thought of a new hair style that doesn&#x27;t require me to spend the required 25 minutes blowdrying it.  So after following the directions on the bottle I realized I already knew what I already knew!  This type of product doesn&#x27;t work for me.  There is a high probability that I sprayed too much product in my hair though.  I didn&#x27;t like the feel that is was sticky and just plain felt dirty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did love the smell of the product and it made me a sad that I wasn&#x27;t going to enjoy this product from here on out.  The next day I decided to re-wash, blow dry and style it as usual PLUS do a few spritzes of the product afterwards and I&#x27;m pleased to announce that it was a success when using it in this manner.  With the type of hair I have, following the directions on the bottle didn&#x27;t work for me.  Guessing that someone with natural curls would have better luck.</li>
            <li> Love it... Waited 10 years for this to come back</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product, but I can&#x27;t. Interestingly, they made a similar one many years ago and I was disappointed in that one too. For the life of me, I just can&#x27;t get the waves it promises. I do get texture, and great smelling hair, but there&#x27;s no mermaid action going on here. For the record, I do have pretty thick, long hair, though, so maybe it would work better on people with easier hair to work with.</li>
            <li> This is an okay product.  It just left my hair too dried out looking and more frizzy.  Good product though if you are at the beach and want your hair to have that look.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have both enjoyed using this product.  Nice, summery scent and holds waves well.  Easy to use, and not sticky.</li>
            <li> Was disappointed it didn&#x27;t give me the love I was hoping.  I have VERY thick hair, that is extremely wavy all over except a few sections in the front.  My first attempt was to put this in damp hair after showering.  I brushed my hair as usually, and let it air dry for a bit to get the waves really showing.  I sprayed this in my hair and followed the directions to twist and play with my hair in bunches to make it wavy.  After a few minutes my hair was so clammy and gross I couldn&#x27;t even put my fingers through it.  I even had a hard time putting it in a poly tail.  My second attempt was after I had blow dried, flat ironed and curled it.  I sprayed the product in separated sections, did a little twisting and let it fall naturally.  this was a slightly better outcome, but not anywhere near my hopes.  my hair would have stayed better with the curlers/curling iron alone.  Chalk this up to another product fail.  Guess natural is the only way to go for this girl:(</li>
            <li> Was so excited to see they brought this product back, only to find they actually just released a new product.  Doesn&#x27;t smell anywhere near as good as the original and it doesn&#x27;t work as well.  What a letdown!&lt;br /&gt;Sedu makes one that you shake to mix like the original ocean waves.  It smells and works like the original.  I&#x27;ll stick with it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m just using this wrong or what the deal is...each time I try it my hair looks greasy, I&#x27;ve used it on wet &amp; dry hair, not beach wavy at all!  I&#x27;ll use it a few more times or google it and see if it works better but it will probably be a product that sits on my shelf until I throw it out.  Smells pretty good, just not at all what I expected.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair styler of my long life! I just opened my second bottle and ordered two more on a new subscribe and save subscription. I have fine, wavy hair that I generally blow dry and straighten. This summer the humidity was making my hair impossible to dry, so i decided to make the most of what I have. My daughter recommended this. Possibly I&#x27;ve never been happier with my hair. After washing, spraying, scrunching and air-drying, my hair is honestly enviable, a claim I even hesitate to make anonymously. It&#x27;s thick and with a gentle curl. Love it!</li>
            <li> Was so happy to see this come back on the market. Amazon was out of stock but I was able to find the product locally. Unfortunately it is not the same product as before. The smell is a bit off and it doesn&#x27;t work as well as the original.</li>
            <li> The greatest for a natural, wavy look. I used to bring home water from the beach and keep it in a bottle in the fridge to use it as spritz on my hair to give it  a little texture.  Then I started using John Frieda&#x27;s coconut smelling Salt Spray and it was heaven. It disappeared from the shelves for a while with company reps claiming it was replaced with another. I never found any replacement to be as good as this stuff and I kept my half filled, old bottle in the freezer. The salt adds volume but Frieda adds other ingredients that keep my hair shiny and soft at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;Grab it while you can and store some in the freezer, just in case.  Really Good Stuff!</li>
            <li> I fine, flat hair but plenty of it and so does my daughter.  The poor child does not like her straight hair any more than I did when I was younger.  I just wanted a little volume and texture to my hair so this is working for my needs.  I like the look that it creates and keeps me from getting the dreaded helmet head that so often plagues those with my hair type.  I feel that it gives my style an edgy look.  My daughter is beyond thrilled with the results on her hair.  She is getting more of a wavy effect than I am which is probably because her hair is longer.  We will return for more when this bottle is gone.  We do not mind the smell either.  It is a coconut smell but we did not find it to be overpowering.</li>
            <li> John Frieda Beach Blonde Sea Waves Sea Salt is a light spray with a mild scent. It allows my hair to frizz less and perks up dull locks. It doesn&#x27;t have enough punch to give me a tousled look or to hold my curls, but it works for mild curl days and freshens my thick hair.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers have said, this spray isn&#x27;t some miracle product that will magically transform your hair into post-beach perfection. You definitely will have to style and smooth your hair on your own, BUT this spray really does help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually ended up spraying this on my damp hair and then braiding it almost immediately after. In a few hours, my hair was dry and then, when I took my hair down, it had that perfect beachy texture. And because the product is kind of like a hair spray, I was able to keep my hair wavy but not frizzy for much longer than would have normally been possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m happy with it overall. Just know that you will have to work with the product a little bit. Also, while this product smells really great, be aware that it does contain some less than desirable ingredients like sulfates and and artificial fragrances, etc.</li>
            <li> John Frieda makes products which are super unique and special.&lt;br /&gt;Here I am in the midst of one of our toughest winters yet, and I might as well be luxuriating near a tropical beach,under a big, colorful sun umbrella.&lt;br /&gt;Why?  Because he has concocted a yummy smelling(coconut and pineapple) hair treatment like nothing I have ever used before.Also,&lt;br /&gt;it seems as it everyone wants the wild and tousled look at the moment. Spray some of this on your hair and the smell coupled with Nature&#x27;s waves will make you feel divine.&lt;br /&gt;Head off to the islands! Enjoy your time in the fabulous gorgeous water and emerge looking like Bottecelli&#x27;s Venus and smelling delicious!&lt;br /&gt;Empower yourself all day long, everyday! Yummy and chic.</li>
            <li> It smells like the beach!! I absolutely love this!!</li>
