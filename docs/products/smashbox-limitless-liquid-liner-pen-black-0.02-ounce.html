            <li>Wonderful product and thank you!</li>
            <li>Wonderful wonderful.</li>
            <li>Use this to create wonderful art on the body.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to mac today for some fluidline because I&#x27;ve heard great things about it.</li>
            <li>Great products.</li>
            <li>Put powder eyeshadow over it, that works great.</li>
            <li>Great.</li>
            <li>This product is great.</li>
            <li>Dries very fast, great for beginners and excellent for professionals.</li>
            <li>I tested many many liquid eyeliners and this one is the best.  </li>
            <li>- well it is very precise and does not deposit a ton of liquid, making me a raccoon!  </li>
            <li>, the tip doesn&#x27;t go on as smoothly and really isn&#x27;t ideal for people like me who use it as part of a smoky eye regimen.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>this wonderful new found eyeliner glory and then</li>
            <li>If this is acceptable to you for the price, then you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Why I love it better than others??</li>
            <li>but I still love it.</li>
            <li>For a better liquid eyeliner pen, try Stila.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t apply most liners.</li>
            <li>You basically fall in love with the ease and boldness of this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I really liked it at first, it was easy to put on and looked amazing</li>
            <li>Or, for a better experience altogether, I would strongly recommend the Stila Smudge Pot (waterproof gel) with a precision brush instead.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily.</li>
            <li>You get excited to wear</li>
            <li>Instead it deposits just the right amount of liquid in a precise easy to control line.</li>
            <li>Love smashbox and this pen!!&lt;br /&gt;just be careful not to apply it onto ur eye shadow, but if you do make sure you clean it before putting it away for example taking the pen and marking your wrist or hand so that you wipe away any excess eyeshadow!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased this eyeliner in a Sephora before and it lasted months, was easy to apply and was very bold and vivid.  </li>
            <li>Dark brown is amazing too!</li>
            <li>The first month, it&#x27;s the only eye liner I used as it worked great, giving you a nice thin smooth line.</li>
            <li>This is not the first time I&#x27;ve ordered it</li>
            <li>I bought it twice as I thought the first time was just a freak thing.</li>
            <li>The product &amp;#34;IS&amp;#34; exactly as described &amp; I don&#x27;t believe the box had &amp;#60;ever been opened&amp;#62; ;-)</li>
            <li>The liquid dries so fast!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fell SO IN LOVE with this eyeliner, I decided to take it back.</li>
            <li>This eyeliner creates a precise line and really does last all day.  </li>
            <li>Very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li>I have always had problems with liquid eyeliner smearing because I have very oily skin which includes eyelids.  </li>
            <li>That would&#x27;ve been better than spending the same amount of money for the second time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely long-lasting throughout the day, but the applicator gets dry very easily and it doesn&#x27;t flow like it should.</li>
            <li>I would say that the two are comparable as far as wear and waterproofness goes, but for being more expensive, I expected more out of smashbox!  </li>
            <li>but no - this is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased it and after the first couple of weeks</li>
            <li>Pretty dark bold black liner liner that wears well for hours,</li>
            <li>I do have a major problem with the applicator though now that I&#x27;ve been using it for a month.  </li>
            <li>I use powder eyeshadow under my eyeliner and it seems that this majorly dries up the sponge tipped applicator.  </li>
            <li>I wish you could pump more out for thin, under eye, lines</li>
            <li>The cap pops off so it dried up right away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just going to compare this eyeliner to stila, because it is the only other high end waterproof liquid eyeliner I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I really did love this product however the tip of it becomes somewhat limp after just a short time and makes it difficult to use.</li>
            <li> As long as I touch up my oil regularly this doesnt budge.</li>
            <li> but I had only had it for a month before it started to run low and wouldn&#x27;t draw as dark a line.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to sit and dry my eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I only wore it every few days, so I&#x27;d say I got 10-15 uses before it began to fade.</li>
            <li> Fluis is harder to control than a pencil product.</li>
            <li> as the other reviewer did, this would not work for any liquid eyeliner!  </li>
            <li> comes out to heavy and there is no control knob to control the flow of the liner</li>
            <li> The one I purchased from amazon was nearly dried out when I received it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is smashbox&#x27;s fault or the sellers fault, but my eyeliner dried out and was unusable within a month of buying it.</li>
            <li> It seems the applicator dried out or something.</li>
            <li> Yupp, you read that right, I went back to a terrible relationship.</li>
            <li> I am pretty disappointed and decided to purchase something else instead.</li>
            <li> so I take my eyeliner seriously!  </li>
            <li> But that being said, it is somewhat expensive for just one month of use.</li>

            <li> comes out to heavy and there is no control knob to control the flow of the liner</li>
            <li> Pretty dark bold black liner liner that wears well for hours, but I had only had it for a month before it started to run low and wouldn&#x27;t draw as dark a line. You know how they get when pen liners run low. I only wore it every few days, so I&#x27;d say I got 10-15 uses before it began to fade. If this is acceptable to you for the price, then you&#x27;ll love it. Personally,  I may try try another from from a product line along a similar price range revise this review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just going to compare this eyeliner to stila, because it is the only other high end waterproof liquid eyeliner I&#x27;ve used.  I wear winged eyeliner every day and it&#x27;s totally my trademark, so I take my eyeliner seriously!  This eyeliner creates a precise line and really does last all day.  I go swimming with this liner and it does not budge.  I do have a major problem with the applicator though now that I&#x27;ve been using it for a month.  I use powder eyeshadow under my eyeliner and it seems that this majorly dries up the sponge tipped applicator.  After one month&#x27;s use, the product is not usable at all!  I used my stila eyeliner daily for over six months without any problems.  I would say that the two are comparable as far as wear and waterproofness goes, but for being more expensive, I expected more out of smashbox!  I&#x27;m going to mac today for some fluidline because I&#x27;ve heard great things about it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this eyeliner in a Sephora before and it lasted months, was easy to apply and was very bold and vivid.  The one I purchased from amazon was nearly dried out when I received it and I could only use it for a couple of days.  Very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> I love this product. This is not the first time I&#x27;ve ordered it and I will order from the Smashbox line again. Great products.</li>
            <li> I really did love this product however the tip of it becomes somewhat limp after just a short time and makes it difficult to use. I bought it twice as I thought the first time was just a freak thing. The first month, it&#x27;s the only eye liner I used as it worked great, giving you a nice thin smooth line. But that being said, it is somewhat expensive for just one month of use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is smashbox&#x27;s fault or the sellers fault, but my eyeliner dried out and was unusable within a month of buying it.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product or this seller who I will defiantly use again! The product &amp;#34;IS&amp;#34; exactly as described &amp; I don&#x27;t believe the box had &amp;#60;ever been opened&amp;#62; ;-)</li>
            <li> I put this on my wishlist and my grandma bought it for me for Christmas. I really liked it at first, it was easy to put on and looked amazing but after about two weeks of daily use it doesn&#x27;t apply well anymore. No matter how much I shake it before I put it on, it goes on way too lightly or not at all. I am pretty disappointed and decided to purchase something else instead. It seems the applicator dried out or something.</li>
            <li> I tested many many liquid eyeliners and this one is the best.  But do not put powder eyeshadow UNDER it, as the other reviewer did, this would not work for any liquid eyeliner!  Put powder eyeshadow over it, that works great. Why I love it better than others?? - well it is very precise and does not deposit a ton of liquid, making me a raccoon!  Instead it deposits just the right amount of liquid in a precise easy to control line.</li>
            <li> Low this! I wish you could pump more out for thin, under eye, lines but I still love it. Dark brown is amazing too!</li>
            <li> Fluis is harder to control than a pencil product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely long-lasting throughout the day, but the applicator gets dry very easily and it doesn&#x27;t flow like it should. I would say perhaps I just got a defective stick but no - this is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased it and after the first couple of weeks, the tip doesn&#x27;t go on as smoothly and really isn&#x27;t ideal for people like me who use it as part of a smoky eye regimen. For a better liquid eyeliner pen, try Stila. Or, for a better experience altogether, I would strongly recommend the Stila Smudge Pot (waterproof gel) with a precision brush instead.</li>
            <li> I have always had problems with liquid eyeliner smearing because I have very oily skin which includes eyelids.  I love this stuff! As long as I touch up my oil regularly this doesnt budge.</li>
            <li> The cap pops off so it dried up right away. The product was defective and I believe that&#x27;s why it was sold.</li>
            <li> Love smashbox and this pen!!&lt;br /&gt;just be careful not to apply it onto ur eye shadow, but if you do make sure you clean it before putting it away for example taking the pen and marking your wrist or hand so that you wipe away any excess eyeshadow!</li>
            <li> Easy to use. I can&#x27;t apply most liners. But this one is like using a pen.</li>
            <li> Great. The liquid dries so fast! I don&#x27;t have to sit and dry my eyeliner. Wonderful product and thank you!</li>
            <li> This product is great. It goes on easily. Wonderful wonderful. Use this to create wonderful art on the body. Dries very fast, great for beginners and excellent for professionals.</li>
            <li> The bestway to describe this eyeliner is &amp;#34;deceitful love&amp;#34;. It reminds me of a summer fling almost. You basically fall in love with the ease and boldness of this eyeliner. It takes your breath away almost. You get excited to wear so you wear it every day and it is this wonderful new found eyeliner glory and then... POOF. It begins running out after 6 weeks. le sigh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fell SO IN LOVE with this eyeliner, I decided to take it back. Yupp, you read that right, I went back to a terrible relationship. I thought it was me. I thought I bought a &amp;#34;lemon&amp;#34; eyeliner. SAME THING HAPPENED AGAIN. I should&#x27;ve banged my head into a brick wall. That would&#x27;ve been better than spending the same amount of money for the second time. I am moving on to benefit push-up gel liner. Let&#x27;s see how this one goes...</li>
