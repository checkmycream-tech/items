            <li>Thank you again for making this product available.</li>
            <li>Overall its a great product</li>
            <li>My old wigs still looks good after 6 months or longer.</li>
            <li>Excellent leave in conditioner for synthetic and natural human hair.  </li>
            <li>I definitely recommend a good light holding gel and curl treatment to maintain your hair...or some type of treatment period.  </li>
            <li>It smells incredibly fresh &amp; clean, helps to detangle &amp; soften.</li>
            <li>I buy a fresh pack of hair every 6 months</li>
            <li>I bought this product because my hairdresser said it was a must have, and she was right.</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying Bobo&#x27;s leave in conditioner, and I can honestly say that I saw definite results after just one application.</li>
            <li>4 weeks after I installed my extension, it was very dry and tangle very easy.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do much for mine.  </li>
            <li>Reasonable price and very affordable.</li>
            <li>I never realized how much work</li>
            <li>I was use to maintain my hair, my real hair touches my shoulders, I just wanted something easier to maintain while I was in school...</li>
            <li>I cant really pinpoint the type of fragrance used</li>
            <li>&quot; look, and if thats what you are going for the great, but I am a person that shuttles back and forth to school and having to brush my hair every time I entered a building was getting old quick, my real hair was not that much trouble!  </li>
            <li>It goes a long way and makes my hair feel fabulous.</li>
            <li>I love how you can spray it directly on your hair and it does not give you a greasy feeling or too wet look.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>but if you are reading this take that with a grain of salt because I have a sensitive nose and cant tolerate certain fragrances.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t do much from natural hair, but does wonders for wigs/weaves and completely revitalize your hair pieces.</li>
            <li>Just sprayed 2 times on my natural hair.</li>
            <li>For all long hair girls that your hair gets tangled - I highly suggest this!</li>
            <li>I use no other products but the Bobos Remi line.</li>
            <li>I used it on both synthetic hair, as well as, natural hair that has been over processed and it made the hair instantly softer and easier to work with.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m constantly getting complements on how soft and shiny</li>
            <li>I have long natural wavy hair and use it every day</li>

            <li> I have long natural wavy hair and use it every day</li>
            <li> this is just as much work if not more.  </li>
            <li> I straighten my hair with a flat iron to cover over my weave.</li>
            <li> This just aids in keeping my hair last for a long, long time.</li>
            <li> have extremely thick hair, meaning if I didn&#x27;t straighten it, it would look like a straight Afro with no curls.</li>
            <li> Well definitely recommend to friends and other who wear an weave</li>
            <li> I spray this in and leave to air dry.</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t get dry and brittle or tangle...</li>
            <li> Two weeks ago my extensions were dried and I wanted to remove them and now, after I bought bobos, I am planning to use the same hair!</li>
            <li> Other tips</li>
            <li> I think that for the average person the smell would not be all that bad and some might really like the smell, but for me it was just a little too much.</li>
            <li> I spray a little on in the morning</li>
            <li> but it is not where near as bad as before as previously stated this will help with the tangles definitely.</li>
            <li> I purchased a bottle a few months ago.</li>
            <li> I use bobos everyday in the morning before going to work and I also use &amp;#34;mane &#x27;n tail&amp;#34; at night when I get home.</li>
            <li> Only bad thing is I can never find it at our local ulta or beauty supply store!</li>
            <li> not sure yet how it holds up against heat, rain, or over time.</li>
            <li> Use Motions to shampoo and condition when you wash your weave at least monthly.</li>
            <li> This is unbelievable!</li>
            <li> I was wrong</li>
            <li> It could be that I am using it wrong</li>
            <li> bad product!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> great hair and wig product for all hair types</li>
            <li> This spray works perfect for detangling hair weave, it leaves a brilliant shine and makes the hair look natural love BoBo&#x27;s.....</li>
            <li> I bought this product because my hairdresser said it was a must have, and she was right. I love how you can spray it directly on your hair and it does not give you a greasy feeling or too wet look. It was a great price compared to the hair stores in my area</li>
            <li> This just aids in keeping my hair last for a long, long time. I make wigs, and I maintain them for others. I wash in Silicon Mix and condition with the same. I spray this in and leave to air dry. No tangles, smells good, and does what it says it does. I use it on both remy and virgin hair.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I discovered this product. If you wear hair weave that is human hair, you need this spray conditioner. I use no other products but the Bobos Remi line. I use this and the Bobos Remi Argan oil. That&#x27;s it! My hair doesn&#x27;t get dry and brittle or tangle...ever! I wash and reuse my weave over and over now. I buy a fresh pack of hair every 6 months but I could go longer. This conditioner keeps the hair smooth and healthy. Other tips: I wear a satin cap at night to protect the hair as well. Use Motions to shampoo and condition when you wash your weave at least monthly.</li>
            <li> Pretty awesome.  Wish I would have found this years ago.  Helped rejuvenate some &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; hair I was planning on pitching out.</li>
            <li> This provides a nice, light leave-in treatment and it smells great! You do not need a lot. It goes a long way and makes my hair feel fabulous. For all long hair girls that your hair gets tangled - I highly suggest this! I know it&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;big name&amp;#34; brand, but it is much better than any of those that I have tried.</li>
            <li> I purchased a bottle a few months ago. I love this product. I had to purchase again so soon because the TSA confiscated mine at the airport. I forgot about the size of the bottle that was allowed. Thank you again for making this product available. If you wear synthetic wigs this is very good for them, too. My old wigs still looks good after 6 months or longer. This is all I use on my wigs.</li>
            <li> Excellent leave in conditioner for synthetic and natural human hair.  Bobo&#x27;s detangles without leaving oily residue build-up on the hair.</li>
            <li> my friend asked me to order it for her  as this is the only conditioner she will use on her wigs</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t do much from natural hair, but does wonders for wigs/weaves and completely revitalize your hair pieces. The smell is out of this world</li>
            <li> Just sprayed 2 times on my natural hair. And this product actually straighten my roots more.&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely thick hair, meaning if I didn&#x27;t straighten it, it would look like a straight Afro with no curls. I straighten my hair with a flat iron to cover over my weave. So when I sprayed this product only 2x and saw a difference within 2 minutes, I can officially say I&#x27;m betting a couple bottles for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does not feel greasy. It&#x27;s very light almost like water but you can see and feel the difference in the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I have only had this in for about 10 minutes not sure yet how it holds up against heat, rain, or over time.</li>
            <li> my wife loves this spray for her remi hair, she bought two more bottles while in tulsa, will order again when before she runs out</li>
            <li> I use a lot of synthetic wigs, hair pieces, etc.  This was suggested by several youtube gurus as something to use to keep the wig from losing it&#x27;s shape.  Didn&#x27;t do much for mine.  My wigs tend to be wavy curly hair.  Oh, well.</li>
            <li> Tangles hair!&lt;br /&gt;Very bad product!</li>
            <li> I use this product on my sew in weave. It bring back life to my weave.  Reasonable price and very affordable. Well definitely recommend to friends and other who wear an weave</li>
            <li> Great product.  Love it.</li>
            <li> it makes my hair shine and does not tangle at all!!!!!!!!Five star</li>
            <li> This leave-in conditioner works great.  I use it on my wavy indian remy weave that tends to tangle quit a bit.  I spray a little on in the morning and I am able to comb through with no problems. I will definately order this again.</li>
            <li> 4 weeks after I installed my extension, it was very dry and tangle very easy. I heard about bobos in youtube and decided to give it a try.  I have to say, I am very pleased. My extensions look great! I use bobos everyday in the morning before going to work and I also use &amp;#34;mane &#x27;n tail&amp;#34; at night when I get home. I am even thinking about re-using this hair.  This is unbelievable! Two weeks ago my extensions were dried and I wanted to remove them and now, after I bought bobos, I am planning to use the same hair! I definitely recommend bobos.</li>
            <li> Yes I guess I could go by some detangler but this product has definitely saved my 200+ investment I never realized how much work a sew-in could be!  I was use to maintain my hair, my real hair touches my shoulders, I just wanted something easier to maintain while I was in school...I was wrong this is just as much work if not more.  However this is not the end to all the problems...I definitely recommend a good light holding gel and curl treatment to maintain your hair...or some type of treatment period.  Just using this can create the \\&quot;blow away\\&quot; look, and if thats what you are going for the great, but I am a person that shuttles back and forth to school and having to brush my hair every time I entered a building was getting old quick, my real hair was not that much trouble!  Once I discovered how to combine the products yes I still feel that its necessary to carry a brush but it is not where near as bad as before as previously stated this will help with the tangles definitely.</li>
            <li> I love to use this conditioner to help maintain and freshen my weave. It smells incredibly fresh &amp; clean, helps to detangle &amp; soften.</li>
            <li> I tried this product 3 times and it didn&#x27;t do the job such as giving your weaves back to life. It could be that I am using it wrong or it don&#x27;t go well with the shampoo and conditioner I am using. But Try it it may work for you and your hair</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying Bobo&#x27;s leave in conditioner, and I can honestly say that I saw definite results after just one application. I used it on both synthetic hair, as well as, natural hair that has been over processed and it made the hair instantly softer and easier to work with. I personally do not like the smell...but if you are reading this take that with a grain of salt because I have a sensitive nose and cant tolerate certain fragrances. I think that for the average person the smell would not be all that bad and some might really like the smell, but for me it was just a little too much. I cant really pinpoint the type of fragrance used but it smells some what earthy. Overall its a great product and I look forward to experimenting with reviving different types of hair using this!</li>
            <li> I loooove this stuff! I have long natural wavy hair and use it every day and I&#x27;m constantly getting complements on how soft and shiny my hair looks and feels. Only bad thing is I can never find it at our local ulta or beauty supply store! Booo but jus make sure to order b4 u run out like me lol ! Give it a try!!</li>
            <li> The best spray for my human hair wigs I have ever used.  I highly recommend this product.  I have purchased 4 bottles so I won&#x27;t run out!</li>
