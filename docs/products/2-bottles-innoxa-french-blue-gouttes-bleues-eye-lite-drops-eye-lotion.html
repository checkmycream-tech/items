    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>VERY HAPPY!!!</li>
            <li>Glad I bought 2 bottles!!!</li>
            <li>The price was very fair and the delivery was prompt.</li>
            <li>This is a great eye drop...</li>
            <li>The product itself is great, but the packaging leaves something to be desired.  </li>
            <li>These drops feel very nice and soothing to my eyes.</li>
            <li>It works amazing.</li>
            <li>I liked the description</li>
            <li>Introduced to this product by a top Parisian makeup artist.</li>
            <li>I love this.  </li>
            <li>Love them using for years</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>I was expecting (and wanted) a product more like the collyre bleu drops.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I decided to try them!&lt;br /&gt;Worth the money for me.</li>
            <li>My eyes are more sparkling and look fresher.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Best blue eydrops around.  </li>
            <li>I am 50 years old, have great eyes</li>
            <li>Most eye drops burn my eyes, these beautiful blue drops did nothing except soothe!  </li>
            <li>If you use it for a longer time, eyes feel more comfortable, somehow relaxed.</li>
            <li>My friend experienced the same result.</li>
            <li>Yes, the drops are a blue eyedrop lotion and its great.</li>
            <li>but, I didn&#x27;t know that I would love these drops so much!</li>
            <li>notice any significant changes after using this product.</li>
            <li>Innoxa eyedrops are superior to OTC products such as Visine.</li>
            <li>Works great, few comfortable after and eyes are brighter</li>
            <li>They were fun to try, but I doubt I would bother purchasing them again.  </li>
            <li>my in-law loves this product, she swears it helps her eyes, the fact that this is all natural is even better  bk WA</li>
            <li>Innoxa is the right help.</li>
            <li>I think they make my eyes a bit more sparkly, but not in a major way.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it has a functional pliable blue dropper to place the drops gently and kindly with zero risk of injury by the user.</li>
            <li>The drops did make my eyes feel like they were more open, but did nothing to take away any redness or improve the whites of my eyes.</li>
            <li>, my husband said his eyes felt better but no different than visine.</li>
            <li>But who knows, maybe if you have blue eyes they will work better for you.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, but I feel it&#x27;s way overpriced (again, compared with the Quebec variety, which I can&#x27;t find outside that province).</li>
            <li>Further, I don&#x27;t see any difference whatsoever after using it, and I have, based on retoucher-tests, a 100% accurate color vision.  </li>
            <li>These French blue don&#x27;t whiten your eyes at all but do feel really nice in the eye.</li>
            <li>A pure plant based natural beauty product that really works!</li>
            <li>that was due more to the description that the product itself.</li>
            <li>The product makes your eyes feel nicely hydrated and has a shooting effect but is too expensive if you have to buy a bottle every two weeks and other products can do the same just as good.</li>
            <li>If you want do want the best for your eyes, then be sure to buy something gross like Visine with its cold hard plastic applicator whereby you run the risk of eye injury during application.</li>
            <li>i thought these were going to be like the blue drops that hollywood makeup artists use, but these are more like plain water with blue food coloring added</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, allergy eyes that are always red.</li>

            <li> Soothing active ingredient Azulene (Blue Chamomile) moisturizes dry eyes and makes redness go away.</li>
            <li> The directions (on the bottle in small print, not on the box that I had to break open) say to use it up in 2 weeks of breaking the seal and to use it several times a day.</li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money...</li>
            <li> I painstakingly cleaned the dropper and lid with bleach and that solved the problem for a few days and then it happened again.  </li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d try these drops, even though I have green eyes.  </li>
            <li> They say they can be used with any color eyes, so I was hoping they would make the whites of my eyes clearer, enhancing the green.  </li>
            <li> Also, they are messy and can stain.</li>
            <li> The bottle is impossible to transport cleanly (not sealed well since the applicator is a cow udder) and the liquid is blue</li>
            <li> After a few weeks we both noticed an unpleasant smell coming from the lid and dropper area.  </li>
            <li> OTC products burn my eyes and fail to provide the clarity and relief for which they are intended.</li>
            <li> Disappointed, wont buy it again.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> There alright nothing big</li>
            <li> This is a great eye drop...I have been waiting to receive it though...have sent notice to sender---no word yet as to where my drops are...will contact credit card since they have not returned my inquire as to delivery.</li>
            <li> My friend and I placed the order and found that the drops did nothing for either of us. The drops did make my eyes feel like they were more open, but did nothing to take away any redness or improve the whites of my eyes. My friend experienced the same result. Don&#x27;t waste your money...</li>
            <li> The directions (on the bottle in small print, not on the box that I had to break open) say to use it up in 2 weeks of breaking the seal and to use it several times a day. The bottle is impossible to transport cleanly (not sealed well since the applicator is a cow udder) and the liquid is blue so don&#x27;t flip it in your purse and don&#x27;t wear white.    I felt and saw no difference, my husband said his eyes felt better but no different than visine.</li>
            <li> Soothing active ingredient Azulene (Blue Chamomile) moisturizes dry eyes and makes redness go away. A pure plant based natural beauty product that really works! Introduced to this product by a top Parisian makeup artist. I&#x27;ve seen this in makeup bags of models, stylists and beauty insiders.</li>
            <li> I wish the seller listed the fact that the product states \\&quot;use within 15 days after opening\\&quot;.  Further, I don&#x27;t see any difference whatsoever after using it, and I have, based on retoucher-tests, a 100% accurate color vision.  The product makes your eyes feel nicely hydrated and has a shooting effect but is too expensive if you have to buy a bottle every two weeks and other products can do the same just as good.</li>
            <li> I liked the description but, I didn&#x27;t know that I would love these drops so much! Glad I bought 2 bottles!!!</li>
            <li> I would probably not purchase this product again.  The product itself is great, but the packaging leaves something to be desired.  I gave one bottle to my sister and kept the other for myself.  After a few weeks we both noticed an unpleasant smell coming from the lid and dropper area.  I painstakingly cleaned the dropper and lid with bleach and that solved the problem for a few days and then it happened again.  I ended up just throwing them away</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d try these drops, even though I have green eyes.  They say they can be used with any color eyes, so I was hoping they would make the whites of my eyes clearer, enhancing the green.  I think they make my eyes a bit more sparkly, but not in a major way.  They were fun to try, but I doubt I would bother purchasing them again.  But who knows, maybe if you have blue eyes they will work better for you.  Give &#x27;em a try!</li>
            <li> I love this.  The only drops that do not sting my eyes and totally removes the redness which in turn makes eyes sparkle. I will not live without these and amazon is one of the few places that has them.</li>
            <li> I was expecting snow white eyes, like some kkind of miracle eye-whitener. But it isnt. Disappointed, wont buy it again.</li>
            <li> my in-law loves this product, she swears it helps her eyes, the fact that this is all natural is even better  bk WA</li>
            <li> This product does not work as stated in the advertizement. I did&lt;br /&gt;not notice any significant changes after using this product.</li>
            <li> i thought these were going to be like the blue drops that hollywood makeup artists use, but these are more like plain water with blue food coloring added</li>
            <li> Innoxa eyedrops are superior to OTC products such as Visine. OTC products burn my eyes and fail to provide the clarity and relief for which they are intended. Currently, the pollen is so thick where I live (Houston) that everyone is looking for relief. Innoxa drops are lotion drops relieve irritation, soothe and provide continual relief throughout the day. You&#x27;ll feel the difference immediately and your eyes will relax. Sometimes we become so overtaxed or ill over a long period of time that we don&#x27;t realize how compromised we are until we receive the right help. Innoxa is the right help. I am 50 years old, have great eyes but Innoxa makes my eyes  look brighter. This product eliminiates the red and actually brightens the eye. Yes, the drops are a blue eyedrop lotion and its great. Yes, it has a functional pliable blue dropper to place the drops gently and kindly with zero risk of injury by the user. If you want do want the best for your eyes, then be sure to buy something gross like Visine with its cold hard plastic applicator whereby you run the risk of eye injury during application.</li>
            <li> Love them using for years</li>
            <li> The price was very fair and the delivery was prompt. These drops feel very nice and soothing to my eyes. I love them. I would order this product from this company again and again. VERY HAPPY!!!</li>
            <li> Works great, few comfortable after and eyes are brighter indeed.&lt;br /&gt;Good product !</li>
            <li> that was due more to the description that the product itself. I was expecting (and wanted) a product more like the collyre bleu drops. These French blue don&#x27;t whiten your eyes at all but do feel really nice in the eye. It is an eye lotion not a whitener.&lt;br /&gt;So I do like the product but not as what I bought it for.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant about purchasing this product because of the mixed reviews.  I have sensitive, allergy eyes that are always red. Most eye drops burn my eyes, these beautiful blue drops did nothing except soothe!  I&#x27;m glad I decided to try them!&lt;br /&gt;Worth the money for me.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to duplicate the product Collyre Bleu bought (and made) in Quebec, but this doesn&#x27;t match up. It&#x27;s ok, but I feel it&#x27;s way overpriced (again, compared with the Quebec variety, which I can&#x27;t find outside that province).</li>
            <li> The product was recommended by a German magazine. My eyes are more sparkling and look fresher. No problem with my contactlense. If you use it for a longer time, eyes feel more comfortable, somehow relaxed.</li>
            <li> It does what it promises. The whites of my eyes are whiter after using this eye drop. Use a tissue to catch any drops that fall  because the blue liquid can stain your skin.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff. It works amazing.</li>
            <li> These eye drops work about as well as Visine. They soothe, but they do not whiten the whites. Also, they are messy and can stain. I would not recommend them.</li>
            <li> This product makes your eyes really blue especially in pictures</li>
            <li> Best blue eydrops around.  These are the eyedrops Kevyn Aucoin used to recommend.  I used to have to get them when I travelled to Paris but now I can order them online!</li>
