            <li>Good product though.</li>
            <li>spray on mousse is a good product to massage into your hair to add the look of fullness.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products for my fine hair and this is the best yet!</li>
            <li>I have liked the product results.</li>
            <li>Started off loving this product</li>
            <li>Delivery on time &amp; packaged appropriately.  </li>
            <li>but I am so glad my hairdresser recommended this product.</li>
            <li>, it is just okay.</li>
            <li>I like this beter than many others I have tried</li>
            <li>I think this product may work better as it is a system and not just the monoxodile treatment.</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>I get better results from hair vitamins.</li>
            <li>Taken in for over a year now and some of my hair is better.</li>
            <li>and I am very excited about it&#x27;s possibilities.  </li>

            <li>Easy to use.  </li>

            <li>and I have had several friends ask what I was doing because my hair is thicker and the luster is beautiful.</li>
            <li>I think it makes my fine colour treated hair brittle.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely say these are better than Nioxin products if you&#x27;ve tried that(even though they&#x27;re pretty good too).</li>
            <li>I recommend adding a light de-tangling rinse if you have baby fine hair</li>
            <li>I got this product for free from a salon to test for them, so I didn&#x27;t have to pay for this.</li>
            <li>But since I added the shampoo and conditioner, my hair has actually filled out.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t love it as much any more.</li>
            <li>My hair where it was thinning right in front on the top of my head</li>
            <li>Took nothing to rinse it out and at first I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was doing what it was supposed to do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard they have begun making a 3-product special purchase which includes shampoo, conditioner and this regrowth product for $65.00.</li>
            <li>I am really anxious to use this for a while and think it will be a great benefit.</li>
            <li>For being a 70 year old male with white hair this is GREAT!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smell is pretty manly, but I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li>I think that&#x27;s what it exactly is.</li>
            <li>I know this doesn&#x27;t sound possible, but I truly think my hair has improved in the first treatment!  </li>
            <li>I do not wash my hair more than 3 times per week but still use the conditioner daily and use my fingertips to really scrub it into my scalp and massage my scalp.  </li>
            <li>This is the first product I have tried that really works.</li>
            <li>I would certainly deal with Bellezza Beauty Supply again, and again, and again.</li>
            <li>I love the Dense FX thickener serum - this is my second bottle &amp; it makes my hair feel so much more substantial without it weighing down or making the strands look stringy / greasy.  </li>
            <li>I had given up on re-growing my real hair</li>
            <li>my hair is stronger and thicker and I have kept the hair that I had plus added so much.  </li>
            <li>However, the conditioner &amp;  thickener really dries out my hair.</li>
            <li>It really makes my hair feel fuller and thicker.</li>
            <li>THIS REALLY DOES THICKEN UP YOUR HAIR.  </li>
            <li>My hair does seem fuller and it held its styling overnight very well.  </li>
            <li>But that did not seem to make much of a difference.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve got a bunch of new growth!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using dust it volume powder for several years now, and now is the first time I stopped using it-</li>
            <li>But, the conditioner is more like the old Tame cream rinse!  </li>
            <li>off the bat you will loose more hair as it clears your scalp of dirt gunk and weakness, but that will grow back within two weeks and you should see results shortly after that.</li>
            <li>Thickens, vigorous action to promote growth.</li>
            <li>To early to know how it will do for my hair.</li>
            <li>Working well so far.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised on how quickly I received my purchase -- less than a week.  </li>
            <li>It is very pricy compared to rogain or other products</li>
            <li>and I have significant thinning hair in the front, which is disappointing, but if I style it right</li>
            <li>I used this religiously for 6 months, along with the 5% Cerafill minoxidil and my whole head has thickened up along with little baby hairs all over my head.  </li>

            <li> As far as the conditioner goes I can not post a review because it was missing in my kit when I received it with no compensation from the company after several email correspondences.</li>
            <li> The products not only makes your hair feel twice as thick, but gives so much volume too.</li>
            <li> The hairs are about 1 inch long now all along the hairline and throughout the to of my head.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have thinning hair, but I have very thin fine hair.</li>
            <li> I started getting a little itch on the back of my scalp and every day it got worse and spread up to the top and front of my scalp until i started getting little scabs.</li>
            <li> It has helped my hair grow back after it was falling out due to a medication was taking.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any other mousse products with it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I will not purchase this again unless the price goes down.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or weigh your hair down.  </li>
            <li> The product did weigh my hair down a bit.</li>
            <li> but when I tried rogain i only saw a very small improvement over 4 months.</li>
            <li> Like a previous poster, I also got 2 sores on my scalp after using it.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised when it came back very thin and with small bald spots.  </li>
            <li> meaning, it DOES NOT weigh your thin, fragile hair down!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 52, female, with thin hair all my life.</li>
            <li> I can finally wear my hair longer without it looking thin and scraggly.  </li>
            <li> but I will have to stop using it due to it causing serious scalp irritation.</li>
            <li> These products are unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> Just wish it were a little less expensive.</li>
            <li> Four years ago I had chemo and lost all my thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I was not sure if this shampoo was going to work, but it did!  </li>
            <li> I have used this set of products for over a year as suggested by my hairdresser for my thin hair.  </li>
            <li> expensive.....</li>
            <li> It felt coated and dirty.</li>
            <li> The spritz also seems to make my hair feel fuller without feeling dirty.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not too bad.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed the product made my hair so frizzy</li>

            <li> This actually works. I don&#x27;t have thinning hair, but I have very thin fine hair. The products not only makes your hair feel twice as thick, but gives so much volume too. I&#x27;ve been using dust it volume powder for several years now, and now is the first time I stopped using it- because it&#x27;s not necessary! It&#x27;s smell is pretty manly, but I don&#x27;t mind. I would absolutely say these are better than Nioxin products if you&#x27;ve tried that(even though they&#x27;re pretty good too).</li>
            <li> my wife uses these every week</li>
            <li> Does not work that well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the fx for two months 3 x per week and I&#x27;ve got a bunch of new growth! The hairs are about 1 inch long now all along the hairline and throughout the to of my head. No irritation and I have allergies and am prone to rashes. I&#x27;m so impressed I&#x27;m trying the shampoo and conditioner next. I&#x27;m 52, female, with thin hair all my life. Could not be happier. Hope it continues!!!</li>
            <li> It was good and on time.  Price can be negotiable but delivery took a couple days.  Good product though.</li>
            <li> I love the Dense FX thickener serum - this is my second bottle &amp; it makes my hair feel so much more substantial without it weighing down or making the strands look stringy / greasy.  I am hopeful for the effects of shampoo &amp; conditioner I am just now trying out.  Shampoo leaves hair feeling very clean. Conditioner has a different texture than I am use to - I recommend adding a light de-tangling rinse if you have baby fine hair like I do.  Delivery on time &amp; packaged appropriately.  I would order products from this company again.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything to help grow my hair back and this is a product that worked for me.  I used this religiously for 6 months, along with the 5% Cerafill minoxidil and my whole head has thickened up along with little baby hairs all over my head.  I had given up on re-growing my real hair but I am so glad my hairdresser recommended this product. I was hesitant to ever try minoxidil again after shedding my hair when I started Rogaine and when I stopped years ago. I had no shedding at all with this product. In fact, it is the opposite- my hair is stronger and thicker and I have kept the hair that I had plus added so much.  I am so grateful that I tried this product and that it worked!</li>
            <li> I have used these products...mainly just the shampoo and conditioner for months now almost a year.  My hair where it was thinning right in front on the top of my head has doubled in thickness.  I do not wash my hair more than 3 times per week but still use the conditioner daily and use my fingertips to really scrub it into my scalp and massage my scalp.  This is a must have product for thinning hair!</li>
            <li> Just started using the product, so time will tell.</li>
            <li> This product does what it says it does. Thickens, vigorous action to promote growth. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The price &amp; product were excellent. I have liked the product results. However, the conditioner &amp;  thickener really dries out my hair. So I have to compensate with a leave in conditioner &amp; not use every time.</li>
            <li> Started off loving this product and I don&#x27;t love it as much any more. I think it makes my fine colour treated hair brittle. I&#x27;ve gone back to regular sulfate-free shampoo and a root volumizer.</li>
            <li> I have used this set of products for over a year as suggested by my hairdresser for my thin hair.  Your scalp may tingle - I used to think this was doing something but this is no miracle product and will not change anything.&lt;br /&gt;The spray on mousse is a good product to massage into your hair to add the look of fullness.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the way the serum made my hair feel. It felt coated and dirty.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about 6 months now.  It really makes my hair feel fuller and thicker. It has helped my hair grow back after it was falling out due to a medication was taking. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> These products are unbelievable.  I can finally wear my hair longer without it looking thin and scraggly.  Easy to use.  Just wish it were a little less expensive.</li>
            <li> Just the best on the web!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am 21 and I have significant thinning hair in the front, which is disappointing, but if I style it right it&#x27;s not too bad. Thinking this kit could solve my problem, I purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, it is just okay. I do like the cooling sensation of the conditioner on my scalp, but none of these products thicken the hair significantly enough. It&#x27;s not worth the price. I will not purchase this again unless the price goes down.</li>
            <li> I like this beter than many others I have tried</li>
            <li> halfway through this product and it seems like it is working but I will have to stop using it due to it causing serious scalp irritation. off the bat you will loose more hair as it clears your scalp of dirt gunk and weakness, but that will grow back within two weeks and you should see results shortly after that. I started getting a little itch on the back of my scalp and every day it got worse and spread up to the top and front of my scalp until i started getting little scabs. I got this product for free from a salon to test for them, so I didn&#x27;t have to pay for this. It is very pricy compared to rogain or other products but when I tried rogain i only saw a very small improvement over 4 months. I think this product may work better as it is a system and not just the monoxodile treatment. but stop using it if you have signs of irritation.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised on how quickly I received my purchase -- less than a week.  Thank you.  I would certainly deal with Bellezza Beauty Supply again, and again, and again.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is OK; didn&#x27;t feel like it was anything special.  But, the conditioner is more like the old Tame cream rinse!  It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or weigh your hair down.  Took nothing to rinse it out and at first I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was doing what it was supposed to do. Believe me, it does work.......meaning, it DOES NOT weigh your thin, fragile hair down!  The spritz also seems to make my hair feel fuller without feeling dirty.  I don&#x27;t use any other mousse products with it.  My beautician has ordered me the Redken hair regrowth product so maybe I&#x27;ll come back and edit this review to let you know if it&#x27;s working.  I&#x27;ve heard they have begun making a 3-product special purchase which includes shampoo, conditioner and this regrowth product for $65.00.</li>
            <li> Definitely thicker hair.  Love the product.</li>
            <li> I bought this about 2 months ago. The shampoo does not have a pleasant odor. The Dense Fx feels like water &amp; guess what? That&#x27;s the 1st ingredient. I think that&#x27;s what it exactly is. As far as the conditioner goes I can not post a review because it was missing in my kit when I received it with no compensation from the company after several email correspondences. Like a previous poster, I also got 2 sores on my scalp after using it. One on each side of my crown.I get better results from hair vitamins.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products for my fine hair and this is the best yet! I am in my 60&#x27;s and my hair is thinning. Using these products together has made my hair feel like it did 20 years ago. Have recommended it to several friends.</li>
            <li> expensive.....but it does seem to make my hair fuller....but I do not think it is changing the structure of the hair.</li>
            <li> THIS REALLY DOES THICKEN UP YOUR HAIR.  AWESOME PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I recently bought this from my hairdresser.  I have only used it one time and I am very excited about it&#x27;s possibilities.  I know this doesn&#x27;t sound possible, but I truly think my hair has improved in the first treatment!  My hair does seem fuller and it held its styling overnight very well.  I am really anxious to use this for a while and think it will be a great benefit.</li>
            <li> Well, it works ! I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results! Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Taken in for over a year now and some of my hair is better.</li>
            <li> I have been using Cerafill since October 2014 and I have had several friends ask what I was doing because my hair is thicker and the luster is beautiful. For being a 70 year old male with white hair this is GREAT!</li>
            <li> I was not sure if this shampoo was going to work, but it did!  Even my hairdresser noticed the difference.  For over a year I have been using minoxiydil . But that did not seem to make much of a difference.  But since I added the shampoo and conditioner, my hair has actually filled out.  Four years ago I had chemo and lost all my thick hair.  I was really surprised when it came back very thin and with small bald spots.  One of the drugs I am on does cause hair loss.This is the first product I have tried that really works.</li>
            <li> Just received.  To early to know how it will do for my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is growing back. I didn&#x27;t buy the rogaine type stuff, just the shampoo and conditioner and also use the spray gel stuff. I&#x27;m attributing the hair growth to this product. I&#x27;ve on the second box now.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product.  I did notice improvement in the thickness of my hair.  The product did weigh my hair down a bit.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed the product made my hair so frizzy</li>
            <li> Working well so far.  No shedding..</li>
