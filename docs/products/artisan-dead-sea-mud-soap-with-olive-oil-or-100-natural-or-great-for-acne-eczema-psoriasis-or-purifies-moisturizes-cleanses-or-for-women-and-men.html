            <li>The ingredients are great very easy to understand no odd words that I didn&#x27;t recognize, as indicated on my photos.</li>
            <li>This great mud soap, it is hydrating to your skin and leaves your skin silky soft.</li>
            <li>It has a mild, yet fresh, clean scent, and lathers up nicely!</li>
            <li>The fragrance is fine though, not overpowering.</li>
            <li>typically a body wash user, I had the opportunity to try this product and came away impressed.  </li>
            <li>Shipped the same day good packaging lathers nicely rinses clean no complaints here</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a large 5.3 ounce bar that fits nicely in the palm of my hand when I opened the box</li>
            <li>I received this product for free in exchange for an honest&lt;br /&gt;and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant, subtle fragrance, a good lather, and does leave my skin feeling more &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; and moisturized than what I get from a body wash.  </li>
            <li>Like our first one this has been really great for both of us - although we feel archaeic using an actual bar (hello, 1990 :)</li>
            <li>It does have a bit of residue from the mud while washing, but that rinses clean.  </li>
            <li>I would buy it in bulk if there was a special price.</li>
            <li>Artesian Dead Sea mud soap from Vida man</li>
            <li>Thanks :)</li>
            <li>It gets daunting at times, as your face is the very first thing people see.</li>
            <li>It smells fresh and clean, lathers up nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave our skin feeling dry.</li>
            <li>it is WELL worth the benefits these product bring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>unless you have it right up to your nose you may not even notice it.</li>
            <li>I really like this!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to buy another bar for mom ;)</li>
            <li>At first, I purchased this soap for myself.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been battling eczema in my house and this really has improved my son&#x27;s skin!</li>
            <li>Ive tried so many different products from over  the counter to many different prescriptions from Dermatologists and nothing has come this close to clearing up my dermatitis/psoriasis/adult acne.</li>
            <li>This mud sea soap covers a great amount of skin issues, such as acne, psoriasis and eczema, also it helps repair the skin from scars,wrinkles and dark spots.</li>
            <li>Something about using black soap is very cool too!</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of oils and essential oil smells</li>
            <li>and I really like the way it feels.</li>
            <li>But when I opened it up and smelled it, it wasn’t very feminine</li>
            <li>Very gender neutral, too.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t irritate my eczema-prone sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t dry it out either like most soaps.  </li>
            <li>you might expect, It has a different and interesting scent - not overpowering or bad, just kind of interesting and new if you&#x27;ve never used non scented / natural products before.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this soap to men.</li>
            <li>Only thing to improve would be if an unscented version was available since I don&#x27;t generally like scents in my soap.  </li>
            <li>Once we finished the sample soap, I immediately purchased a new bar.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell or feel artificial in any way, and the black color is a great unique feature.</li>
            <li>My face continues to stay clear</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not meant to - this is a natural product that has all kinds of benefits,</li>
            <li>As I suffer from dermatitis/psoriasis and adult acne.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s not drying at all, which bar soap can sometimes be on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Overall a product I will continue to use and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I have dry spots on different areas of my body and they have literally been disappearing right before my eyes.</li>
            <li>I am not sure about the claim about helping some of the other issues (excema etc) as I don&#x27;t have those, but I would imagine it can only improve / lessen any kind of skin issue along these</li>
            <li>main issue I had was dry skin, and DH had some bumps from dirt and sweat at work.</li>
            <li>Extremely thick and smooth texture makes using this soap a pleasure.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m excited to be using a product that will not have a negative impact on the environment</li>
            <li>Works just like mud right from the Dead Sea!</li>
            <li>Does leave the skin dry like other soaps, good enough to replace expensive facial/body wash products.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Priced well, especially if it lasts as long as it seems to be lasting.</li>
            <li> My wife and I aren&#x27;t typically bar soap users, but we received a sample of this one and were pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> Even though I use sunscreen and daily moisturizers, the sun and salt air keep my skin really dry and sometimes flaky.</li>
            <li> If it is constantly getting wet from the shower water, it will not last long.  </li>
            <li> As a fashion stylist and the owner of a high fashion Boutique, it can make me feel a little uncomfortable and less confident when working with clients.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to run out of this soap, as long as it is doing its job for my dermatitis/psoriasis/adult acne I will be purchasing a monthly supply in the coming days and every month there after.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of dry skin form going to the beach and being exposed to the sun.</li>
            <li> One tip I can offer, as other reviewers have stated, store the bar in a dry soap dish in between uses.</li>
            <li> This is the second dead set mud soap we have tried this year.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually started using it in place of my previous face wash, and haven&#x27;t had any blemishes since!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m anxious to watch the dark spots and scars to vanish form years of fighting acne and dry skin.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ll be discontinuing use of previous face wash products that contain plastic micro-scrubbers).    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many products that were terrible / unbearable and this is definitely not like that -</li>
            <li> After a few weeks we both noticed some improvement - less dryness for myself and some clearing up for him.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews.  </li>
            <li> what I mean is I almost smell manly</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is the Best soap I have ever used. I would buy it in bulk if there was a special price. I plan to keep this soap in stock at all times.</li>
            <li> Wonderful soap! Doesn&#x27;t irritate my eczema-prone sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t dry it out either like most soaps.  It does have a bit of residue from the mud while washing, but that rinses clean.  Would repurchase:)  Only thing to improve would be if an unscented version was available since I don&#x27;t generally like scents in my soap.  The fragrance is fine though, not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Extremely thick and smooth texture makes using this soap a pleasure. Does leave the skin dry like other soaps, good enough to replace expensive facial/body wash products. Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> Just received this soap in the mail and started using it last week, it&#x27;s great!  Doesn&#x27;t smell or feel artificial in any way, and the black color is a great unique feature.</li>
            <li> My wife and I aren&#x27;t typically bar soap users, but we received a sample of this one and were pleasantly surprised! It smells fresh and clean, lathers up nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave our skin feeling dry. I&#x27;ve actually started using it in place of my previous face wash, and haven&#x27;t had any blemishes since! Once we are done with this bar, we will be buying more.   Update - 2/27/16:  Once we finished the sample soap, I immediately purchased a new bar.  My face continues to stay clear and I&#x27;m excited to be using a product that will not have a negative impact on the environment (I&#x27;ll be discontinuing use of previous face wash products that contain plastic micro-scrubbers).    One tip I can offer, as other reviewers have stated, store the bar in a dry soap dish in between uses. If it is constantly getting wet from the shower water, it will not last long.  I just use the bar on my face daily and have managed to get about 2-3 months of life out of it.</li>
            <li> Artesian Dead Sea mud soap from Vida man I really like this! It&#x27;s a large 5.3 ounce bar that fits nicely in the palm of my hand when I opened the box it smelled very nice and felt extremely smooth and wonderful. When I see it smelled nice what I mean is I almost smell manly I didn&#x27;t mind that of course because I like men. The ingredients are great very easy to understand no odd words that I didn&#x27;t recognize, as indicated on my photos. I am a huge fan of oils and essential oil smells and I&#x27;m very impressed at this product being 100% natural. I received the product at a discounted rate for my unbiased an honest review and I really like the way it feels. I used it on my face and body and I love the way it made my skin feel moisturized and renewed. I wish I hadn&#x27;t used it so I could have given it as a gift to my mom as I think that she would really love it! That being said, I&#x27;m glad I get to keep it for myself. I&#x27;ll have to buy another bar for mom ;)</li>
            <li> This is a great men’s soap! At first, I purchased this soap for myself. But when I opened it up and smelled it, it wasn’t very feminine but it smells amazing for a man. I immediately had my husband try it out and he loved it. He also loves the smell and compliments on how moisturized his skin feels after using it. The soap lathers up very nicely and is easy to hold unto while in the shower. My husband now uses this soap all the time and we are re-ordering soon because he’s out. I would highly recommend this soap to men. He will love and you will love it too because he will smell fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free or at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Who ever thought that one day you would be using soap with mud IN it?&lt;br /&gt;While typically a body wash user, I had the opportunity to try this product and came away impressed.  It has a pleasant, subtle fragrance, a good lather, and does leave my skin feeling more &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; and moisturized than what I get from a body wash.  Will definitely be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I LOVED this soap. Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> This is the second dead set mud soap we have tried this year. Like our first one this has been really great for both of us - although we feel archaeic using an actual bar (hello, 1990 :) it is WELL worth the benefits these product bring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you might expect, It has a different and interesting scent - not overpowering or bad, just kind of interesting and new if you&#x27;ve never used non scented / natural products before. It&#x27;s not going to be like your lavender, mango, vanilla soaps and it&#x27;s not meant to - this is a natural product that has all kinds of benefits, and with that comes the &amp;#34;interesting&amp;#34; scent. I&#x27;ve used many products that were terrible / unbearable and this is definitely not like that - unless you have it right up to your nose you may not even notice it. We have used it daily and have not had it crack or break and it seems to be taking a long time to get smaller, if that&#x27;s even possible, lol!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main issue I had was dry skin, and DH had some bumps from dirt and sweat at work. After a few weeks we both noticed some improvement - less dryness for myself and some clearing up for him. For light issues like these this kind of soap is perfect I think. I am not sure about the claim about helping some of the other issues (excema etc) as I don&#x27;t have those, but I would imagine it can only improve / lessen any kind of skin issue along these lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Priced well, especially if it lasts as long as it seems to be lasting. Something about using black soap is very cool too! Now if they only made it in a liquid soap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note: Product received at no cost for testing purposes. All my reviews are 100% honest and unbiased. Thanks :)</li>
            <li> This soap has a rich lather, keeps my skin moist, prevents it from breaking out, and has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Amazing soap! We&#x27;ve been battling eczema in my house and this really has improved my son&#x27;s skin!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS SOAP!!! As I suffer from dermatitis/psoriasis and adult acne. Ive tried so many different products from over  the counter to many different prescriptions from Dermatologists and nothing has come this close to clearing up my dermatitis/psoriasis/adult acne. It gets daunting at times, as your face is the very first thing people see. As a fashion stylist and the owner of a high fashion Boutique, it can make me feel a little uncomfortable and less confident when working with clients. This soap is THE BEST I&#x27;ve came across in years. My face had cleared up dramatically in a matter of 3 DAYS!!! I don&#x27;t want to run out of this soap, as long as it is doing its job for my dermatitis/psoriasis/adult acne I will be purchasing a monthly supply in the coming days and every month there after.  I TRULY RECOMMEND THIS SOAP!!!</li>
            <li> This great mud soap, it is hydrating to your skin and leaves your skin silky soft. I have a lot of dry skin form going to the beach and being exposed to the sun. Even though I use sunscreen and daily moisturizers, the sun and salt air keep my skin really dry and sometimes flaky. After using this Artisan Dead Sea Mud Soap, by Olive Oil, I can really feel and see a difference. It has a mild, yet fresh, clean scent, and lathers up nicely! This mud sea soap covers a great amount of skin issues, such as acne, psoriasis and eczema, also it helps repair the skin from scars,wrinkles and dark spots. I&#x27;m anxious to watch the dark spots and scars to vanish form years of fighting acne and dry skin. Whether you have any of these issues with your skin or not, I would recommend this for a refreshing feel to the skin. I received this product for free in exchange for an honest&lt;br /&gt;and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Great product, soften skin even after the first use. Works just like mud right from the Dead Sea!</li>
            <li> Smells great, makes my skin feel great. Overall a product I will continue to use and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews.  This is the best and always seems fresh.  Company service is great too.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it! I have dry spots on different areas of my body and they have literally been disappearing right before my eyes. This is a great purchase!</li>
            <li> Love the smell! Very gender neutral, too. And it&#x27;s not drying at all, which bar soap can sometimes be on sensitive skin. I liked it!</li>
            <li> Shipped the same day good packaging lathers nicely rinses clean no complaints here</li>
            <li> hubby loves i on his skin</li>
