            <li>Love it, feels really nice on the skin.</li>
            <li>This is really great oil, I used it on my hair to help with dryness and its helped so much!</li>
            <li>But the vendor should know better to wrap the items to make sure they don&#x27;t leak.  </li>
            <li>and I love this product for my hair.</li>
            <li>My father-in-law gifted us with a bottle of this Life-Flo Macadamia Oil.  </li>
            <li>I had read that macadamia nut oil is much better for you than olive oil.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so healthy for your hair, given it the moisture your hair look for in shampoo,conditioner and hair moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Promote healthy living.&lt;br</li>
            <li>More like peanut.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference in her skin, it looked more pump and smoother.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it all the time because it does take a while to absorb into your skin (5-10 min), more time than my argon oil I have</li>
            <li>so I mostly use it at night</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS</li>
            <li>Love the way it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>will update my review if I am able to contact Amazon and my issue gets resolved.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s doing so much better for my body, than a cream.</li>
            <li>Love the price and the product, and I will order again.</li>
            <li>I love the flavor of this oil</li>
            <li>Im glad I bought it and will purchase again.</li>
            <li>so it is better for you.</li>
            <li>AMAZON was great they fixed everything.  </li>
            <li>For cooking there are better oils available.</li>
            <li>After trying two other macadamia products for beauty regimen , this is the best I have found.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a strong toasted nut smell but mixes well with coconut oil</li>
            <li>I love coconut oil for skin, so I wasn&#x27;t all that surprised that I loved Macadamia Oil.  </li>
            <li>I have to say it seems to do a very nice job of keeping her skin soft and free of wrinkles.</li>
            <li>My skin has never been so soft and nice feeling and looking!</li>
            <li>This absorbs quickly, smells wonderful, and has eliminated the dry skin on my legs and my chapped hands.  </li>
            <li>After it was fine.</li>
            <li>I put some in a little dropper bottle to keep at work to use as a moisturizer, and people always comment on the delicious smell whenever I put it on.  </li>
            <li>Huge bottle</li>
            <li>Clean Boutique, shipped this product very quickly.</li>
            <li>but it makes my skim plump  and feel comfortable.</li>
            <li>I always feel good using natural products when they are going to come into contact with my skin.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smoke at higher heat and maintains its healthy property&#x27;s after heated - unlike olive</li>
            <li>May be OK to drink, but who&#x27;s going to try it first?</li>
            <li>I originally bought this product to use in cooking.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li>but I bought it because in my reading I found that Olive oil is wonderful except if you are going to heat it up since it loses its benefits at that time.</li>
            <li>Thicker than expected but very nice oil.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s scent reminds me of birdseed in a way, but it&#x27;s nothing that doesn&#x27;t fade quickly.</li>
            <li>What was surprising was that after just a short time, the oil was absorbed and did not leave a greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Macadamia oil is the most stable at high temperatures</li>
            <li>When I first got this, I made the huge mistake of massaging a couple squirts of the oil into my hair (which is what I did when I was using Organix macadamia oil).  </li>
            <li>product seems to be pretty good for topical macadamia nut oil..</li>
            <li>It works fine for skin and hair, adsorbs fast and smooths skin and hair.</li>
            <li>Also, as a side note, I have very long and fine hair, so results may vary for different hair types, but I&#x27;ve been very pleased with how this oil has worked for my hair :)</li>
            <li>I love using natural oils on my hair.</li>
            <li>Not great for eating though, because it&#x27;s not the best quality Macadamia oil.</li>
            <li>/&gt;seed oil, was and remains a success.</li>
            <li>and it gets absorbed to skin pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>but the odor goes away very fast.</li>
            <li>Very good natural product for such a low price.</li>
            <li>I am using this oil for oil cleansing method and for hot oil massage of hair.</li>
            <li>I will definitely order some more once i run out of it.</li>
            <li>The bottle was sealed and exactly what it was advertised as, on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The macadamia oil made my hair so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The first delivery had to be denied, the box it was delivered in was saturated with oil.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how oily and gross my hair looked and I wasn&#x27;t sure if this product was going to work for me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it most definitely is rancid enough to be unusable (color seems ok but</li>
            <li>My hair really loves this oil.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>everything and more than what I expected</li>
            <li>After trying Argan Oil on my face, I got so much hooked-up on the staff what started to use on my body also.</li>
            <li>I really lovecooking with this oil.</li>
            <li>Such a mild flavor that was overpowered by strong Asian flavors.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this with high hopes based on reviews and online research.</li>
            <li>It is very concentrated and leaves my hair feeling really soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I also use this oil to massage my scalp, my scalp has been dry and flaky lately and this has been a great remedy for it.</li>
            <li>I use several oils for cooking and salads and even for many side dishes; a few added spices in a small amount of this oil in a salad cruet or olive oil bottle with a few spices makes a very flavorful and healthy dressing for many salads and foods.</li>
            <li>And, though at first it has a nutty scent, that too disappears in a short time.</li>
            <li>Ever since i have started using oils regularly my skin has become normal and does not require much moisturizing.</li>
            <li>makes my skin feel really soft and nourished.</li>
            <li>I have forgotten about more than my share of almost empty containers of various nuts and this oil smells just like what I smell when I open one of those found jars.</li>
            <li>We like it very much for dry skin care.</li>
            <li>The scent is a little nutty but goes away quickly.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this for people who have dry or mature skin.</li>
            <li>I have also used it as a leave in hair treatment and it has left my hair so so soft.</li>
            <li>I might experiment with a small amount mixed with some sweet orange essential oil</li>
            <li>The quality of the product was fine until I researched and found out that this oil should be stored in a dark colored bottle not a clear one which pretty much renders its value useless as an essential oil.  </li>
            <li>The only problem is that I used a little too much my first time so my hair looked oily.</li>

            <li> I also use this oil to massage my scalp, my scalp has been dry and flaky lately and this has been a great remedy for it.</li>
            <li> I use several oils for cooking and salads and even for many side dishes; a few added spices in a small amount of this oil in a salad cruet or olive oil bottle with a few spices makes a very flavorful and healthy dressing for many salads and foods.</li>
            <li> And, though at first it has a nutty scent, that too disappears in a short time.</li>
            <li> Ever since i have started using oils regularly my skin has become normal and does not require much moisturizing.</li>
            <li> makes my skin feel really soft and nourished.</li>
            <li> I have forgotten about more than my share of almost empty containers of various nuts and this oil smells just like what I smell when I open one of those found jars.</li>
            <li> We like it very much for dry skin care.</li>
            <li> The scent is a little nutty but goes away quickly.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this for people who have dry or mature skin.</li>
            <li> I have also used it as a leave in hair treatment and it has left my hair so so soft.</li>
            <li> I might experiment with a small amount mixed with some sweet orange essential oil</li>
            <li> The quality of the product was fine until I researched and found out that this oil should be stored in a dark colored bottle not a clear one which pretty much renders its value useless as an essential oil.  </li>
            <li> The only problem is that I used a little too much my first time so my hair looked oily.</li>
            <li> I rather use natural oils than use chemicals and other items I can&#x27;t pronounce.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend if your hair responds well to heavy oils.</li>
            <li> A bottle of this will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I always put oil on my skin after showering but by the end of the day my skin is dry.</li>
            <li> It also works wonderfully on my dry skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is so dry that often with lotions, I must apply both morning and evening to keep my skin from feeling dry.</li>
            <li> Just this small amount has made my hair so soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> After that, I use the residual oil left on my palms and fingers to run through the bottom half of my towel-dried hair.</li>
            <li> I had very dry skin and prefer using oils as moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Helps nourish and moisturize my very dry skin.</li>
            <li> A little oil goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Also use this on my hair as it is non-greasy and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way when doing this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased other macadamia products to try on my hair and have reached the conclusion that it just isn&#x27;t for my hair.  </li>
            <li> I was using all kinds of other oil before I used it.</li>
            <li> Was leaking upon shipment, prbly due to heat.</li>
            <li> But the oils so thick that it only leaked 10% of product</li>
            <li> It does have a slight nutty scent.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what is wrong with my particular bottle</li>
            <li> It is an oil, so it takes a few minutes to soak into your skin.</li>
            <li> once I get out of the shower, I put a few squirts onto my palms and then massage the oil into my arms and hands.  </li>
            <li> but I do not want to waste my orange oil if it doesn&#x27;t work, so I am undecided.</li>
            <li> Not a strong flavor.</li>
            <li> I think, every women should if not switch to it, at least tried once.  </li>
            <li> For me it felt too viscous (thick).</li>
            <li> They fixed the problem, it was just annoying to have to deal with the tracking and reporting.  </li>
            <li> Not happy customer..</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed because living overseas with an APO address makes ordering and waiting for my items a lengthy process, much less</li>
            <li> Came broken and leaking!</li>
            <li> Needless to say I started to use it as well.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> makes my skin feel really soft and nourished. i use it for my hair dresses. the shipping was EXCELLENT. packaged and sealed perfectly to prevent leaking. a must try!!</li>
            <li> Thicker than expected but very nice oil.</li>
            <li> Really good, I&#x27;ve used it for bath oil. It&#x27;s got a strong toasted nut smell but mixes well with coconut oil</li>
            <li> This oil has nutty aroma and comes in a plastic bottle. I found the oil to be on lighter side and it gets absorbed to skin pretty quickly. I personally find extra virgin olive oil heavier for me and compared to olive oil this is a lighter oil.  The nutty aroma goes away after a while. I had very dry skin and prefer using oils as moisturizer. Ever since i have started using oils regularly my skin has become normal and does not require much moisturizing. However I regularly use oils to take care of my face, body and hair. It been about 2 years I have not used cosmetic moisturizers. So I keep trying with different oils. I am using this oil for oil cleansing method and for hot oil massage of hair. This is really great oil and leaves my skin clean, moisturized with healthy glow, without leaving any greasy residue. My hair really loves this oil. I will definitely order some more once i run out of it.</li>
            <li> Love it, feels really nice on the skin.</li>
            <li> Very Good product would purchase again.</li>
            <li> The quality of the product was fine until I researched and found out that this oil should be stored in a dark colored bottle not a clear one which pretty much renders its value useless as an essential oil.  Not happy customer..</li>
            <li> Clean Boutique, shipped this product very quickly. I received this Macadamia oil in 2 days.  The bottle was sealed and exactly what it was advertised as, on Amazon. This oil is great! It does have a slight nutty scent. I like the scent. I plan on making my own lotion with this and Shea butter. A little oil goes a long way. It is an oil, so it takes a few minutes to soak into your skin.</li>
            <li> Great carrier oil. Has a very pleasant nutty aroma. Helps nourish and moisturize my very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I am using this for removal of the makeup at the end of the day. I really like it.</li>
            <li> The macadamia oil made my hair so soft and smooth. It also improved the manageability of my hair as  well. The only problem is that I used a little too much my first time so my hair looked oily.</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil for everything. I use it as a makeup remover, face and body moisturizer, and for the tips of my hair. I also use this oil to massage my scalp, my scalp has been dry and flaky lately and this has been a great remedy for it.</li>
            <li> Came broken and leaking! But the oils so thick that it only leaked 10% of product so I still have a lot to use :) good product though</li>
            <li> I always put oil on my skin after showering but by the end of the day my skin is dry. Not with the Macadamia oil. My skin has never been so soft and nice feeling and looking! It really works. I also tan twice a week and my tan looks great.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle. Use this as a body oil lotion (mix it with body lotion) and it works wonderfully on my skin. Also use this on my hair as it is non-greasy and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> everything and more than what I expected</li>
            <li> After trying two other macadamia products for beauty regimen , this is the best I have found. It&#x27;s scent reminds me of birdseed in a way, but it&#x27;s nothing that doesn&#x27;t fade quickly. I&#x27;ve used it as a moisturizer for both body and face , and it has not left me with blemishes. My skin feels supple and revived. I have also used it as a leave in hair treatment and it has left my hair so so soft. A little goes a long way when doing this. The best part it has no added harmful preservatives or chemicals!!</li>
            <li> This is really great oil, I used it on my hair to help with dryness and its helped so much!</li>
            <li> This oil is great and it smells heavenly!  I put some in a little dropper bottle to keep at work to use as a moisturizer, and people always comment on the delicious smell whenever I put it on.  I love using it in the bath!</li>
            <li> Nice oil which is organic and food grade.</li>
            <li> The first delivery had to be denied, the box it was delivered in was saturated with oil.  The packing was horrible.  They fixed the problem, it was just annoying to have to deal with the tracking and reporting.  AMAZON was great they fixed everything.  But the vendor should know better to wrap the items to make sure they don&#x27;t leak.  The product quality was great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American and I love this product for my hair. Highly recommend if your hair responds well to heavy oils.</li>
            <li> Excellent  product. It is very concentrated and leaves my hair feeling really soft and silky. It also works wonderfully on my dry skin.</li>
            <li> My father-in-law gifted us with a bottle of this Life-Flo Macadamia Oil.  I love coconut oil for skin, so I wasn&#x27;t all that surprised that I loved Macadamia Oil.  What was surprising was that after just a short time, the oil was absorbed and did not leave a greasy feeling.  And, though at first it has a nutty scent, that too disappears in a short time. I do not like perfumes, nor do I like to buy scented lotions, so the fact that the nutty scent disappeared after a time, was pleasing to me. My skin is so dry that often with lotions, I must apply both morning and evening to keep my skin from feeling dry. The Macadamia Oil stays with me all day, into the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this for people who have dry or mature skin.</li>
            <li> I always feel good using natural products when they are going to come into contact with my skin. This is very nice. I don&#x27;t have to use a lot to get the smoothness and moisturization that my skin needs. I use it on my face, arms, legs--wherever ~ it is great. If you don&#x27;t mind the smell of Macadamia nuts then you&#x27;re good to go!!!!!</li>
            <li> This worked great for cooking.  I used it to make stir fry to replace peanut oil.  It had no discernible change to the flavor.  Such a mild flavor that was overpowered by strong Asian flavors.  Which is what I wanted it to do.  Next I will try and make mayonnaise out of it.</li>
            <li> I had read that macadamia nut oil is much better for you than olive oil. The 1st time I fried an egg in olive oil - - - yuck. Save it for salads.&lt;br /&gt;This macadamia nut oil makes foods taste VERY GOOD! It doesn&#x27;t smoke at higher heat and maintains its healthy property&#x27;s after heated - unlike olive oil.&lt;br /&gt;The container is also especially easy to use. I&#x27;m getting more!</li>
            <li> You only need to smallest amount for this stuff to work wonders.  When I first got this, I made the huge mistake of massaging a couple squirts of the oil into my hair (which is what I did when I was using Organix macadamia oil).  I couldn&#x27;t believe how oily and gross my hair looked and I wasn&#x27;t sure if this product was going to work for me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I changed up my routine a bit and now, once I get out of the shower, I put a few squirts onto my palms and then massage the oil into my arms and hands.  After that, I use the residual oil left on my palms and fingers to run through the bottom half of my towel-dried hair. Just this small amount has made my hair so soft and shiny.  Also, as a side note, I have very long and fine hair, so results may vary for different hair types, but I&#x27;ve been very pleased with how this oil has worked for my hair :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so healthy for your hair, given it the moisture your hair look for in shampoo,conditioner and hair moisturizer. And that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m giving. Promote healthy living.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes I recommend</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering this. I love using natural oils on my hair. Makes my skin nice and soft. I rather use natural oils than use chemicals and other items I can&#x27;t pronounce.</li>
            <li> It works fine for skin and hair, adsorbs fast and smooths skin and hair. The oil smells like nut but the odor goes away very fast. Very good natural product for such a low price. The bottle was sealed, nothing spilled during shipping.</li>
            <li> I use several oils for cooking and salads and even for many side dishes; a few added spices in a small amount of this oil in a salad cruet or olive oil bottle with a few spices makes a very flavorful and healthy dressing for many salads and foods.</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing.  Use it on my face, legs, arms.  I have rosacea on my face and this is the only thing that helps.  Absorbs quickly. The scent is a little nutty but goes away quickly.  I will buy this again and again.</li>
            <li> I manufacture Liquid Castile Soap using Organic Macadamia Nut Oil and I can say that this is a quality oil. I&#x27;ve tried others that are just way too refined. This has a nice color and nutty smell.</li>
            <li> bought it for use with the South Hampton Diet. Hope it does what the diet says it does.</li>
            <li> I tried this on my hair but didn&#x27;t like the smell of the product.  I now have it in my kitchen cupboard to use when cooking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased other macadamia products to try on my hair and have reached the conclusion that it just isn&#x27;t for my hair.  Seems to make it oily and it doesn&#x27;t seem to soak in!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like Macadamia oil to me. More like peanut. But good absorption (like macadamia).</li>
            <li> I got this cause I was on this oil kick there for a min. I was using all kinds of other oil before I used it. I have given a sample to my mom who started using it (my mom is 73). She used it as a face moisturizer in the morning and that at night. I noticed a difference in her skin, it looked more pump and smoother. I asked what she was using not remembering I have given her a sample in a plastic travel bottle I had. She was like that oil you gave me a while back! Needless to say I started to use it as well. I don&#x27;t use it all the time because it does take a while to absorb into your skin (5-10 min), more time than my argon oil I have so I mostly use it at night but it makes my skim plump  and feel comfortable. It doesn&#x27;t break me out or anything so I like it. Huge bottle so I will last a while even with me giving out samples. FYI does have a nutty smell to it that might take time to get used to.</li>
            <li> Purchased this Organic Oil to consume, but found it was produced for Topical application. May be OK to drink, but who&#x27;s going to try it first?</li>
            <li> everyone yhis for your skin and not for cooking or consumption</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS I AM USING AS PART OF MY HAIR CARE REGIME</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product. I have to say it seems to do a very nice job of keeping her skin soft and free of wrinkles. A bottle of this will last a long time. It&#x27;s also very good on sunburn.</li>
            <li> Pricey but I bought it because in my reading I found that Olive oil is wonderful except if you are going to heat it up since it loses its benefits at that time. Macadamia Oil was recommended for cooking. Not a strong flavor.</li>
            <li> I use it on my skin and it&#x27;s the best oil for that, much better than coconut oil. Not great for eating though, because it&#x27;s not the best quality Macadamia oil.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find on local market.  Love the way it makes my skin feel.  I not only use it on my face but occasionally I mix it with my shampoo for conditioning my hair.  Also use as an all over body oil.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It goes on smooth and leaves my skin feeling wonderful.</li>
            <li> I ordered this with high hopes based on reviews and online research. I am not sure what is wrong with my particular bottle but it most definitely is rancid enough to be unusable (color seems ok but stench is overpowering). The expiration date isn&#x27;t until 2015 but ugh, the smell! I have forgotten about more than my share of almost empty containers of various nuts and this oil smells just like what I smell when I open one of those found jars. There is no way I am rubbing this all over my body in its present condition. I might experiment with a small amount mixed with some sweet orange essential oil but I do not want to waste my orange oil if it doesn&#x27;t work, so I am undecided. I am so disappointed because living overseas with an APO address makes ordering and waiting for my items a lengthy process, much less returning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update my review if I am able to contact Amazon and my issue gets resolved.</li>
            <li> After trying Argan Oil on my face, I got so much hooked-up on the staff what started to use on my body also. I think it&#x27;s doing so much better for my body, than a cream. I think, every women should if not switch to it, at least tried once.  You have nothing to gain but your beautiful skin!!  Just tried.</li>
            <li> This absorbs quickly, smells wonderful, and has eliminated the dry skin on my legs and my chapped hands.  Love the price and the product, and I will order again.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it was cooking oil.  After reading that it is food grade, that&#x27;s what I used it for and it was great!!  Nice nutty flavor in salad dressings, nice complement to sauteed foods.  Love the squeeze bottle/flip top!</li>
            <li> I love the flavor of this oil and you just know its good for you! Im glad I bought it and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great nutty smell, great that it&#x27;s food grade, and great in not being too oily.  Used it in cooking, massage and skin moisturizer.  Maybe I should have used GREAT in my title.</li>
            <li> Having read that macadamia oil is also used to moisturize hair, I tried it. For me it felt too viscous (thick). A thinner oil&lt;br /&gt;spreading through my hair was /is my preference. I had prepared for this possibility. My second &amp;#34;test case&amp;#34;, grape&lt;br /&gt;seed oil, was and remains a success. Amazon is the place to find &amp;#34;Nature Certified Premium Organic Grapeseed Oil&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Both oils can also be used for some good and healthy cooking.</li>
            <li> I really lovecooking with this oil. It is especially good with meats and roasted zucchini. Macadamia oil is the most stable at high temperatures so it is better for you. This is my second bottle and I will continue to buy this brand.</li>
            <li> product seems to be pretty good for topical macadamia nut oil..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pretty disappointed this wasn&#x27;t for consumption</li>
            <li> Like the oil for soothing and healing skin, however it smells like cooking oil. It&#x27;s a good size bottle. Was leaking upon shipment, prbly due to heat. After it was fine.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product to use in cooking. I would not recommend it for cooking but it is ideal for skin care. For cooking there are better oils available. We like it very much for dry skin care.</li>
            <li> Very good oil, it softs my skin like a baby</li>
            <li> Good quality, it miss a bit of flavour.</li>
